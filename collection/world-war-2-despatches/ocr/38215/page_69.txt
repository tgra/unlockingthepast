Section XLVIII.—Tue DEFENcE Pian.

463. As a result of the loss of the 22 Indian .

Infantry Brigade, (see Section XXXIX), the 9
Indian Division, which had never had more than
two infantry brigades, now had only one weak
infantry brigade, Its Commander also had been
lost. In these circumstances it was decided that
the tr Indian Division should absorb what re-
mained of the 9 Indian Division. In conse-
quence it became necessary to include the 18
British Division in the 3 Indian Corps at once
instead of at a later date as had been intended.

464. The Intention was to hold the Singapore
Fortress area,

465. The essence of the defence was that the
enemy must be prevented from landing or, if he
Succeeded in landing, that he must be stopped
near the beaches and destroyed or driven out by
counter-attack.

For this purpose the defences were organized
into three areas (Northern, Southern and
Western) and the Anti-Airctaft Defences. The
boundaries of areas and the garrisons allotted to
them were as under: —

sive Paya Lebar Village—exclusive Peirce

one hour’s nctice at night to move to the support
of other areas as required.

Artillery, Headquarters Malaya Command. The
inner line of the Defensive Fire Zone was ap-
proximately 200 yards in front of the Foremost
Defended Localities. _ Owing to an anticipated
shortage of 25-pounder ammunition, normal
harassing fire was restricted but could be in-
creased on application in special circumstances.

the Docks area.
