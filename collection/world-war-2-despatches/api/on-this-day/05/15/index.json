Even then training was a limiting factor, The Middle East Defence Committee thought it well to stress the point made by General Nye that 15th May was only a tentative date dependent upon the rate at which the enemy could build up his tank strength. They added that any favourable opportunity before or after this date would be taken."

Concerning the preparation and use of Bardufoss, comsiderable tact was necessary in dealing with the Norwegians, as they firmly wished to keep it under their control. The acceptance of Norwegian pilots and other air personnel for training in England did much to bring a convenient working arrangement into force."

            "description": "390. Directly Akyab Island was occupied, work began on expanding the existing allweather airfield so that it could accommodate three transport and three and a half tactical squadrons, with a target completion date of the 15th May.. At the same time, to meet the immediate and pressing needs of Fourteenth Anny, a fair-weather transport field for two squadrons was constructed and opened on the 17th February. Two tactical strips were also made. Fourteenth Army's rapid progress, however, made further demands on the airfield development of Akyab. A second fair-weather transport strip was called for, and an advance on the completion date for the all-weather airfield, and finally an increase in the operational capacity of the latter was required. Despite many difficulties this programme of work was completed ahead of schedule. The works on Akyab Island were begun by the Chief Engineer, 15 Indian Corps, but early in February, the responsibility was taken over by the commander of an Army Group Royal Engineers, working directly under my Chief Engineer."

            "description": "Secondly, I must again draw attention to the factor of the weather, During the monsoon, say 15th May to 15th November very roughly, we had to expect all fair-weather routes to be out of action ; even all-weather roads were subject to wash-outs and damage. Although flying was certain to be intermittent and hazardous, air supply became often the only practicable means, but it was entirely dependent on allweather airfields. Al] administrative planning had to include provision for the continuance of adequate maintenance under monsoon conditions. The absolute importance of completing the construction of all-weather airfields for supply aircraft before the monsoon was therefore obvious."

At the same time 7 Indian Division, 268 Indian (Independent) Infantry Brigade and the Lushai Brigade, were driving the enemy south before them down the west bank of the Irrawaddy, and so closing the net. The linkup between 20 and 26 Indian Divisions was made on the 15th May at Taikkyi, 60 miles morth of Rangoon, and 26 Indian Division then came under command of 33 Corps."

These dates were, however, not nearly early enough to support Fourteenth Army's rapid advance and it became necessary to develop fair-weather airfields and to put them into operation simultaneously with the construction of the all-weather ones. Two squadrons of C.47 aircraft began supply operations from Akyab on the 20th March, with No, 1 R.A.M.O. which had been switched from Imphal, and a further two squadrons by- the end of the month. Half a squadron operated from Kyaukpyu during April for the supply of troops in Arakan only. The all-weather airfields were in fact completed in both places in early May, when each base operated three squadrons of C.47 transport aircraft."
