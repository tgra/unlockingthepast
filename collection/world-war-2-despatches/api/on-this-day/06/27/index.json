            "date": "27th June",
            "description": "It will be noted that no decision had been taken, at the time this directive was issued, whether ANVIL should be mounted or not; on the other hand the forces to be provided for it from Italy had now risen to seven divisions. This uncertainty was a very great handicap to our planning, and its psychological effect on the troops expecting to be withdrawn, especially on the French, was undoubtedly serious. It is hard to expect troops to give of their best when they are continuously  ' looking over their shoulder   to a new objective, particularly when it is so attractive an objective as the liberation of their own country. This situation lasted throughout June. On the 14th I was instructed that VI Corps Headquarters was to be withdrawn at once, 3 Division on 17th June and the 36th on 27th June. On the 24th a French division was to be withdrawn to the Naples area, followed by a second in the first week of July. On the same day  the Combined Chiefs of Staff signalled   the destruction of the German armed forces in Italy, south of the Pisa-Rimini line, must be completed. There should be no withdrawal from the battle of any Allied forces that are necessary for this purpose  . Nevertheless I was informed on the 16th that, in order to preserve the possibility of mounting ANVIL, it was necessary to proceed with the programme of withdrawal of forces already laid down. We could still hope that we might get these troops back again later but this became more unlikely after it was known that General Eisenhower had strongly recommended the operation in a signal of 23rd June. The final decision in its favour was communicated to me on 5th July. ANVIL* was eventually launched on 15th August.",

The strong mountain positions north of Perugia, extending almost to the east shore of the lake, were unsuitable for operations by 6 British Armoured Division; the Germans rapidly appreciated  this and were able to withdraw 15 Panzer Grenadier Division to the west side of the lake to oppose 13 Corps. They also pulled out 94 Infantry Division and sent it back to North Italy to reform completely with fresh drafts, On 26th June 10 Corps regrouped; 10 Indian Division arrived and 6 Armoured was sent across to reinforce 13 Corps. The same day 8 Indian Division scored a gratifying success  by the capture of Monte Pilonica, east of the Tiber. Between the river and the lake the Germans now began, on 27th June, to fall back",
