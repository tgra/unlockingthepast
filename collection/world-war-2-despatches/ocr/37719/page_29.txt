27. One. other attribute of a naked steel bullet
must not be overlooked, viz., its incendiary
effect when it strikes a ferrous structure.
During ground trials a Blenheim was set on fire
by the second hit from a ‘‘ solid ’’ bullet. Un-
fortunately, German aircraft do not normally
contain much iron or steel.

28. If we look into the not too distant future,
‘I think we shall find that an additional and
quite different reason may arise for the adoption
of the high-velocity gun with a comparatively
heavy projectile. I refer to the increasing inten-
sity and effect of return fire from Bombers.

2g. Our Fighter's are protected to a very
large degree from the return fire of Bombers
which they attack from astern, so long as they
pave to sustain the impact only of rifle-calibre
lets.

30. The situation will be quite different,
however, if turrets with .5-inch guns are com-
monly uggd in Bombers. The Bomber has the
comparative advantage over the pursuing
Fighter of firing ‘' down-wind ”’ (one may get
a clear idea of the situation by imagining both
aircraft to be anchored in space, with a
300-m.p.h. wind blowing from the Bomber to
the Fighter). The result is likely to be that
effective armouring of Fighters against return
fire will be impossible, and fighting ranges in
good visibility may be considerably lengthened.
In such circumstances high velocity, flat trajec-
tory and a heavy projectile will attain increas-
ing importance; attention will also have-to be
paid to accurate methods of sighting, and
allowance for gravity drop.
