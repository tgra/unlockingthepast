to be present; but SUFFOLK never saw this
ship and in view of her position it,is,considered
that its presence is not established. “If is curious,
however, that PRINCE OF WALES also ob-
tained 3 echoes soon after meeting the enemy.
It is possible that two separate R.D.F. echoes
were being received from the .BISMARCK.
Aircraft from Iceland were also sent to shadow,
and one made a report of enemy’s course and
speed to NORFOLK.

Battle Cruiser Force.

16. HOOD and PRINCE OF WALES and
their screen’ were meanwhile closing at high
speed. They arrived in the vicinity of the
enemy sooner than I had expected. At 0205 the
Vice-Admiral Commanding, Battle Cruiser
Squadron turned to a course nearly parallel to
that of the enemy to wait for the relative posi-
tions to become clear and for daylight. The
opposing forces were in close proximity at this
time, and it is possible that the ship sighted by-
NORFOLK at 0229 was the PRINCE OF
WALES. During the rest of the bight PRINCE
OF WALES obtained frequent D/F* bearings
of NORFOLK and SUFFOLK and passed them

.in to the Vice-Admiral Commanding, Battle
Cruiser Squadron. At 0340 HOOD and
PRINCE OF WALES increased to 28 knots
and altered in to make contact..

17. It was-the intention of the Vice-Admiral
“Commanding, Battle Cruiser Squadron, that
HOOD and PRINCE OF WALES should
engage the BISMARCK, leaving the PRINZ
EUGEN to the cruisers, but the Rear-Admiral
Commanding, First Cruiser Squadron, was not
aware that the battle-cruiser force was so near;
NORFOLK and SUFFOLK, therefore, shadow-
ing from the eastward and _ northward
-respectively at ‘a range of about 15 miles,
were not in a position to engage the PRINZ
EUGEN who was now stationed ahead of the,
BISMARCK on a course of 240°.

18. HOOD and PRINCE OF WALES sighted
the enemy at 0535 from a direction just before
his beam and came into action at 0553 steering
to close the range as fast as possible. All three
ships opened fire practically simultaneously at
a range of about 25,000 yards. The shooting
of both the HOOD and the BISMARCK was
excellent from the start and both scored hits
almost at once. The BISMARCK’s second or
third salvo started a fire in HOOD in the
vicinity of the port after 4-inch mounting.
This fire spread rapidly and, at o600, just after
the ships had turned together to open ‘A’
arcs, | HOOD was straddled again: there was a
huge explosion between the after funnel and the
mainmast and the ship sank in 3 or 4 minutes.
She had fired only 5 or 6 salvos.
‘one unlucky hit of this famous ship with Vice-
Admiral Lancelot Ernest Holland, C.B.,
Captain Ralph Kerr, C.B.E., and her fine com-

. Pany, was a grievous blow.

I9. PRINCE OF WALES had started off
well for so new and unpractised a ship and
had- straddled with her sixth salvo. She had
been engaging the BISMARCK, while herself

being engaged by the PRINZ EUGEN. After ~

to fire simultaneously at the enemy.

The loss by «

16 OCTOBER, 1947

emptying her aircraft in preparation for a night
encounter, she had been unable to refuel it in
time to fly off before contact was made. It was
just about to be catapulted when it was hit by
splinters,and had to be jettisoned. As soon as
HOOD had been disposed of, the BISMARCK
shifted her main and secondary armament fire
quickly and accurately on to the PRINCE OF
W. . The range was now about 18,000
yards and PRINCE OF WALES’ starboard
5.25-inch battery had also come into action.
Within a very few minutes she was hit by four
r5-inch and three smaller, probably 8-inch
shells; her compass platform was- damaged and
most of the people on it killed or wounded;
both forward H.A. Directors and the starboard
after one were out of action; one four-gunned
turret had jammed and the ship, was holed
underwater aft. The Rear-Admiral Command-
ing, First Cruiser Squadron, reports that
PRINCE OF WALES’ salvos Were now falling
short and had a very large spread. The Com-
manding Officer considered it expedient
temporarily to break off the action and, at
0613, turned away under smoke. The range

-on ceasing fire was 14,600 yards.

20. SUFFOLK reported that the BISMARCK
had suffered three hits, but neither the Rear-
Admiral Commanding, First Cruiser Squadron,
nor PRINCE OF WALES had been able to
observe any hits for certain, though black
smoke had been seen at times. Her fire at any
tate was still very accurate. (It is now known
that she did probably suffer three hits, one of
which caused her to leave an oil track and may
have had .a considerable effect on, her

endurance.)

az. The Rear-Admiral Commanding, First
Cruiser Squadron, ordered the destroyers in the
area fo search for survivors of the HOOD and
told PRINCE OF WALES to remain in com-
pany with him and maintain her best speed.
By 0720 she had cleared away most of the
debris on the bridge, and resumed conning from
the compass platform; two guns of ‘ Y ’ turret
were again in action and her Gest speed had been,
reported as 27 knots. 3

Decision to Break Off the Action.

22. The Commanding Officer of the PRINCE
OF WALES in his report says: —

. ‘Some explanation remains to be made
as to my decision to break off the engage-
ment after the sinking of H.M.S. HOOD—
a decision which clearly invites most critical
examination. Prior to the disaster to HOOD
I felt confident that together we could deal
adequately with the BISMARCK and her
consort. The sinking of the HOOD obviously
changed the immediate situation, and there
were three ‘further considerations requiring
to be weighed up, of which the first two had
been in my mind before action was joined.
namely :—

(a) The practical certainty that owing
to mechanical ‘ teething troubles’ a full
output from the main armament was not to

_ be expected.
(0) The working up of the ship after
commissioning had only just reached a
stage where I thad felt able to report to
the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, that

I considered ther reasonably fit to take part

in service operations. This was the first
