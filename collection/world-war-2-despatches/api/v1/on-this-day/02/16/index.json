Of these, the 5th Division arrived in Middle East on 16th February, 1943, and was re-equipped, fully trained, and ready to take its part in the assault on Sicily by July. The 56th Division arrived in Middle East in March, to train and re-equip for Sicily: but early in April it became necessary to send the Division (except for 168th Brigade, which remained to corfiplete its trainfing for Sicily) to Eighth Army, to gain battle experience and to replace the casualties sustained by the army at Mareth. ,"

On 16th February, when one company of the Frontier Battalion was approaching his area, Colonel Torelli, commanding the nine battalions in Dangila, withdrew to Piccolo Abbai, and thence after a short rest at Meshenti, to Bahrdar Giyorgis. He lost several hundred deserters en route and was harried by patriots and by a Bimbashi of the S.D.F. with one mortar and 20 regular troops, but his casualties to fire were not large. In the following weeks he was able to withdraw all the outlying garrisons of Alefa and Achefer, Zeghie, Debra Mai and Addiet, without great loss, to Bahrdar, where he was invested by   Beghemder Force   consisting of one company of the Frontier Battalion and an Operational Centre of 180 men acting under the G.S.0.2 of Mission ror. The role of this small force, which it successfully accomplished, was to prevent Torelli from breaking  back and attacking the rear of the Frontier Battalion and 2 Ethiopian Battalion once the Italian Commander understood the midget from which he had run. Dangila had meanwhile been looted by the patriots."

In the event the two attacks went in on the same day, 16th February. A preliminary to the New Zealand Corps attack was the destruction of the Monastery of Monte Cassino by air bombardment and artillery fire. This famous building had hitherto been deliberately spared, to our great disadvantage, but it was an integral part of the German defensive system, mainly from the superb observation it afforded. It is doubtful, however, whether the ruins after the destruction were not more valuable to the enemy than the intact buildings; as we were to find in the town of Cassino below, heavy bombardment often produced better defensive positions than it destroyed. The attack which went in on the r6th made no progtess. 4 Indian Division ruefully decided that the Cassino position was almost as strong as Keren, still their invariable standard of com-"

This initial success, and the subsequent build-up, were largely due to audacious minor operations carried out during the three nights preceding the landing. Detailed reconnaissance by 3 Commando Brigade of the mangrove swamps west of Ru-Ywa revealed an unoccupied island four miles from the proposed bridgehead. A battery of medium artillery was unobtrusively transported to it by naval landing craft, a light airstrip was constructed, and supplies dumped. The enemy never succeeded in locating this battery and its support proved invaluable. The Japanese made a determined attack on the bridgehead on the 19th February,"

            "description": "98. In 33 Corps  sector, 19 Indian Division made substantial gains in the third week in February, capturing Singu after stiff fighting and inflicting heavy casualties. On 98 Brigade's front, there were indications that the enemy was pulling out from the Thabeikkyin area, after ten days of continuous attacks. 98 Brigade was, therefore, ordered to clear the area between Thaibeikkyin and the southern bridgehead and rejoin the remainder of the Division. This operation was successfully completed by the 20th February, on which date 19 Indian Division commenced its drive south on a two brigade front against continued resistance. 2 British Division encountered only light opposition to their build-up, as the enemy in this sector had concentrated his strength in an all-out effort to destroy 20 Indian Division. In 20 Indian Division's bridgehead, a prolonged and bitter struggle was raging, but the Japanese, following their usual custom, flung their reinforcements in piecemeal and their casualties continued to mount. By the 16th February, we had passed to the offensive, capturing Alethaung Village after savage hand-tohand fighting. Fierce counter-attacks followed against the extreme west of our position ; but, by the 26th we had taken Tabingon and extended our bridgehead to a width of eight miles and a depth of two and a half."
