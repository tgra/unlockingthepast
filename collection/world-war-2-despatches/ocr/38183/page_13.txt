‘leave certain R.D.F. stations.”

SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 22 JANUARY, 1948

as we were short generally of signalling equip-
ment, especially material for the construction
of land lines; but the Government Post and
Telegraph Service was most helpful, and war
experience proved that so long as the Japanese
were kept out of Southern Malaya, Singapore
could always rely on half.an hour’s warning of
hostile aircraft. This was, of course, reduced
after the Japanese advance had forced us to

Other Matters that Required Action.

55. Some special camouflage officers having
been sent out from England in the late summer
of 1941, a Camouflage Committee was set up
in Malaya and camouflage classes formed in
Malaya for the Far East. Priority in camou-
flage work was given to the Naval Base and
aerodromes, but work was also being done
for civilian establishments which were impor-
tant to the war effort. All this involved a
period of years rather than months and was
by no means complete when war broke out.

The formation of Army Labour Units in
Malaya was a matter that was delayed for
various reasons. Finally, however, it was de-
cided to recruit Chinese in Hong Kong, which
had the advantage not only of getting labour,
but also of reducing the Chinese population of
Hong Kong, but, unfortunately, the project
was not executed before war broke out.

Arrangements were made for successive varia-
tions in the route to be followed by civil air-
eraft between Australia and India in the event
of war with Japan.

56. In December, 1940, there was a serious
deficiency in ammunition, especially for the
4.5 and 3.7 A.A. guns, and in reserves for
ordnance stores which were only sufficient for
go days instead of 180. Anti-tank weapons
and mines, 3-inch mortars and ammunition were
also short.

Aircraft bombs at this time were also quite
insufficient to allow for the expected expansion,
and up to the autumn. of 1941, .5 ammunition
for the Buffaloes was difficult to obtain in
adequate quantity.

. By December, 1941, some of these deficien-
cies had been made good. (See paragraph 92
below.)

57. Although the Government Post and Tele-
graph Service was responsible for the communi-
cations on the mainland of Malaya, the lines
on Singapore Island were mainly in the hands
of a private company known as O.T.E.C. This
caused some difficulties, ¢.g., as regards main-
tenance of stocks of spares. But it was de-
cided that the situation in 194 was not suitable
for making the big changes that would have
been involved had the Government taken over
this company. :

58. I found the Malayan War Committee was

‘not on a satisfactory basis; though the pro-

ceedings were recorded in the relevant files,
there were no formal minutes, so it was often
difficult at a meeting to find out quickly what
had been decided previously or who was respon-
sible for taking action. This was corrected,
a new Secretary for Defence was appointed,
and three civilians were brought into the War
Committee with good results. The Commander-
in-Chief, China, and I were not members of
this War Committee, but had a permanent in-

' vitation from the Governor to attend meetings.

Press Relations.

59. It was realised in the Spring of 1941
that some organisation to deal with the Press
would be necessary when war broke out, and,
further, that it would be important before war
during periods of strained relations with Japan.
As a, result of a conference attended by all
concerned, an organisation was worked out
and brought into operation in the middle of
May, 1941. The essential feature of it was that
the Press relations of all three Services were
grouped under one head. As has been stated
above (in paragraph 41), Commander-in-Chief,
China, agreed to be responsible for Press re-
lations, and a Commander, R.N., who was
called up from the ‘Reserve, was put at the
head of the Services Press Bureau. I was, and

* still am, of the opinion that this organisation

was workable. Unfortunately, there were some
discordant personalities, and, finally, after war
broke out, a somewhat different organisation
was adopted, with Sir George Sansom at the
head.

T always found the Press ready to help when
they were asked (see, for instance, paragraph
110 below) and on many occasions we got
good value from them. On the other hand,
some representatives of the Press of other
countries were difficult and required very tact-
ful handling; and we were undoubtedly ham-
pered in the Far East through lack of officers
experienced in dealing with the Press.

Complaints reached the Ministry of Infor-
mation in London that Press correspondents
were not being properly treated; in my reply
to one that was passed on to Singapore I stated:
‘* Should be most grateful for any assistance
you can give to assure that we get out here
officers who have knowledge of the work and
can be trusted to work loyally as a team and
not for their own individual benefit.’” I feel
that in this matter we should have had more
help from England, principally in the way of.
suitable and experienced personnel from the
beginning.

I was reluctant to give Press interviews, but
the importance of doing so from time to time
was frequently intimated to me. There was
one stock question I was frequently asked:
“Was I satisfied with the strength of the de-
fences of Malaya or the Far East generally? ”
I always gave the same reply, that I was
never going to be satisfied because defensive
preparations could always be improved, and,
so far as I could, I was not going to allow
any of my subordinates to be satisfied either.

60. One of the steps taken to discourage the
Japanese from starting war was to emphasise
the growing strength of our defences in Malaya.
(See paragraph 5 (a) above.) The Chiefs of
Staff stated in May, r941, that they saw no
objection to this policy and we were aided by
directions from the Ministry of Information in
London to their representative in Singapore.
The method adopted did not consist merely
in extensive advertising of any reinforcements;
sometimes when these were obvious they were
given only a small notice in the papers or
broadcast. On the other hand, when reinforce-
ments of Royal Air Force personnel arrived they
were merely referred to as Royal Air Force and
no mention was made of the fact that no aero-
planes were with them. It is doubtful if the
effect was great, but it was probably .not
negligible. :
