            "description": "80. 161 Brigade of 5 Indian Division had concentrated at Manipur Road on the 30th March, and was sent to reinforce the Kohima garrison, but it was withdrawn to meet a reported enemy threat further north which menaced the Dimapur base. As the enemy closed in on Kohima, however, the Commander, 202 Line of Communication Area, sent back the 4th Battalion, The Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment of that brigade to assist in its defence, and it arrived on the day on which the Japanese opened their attack. When it became apparent that the threat to Manipur Road from the east was not serious, and that, moreover, the enemy were making no attempt to cut the railway, although it would have been easy for them to do so by sending forward small demolition parties by forest tracks, the remainder of 161 Brigade less one battalion already in Kohima was again ordered forward towards Kohima. It advanced into the hills to within four miles of Kohima on the west, but, being itself engaged, was unable to reach the garrison, although two companies actually succeeded in fighting their way in on the 18th and proved a welcome reinforcement in the bitter fighting which occurred on that date."

            "description": "I had ordered General Anderson to take the earliest opportunity of restoring the situation on the northern road and to relieve the pressure on Medjez by extending our line here to the north of the B ya road The first task was entrusted to 46 Division, using 138 Brigade, 36 Brigade from 78 Division and x Parachute  Brigade. It was facilitated by the fact that the enemy had thinned out in this area to reinforce other sectors but even so the dense scrub and the boulder-covered mountains were mos: serious obstacles. The attack began on 28th March in very heavy rain and made steady progress, assisted by the Corps Franc d  Afrique and a Tabor of Moroccan Goumiers on the left flank. On 30th March we re-entered Sedjenane, and the capture was completed by next day. The enemy was now reinforcing by recommitting his carefully husbanded reserves but they were unable to halt our progress. On 31st March we recaptured our former positions east of El Aouana; shortly afterwards the enemy withdrew from his positions on Cap Serrat. By this advance of  eighteen miles we had won back all the ground which the enemy had taken three weeks to capture; prisoners amounted to over eight hundred and fifty and there is no doubt that his losses in killed and wounded were heavy."

Having inspected the position the Corps Commander reported that it could not be carried by assault with his present forces and General Montgomery decided to wait until he could bring up stronger forces in infantry. His plan was to assault with three infantry divisions, 50th, 51st and 4th Indian, attacking through zo Corps as now disposed; after a breach had been made ro Corps would pass through, with the New Zealanders leading It would take about a week for the attack to be prepared. This would give me time to coordinate Eighth Army's offensive with two other thrusts which I had planned. I issued a plan of operations on 3rd April. My object was still  to seize and secure airfields and potential airfields from which we can develop the full weight of our great superiority in the air, thereby paralysing the enemy's supply system to an extent which will greatly facilitate the rapid advance of our ground forces.  The first phase was to drive the enemy from the Gabes gap iby a frontal attack by Eaghth Army and flanking pressure by II Corps.  When this operation was completed II Corps would be pulled out and transferred to the extreme northern flank. The second phase was to coincide with Eighth Army's advance towards Sousse. I had organized an Army Group reserve under the recently arrived Headquarters"

This move was a forerunner of increased activity by strong enemy patrols which- necessitated the withdrawal of our outposts from Agheila, the enemy occupying the fort there on 24th March. Italian infantry, supported by German armoured forces and dive-bombers, moved East of Agheila on 30th March, and on 3Ist March our forward troops were compelled to fall back on Agedabia. Blenheims of No. 55 Squadron bombed and machine-gunned enemy M.T. concentrations, while the landing ground at Misurata, from which enemy aircraft were operating in support of their advance, was successfully attacked by Wellingtons and Blenheims. The superior weight of the enemy enabled him to continue his advance, however, despite the opposition of our troops and aircraft."

It was also a possibility that the enemy had suffered damage in an encounter between their own forces. 30th March, 1941 Fleet Return to Alexandria."

Progress was slow owing to minefields and road-blocks. Four miles east of Neghelli opposition was met and overcome, and Neghelli itself was occupied at 0830 hours on 21st March. No administrative arrangements could be made at that time to maintain troops in Neghelli, so the column returned to Dolo on 26th March. On 23rd March the Commander rath (A) Division had been ordered by me to do what he could to keep the enemy forces north of Neghelli engaged. By making a show of force in this area it was hoped to delay the withdrawal of enemy forces on the route Neghelli-Addis Abeba and thus to contribute to the success of operations being undertaken by rrth (A) Division in the Harrar-Auasc River area. ' Unfortunately this message was delayed and before receipt the Neghelli columns, which had never  been intended to stay, had been withdrawn. Accordingly, re-occupation was decided upon provided the necessary administrative arrangements could be overcome. A column of 3rd G.C. Regiment less two companies, one troop of E.A.A.C. Regiment and a section of 51st G.C. Light Battery left Dolo early on 30th March and reached Neghelli on ist April. In the meantime, however a patrol of r/and K.A.R. from the 21st E.A. Infantry Brigade at Iavello had already re-occupied Neghelli on 30th March. The 3rd G.C. Regiment remained in Neghelli and the 1/and K.A.R. patrol returned to Iavello. No enemy were reported near Neghelli but local riots were taking place-between Boran-and:Somaii tribesmen and punitive patrols had to be sent out to round up offenders. The enemy were believed to be holding a position in the area Uaddara and a patrol was accordingly sent out to investigate. The patrol returned on 5th April"
