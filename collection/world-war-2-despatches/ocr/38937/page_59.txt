SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

clear that we should have stiff fighting before
we could drive these excellent troops from their
positions. Their artillery support was better
co-ordinated now, and a particular feature of
the fighting here was the German use of their
heavy artillery, especially the 17 centimetre
gun, and of a reinforced strength in multi-
barrelled rocket projectors. 305 and 44 Infantry
Divisions, withdrawing from Perugia, had
fallen back unhurriedly, the former closing in
east of Arezzo. 114 Jaeger Division, moving
up the centre of the peninsula, put in several
counter-attacks to ease the pressure on its
neighbours. On the Adriatic coast 278 Divi-
sion, in its first major engagement, was fighting
hard for Osimo and Filottrano and losing
heavily.

IV Corps on the left had a very bitter
struggle for Rosignano, which the $.S. Panzer
Grenadiers defended against 34 United States
Division with the same stubbornness as they
had shown at Cecina. The town is situated on
a hill top, very compactly built of large
masonry houses with an ancient castle in’ the
centre. In these circumstances street fighting
was bound to be a long job; it lasted in fact
from 3rd July until gth July. Naturally only
part of our force was directed into the town
itself and the remainder endeavoured to out-
flank it to the east, but here too resistance from
26 Panzer Division was strong. Further east
I United States Armoured Division was relieved
by 88 United States Infantry Division which
on the 8th captured the ‘‘ far-famed hold’’ of
Volterra.

Arezzo presented a more complicated prob-
lem. The town itself lies in a flat plain but
it is surrounded by mountains on three sides.
The broad and fertile Val di Chiana leads
up to it from the west side of Lake Trasimene
but some three miles short of it the plain
ceases and the road turns north-eastwards to
enter the town through a comparative defile.
The advance on Arezzo from the Trasimene
line was relatively rapid both by 13 Corps and
ro Corps, though the latter was employing only
one infantry division and an armoured brigade.
13 Corps first met stiff resistance lafe on 5th
July. ‘The full strength of the German position
was not immediately appreciated, for the ex-
posed approaches and heavy shelling made
reconnaissance difficult, and for the next three
days the leading brigades continued to probe
forward in the expectation that the Germans
would turn once more to withdrawal under
continued pressure without our having to mount
a full-scale attack. 6 Armoured Division in the
valley, having relieved 78 Division, attempted
to press on by the direct route to Arezzo and
succeeded in gaining a tenuous foothold on
Monte Lignano, due south of the town on the
right hand side of the-defile. On the Corps’
left 4 British Infantry and 6 South African
Armoured Divisions tried to break through the
enemy defences on the hills running parallel
to the Arezzo-Siena road and thus break into
the Arno valley west of Arezzo but though
4 Division succeeded in seizing one of the hills,
Poggio all’Olmo, the main line held firm.

It was clear that further reinforcement would
be needed before we could break through this
line of defence. Our main weight must be
developed in 13 Corps’ sector, where the ap-
proach was easiest, but the three divisions
which had fought their way through the Trasi-

2937

mene line were now stretched over a front of
twenty-five miles and had no reserves.* In
ro Corps 8 Indian Division had been fighting
with only four days break since the crossing
of the Rapido; 10 Indian Division had arrived
to reinforce and had taken over almost the
whole Corps sector to allow the 8th a partial
test, 4 Indian Division, which had had three
weeks mountain training, was coming forward
and the first brigade reached the Umbertide
area by 7th July. However, even when thus
reinforced, 10 Corps could have little effect
on the battle for Arezzo as the country east
of the town is very broken and badly roaded
and the Corps’ main task was to press up the
Tiber valley to Sansepolcro. It was necessary,
therefore, to reinforce 13 Corps and strike at
Arezzo by the natural route, from the south-
west. The nearest reserves were in x Canadian
Corps which had 2 New Zealand Division under
command; they had not been needed for the
pursuit so far and had been left in the Liri
valley for ease of administration and in order
to give them time to rest, reorganise and pre-
pare for the attacks on the ‘' Gothic’ line.
The most readily available formation was the
New Zealand Division at Frosinone and I
decided to bring this up; to give it time to
arrive the attack would have to be postponed
until the 15th. ;
This decision was reached on oth July and
for the next four days the enemy attempted,
by a series of counter-attacks on different
points of 23 Corps’ front, to gain the initiative
and re-establish his positions where they had
been endangered. These were all repulsed
with heavy losses and on our side an attempt
to increase our hold on Monte Lignano, the
main bulwark of the defence south of Arezzo,
was also unsuccessful. In the meantime Io

“Corps was able to make a gratifying and un-

expected advance. 4 Indian Division was em-
ployed west of the Tiber, where a large moun-
tain mass, culminating in the three thousand
five hundred foot peak of Monte Favalto,
‘blocks all access from the Tiber valley to
Arezzo; there were no roads across this massif
in either direction and shortage of bridging
material meant that the divisional routes of
access were severely restricted. Trusting in
this inaccessibility the enemy held the ground
here relatively lightly. But 4 Indian Division
had already a fine reputation in mountains
and recent training had polished up its know-
ledge; with 1/9 Gurkhas in the lead it pushed
resolutely into the tangled mass of ridges
and peaks and by the 13th Monte Favalto
was in our hands. The Army Commander,
taking advantage of this, ordered the division
to press on north across the Arezzo-San-
sepolcro road, capture the Alpe di Poti and
threaten Arezzo from the east. It was a
difficult task, as the Indians had completely
outstripped their road communications, ‘and be-
fore this threat could be fully developed the
Germans had been forced out of Arezzo; but the
capture of Monte Favalto was undoubtedly a
strong contributing factor in that success.

13 Corps’ attack on Arezzo was launched at
oroo hours on 15th July. The New Zealand
Division attacked in the hills south of the

* 78° Division, which had been engaged almost
continuously since Sicily, was due to leave for the
Middle East in the normal programme of rotation ;
46/and 56 Divisions were returning from the Middle
East to replace it.
