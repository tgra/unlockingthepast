This correspondence is too I iy to reproduce here, but it deals also with my apprehensions concerning Hurricane wastage in France, which were realised in the Spring of 1940.

Neither the flashspotting nor the sound-ranging troops coud give us any useful data about its origin, and at first the radar stations were equally reticent. Even the objective which the Germans had meant to hit remained unknown. Hence the rocket might have come from any area in German hands which was within 230 miles of the point of impact for this, as we had reason to believe, was the maximum range of the A-4. Thus we were reduced to this hypothesis: that if the rocket had been aimed at London, then it must have come from the Hague or somewhere near it; but if at some other target, then it could have come from another part of Holland, from the Frisians, or even from a part of Germany near Cleves.",

Rome, of course,  had great political value but we did not regard it primarily as a prize to be won but rather as something which we knew the enemy intended to defend and for which we could make him fight his hardest. To draw him into battle and destroy his forces was our real object. The directive Tecognised that the enemy  intends to resist our occupation of Southern Italy to a greater degree than hitherto contemplated.  was therefore given, in the first phase, to the build-up of our land forces and of such air forces as were specifically required to assist them in their task. However, six heavy bombardment groups of the Strategic Air Force must  be in Italy and operating by the end of the year for use in the bombing programme . against Germany. Finally I was directed, after the capture of Rome, to secure possession by occupying a general line to cover Civitavecchia and Terni, the former being taken into use as a port.",
