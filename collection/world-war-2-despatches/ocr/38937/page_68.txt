At the time the attack went in the New
Zealanders were moving from the Siena area to
concentrate between Falconara and Iesi.

__ Fifth Army had three Corps in line, account-
ing for the remaining nine divisions, four of
them British. 13 Corps, on the right of the
Army front, held the area from the Prato-
Magno range to about two miles west of
Florence. In the line were 1 Infantry, 6
Armoured and 8 Indian Divisions, supported
by 1 Canadian Armoured Brigade. II Corps
held a narrow sector of about four miles imme-
diately on the left of 13 Corps; it had three
infantry divisions under command, the 34th,
88th and grst, All these were in reserve and
the front was held by an independent Japanese-
American Regimental Combat Team. On its
left was IV Corps, responsible for the line of the
‘Arno from due south of Prato to the sea; under
command were the x Armoured and 85 Infantry
Divisions, a Regimental Combat Team of 92
(Negro) Infantry Division, which was in pro-
cess of arriving, and ‘‘ Task Force 45’, the
improvised formation I have already referred
to. 6 South African Armoured Diyision was
moving to come under command of IV Corps
to relieve 85 Infantry Division, which was
to pass to II Corps. Like Eighth Army,
therefore, Fifth Army had its greatest strength
on its right; IV Corps duplicated the réle of
zo Corps in holding a long defensive sector
with minimum forces. :

As will be seen, we had all our goods in the
shop window and it was impossible for me to
create a central reserve with which to influence
the battle. This was less important than it
might seem, however, in view of the nature of
the plan. The two Armies were fighting, in
the opening stages, essentially separate battles
and each of them had a strong striking Corps,
5 and IE Corps, with plenty of reserves. In
a sense, Fifth Army might be regarded as the
Army Group reserve, for in the two-handed
strategy which I planned its blow would be
held back until the moment seemed right.
Opening of the Offensive.

Eighth Army’s attack went in as planned
an hour before midnight on 25th August. The
opening stages were silent but a barrage was
fired at midnight to cover the advance from
the bridgeheads over the Metauro river. By
dawn on the 26th all the five assaulting
divisions were deep across the river, more or
less without nepoasien. It soon became
obvious that we had caught the Germans in
the middle of a fairly complicated withdrawal
and regrouping movement; their intention was
to pass 278 Division back through x Parachute
Division and bring it across to the western
flank of LXXVI Corps where it would relieve
5 Mountain Division which was to move to the
French frontier to relieve 90 Panzer Grenadier
Division. The enemy was, therefore, prepared
to yield ground and the fact that he was fall-
ang back voluntarily as we advanced made it
difficult for him to detect the greater weight
of our attacks on this occasion compared with
tthe following-up attacks by which the Poles
had up to now been pressing him back up
the Adriatic coast. Eighth Army’s secret con-
centration had completely escaped his notice;
the presence of some new troops in the former
Polish sector had indeed been established but,
having overestimated the Polish casualties in

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

the battle for Ancona, where his own losses
had been heavy, he had in any case been
expecting the Poles to be relieved. Moreover,
there was still some twelve miles to go before
the ‘‘Gothic’’ line was reached and the Germans
probably expected us to delay our formal attack
until we had actually reached it. .

The effects of this German misappreciation
lasted for some time and it was not until the
zgth that the German Corps Commander issued
a strong Order of the Day which showed that
he had at last realized that a serious attempt
at a break-through was intended. In spite of
this on the 30th elements of both 5 Corps and
the Canadians crossed the River Foglia and
captured the advanced positions of the ‘‘ Gothic ’’
line before the enemy had time to man them.
On 3xst August and 1st September a further
advance gave us a stretch of the main defences
some twenty miles long, from the coast to Monte
Calvo, The works were not manned, many of
the minefields were still carefully marked and
set at safe and in one case some recently arrived
troops were actually captured while sweeping
out the bunkers which they were to occupy.
The parachutists, all of whom had acknow-
ledged, by imitialling, an order from
Kesselring stating that the ‘‘ Gothic ” line was
the last hope in Italy before the Brenner and
that they were to hold their positions for three
weeks, pulled out of Pesaro on the night
of ist September and raced back behind
the Conca. In the fighting so far they had
suffered very heavily, up to half the strength
with which they went into action; it was only
their hasty retreat which prevented them from
being encircled by an outflanking move of the
Polish Corps.

As always the Germans were quick to recover
from their surprise. By 29th August a regiment
from 26 Panzer Division, brought across from
west of Empoli, had arrived and gone into
action on the River Foglia; it was soon followed
by thie rest of the division. This was a standard
manoeuvre; we had seen before, for instance
in the Anzio crisis, the rapid transference of
this division, now Kesselring’s only armoured
division, from one flank of the Army Group
to the other, but this time it was committed
so hastily and so unprepared that it suffered
unduly heavy losses. At the same time 98
Division was committed from Army reserve.
It fought with great vigour in this its first action
in Italy and its casualties too were heavy. A
regiment from 162 Turkoman Division was a
less useful reinforcement. Finally, with that
readiness to accept risks which had marked
Kesselring’s strategy throughout the campaign,
and had gone far to retrieve the initial disasters
to German arms which his invariable misreading
of our intentions always incurred, the enemy
Commander-in-Chief now removed -his. last re-
serve from the centre and left, 29 Panzer
Grenadier Division, and despatched it in haste
eastwards. The first elements of the division
were in action by 4th September, but the bulk’
did not arrive until the 6th. On the latter day
also a regiment of 5 Mountain Division, which
had been taken out of the line on its way to
the French frontier, was halted and brought
back into the line.

It had been a great success for Eighth Army.
By a combination of surprise in preparation
and dash in the attack they had swept through
a fortified line which had been twelve months in
