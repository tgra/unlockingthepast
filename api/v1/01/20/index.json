On the 20th January ABDA Command (00186 of 20/1) informed the Air Ministry that while the reinforcements asked for were undoubtedly required, it was not known whether they would have to be found from the aircraft allotted to the South Pacific theatre. The full position was asked before agreement to allocate from the total pool was possible—since the need in the Southern Malayan theatre was more immediate than that in Burma.",

            "description": "339. It will be remembered from Part I that the original operation planned for the capture of Akyab was to have been mounted from Chittagong. Owing, however, to the limited capacity of the port, maintenance had to be arranged direct from depots in India, and despatched from Calcutta. This resulted in loss of flexibility, so that when Akyab was captured by a river-crossing operation on the 3rd January, it was found that the shipping from Calcutta could not be made to arrive before the 20th January; even then it was loaded with stores, etc., planned for the original February assault. The landing on the Myebon Peninsula, which took place only nine days after the capture of Akyab, was mounted and maintained from that port.
