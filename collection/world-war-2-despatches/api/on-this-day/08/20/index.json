            "date": "20th August",
            "description": "329. The Japanese Mission returned to Okinawa from Manila at midday on 20th August. No untoward events occurred during their visit to the Philippines, but such was the mixture of feeling within their own country at that time regarding the peace terms that they were shot at by their own fighters when leaving Japan for Okinawa. A similar reception was contemplated on their return to Japan, and, in consequence, they took the precaution of approaching Japanese territory in the dark.",

            "date": "20th August",
            "description": "304. The Mosquito indeed made amends for the structural defect which had curtailed its use in this Command, for it set up two records in 1945. Firstly, a Mosquito XVI broke the long distance record on March 22 for this type of aircraft in any theatre of war, with a flight of 2,493 miles in eight hours forty-five minutes, covering the Bangkok  Singapore railway to a point south of the Malayan frontier. This performance, however, was eclipsed by a Mosquito XXXIV based on the Cocos Islands, which on 20th August, 1945, flew 1,240 miles to Penang Island and then went on to cover Taiping town and air-: field at 17,000 feet. On the return home a survey tun was made on the K8/12-inch camera. This was the longest P.R. flight to be made in the Command, and covered a total of 2,600 miles in nine hours five minutes.",
