13 Corps: 1 New Zealand Division, 7
Armoured Division.

(b) Reserve—

5 Indian Division (4 Indian Division
eventually): x Armoured Division.

(c) General line of F.D.Ls.—El Alamein
defences—Pt. 63 (eastern) on Ruweisat
Ridge-vicinity of Alam Nayal. South of
Alam Nayal the flank will be covered by 7
Armoured Division.

(d) General line of reserve positions.—
For forward bodies, the most western line
of the new rearward position.

Should it be desired to avoid the full effect
of an enemy attack in great strength the above
F.D.Ls. can become the outpost line and the
main front can be withdrawn accordingly.

(e) Matruh.—Should be blocked by the
Navy without delay.

Tactical Technique and Future Organisation.

18. In the light of the course recommended
it will be necessary to adjust our tactical tech-
nique. This should be based on three facts:—

A.—We have to be prepared to fight a
modern defensive battle in the area El

SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 10948

Alamein—Hammam. The troops detailed
for this must be trained and exercised so as
to get the maximum value from the ground
and the prepared positions.

B.—Eighth Army may have to meet an
enemy’s sortie developing into manceuvre by
the southern flank from his firm front on the
general line Bab el Qattara—Taqa Plateau.
We must therefore organise and train a
strong mobile wing, based on 7th Armoured
Division, comprising a divisional artillery,
ath Motor Brigade, 4th Light Armoured
Brigade, and possibly extra Crusader units.
This mobile wing must be well trained in
harassing defensive technique.

C.—Eventually we will have to renew the
offensive and this will probably mdan a
break-through the enemy positions about El
Alamein. The newly-arrived infantry divi-
sions and the armoured divisions must be
trained for this and for pursuit.

19. From the point of view of G.H.Q., the
organisation of our available forces in August
and September might take the following
form:—

Eighth Army.

Alamein defended area

and the Delta.
and to prevent its being

the Natrun area.

30 Corps. 13 Corps.
(x3 Corps also commands Mobile Wing).

This goes further than the present apprecia-
tion, but can hardly be separated from it
because, should this idea be adopted, it means
that the formations now in Eighth Army will
not be relieved and the new formations will be
built up and reorganised irrespective of the
immediate needs of Eighth Army.

20. Summary.—The enemy now holds in
sufficient strength for his purpose a front
from which he cannot be dislodged by
manceuvre or any attack Eighth Army can at
present deliver. ‘We are strongly posted for a
defensive battle. The enemy is attempting to
build up his strength and renew his attack on
Egypt. Eighth Army requires re-equipment
and training before it will be fit for offensive
operations. During August it js unlikely that
either ourselves or the enemy will be strongly
reinforced on land; a successful offensive by
either side is therefore unlikely. Provided the
land and air situation does not change, Eighth
Army can be reinforced about mid-September
by two armoured divisions and two infantry
divisions. This may give us a superiority
sufficient to justify a direct attack on what
may be by then a strongly organised front.
Alternatively, we may develop a threat to the
enemy’s rear via Siwa. The immediate need
is to reorganise present forces with Eighth
Army and to rearrange the front so as to provide
an army reserve. The longer term policy is to

train the newly-arrived divisions for the
counter-offensive which it is hoped might
begin in the latter part of September.

Letter to the Chief of the Imperial General
Staff.

14th August, 1942.

1. I wish to place before you my views on
the proposal to separate Iraq and Persia from
the present Middle East Command and to con-
stitute them as an independent command under
a Commander-in-Chief directly responsible to
the Chiefs of Staff.

I am aware that I have not been asked for
my opinion, but I consider that in view of my
experience as Commander-in-Chief both in India
and the Middle East, and because I have made
an exhaustive study of the problem of the
defence of the area in question, it is my duty
to place my views on record. I do this solely
in the hope that they may be of some service
to the nation, and not because I wish to
attempt in any way to contest the decision to
divide up my present command.

2, You are aware, I believe, that I have re-
cently approved a reorganisation of the system
of command in Iraq and Persia.

The object of this reorganisation is to free
Commander Tenth Army and his staff to direct
