            "description": "Stampalia on 7th October. The continued delay was certainly due to our naval and air offensive against shipping and German key points. Heavy toll was taken iby British and American air forces, who, although handicapped by the lack of airfields, and operating from very considerable distances, kept up a ceaseless offensive under trying conditions,"

            "description": "on 27th September and progress was timed te. suggest 5th November as the date of com- plehon. A large mock dump was started in the southern sector on 7th October and this too increased at a rate to suggest completion on*5th November. ro Armoured Division used as an intermediate staging area a position right down on the southern flank from where it might be expected to move forward to 13 Corps sector. The westward move to this area was made openly in daylight and when the division moved due north after dusk it was represented in the staging area by the measures I have already described. A wireless network of Io Corps, with all its brigades, was represented as operating in the southern sector up to D-day and from D mirfis 1 onwards occa- sional false messages were sent suggesting a move forward into 13 Corps\u2019 area."

            "description": "13. H.M. Ships SIRIUS, PENELOPE, FAULKNOR and FURY (Lieutenant-Com- mander T. F. Taylor, R.N.) entered the Aegean on the night of 6th/7th October when recon- naissance indicated that enemy reinforcements were arriving from the westward, and assisted by an enemy report from H.M. Submarine UNRULY (Lieutenant J. P. Fyfe, R.N.) received at 0630 on 7th, they located and sank an enemy convoy consisting of an ammunition ship, an armed trawler and six landing craft. This encounter delayed the retirement of our force, which was attacked in daylight in the Scarpanto Strait by J.U.88s and 87s, H.M.S. PENELOPE being hit by an unexploded bomb and her speed reduced to 23 knots. (The destruction of this convoy probably prevented the enemy from making an immediate assault on Leros.)"

It was thought that this would amount to between 18 and 23 squadrons, depending on the treatment found necessary for the surface of the Indaw airfields. The Chiefs of Staff, however, cabled on the 7th October that provision .of aircraft on this scale was quite out of the question, and that a total of 151 transport aircraft (six squadrons) was all that were likely to be available."
