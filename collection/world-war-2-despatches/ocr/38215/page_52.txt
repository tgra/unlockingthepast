of the older men were employed in Govern-
ment Departments or in the Passive Air
Defence Organization which needed strengthen-
ing. A number of the younger men were
commissioned in the Services. Some specially
selected officers were posted direct to Indian
Army Units in spite of their lack of knowledge
of the language as 1t was considered essential
to strengthen the European element in those
units. Others were attached to combatant
units as interpreters and advisers on local
conditions,

329. Supplies mm Forward Areas.—The tactics
adopted by the enemy of striking at our com-
munications, coupled with the complete lack
of transport aircraft, forced us to modify the
general principle of keeping supplies in forward
areas mobile. I therefore directed that 7 days’
reserve of food, ammunition and other essential
stores were to be maintained at all times by
forces whose communications might be in
danger of attack.

SECTION XXXVI.—REINFORCEMENTS.

330. As has already been stated (Section
XXXIII), the 45 Indian Infantry Brigade with
attached troops and an Indian Pioneer Battalion
had arrived at Singapore on the 3rd January.
On the 13th January an important convoy
reached Singapore safely bringing the following
formations and units :—

53 British Infantry Brigade Group of the

18 British Division.

One Heavy British Anti-Aircraft Regiment.
One Light British Anti-Aircraft Regiment.
One British Anti-Tank Regiment.

50 Hurricane Fighters with their crews.

The transports included several large
American liners which were discharged with the
utmost despatch and left again without delay.

_ 331. The reception and protection of this and
subsequent convoys were combined operations
of considerable magnitude. The Navy was
responsible for routeing and docking them and
for the provision of naval escort vessels, the
Air Force for providing aerial protection from
the Banka Straits northwards, and the Army
for the provision of ground anti-aircraft protec-
tion from the time they reached Singapore till
the time they left and for the rapid disembarka-
tion of personnel and discharge of cargoes.
Each convoy presented separate problems which
had to be carefully studied before plans could
be formulated. In all three Services the
preservation of the utmost secrecy was insisted
upon. It was due to this that commanders in
the forward areas were sometimes unable to
appreciate the broader aspects of strategical
plans It stands to the credit of all three
Services that only one ship in convoy was sunk
before reaching Singapore.

332. The 53 Infantry Brigade Group had left
the United Kingdom in October bound for the
“Middle East and had been diverted off the easi
coast of Africa. The voyage had lasted exactly
eleven weeks. On arrival the troops were
healthy but soft. In addition, a great deal of
new equipment had been issued shortly before
embarkation with which there had been no time
to train. The Brigade had had no experience
of bush warfare conditions. It arrived without
its guns and transport, but it was found possible
to replace these temporarily from local reserves.
It was accommodated.in thé first instance on

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1048

Smgapore Island, where I had hoped to be able
to give it a short time to become acclimatized,
but the swift march of events made this impos-
sible. On the r4th January orders were issued
for :—

(a) One battalion of the Brigade to move
to Jemaluang as soon as ready to relieve a
battalion of the 22 Australian Infantry
Brigade which would then be at the disposal
of Westforce,

(6) The remainder of the Brigade to be
prepared to move as soon as ready to either
(i) Mersing in relief of the 22 Australian
Infantry Brigade, or (ii) Labis, to come under
orders of Westforce. Reconnaissances of the
Mersing area were to be carried out at once.

333. On the 14th and r5th January the
detachment of Dutch Marechaussees (See
Section XX XI) reached Singapore by air from
the Netherlands East Indies. This detachment,
the strength of which was about 8o all told,
consisted of native troops from the N.E.I. with
European officers. They were specially trained
in jungle guerilla warfare. Their despatch to
Malaya provided another proof of the ready co-
operation of our Dutch Allies in this Far
Eastern war.

After arrival the Marechausses concentrated
in the Labis area of North Johore and, after
the Japanese advance, operated against their
communications in that district. During the
latter half of January they had considerable
success killing a number of Japanese and doing
material damage. Later, however, they
experienced difficulties from lack of food and
from the unreliability of some elements of the
local population. Rather more than half the
detachment eventually made its way to
Sumatra.

334. The Hurricane ,Fighters arrived crated,
but were unpacked and assembled with the
utmost despatch by the R.A.F. They were
in the aw within a few days of their arrival.
These machines were not the most modern type
of Hurricane. Most of the twenty-four pilots
had previously seen active service, but had
been drawn from several different units.

335. As regards the future, another Indian
Infantry Brigade, an Australian Machine Gun
Battalion and some Indian and Australian
reinforcements were expected within the next
ten days and the remainder of the 18 British
Division towards the end of the month.

Section XXXVII.—THE STRATEGICAL
SITUATION, I5TH JANUARY, 1942.

336 Our object remained as before, i.e., the
Defence of the Naval Base.

337. Army.—iWe knew that on the west coast
the enemy had two divisions in front line. From
the manner in which they were able to main-
tain the momentum of the attack we thought
that they had the equivalent of two divisions
in reserve with which they were able to effect
regular reliefs of their front line troops.

There was little evidence of what troops the
enemy might have on the East Coast, but we
knew it was a minimum of one division:

In addition the enemy was known to have
in Indo-China a formation trained in air-borne
landings and he was believed to have there at
least two divisions in reserve which might be
employed in Malaya or elsewhere.

(We estimated therefore that the enemy had at
his disposal a.minimum of seven divisions with
