SecTION VII (paras, 102-117) THe BaTTLe
FOR MANDALAY

The importance of Meiktila: The capture of
Meiktila and its effect on the Japanese plans:
The capture of Mandalay: Japanese counter-
offensive to retake Meiktila.

102. While the Japanese were concentrating
their forces against 33 Corps (vide paragraphs
95 and 96) the thrust at their vitals by 4 Corps
was developing. I use this term advisedly for
all the Japanese communications radiated from
Meiktila and Thazi; north to Mandalay and
Lashio, south to Rangoon, north-west to
Myingyan, west to Kyaukpadaung and thence
to the oilfields at Chauk and Yenangyaung,
and east, via Kalaw, to Siam. Meiktila was
the advanced supply base for all the Japanese
forces in Burma, with the exception of those
in Atakan. At Meiktila, too, were located the
principal Japanese airfields, the capture of
which would be of inestimable value to us.
Tf we could seize Meiktila, and hold it, the whole
structure of the Japanese defence in Central
Burma was bound to collapse.

103. The great dash om Meiktila started on
the 21st February, when a mechanised and
armoured. column composed of 48 Brigade (17
Indian Division), with tanks, broke out of the
Nyaungu bridgehead, captured Hnawdwin 15
miles to the east, and were then temporarily
held up by deep ravines beyond the village.
Here they were joined by the rest of the Divi-
sion and 255 Indian Tank Brigade (less one
regiment left with 7 Indian Division). The
advance continued the same day, but to avoid
the difficult country between Pyinsin and
Welaung, the Division fanned out, 48 Brigade
and a proportion of armour moving on
Taungtha, via Kainye, and 63 Brigade with
the main body of the Tank Brigade directed
south-east on Seiktin and then north-east, via
Welaung. Both columns reached Taungtha on
the 24th February after overcoming desperate
resistance and clearing many minefields. By
the evening of the 24th, our leading troops
had progressed five miles south-east of
Taungtha, towards Mahlaing. By 0900 hours
om the 26th we had captured the important
Thabutkon. airfield intact, smashing through a
determined Japanese effort to protect it. The
fly-in from Palel of the air-transportable brigade
(99 Brigade).of 17 Indian Division began next
morning, by which time our tanks were engaged
within five miles of Meiktila.

104. This rapid drive merits attention. It
was the first opportunity we had had of utilis-
ing our mechanised and armoured superiority
on a large scale and the Japanese were com-
pletely bewildered and overwhelmed. The
enemy positions, manned by such scratch
forces as could be hastily collected, were sub-
jected to heavy air attack, encircled by tanks
and lorried infantry, and rendered untenable.
Forced into the open, the enemy suffered enor-
mous casualties. The “Cab Rank” method
of air support was here employed most success-
fully for the first time in Burma, squadrons
remaining over the operations area and being
directed on to fleeting targets from ground con-
trol centres. These were known as Visual
Control Posts (V.C.Ps.) which comprised an
Army and a R.AF. officer and which were
usually located at brigade headquarters. It

1903

proved a most efficient method, though un-
economical from an Air Force point of view,
of providing instantaneous air strikes during
rapidly moving operations. The finding of the
necessary officers for these V.C.Ps., and their
training had in the past been matters of some
difficulty. The efforts which had been made
to overcome these were now rewarded in full.

105. The Japanese garrison at Meiktila
totalled 3,500, according to a document cap-
tured later. Unfortunately, our arrival in the
area coincided with that of one regiment of
49 Japanese Division, which was being rushed
from Pegu to Mandalay. The enemy was also
strong in artillery. The commander of the
garrison,’ General Kasuya, had acted with
vigour in the short time at his disposal. The
defences were strong and ingeniously sited, and
all available men, including hospital patients,
were put in to man them. The large lakes to
the west of the town narrowed the areas of
approach and, in all sectors, the lines of
advance suitable for tanks were well covered
by artillery, which included many anti-aircraft
batteries used in their anti-tank réle. All this
in an area where the deployment of armour
was already hampered by broken country and
deep irrigation cuts.

106. As dawn broke on the 28th February,
the attack on Meiktila went in from four direc-
tions. On the north-west, 48 Brigade drove
down the axis of the main road, while
63 Brigade attacked from the west. Simul-
taneously, 255 Indian Tank Brigade, with two
infantry battalions, attacked from the east and
north-east. The tanks experienced difficulty in
deploying and the infantry were at first pinned
down by heavy fire, but later succeeded in
capturing Point 859, which dominates the town
from the south-east. 48 Brigade were tem-
porarily held up by a blown bridge, but by
nightfall Point 859 had been consolidated and
Meiktila had been entirely surrounded. There
followed three days and nights of ‘hand-to-hand
fighting as savage as any yet experienced in
the campaign. The enemy put up the most
fanatical resistance and houses and dug-outs
were only cleared after the last defender had
been bayonetted. By the morning of the 4th
March, all Meiktila north of the railway had
been cleared, but on both sides of the lake
suicide parties still held out, which it took some
days to eliminate. In this bitter fighting, the
Japanese garrison had been practically
annihilated—over 2,000 bodies being counted
in the town alone. The booty captured included
48 guns.

107. In the meantime, the fly-in of 99 Bri-
gade of 17 Indian Division, which had begun
on the 27th February (paragraph 103), was
completed early on the 2nd March, three days
ahead of schedule, and the Brigade moved
forward into battle. In all, 353 sorties were
flown without the loss of a single man, a very
fine achievement by the RAF. and
USAAF,  ~

108. On the 4th March, leaving the complete
clearance of the town to 63 Brigade, columns of
all arms were despatched along all the roads
radiating from Meiktila. The important road
and railway junction of Thazi was reported
clear, but, in other sectors, columns of rein-
forcements, guns and lorries heading for
Meiktila were encountered. The fighting in the
