The Allies employed in Italy a total of forty
divisions of which eight were transferred to
the Western front in 1943 and ten in 1944 and
1945, followed by three diverted to the Balkans.
Like us the Germans never employed this whole
force at once but the details of-opposing strength
at each stage of the campaign show the same
advantage on the Allied side. In October,
1943, there were nineteen German to fifteen
Allied divisions, and in December twenty-one
to fifteen and a half. Next May the numerical
balance shifted slightly in our favour with
twenty-seven to twenty-three but with this
minor superiority we were able to inflict such
losses on the enemy that by August they had
been obliged to reinforce to a total of twenty-
five (and two Italian) against our twenty.
When the final attack began in April, 1945,
we had seventeen divisions to their twenty-
three German and four Italian. Nor should
we restrict our survey solely to the divisions
contained in Italy, for our forces in that country
represented such a threat to the whole of the
southern coastline of Europe that strong garri-
sons had to be maintained in Southern France
and the Balkans; in the summer of 1944, for
example, the most critical moment of the war
when the main effort of Great Britain and the

United States was launched against the beaches
of Normandy, the presence of our forces in
Italy tied down fifty-five divisions in the
Mediterranean area.*

It was the Germans, therefore, who were
contained in Italy and not the Allies; the
Italian campaign drained their strength more
than ours. The reasons why the Germans de-
cided to fight in Italy rather than withdraw to
the Alps I have already discussed; they were
not, or at least the more important were not,
military reasons but political, Perhaps the
future German historian, if he is as eager as
his predecessors have always been to extol the
virtues of Prussian military science, will admit
the folly of protracted resistance in Italy and,
throwing the blame on a _ megalomaniac
Fuehrer, will seek consolation by pointing to
the bravery and stubbornness in defence of the
German soldier. He will be justified in so
doing; but a still finer theme will be that of
the historian who describes how that stubborn
defence and the barrier of so many mountains
and rivers were triumphantly overcome by. the
Allies.

eleven in the South of France.
