SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 18 OCTOBER, 1948

At 0205 H.M.S. MACKAY in the vicinity of
Z23 broke off the engagement and returned to
patrol 4.

Loss of H.M.T, WILLIAM STEPHEN,

15. This trawler did not maintain her station
in the convoy though she should have had
sufficient speed and had dropped some five
miles astern. As soon as the E-boat activity
developed it was seen that this unfortunate
trawler had E-boats both ahead and astern
of her and she ran into the group at 56B buoy,
being sunk by torpedo a few minutes before
oroo. I regret now that I did order her to
steer inshore, but at the time the E-boat situa-
tion was noi so clear as it became subsequently.
The explosion was felt by Unit V to the north-
ward. A German broadcast on the following
day mentioned the picking up of survivors.

Coastal Force Engagements.

16. Unit S—M.L. 250 and R.M.L. 517
(position Z22) sighted H.M.S. MACKAY’s
first action but was not able to intercept the
E-boats, the speed of the unit being reduced
to 12 knots due to engine failure in M.L. 250.
At 0156 a momentary action was fought with
the two E-boats driven off by H.M.S. MACKAY
in her second action.

17. Unit V—M.G.B.s 315 and 327 (position
255) started to fleet 300°, 20 miles at 2345.
The first actions of H.M. Ships WORCESTER
and MACKAY were seen in the distance to the
southward. An underwater explosion was felt
about oxoo which confirms the time of the
torpedoing of trawler WILLIAM STEPHEN.
H.M.S. WORCESTER’s second action (para-
graph 14) was also seen and at or20 radar
contact was made with these (E-boats. Three
boats were heavily engaged from 0138 until
0144, hits being observed on two of them. The
last boat in the line may have been considerably
damaged. At 0230 three more E-boats were
sighted on a north-easterly course at high speed
abdut six miles north of 55B buoy. Owing
to their large turning circle Unit V was unable
to turn quickly enough to engage the fast
moving enemy.

18. Unit R—M.G.B.s 609 and 610 (position
256) started to fleet 300°, 20 miles at 2341.
Two unidentified plots were signalled to the
unit at 0035 and 0040 some ten miles E.N.E.
of Sheringham buoy but Unit R had already
investigated radar contacts in this area by the
time the signals were received.

1g. At oroo Commander-in-Chief signalled
position of Unit R and an enemy plot—Unit R
had already obtained hydrophone contact and
at or02 obtained contact by radar. From this
time until orq41 Unit R stalked the enemy,
keeping between him and the convoy. As soon
as the enemy showed signs of closing the
convoy, Unit R attacked, twice forcing him to
withdraw to the eastward, the second time for
good. The second boat in the line on which
Unit R concentrated their fire was undoubtedly
hit hard and forced to leave the line.

20. This group of E-boats was the only one
to operate north of 57F buoy.

21. Unit Y—M.G.B.s 607 and 603 (position
216) together with Unit L (position Z18) was
fleeted 020°, 20 miles at 2340 as mentioned in
paragraph 4. H.M.S. WORCESTER’s first

5503

engagement, at 0027 and those of H.M.S.
MACKAY were observed to the westward.
H.M.S. MACKAY’s track chart and that of
Unit Y indicate that the E-boats engaged by
H.M.S. MACKAY at o148 could sot be the
same as those engaged by Unit Y as suggested
by Senior Officer of Unit Y. From statements
prisoners of war and other sources it is
considered that Unit Y’s group were proceeding
back to their base possibly escorting one E-boat
that had been damaged by 'H.M.S. PYTCHLEY
at 2318. The fact that they reached Unit Y
approximately at the end of H.M.S. MACKAY’s
action appears to have been pure coincidence.

22. At 0206 Unit Y engaged a group of E-
boats steering an easterly course about 22 miles
north-east of Smiths Knoll buoy. The unit
pressed home its attack with great vigour and
set two E-boats on fire. These E-boats were
seen to blow up. M.G.B. 607 (Lieutenant
R. M. Marshall, R.N.V.R.) also rammed and
sank a third E-boat.

23. At 0409 M.G.B, 603 with 607 in tow
obtained radar contact to the northward. Tow
was slipped and at 0418 M.G.B. 603 went into
action with six E-boats at a range of under
800 yards. As the result of being the first to
open fire M.G.B. 603 obtained many hits on
one boat and probably damaged it severely.
After a running fight the enemy made off at
high speed at about 0445. M.G-B. 603 then
tejoined M.G.B, 607.

24. Unit J—M.T.B.s 442 and 439. Units E
and J which had been ordered out from Lowes-
toft to positions Zro and Z12 when E-boat
activity started, were ordered to the northern
end of Brown Ridge (position RB27 and ten
miles north of position 'RB27 sespectively)
where they arrived at 0300. At 0406 unit went
into action with three E-boats and a high speed
tunning fight ensued in which both M.T.B.s
scored a number of hits. They also suffered
damage and casualties, a hit on the bridge of
442 killing the First Lieutenant. At 0415
M.T.B. 439 lost contact with 442 owing to the
failure of the rudder to turn the boat, although
hard over—439 continued to engage the enemy,
however, until 0445 when it became necessary
to attend to action damage and to wounded.
At 0450 M.T.B. 442 also disengaged due to
action damage and stoppage of 2-pdr. It is
considered probable that considerable damage
was inflicted on the enemy in these engage-
ments.

25. At 0545 in position 52° 50’ N. 3° 04’ E.,
M.T.B. 439 sighted four E-boats steering E.S.E.
As by this time 439 was in no fit state for
action, avoiding action was taken. The presence
of 439 appears to have confused the enemy
sufficiently to induce them to open fire on
one of their own boats which was straggling
ffrom the line.

26. At 0605,'some 12 miles further west, 439
sighted another group of eastbound E-boats who
opened fire. This group was also avoided. I
consider this avoiding action was justified.

27. Most unfortunately fog at the aerodromes
prevented any aircraft of Fighter or Coastal
Commands taking advantage of this unique
opportunity of attacking E-boats in daylight.
A number of these did not reach their base
before noon.
