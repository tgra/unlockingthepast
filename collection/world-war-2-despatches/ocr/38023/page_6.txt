a ‘‘ get away ’’ well to the eastward and landed
on at 0230.

(vii) Skelton-Perkins.
Task: Dropping Flares.

Approach course was similar to Hamilton-
Weekes except that the flares were dropped
south-east of the harbour. Eight flares were
dropped at between 6,500 feet and 5,000 feet,
set to burn 3,000 feet lower. Bombs were
dropped near the oil storage depot, but it is not
considered that hits had been secured. Anti-
aircraft fire similar to that of Hamilton-Weekes
was experienced, some of the bursts during the
dive bomb attack being particularly close.

The aircraft landed on at 0200.

(viii) Clifford-Going.
Task: Bombing Cruisers and Destroyers
in Mar Piccolo (See Plan 1). :

This aircraft started } hour late as stated in
paragraph fo and arrived at Taranto when the
second attack was already in progress. The
aircraft came in over the land about 5 miles
east of the harbour entrance, and steered
straight over the dockyard to the far side of
the Mar Piccolo.

Turning to port a dive bombing attack was
made from 2,500 feet along the line of cruisers
and destroyers from west io east. A stick of
250-lb. S.A.P. bombs was dropped across the
cruisers. The pilot then turned north across
the Mar Piccolo, later swinging to starboard
and returning over the mainland and out to
sea about 5 miles eastward of the harbour
entrance.

A large fire in one of the battleships was seen
to be raging for over 5 minutes.

Anti-aircraft fire was experienced the whole
time the aircraft was over the land, the pom-
pom fire being particularly intense during the
bombing attack.

Aircraft landed on at 0250.

1g. All aircraft, except the two missing, were
landed on by 0250, and the Force rejoined
the Commander-in-Chief at 0730. ,

zo. It is noteworthy that the enemy did not
use the searchlights at all during either of the
attacks. :

Royal Air Force Co-operation,

22. The excellent photographic . reconnais-
sance promoted ‘by the Royal Air Force was a
most important factor in the success of this
operation. The accurate meteorological fore-
cast from Malta was also most useful.

Repetition.

23. It was proposed to repeat the operation
on the following night and a Striking Force
of 15 aircraft comprising 6 torpedo aircraft, 7
dive bombers and 2 flare droppers was pre-
pared, but the operation was cancelled owing
to the unfavourable weather report.

General Remarks. _

24. Duplex Pistol.

There was considerable debate as to the
wisdom of using Duplex pistols in such con-
stricted waters. . It was decided to run off 100
yards of the safety range and the battery re-
sistance was removed to ensure that the tor-
pedoes would remain dangerous on completion
of their run,

The decision to use them was indeed for-
tunate as the results could not have been
obtained by any other weapon. .

To those whose faith in this weapon has re-
mained unshaken the greatest honour is due
and their faith has been amply justified by
3 battleships being either sunk or crippled by
Q—or possibly 1118 inch torpedoes.

25. Spirit in which the attack was made.

This attack was carried out under somewhat
difficult conditions. Owing to the heavy Fleet
programme no rehearsals had been possible.
Aircraft from H.M.S. EAGLE were embarked
the day before leaving harbour and had had
no previous experience of Janding on H.M.S.
ILLUSTRIOUS deck or of our controlled land-
ing and the use of the barrier. A third obstacle
was presented by the discovery that our petrol
was contaminated, three Swordfish being lost
on the preceding days from this cause. In
spite of this the zeal and enthusiasm of every-
one to carry out this great enterprise was un-
abated and it is impossible to praise too highly
those who in these comparatively slow
machines made studied and accurate attacks
in the midst of intense anti-aircraft fire.

26. The Fleet Air Arm.

Although the proper function of the Fleet Air
Arm may perhaps be the operation of aircraft
