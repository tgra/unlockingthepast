SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

brigades for 6 South African Armoured
Division, was to secure the right flank of the
advance by blocking off the roads leading
south from Sulmona, Opi and Atina. The New
Zealand Division was on the southern flank of
the Corps and advanced through San Biagio
to Atina and Sora, on the road from Arce to
Avezzano. For the advance in the valley the
stages were to be, first the line Arce-Ceprano;
secondly Ceccano and thirdly Valmontone, or
near it, to link up with VI Corps. The two
Corps would advance abreast, a great concen-
tration of strength in so narrow a space.
The Germans were as well aware as we were
of their position and of the danger of the
centre of their line being rushed while their
tight was locked in a furious battle for Rome.
At all events they must block the valley long
enough to allow the withdrawal of their forces
from the area to the south of it and ensure an
orderly withdrawal into the ‘‘ Caesar’’ line
before Eighth Army joined hands with VI
Corps. They also had to block the Sora and
Subiaco roads to prevent a further envelop-
ment by these routes, but this was a much
simpler task for both roads run through narrow
defiles on either side of the Simbruini moun-
tains and can be held without much difficulty
against any force which can advance up them.
From a captured operation order it appears
that they intended to hold the line of the
Melfa river with go Panzer Grenadier and 1
_ Parachute Divisions but the order was issued
too late; by the evening of the 24th the
Canadians succeeded in forcing a crossing. This
was a notable feat by 5 Canadian Armoured
Division, which had advanced rapidly from
the breach in the ‘‘ Hitler ’’ line with the right
flank of its advance open since the enemy were
still resisting 13 Corps in Aquino.’ The small
bridgehead, only one company strong, resisted
violent enemy counter-attacks all that night.
Next morning, the enemy having withdrawn
from Aquino and Piedimonte, 13 Corps was
able to advance to.the river line with 6
Armoured, 78 and 8 Indian Divisions, and the
remainder of 1 Canadian Corps, whica nad been
delayed by bad going and the inadequacy of
routes forward, came up to the support of its
advanced guard. There were now five divisions
moving forward in the same general direction
on a front of rather less than five miles and
skilfully laid minefields and German delaying
tactics added to the difficulty of bringing so
large a force to bear in so restricted a space.
13. Corps’ plan provided for an advance up
the northern side of the valley. The Corps
axis was to run through Arce, exclusive of
Ceprano, to Frosinone where it would swing
tight handed to run more or less parallel with
Route 6 through Alatri to Genazzano. It was
impossible to get started, however, until the
enemy had been cleared’ from Aquino and an
. attempt to pass 6 Armoured Division south of
Aquino involved it in confusion with 5 Canadian

Armoured Division which was using the same .

axis; an undetected minefield caused further
delay. They got across the Melfa on the 25th
and advanced on the early morning of the
26th directed on Arce; the Canadians to the
south advanced at the same time towards
Ceprano. Shortly before Arce Route 6 runs
through a defile formed by the main mass of
Monte Cairo on the right and, on the left, by
two prominent hills known as Monte Grande
and Monte Piccolo, both rising about seven

hundred feet above the general level of the
valley. Monte Piccolo had been occupied by a
small advanced detachment of 1 Guards
Brigade late on the 26th but during the night
x Parachute Division infiltrated back onto both
hills and prepared for a stubborn defence. An
attempt to force the defile on the 27th ran
into heavy enfilade fire and we were obliged

.to desist from this attempt and withdraw the

small force from Monte Piccolo. For the next
two days attack and counter-attack continued
and it was not until late on the 28th that the
Germans evacuated Arce and fell back behind
the upper Lisi, which here cuts across Route 6
at right angles. Meanwhile the Canadians had
made an assault boat crossing of the Liri south
of Ceprano on 27th May. It was a difficult
operation in face of heavy enemy artillery and
small arms opposition but the town was cap-
tured by midday. Our bridgehead was still
only supported by ferries and it was not until
the afternoon of the 28th that a hundred and
twenty foot bridge was completed over which
the armoured brigade was to pass to advance to
Frosinone. It had to be used instead, however,
by 78 Division which 13 Corps had sent round
to the south to outflank the enemy defenders
of the Arce defile. This delayed the pursuit
by the Canadian armour.

The first few days of the break-out by VI
Corps had gone so well that the first object of
the operations could be deemed to be secured;
we were already threatening Route 6 and had
destroyed or driven off all the enemy on the
right flank of the original bridgehead. How-
ever the Hermann Goering Division had now
begun to arrive in the Valmontone area where
it had been joined by part of 92 Infantry
Division from north of the Tiber and by units
of 4 Parachute and 65 Infantry Divisions with-
drawn from the left flank of the bridgehead.
It had suffered heavy losses from air attacks,
for its move from Leghorn had been so precipi-
tate that it had mainly been made by day; but
we knew its quality and that it was likely to
put up a very stout defence. It was therefore
decided to change the direction of VI Corps’
attack and throw the main weight against the
weakened left shoulder of the bridgehead in a
drive to secure a line from Lanuvio to
Campoleone station. Early on the 26th General
‘Clark issued orders for the change, which he
described as “a new attack along the most
direct route to Rome ’’. The intention was to
continue the drive towards Valmontone with
3 Division, reinforced, and to employ for the
mew drive the 34th, 45th and 1 Armoured,
supported by 36 Division, which had not been
used for its original mission owing to the speedy
success of the first attack. ‘Within the very
short space of twelve hours from the decision
being taken the new attack was under way. -
Troops of 3 Division with their supporting tanks
advanced with great dash to Artena, which they
surrounded and captured next day. They were
unable, however, in face of stiffening enemy
resistance, to establish themselves across
Route 6. 36 Division, which was to form the
link between this drive and the main attack on
the left, advanced towards Velletri, driving the
enemy ‘back into their prepared defensive line
in its sector.

The new attack towards Lanuvio jumped off
at 1r00 hours on the 26th simultaneously with
3 Division’s attack; the successful shifting
