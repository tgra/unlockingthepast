As a temporary measure, therefore, Kohima was placed under the Commander, .202 Line of Communication Area*, and an extemporised headquarters was set up at Kohima under Colonel Richardst, who had formerly commanded an infantry brigade in 81 (West African) Division. Headquarters 33 Corps was meanwhile flown to Jorhat from India and moved forward from there to Manipur Road, where it arrived on the 8th April.",

On 8th April, three days after Germany invaded Yugoslavia and Greece, it became clear that Yugoslav resistance in the south had collapsed and that from Monastir southwards the road was open to the Germans. To meet this threat it was decided that no further relief in the Veria Pass should be undertaken by units of the 6th Australian Division, and that a force should be formed about Veve under MajorGeneral Mackay, consisting of x9th Australian Infantry Brigade, less one battalion, with a Field Regiment and an Anti-Tank Regiment.

Although the enemy attack was held and heavy casualties inflicted on him, it was obvious that the Olympus-Veria-Amynteion position could not be held for ever. The position was much too extended for the troops available; there had not been time to consolidate it properly; the left flank was protected only by a Greek cavalry division on an extremely wide front, and between this cavalry division and the Greek forces in Albania there was a large gap through which the enemy were likely to penetrate.",

Between these posts the country was in a state of semi-civil war, On 8th April a message was received from  G.O.C. East Africa that Maji had been evacuated and expressing the opinion that the Merille tribe would not submit unless Maji was occupied by regular troops. He also stated that 25th East African Brigade would only be able to garrison Maji for a limited time as it was wanted for further operations, He asked if the Equatorial Corps could take over the garrisoning of Maji. This was agreed to and the Equatorial Corps moved forward to occupy Maji. The rains had already started and the state of the tracks was, appalling. The country is covered with tropical jungle. Progress was slow and difficult. By 25th April the Equatorial Corps was still ten miles from Maji, having been held up by road conditions and flooded rivers. It was not until early in May that Maji was occupied. The only practicable route into Maji came from the north, and 0.C. Equatorial Corps found it necessary to establish a ison at Masci, nine miles north of Maji, where contact was made with 2/4 K.A.R.",
