SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 5 FEBRUARY, 10948

this operation it was appreciated that the cam-
paign in Africa must end by the middle of
May in order to give us a chance to bring
the Tunisian ports into full use. Otherwise
the invasion would have to be postponed until
August when the deterioration of weather con-
ditions might make the operation impossible.
This was a difficult time-table to observe and
it was with great satisfaction that I found in
the event that I had Bizerta and Tunis eight
days before the allotted date and that all resist-
ance ceased in Africa with two days yet to
spare,

Fifth Army Offenswe m the North.

Before these plans could be put into effect
or any thorough reorgan:zation undertaken I
found myself faced once more by a new enemy
initiative. As the rearguards of Rommel’s
striking force were trailing back to the Eastern
Dorsale von Armm attacked with the full
strength of 5 Army all along the British 5
Corps front, from the sea to Gebel Mansour.
The four principal thrusts were made towards
Jefna, on the northernmost road, Sidi Nsir on
the Mateur-Béja road, at Medjez and north of
Bou Arada. No doubt the intention was to
keep us at full strain at a time when it was
known: that the Kassermne crisis had forced us
to weaken the northern sector and produced
a certain disorganization of our forces; it
would also distract us from the pursuit of
Rommel, who now proposed to use his Army
Group reserve in a blow at Eighth Army. It
must, however, have also been the German in-
tention to drive us back into the mountains in
the north, if possible capturmg Medjez, in order
to increase their security in this sector and re-
lease reserves, especially of armour, for the
coming battle in the more open country of
southern Tunisia. The attack came at an awk-
ward time for us, for it prevented us from
forming that mobile reserve wh:ch I had in
mind and forced us to delay still further the
necessary reorgamsation; for instance General
Anderson saw himself obliged to create an
ad hoc divisional organization, given the name
of ‘‘ ¥ ”’ Division, to control 38 Infantry Bri-
gade and r Parachute Brigade in the area of
Goubellat and Bou Arada. The fighting was
hard, and the enemy gained some important
ground but were unable to attain any vital
objectives. The most important feature in our
favour was that we retained our essential gate-
way at Medjez el Bab.

The main blows on 26th February were down
the Béja road from Mateur and south of Medjez,
the former was made by the Barenthin para-
chutists and part.of 334 Divisfon and the latter
by the recently arrived Hermann Goering
Regiment, both supported by tanks. An attack
on Medjez itself, south of the river, was re-
pulsed with heavy losses after small initial
success. The attack further south penetrated
deeply into our lines but was beaten back
north of El Aroussa while our defences round
Bou Arada, some ten miles to the west, held
firm in spite of being threatened from three
sides. The attack down the Béja road was
more formidable; our outpost at Sidi Nsir was
overwhelmed after a very gallant resistance
but the time gained allowed’ 46 Division to
occupy the pass leading to Béja Very heavy
fighting continued here for a week; losses in
46 Division were heavy but the defence held
firm. The enemy were able, however, to ad-
vance their positions in the mountains over-

looking the Béja-Medjez road from the north,

_ and Medjez now represented the exireme point

ot a dangerous-looking salient. There was some
feeling at First Army Headquarters that it
would be advisable to evacuate Medjez, on
the grounds that its fall was almost imevitable
and that a withdrawal into the mountains to
the west would place us in a stronger defen-
sive position and enable us to economize in
troops. I was determined, however, to retain
our gateway into the Tumis plain and ordered
the town to be held at all costs.

While these attacks on Béja and Medjez
were proceeding with varying success the
enemy was finding better fortune in his thrust
on the northernmost road. The first attacks
on our positions west of Jefna, mainly by
Italian troops, were held; but on 2nd March the
offensive was renewed in this sector with five
German battalions, four of them parachutists,
and succeeded in ga:ning several miles. On
the 3rd the enemy captured Sedjenane, some
twelve miles west of Jefna. 46 Division was
obliged to withdraw to a fresh position at Gebel
Tamera, abdut eight miles further west. The
enemy’s advance on the northernmost road,
which had hitherto ‘been of little importance
from the point of view of ground lost by us,
was now becoming more serious as it threatened
Gebel Abiod and the vital lateral road from
there to Béja. 46 Division had been weakened
by continuous losses in men and General Ander-
son therefore reinforced it with 1 Parachute
Brigade and the Corps Franc d’Afrique, a
French volunteer unit. In spite of this rein-
forcement the enemy continued to advance.
After a succession of heavy attacks supported
by dive-bombers Tamera was captured on the
17th and by the 21st we had been forced back
to Gebel Abiod. This was bitter mountain
fighting in miserable weather; the country either
side of the road is high and covered with scrub,
making the deployment of artillery, our main
strength, most difficult.

The Battle of Medenine.

(While the enemy were thus vigorously and
Persistently attacking in the north, Eighth
Army continued to build up gradually in front
of the Mareth line. This famous fortified posi-
tion was inspired by the same military con-
ceptions as produced the Maginot lne in
France, though the Tunisian line was later in
date and incorporated ideas derived from the
earlier and larger fortification. It ran for a
total length of about twenty-two miles on a
course roughly north-east to south-west just in
front of the small town of Mareth from which
it took its name; one flank rested on the sea,
the other on the steep-sided Matmata moun-
tains. At the north-east end the Wadi Zigzaou
runs in front of the line and, artificially
scarped, made a first class anti-tank obstacle.
The defences themselves consisted of a system
of interconnected strong-points, partly under-
ground, reinforced with concrete.* The fire
plan was well conceived to cover all paris of
the front with enfilade fire of all calibres and
the minefields and wire obstacles were thick
and well sited. The mountains shielding the

there was one disadvantage; the bunkers had been
planned for the French 25 and 47 millimetre anti-
tank guns and were too small to house.the German
50 and 75 millimetre pieces which had therefore to
be emplaced in the open.
