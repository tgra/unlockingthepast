be persuaded to provide. The fuel require-
ments of the escort and covering force were to
be met by two oilers sailed under separate escort
to Spitzbergen, and two more with P.Q.18,
transferring with the covering force to Q.P.14.

33. Frequent German air reconnaissance of
Icelandic ports had been reported, so it was
decided to sail the eastbound convoy direct
from Loch Ewe, with a local escort from the
yen Approaches Command until arrival off
iceland.

34. A considerable increase was possible in
the scale of shore-based air co-operation. The
Royal Air Force in Iceland undertook, as far
as the weather would permit, to provide anti-
submarine escort to the convoys as far as 73°
North, ice reconnaissance daily when they were
west of Jan Mayen and fighter protection for
forces in Icelandic ports. Eleven Catalinas
and thirty-two torpedo carrying Hampdens, of
which five were lost on passage, were flown to
North Russia to provide anti-submarine escort
in the eastern end of the Barents Sea and re-
connaissance and a striking force in case the
German heavy ships put to sea. Arrangements

-were also made for P.R.U.* aircraft in in-
creased numbers to reconnoitre the Norwegian
fiords, working from the United Kingdom and
North Russia. Russian promises of anti-
. submarine escort, fighter cover and bombing
attacks on German aerodromes were also made.
An important addition to the air defence was
. the new auxiliary aircraft carrier AVENGER,
equipped with twelve Sea Hurricanes and three
Swordfish, who formed part of the escort of
both convoys.

35. The ANSON (Vice Admiral Second in
Command, Home Fleett), DUKE OF YORK,
JAMAICA and five short endurance destroyers

were moved to Akureyrif. Their radius of,

action was very limited, unless the destroyer
screen was slipped, but they might be of value
if the enemy surface forces unexpectedly
attacked at the western part of the route: it
was hoped too that their absence from Scapa
would deceive the enemy and make him
imagine that a heavy covering force was at sea
as usual. I remained at Scapa in the KING
GEORGE V to be in touch with the latest
intelligence and in ‘general control of the
. operations. . .

36. Additional cover was provided for
Q.P.14 after passing Bear Island by a force of
five cruisers and four destroyers, under Vice
Admiral Commanding, 18th Cruiser Squadron§,
after they had carried stores to the Norwegian
force in Spitzbergen. Endurance would not
permit this force to cover P.Q.18 as well.

Preliminary Movements

.. 37. In order to reduce as far as possible the
duration of the operation for the destroyer
covering force and the escort of P.Q.18, the
convoy was brought from Loch Ewe to the
Denmark Strait by a separate escort from the
Western Approaches Command, the permanent
escort starting from Icelandic ports. It was
necessary to hold three conferences, one at

Loch Ewe for the convoy and others at
Hvalfiord and Seidisfiord for the escort and
covering forces. These were conducted in
succession by Rear Admiral Commanding,
Home Fleet Destroyers.

38. The convoy sailed from Loch Ewe on
2nd September and immediately met foul
weather. It arrived off Skagi on 7th Septem-
ber, thirty-six hours astern of station, and was
there joined by the ocean escort of three
destroyers, four corvettes, two anti-aircraft
ships and four trawlers. Apart from the
weather, and two U-boat.contacts, the passage
so far had been uneventful.

39. The weather improved on 8th September
and the convoy was joined the next morning
by Rear Admiral Commanding, Home Fleet
Destroyers, in the SCYLLA, eight destroyers,
the AVENGER, two Hunt class destroyers to
escort her, three minesweepers and two sub-
marines, all from Seidisfiord. The other eight
destroyers of the covering force were sailed
direct from Akureyri to refuel at Lowe Sound,
Spitzbergen. The oilers OLIGARCH and
BLUE RANGER, escorted by four destroyers,
had sailed from Scapa for Lowe Sound on 3rd
September.

Submarines -

40. Besides the two submarines which
formed part of the close escort, four were dis-
posed off the Northern Lofoten Islands in an
attempt to intercept the German surface ships
if they moved north, and three off the north
coast in the usual covering positions. ‘Che
SCHEER, HIPPER and KOLN moved up
froma Narvik to Altenfiord on 10th September.
They were sighted by all four submarines on
the coastal patrols, TIGRIS, TRIBUNE,
UREDD and P.54 ; but the TIGRIS alone was
close enough to fire torpedoes: her attack was
spoilt by one of the screening destroyers, which
almost rammed her just before she fired, .and
the torpedoes missed astern. After this, the
four inshore submarines were moved up to join
the covering patrol off the north coast.

First Contact

41. The convoy was first sighted by an
enemy aircraft late on 8th September, but was
not shadowed until 12th September. This
immunity was due to clouds and low visibility ;
but it did not unduly disturb the enemy, for
his U-boats were in contact and shadowing
from 10th September onwards. It did, how-
ever, prevent the early and comparatively small
scale air attacks which had been directed
against previous convoys; and thus had the
unexpected and unfortunate result of depriving
the guns and fighters of the practice and experi-
ence which would have helped them to deal
with the first massed attack.

Fuelling

42. The SCYLLA and five of the destroyers
with the convoy parted company north-east of
Jan Mayen Island on 11th September and pro-
The eight ©
destroyers which had been fuelling joined ‘the
convoy early on 13th September, and the force
with Rear Admiral Commanding, Home Fleet -
Destroyers rejoined at noon the same day. The
two oilers and their screen left Lowe Sound
and cruised to the north-westwards to fuel the
