315. Commencing at 0430 hours on D-Day
and continued throughout the daylight hours
during the assault period, a continuous fighter
cover was maintained at nine squadrons
strength over the whole assault area. Of this
force of nine squadrons, six Spitfire squadrons
provided low cover and three Thunderbo!t
squadrons, high cover. Of the six Spitfire
squadrons, one squadron patrolled over each
of the two American beaches with a third squad-
ron on the western flank; two more covered
the length of the three British beaches with one
“squadron on the eastern flank. Of the three
Thunderbolt squadrons maintaining high cover,
one was disposed centrally over the western
area, a second over the eastern area, and the

ird was positioned between the two areas,
but some eight to ten miles inland from the
beach area itself. In this position it was readily
available to reinforce any particular area or to
engage enemy aircraft approaching the beach
from the south, south-east or south-west.

316. The high and low cover fighters operat-
ing over the eastern area were under the control
of F.D.T, 217; the fighters over the western
area, under the control’of F.D.T. 216. The
‘free’ high flying Thunderbolt squadron
operating inland, was also controlled by F.D.T.
217 (see para. 322).

317. The scale of the effort described above
was maintained, whenever weather permitted,
until 13th June, when the force involved was
reduced to three low cover and two high cover
squadrons. All these squadrons operated from
England. In addition, a reserve of two squad-
rons from those by then operating on the
Continent was maintained at readiness for extra
low cover if required. This arrangement con-
tinued, again whenever weather permitted, until
sufficient fighter squadrons had been moved to
the Continent to take over the commitment
(see para. 329).

318. Four squadrons of Lightnings (each of
16 aircraft strength) maintained throughout
the daylight hours a continuous patrol over the
assault forces and the shipping lanes leading to
the beaches. They operated normally at be-
tween three thousand and five thousand feet
or just ‘below cloud base, in four distinct areas,
and all were under the control of. F.D.T. 13
(see para. 322). This cover was maintained
for the first three days, but because of the

, c

lack of enemy reaction it was then reduced to
three squadrons, and finally to two squadrons
on 11th June. Additionally, a reserve of not
less than six squadrons was also available for
reinforcement of any sector requiring it.

319. It was essential to provide adequate
fighter cover over the beach-head and shipping
lanes during the critical periods of first light
and last light. To ensure that sufficient aircraft
could be in the area at these times, twelve
British and twelve American fighter squadrons
were trained to take off and land in darkness.
Thus, with the night fighter operations, fighter
cover was maintained, whenever weather per-
mitted, continuously throughout the twenty-
four hours.

320. Control of Fighter Forces.—I have
already dealt with the activities of fighter air-
craft on offensive patrols and in direct sup-
port, and those of the strike force. The
arrangement for meeting the calls for air sup-
port during the assault were as follows. A
Headquarters ship accompanied each Naval
Assault Force: this ship carried an Air Staff
Officer who was the representative or the Com-
“mander, Advanced A.E.A.F. This officer kept
the Commander, Advanced A.E.A.F., informed
of the Military and Naval Commanders’ in-
tentions and requirements. through naval
channels to Portsmouth and thence to Uxbridge.
These Headquarters ships were equipped for
the control of direct support aircraft and also
to act as stand-by to the Fighter Direction
Tenders (referred to below) for the control of
fighter cover forces. In neither case did the
need for them to exercise direct control of
fighters arise. In addition, each Headquarters
ship received reports in the clear from recon-
naissance aircraft and relayed this information
on targets to Uxbridge. They also provided
liaison when needed (and it was frequently
needed) between the bombarding warships and
their spotting aircraft (see paragraph 207).

321. As stated in paragraph 311, the central
control of both the night and day fighter squad-
rons was exercised by the Combined Control
Centre, Uxbridge, using the static organisation
of A.D.G.B. Three Fighter Direction Tenders
operated as forward controls. One of these
Fighter Direction Tenders was placed in each
of the United States and British sectors and
one in the main shipping lane. This ship later
