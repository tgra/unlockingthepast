            "description": "380. At 1515 hours 25th January I held a conference at Rear Headquarters Westforce near Kulai, The Commanders 3 Indian Corps, Westforce and 11 Indian Division were present. The only matter discussed at this conference was the immediate policy for the conduct of operations. All were agreed that an imme- diate withdrawal from Batu Pahat was neces- sary and that, as a result of this, the other columns should be withdrawn from the line Jemaiuang \u2014 Kluang \u2014 Ayer Hitam.:. I in- - structed the Commander 3 Indian Corps, who was responsible for the whole of these opera- tions, to issue orders accordingly and to co- ordinate the action of the various columns. A copy of the Minutes of this conference are attached as Appendix \u2018\u2018G\u201d\u2019 to this Despatch."

            "description": "617. Up to the 25th January, when we still had possession of the important chain of aerodromes and landing grounds and the lateral road in Central Johore, there was still a hope, though by then only a slender one, that our strategy might be successful. The loss of the Batu Pahat force, however, forced upon us the necessity of withdrawing into the Singapore Fortress area and of concentrating upon its defence. We had then failed in our object of protecting the Naval Base. Our task there- after was to hold the Singapore Fortress area."

On his entry into Tessenei Commander 5th Indian Division was given a letter from the late Italian Civil Governor pointing out that he had left the town practically undamaged and expressing the hope that throughout the campaign both sides would respect civilian property. The repair of the railway line was put in hand immediately and ~ the first train arrived at Kassala, which became trailhead, on 25th January."

            "description": "The first attempt to enlarge the bridgehead position was on 25th January when 3 Division advanced towards Cisterna. This attack was halted by the Hermann Goering Divi- sion after gains of up to two miles. The advance was resumed on the 27th but was again halted well short of its objective; 3 Division was still three: miles from the town and it was evident that a more concentrated and better prepared attack would be necessary. I Division in the meanwhile was endeavouring to push up the main road from Anzio to Albano with Campoleone as its first objective. An attack on the so-called \u2018\u2018 Factory Buildings \" (actually the first buildings of Mussolini\u2019s new town of Aprilia) was successful on the 25th, though it met strong resistance from 3 Panzer Grenadier Division; but we could only advance a mile and a half beyond the \u2018' Factory \u2019\u2019 and it was clear that Campoleone, like Cisterna, could only be taken by a strong and consoli- dated attack. I had returned to the bridge- head on the 25th, after being there on D-day, and as a result of my observations ordered General Clark on the 27th to press the advance with the utmost energy. before the enemy rein- forcements could arrive; they were then suffering considerable delay from our air attacks on communications. I told him I con- sidered that, with the prospect of the balance of 45 Divisiom arriving in the bridgehead shortly, risks must be taken and I suggested that all efforts should now be concentrated on full-scale co-ordinated attacks to capture Cisterna and Campoleone, followed by a rapid advance on Velletri."

On the 23rd January representa- tions were made both to the Dutch naval and military authorities, and to Abdacom, on the inadequacy of the defences in the Palembang area, but no reinforcements were available. It is thought that plans were in hand to strengthen the defences, as General Sir John Laverack, Commanding 1st Australian Corps, visited Palembang about 25th January and indicated that an Australian division might be expected invthe near future. Presumably, owing to the general situation in the Far East, the move was cancelled. ;"

One battalion reached and captured an wunder-feature near Kangaw Village, but was later called off by the Brigade Commander as the feature proved to be completely dominated from the east. Another battalion secured a precarious footing on a small feature further east, and held on despite strong counter-attacks. On the 28th January alone, the enemy fired about 1,000 shells into our restricted positions, using guns of all calibres, including 150-millimetre and 25-pounders, the latter presumably captured in Malaya. evitable, including some divisional troops."

I had already on roth January authorised General Hutton to accept any Chinese troops available. It may be remarked that those I -had origin- ally accepted on 22nd December, the 93 and 49 Divisions, had not by this date yet reached Burma."
