Headquarters to go to Minden. It was still
necessary, however, for a strong liaison staff
to be maintained at Supreme Headquarters and
Rear-Admiral Parry was accordingly made
head of this staff, which was established at
Frankfurt early in June. A.N.G.X.F.’s
Main Headquarters opened at Minden on 15th
June.

EXCHANGE OF MESSAGES ON THE TERMINATION
OF THE SUPREME COMMAND.

The following messages were exchanged on
the termination of the Supreme Command :—

From: Admiral Sir H. M. Burrough,
K.C.B., K.B.E., D.S.O., Allied Naval
Commander - in - Chief, Expeditionary
Force.

To: General of the Armies D. D.
Eisenhower, Supreme Commander,
Allied Expeditionary Force.

Tomorrow, for the first time, the United
States Ensign will not be flown over my Head-
quarters, and the hauling down of “ Old
Glory ’’ tonight will mark the end of one of
the happiest associations in a Combined Com-
mand which has probably ever existed.

2. It is with great and sincere regret that I
myself and the officers and men of the Royal
Navy who have had the privilege of serving
under your inspiring leadership realise that our
association has drawn to a close. For the rest
of our lives we shall remember this association
with great pride in the fine achievements of the
United Team which you have led to Victory
in Europe.

3. On behalf of all my Command, and all
members of the Royal Navy who have had the
privilege of serving under ‘you as Supreme
Commander, I wish you continued success,
lasting good health and happiness in your
future, which we know will be as brilliant as
has been your past.

From: General of the Armies D. D.
Eisenhower.

To: Admiral Sir H. M. Burrough, K.C.B.,
K.B.E., D.S.O.

With warm personal regard and appreciation
and best wishes for your continued success, I
truly appreciate your generous message. While
I have already sent out a general expression of
gratitude to the entire Command, I think it
appropriate to record the deep sense of grati-
fication I have felt towards the Royal Navy
because of the unvarying efficiency, loyalty
and aggressiveness with which its contingents
have served under me during the past three
years. Both in the Mediterranean and in this
theatre I have found nothing among the per-
sonnel of the Royal Navy but cheerful co-
operation and a determination to see the job
through that have made my association with it
one of the truly pleasing experiences of this
whole war. I regret our separation which, for
my part, is a physical one only. In spirit I
shall always remain closely associated with
al ue ements that have worked so effectively
ogether in the tasks assigned us by the Com-
bined Chiefs of Staff. = ¥ =

SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 8 JANUARY, 1948

Combined Command terminates at midnight,
z3th July, 1945, and brings to a close one of
the greatest and most successful campaigns ever
fought.

History alone will judge the Allied Expedi-
tionary Force in its true perspective, but we,
who have worked and struggled together, can
feel nothing but pride in the achievements of
the men we have been honoured to command,
and sadness at having to be parted now. What-
ever history may relate about the exploits of
this Allied Force, and the memory of man is
short and fickle, it is only we, at this time,
who can fully appreciate the merit and due
worth of the accomplishments of this great

‘Allied team.

These accomplishments are not limited to the
defeat of the Nazi hordes in battle—a con-
tinent has been liberated from all that is an
antipathy to the ideal of democracy which is
our common heritage. Above all, we have.
proved to the whole world that’ the British and
American peoples can forever be united in
purpose, in deed and in death for the cause of
liberty.

This great experiment of integrated com-
mand, whose venture was cavilled at by some
and doubted by many, has achieved unqualified
success, and this has only been made possible
by the sympathetic, unselfish and unwavering
support which you and all other commanders
have wholeheartedly given me. Your own
brilliant performance is already a matter of
history.

My gratitude to you is a small token for the
magnificent service which you have rendered,
and my simple expression. of thanks sounds”
totally inadequate. Time and opportunity pro-
hibit the chance I should like to shake you and
your men by the hand, and thank each one of
you personally for all you have done. IJ can
do nothing more than assure you of my lasting
appreciation, which I would ask you to convey
to all those under your command for their
exemplary devotion to duty and for the most
magnificent loyalty which has ever been shown
to a commander.

MESSAGES EXCHANGED BETWEEN A.N.C.X.F.
AND COMNAVEU ON THE DEPARTURE OF THE
Last U.S. NavaL ForcEs FROM THE Euro-
PEAN THEATRE OF OPERATIONS.

From: Allied Naval Commander-in-Chief,
Expeditionary Force.

To: Commander, U.S. Naval Forces in

Europe.

The departure on the gth July of the remain-
ing United States Landing Ships and Craft
from the United Kingdom brings to an end the
largest combined amphibious force that has
yet been assembled. The work of the L.S.T.s
and Landing Craft of both nations during the
assault and subsequent build-up has been one
long record of harmonious co-operation, the
ships of each nation in their turn bearing and
being glad to bear as much of the burden as
their capacity would allow.

Not only have the L.S.T.s carried immense
numbers of vehicles of all sorts and descriptions
but they have also carried large numbers of
men safely across dangerous waters.
