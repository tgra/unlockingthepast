SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 21 AUGUST, 1946

move had become known to the enemy. It was,

however, agreed that informal, staff contatts

should take place through the meditiin "Sf our
service attaches.

Material for these contacts was carefully com-
piled in Cairo in consultation with the Com-
mander-in-Chief, India. - ‘We were prepared to
make a firm offer to send British Forces to
Turkey in the event of a German attack. But
we stressed the importance of being allowed
to build up supplies and stores in advance and
to reconnoitre and improve maintenance facili-
ties in Anatolia.

During the early part of the conversations
the Turks proposed that we should concentrate
in north-western Anatolia; but latterly, with
the rapid German advance in South Russia and
the possibility that the eventual threat might

come from the north-east rather than the north- -

west, the Turkish military authorities were less
averse than I had expected from considering
Eastern Anatolia as the possible theatre of the
German offensive. There was little doubt, how-
ever, that the Turkish statesmen and, to a
lesser degree, the senior Turkish Generals, were
impressed by the rapidity of the German ad-
vance in Russia, and uneasy at our association
with the Soviet in the occupation of Iran.

Although I believe that the Turks are
genuine in their desire to exclude the Germans
from their country and to side with us if the
situation is favourable, I cannot conceal from
myself the possibility of circumstances proving
too strong for them, and I am making my
plans accordingly.

CO-OPERATIVE PLANNING WITH INDIA.

15. The problem of frustrating a German
thrust through Anatolia or the Caucasus or
both can only be. solved by the closest co-
operation between India and the Middle East.
Before General Wavell left the Middle East for
India, we discussed the matter, and it was the
subject of an exchange of views between the
War Office, India and the Middle East. To
facilitate liaison an officer from General Head-
quarters, India, was posted to the Joint Plan-
ning Staff, Middle East, during September,

At a conference at Baghdad on the 26th Sep-
tember, attended by the Commander-in-Chief
India and myself it was agreed that the Joint
Planning Staff should study the problem of
defending Persia, Iraq, Palestine and Syria
against invasion either through Western
Anatolia. or the Caucasus or by both routes. A
planning party visited those countries and at the

ginning of November representatives of the
Middle East Planning Staff went to India to
discuss the Northern Front. Since then planning
has gone forward on the policy agreed to after
the joint review of the problem.

: East AFRICA.

16. In East Africa operations have been very
nearly at a standstill during this period. The
brilliant campaigns of Lieutenant General Sir
Alan Cunningham and Lieutenant General Sir
William Platt during the previous six months
had eliminated all but one centre of resistance,
that in the Gondar area. Owing to the heavy
rains, our troops could not at once attempt the
task of reducing this stronghold. During the
months of July, August, and September, there-
fore, operations were confined to ‘harassing raids
carried out by our Air’ Forces. °

17. Owi ont the complete success of earlier
operatiof§,*HSsHeHat" Wavell Hid been'“able to

withdraw three divisions which had ‘been
operating in this theatre. By the, beginning
of July the xst South African and the 4th
Indianl Divisions had been withdrawn, and
the last brigade of the 5th Indian Division had
received orders to move. I carried on my
predecessor's policy of withdrawing every unit
that it was possible to release. Finally, there
remained only the rith and r2th African
Divisions to carry out all the nec internal
security duties in this vast stretch of territory,
as well as to contain the Italian forces in the
Gondar area until these could be finally
liquidated, and also to enforce the landward
blockade of French Somaliland.

118. The administration of the conquered
territories presented a large number of prob-
Jems, which were ably handled by Major-
General Sir Philip Mitchell, Chief Political
Officer, who on the 27th June had become
British Represéntative in Ethiopia. On the
first of Au, by formal Proclamation I dele-
gated to him the full legislative, judicial, ad-
ministrative and financial authority which I
exercised in Eritrea and Somalia, and an
Administrative Instruction of the Secretary
of State for War entrusted to him supervisory
powers over the Military Governor of Britisk

land. Although it was impossible in
international law for me to divest myself of
the authority which I held by right of con-
quest in Somaliland and Eritrea, by the
Proclamation I was in fact released from all
but ultimate responsibility.

On the many problems involved in organising
and directing the administrations in the con-
quered territories it is unmecessary for me to
enlarge. Let it suffice to say that Sir Philip
Mitchell lost no time and spared no effort in
handling these problems with the energy and
discretion they demanded. The achievements
of Sir Philip and’ his assistants were re-
markable, especially as. officers and_ police

were scarce and communications difficult.

‘Although it was far from complete when I

relinquished command of the areas, much pro-
gress had been made in the task of pacification.

1g. From both political and military stand-
points the problem of French Somaliland was
pressing and difficult. This territory, which is
controlled iby a Government committed to col-
laboration with the enemy, adjoins the Straits
of Bab el Mandeb and is therefore a potential
base for hostile naval operations against us in
the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Yet to
reduce it by force might well lead to the
destruction of the port of Jibuti and the rail-
way to Addis Ababa, making the evacuation
of the numerous Italian ‘civilians interned in
the Addis Ababa area difficult, if not impos-
sible. The evacuation of these Italians, for
some time past the subject of negotiations with
the Italian Government, was essential. Their
continued presence constituted a menace to ©
internal seourity in that they might escape; a
military liability, in that they must be pro-
tected from the possible vengeance of the
Ethiopians; and a political stumbling-block in
that their protection involved a measure of
interference in Ethiopian affairs which filled the
Emperor and his subjects with suspicion and
Tesentment. . Sa
