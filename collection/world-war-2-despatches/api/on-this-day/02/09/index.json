            "description": "34. The enemy cut the Ngakyedauk Pass and closely invested these boxes. One Japanese battalion also crossed by the Maunghnama Pass further north and began to harass 15 Indian Corps Headquarters and the rear of 5 Indian Division from a position in the hills on the east of the road. But they made no further headway, although on the 9th February the situation in 7 Indian Division's defended area (Sinzweya) was difficult and continued so for several days. 26 Indian Division, which had been moved up to Bawli Bazaar by 15 Indian Corps, now began to make its presence felt, but it was evident that its operations, in conjunction with those of 5 Indian Division from the west to clear the Ngakyedauk Pass, would take time."

This brigade, on orders from the Commander Western area, had modified its dispositions to guard against the threat to its left rear. At about 1930 hrs. the enemy attacked on a front between the Causeway and the River Kranji. Again a large number of his landing craft were knocked out by artillery and machine gun fire but again he succeeded in getting a footing. Fighting went on in this area until midnight."

Air forces operating in tactical support of the Allied Land Forces in Burma comprised Nos. 221 and 224 Groups R.A.F. and 10th U.S.A.A.F. all under the command of Headquarters, Eastern Air Command. Each worked in close association with a corresponding army headquarters the Tenth U.S.A.A.F. with the Northern Combat Area Command, 224 Group with 15 Corps and 221 Group with 33 Corps and 4 Corps, and finally from the beginning of December onwards with the Fourteenth Army. 221 Group and Fourteenth Army remained together at Imphal only until the end of December, when the latter moved forward to Kalemyo, being accompanied by the A.O.C. and his air staff.\" The two headquarters were again united fully at Monywa from 9th February until the middle of April, when they moved to Meiktila, their final staging post before Rangoon. The mobility of 221 Group headquarters had a less active counterpart in that of 224 Group, which remained with the headquarters of 15 Corps first at Cox's Bazar and later at Akyab. In both cases the close relationship of the headquarters of the two Services was an essential element in their successful co-operation."

            "description": "On the 9th February, the hitherto uncompleted section of the British four-inch pipeline between Chittagong and Chandranathpur began pumping, thus giving a continuous flow to Manipur Road. This pipeline was by the 2nd March extended to Imphal, and storage tanks to deal with a flow of three and a half million gallons per month had been constructed there. The opening of this pipeline eased the strain on the road transport a great deal, as hitherfo all the petrol for Imphal, including very large Air Force requirements, had had to be brought from Manipur Road by motor transport. Later this pipeline was extended beyond Imphal to Moreh, thus bridging an exceptionally bad sector of hill road from Palel. The supply onward was by road tanker to Kalewa, by I.W.T. from Kalewa to Myingyan and from Myingyan forward by road and rail."

            "date": "9th February",
            "description": "199. It will be recalled (vide paragraph 185) that, by the 9th February, 2 Brigade of 82 (West African) Division had nearly reached Kangaw, while 1 and 4 Brigades were en route from Hpontha to Kyweguseik to intercept the Japanese forces withdrawing from Kangaw. 82 (West African) Division (less 2 Brigade) was now directed to advance on An with possible speed, leaving a detachment to mask Kyweguseik, which was found to be strongly held. Maintenance would be by air, since they would be going through some of the thickest and most mountainous country in the whole of Arakan. While 82 (West African) Division was continuing its difficult approach march towards An, 53 Brigade (25 Indian Division) was to make yet another landing, this time at RuYwa, a village some 14 miles due west of An. 2 (West African) Brigade, from Kangaw, was then to pass through this bridgehead and advance on An from the south-west, thus forming the southern arm of the pincer movement against this village, the northern arm being formed by the other two brigades of 82 (West African) Division. After 2 (West African) Brigade had passed through the bridgehead, 74 Brigade of 25 Indian Division was to land and, advancing north up the coast, capture Tamandu, a village three miles east of the enemy's inland water transport base of Kantaunggyi, and the western terminus of the road to An. 25 Indian Division was also directed to find a small pursuit force to follow up its success at Kangaw, which was to press rapidly south, through Kyweguseik, on to Tamandu from the north. This secondary pincer movement was designed to destroy fhe large body of enemy troops known to have been virtually trapped in that area."

            "description": "201. On the 16th February, naval forces, commanded by Captain D. C. Hill, R.N., landed 53 Brigade at Ru-Ywa against slight opposition. Enemy gunfire from the Tamandu area was dealt with by the NARBADA and JUMNA. This initial success, and the subsequent build-up, were largely due to audacious minor operations carried out during the three nights preceding the landing. Detailed reconnaissance by 3 Commando Brigade of the mangrove swamps west of Ru-Ywa revealed an unoccupied island four miles from the proposed bridgehead. A battery of medium artillery was unobtrusively transported to it by naval landing craft, a light airstrip was constructed, and supplies dumped. The enemy never succeeded in locating this battery and its support proved invaluable. The Japanese made a determined attack on the bridgehead on the 19th February,"

            "description": "100. On the Northern Combat Area Command front 36 British Division (less 29 Brigade), advancing on Mongmit from the north, effected a strongly opposed crossing of the Shweli River during the first week of February. The first attempt failed, but the second one, made with increased air support, was successful near the bend of the river north of Myitson. Myitson fell on the 9th February and the advance continued against stiff resistance. On the 17th, the enemy counterattacked in strength, using flame-throwers and rouch artillery. They succeeded in penetrating our forward positions, but were ejected by a Spirited attack by an Indian battalion after bitter hand-to-hand fighting. Our further progress towards Mongmit continued to meet with determined resistance. 29 Brigade, advancing on Mongmit from the west, captured Nabu on the 18th February and, by the end of the month, had reached a point approximately half way between Nabu and Mongmit, Further east, 50 Chinese Division entered Namtu on the 23rd February, capturing eleven locomotives and a quantity of tolling stock. Further east again, 30 Chinese Division captured Hsenwi on the night 18th  19th February against light opposition. This village lies on the Burma Road about 30 miles north-east of Lashio. The enemy in this sector appeared to be falling back to positions immediately north of Lashio, with a view to defending that town."

Forward elements of 82 (West African) Division were now in contact with the enemy from Zibingyi to Hipontha, 20 miles north of Kangaw. Here the Divisional Commander divided his forces, pushing south from Hpontha on the 3rd February. 1 and 4 Brigades were directed on Kyweguseik in order to intercept the Japanese forces withdrawing from Kangaw. I will deal later with this phase of the operations. 2 (West African) Brigade pushed south on to the Kangaw block, overcoming considerable opposition. As already recorded, they passed under command of 25 Indian Division on the 9th February, when - within nine miles of Kangaw. By the 14th February, they were driving the enemy from the high ground north of the road; and the junction of the two geographical divisions of the Arakan campaign had been effected."
