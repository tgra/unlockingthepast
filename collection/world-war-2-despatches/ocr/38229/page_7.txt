SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948

damage or more to the enemy than the Hurri-
cane []_—especially as the air battle usually
took place at medium altitude heights below
19,000 feet.

61. As regards bombers, the Blenheim with
its power-operated turret gave a good account
of itself against enemy fighters—only on one
occasion was a Blenheim known to be shot
down by enemy fighters. Thus, however, was
mostly due to the provision of fighter escort to
bombing raids or careful routeing which would
give the bomber formation the best chance of
avoiding enemy fighter interception.

62. Conclusion.—To sum up on equipment,
fighter for fighter we were superior and it was
only when heavily outnumbered, and without
warning and proper airfield facilities, that the
enemy were able to get a decision. Their
bombers were ‘‘ easy meat ’’ for our fighters if
interception took place, while our bombers were
satisfactory for their task,- though light on range
and much inferior to the enemy in bomb lift
and numbers.

Part, IJ]—Tue Arr SuPERIORITY BATTLE OVER
Rancoon.

63. Situation.—From the initial attack
carried out by the Japanese air force on the
23rd December against Rangoon and the second
attack which followed 48 hours afterwards, in
which the bomber formation on both occasions
numbered between 7o and 80, «with escort of
some 30 fighters, 1t was obvious to me that I
had against me at close range a Japanese air
force of about 150 plus. A severe set back had
been inflicted on the enemy in these two attacks
by the P.40’s of the A.V.G. and the Buffaloes
of 67 Squadron and not less than 36 enemy
first-line bombers and fighters were claimed as
destroyed on these two days. The situation,
therefore, that faced me on my arrival on Ist
January was that I must with my small but
growing fighter force defend the base facilities
at Rangoon, the docks, the convoys arriving
and departing and the air bases at Mingaladon
and Zayatkwin. If these could be preserved
from a damaging scale of day bombing attack,
we should be enabled to secure our interests
hereabouts and to get m our land and aur rein-
forcements and maintenance. Additionally, I
should have to be prepared to aid the Army in
any operations they undertook with both fighter
and bombing actioa.

64. Plan.—Thus my general plan was to
keep my fighter force concentrated in the
Rangoon area, to accept such enemy bombing
attacks as might be made on any other objec-
tives in Northern Burma, to fight the enemy in
the defence of the base and lean forward to hit
the enemy wherever and whenever I could with
my small but total force.

65. To achieve this, against a numerically
superior and constantly growmg air force, {
must do all I could to reduce the scale of: air
attack on the Rangoon area, yet still be able to
meet attacks on the bases in sufficient force to
inflict a high casualty rate proportional to the
scale of attack—this. making’ such attacks in
this area abortive and wasteful for the enemy.

66. Reduction of .the scale of attack.—To
reduce the scale of attack I therefore com-
menced to lean forward with a portion of my
fighters, and by using advanced aur bases like
Moulmein, Tavoy and Mergui to attack enemy

1719

aircraft wherever found. Further to weaken
him I must spread my bombing action in day-
light to widely dispersed but important objec-
tives such as Chiengmai, Mehohngsohn and
Chiengrai in the North and in the South his
aerodrome and railway communication system
running down the Eastern coast of the Malaya
Penmsula from Bangkok to Singora. As
Singora was a main base for Japanese opera-
tions in Malaya this action was especially
favourable. Thus I hoped to make him disperse
his fighters by forcing protection for these
widely separated points and so weaken him in
the central sector opposite Rangoon. I gave
instructions accordingly on 2nd January.

67. Offensive Fighter and Bomber action.—
Such enemy airfields as Chiengmai, Mehohng-
sohn, Lampang, Rahong, Mesoht, Prachuab
Ginkhan, Jumbhorn and Kanchanburi were
searched and attacked if enemy aircraft were
present. Later when in enemy hands Moul-
mein, Mingaladon and Highland’ Queen were
attacked and loss inflicted on the enemy.
Hangars, M.T., launches, enemy troops and
trains were also ‘attacked.

68. Results—Attacks in pursuance of this
policy during the campaign resulted in the
P.40’s and Hurricanes and Buffaloes claiming
58 enemy bombers and fighters destroyed on
the ground. In addition, a large number were
damaged but could not be computed. Further-
more, attacks by bombers taking part in the
air superiority battle also accounted for a con-
siderable number. Such, however, is the diffi-
culty of assessing results by bomber attack
that no claims were made; but from the strike
of the bomb lift and its position either amongst
or close to enemy aircraft concentrations on
the ground, further considerable losses must
have been inflicted on enemy first-line aircraft.

69. This was a handsome contribution .to-
wards the air superiority battle in Burma and
reduced the scale of air attack against Rangoon
and our troops.

70. But this form of action was later reduced
in effort, since General Chennault at this time
was not anxious to undertake offensive opera-
tions with the P.4o’s against ground targets
on account of the shortage of equipment. The
Buffalo Squadron was reduced to two or three
serviceable aircraft with engines too worn out
to permit of flying far over jungle country.
The Hurricanes with an effective range of 135
miles were unable to reach anything but the
closest enemy objectives. .

The Air Battle. :

Ae
71. The air battle over Rangoon lasted from
23rd December, 1941, until 25th February
1942. The weight of enemy attack was directed
intermittently against air bases at Rangoon with
the object of destroying our growing fighter
force and achieving air superiority over
Rangoon to the point where it would be
possible for him to undertake unrestricted day
bombing operations on a destructive scale.

72. During this period of about 8 weeks, 31
day and night attacks were made—one in great
weight. After sustaining serious losses—38
claimed destroyed—in the first 3 attacks
termmating on the 4th January, the enemy
resorted to night bombing, his scale of effort
varying between 1 or 2 heavy bombers up to
16. '
