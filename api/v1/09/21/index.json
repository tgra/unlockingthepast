            "description": "2. In the previous despatch the advance of the Italians to Sidi Barrani was described. In accordance with our pre-arranged policy, little opposition had been offered to the enemy’s advance, and it was not proposed to oppose him in s' ch until he reached our prepared defences at Mersa Matruh. It was not, however, intended that the defence should be a passive one. On the 21st September I had issued orders for a counter-stroke to be prepared against the enemy, so soon as he became engaged with the defences of Matruh. I found that General Wilson, Commander of British Troops in Egypt, and General O’Connor, Commanding the Western Desert Force, had already made the preliminary arrangements for such a counter-stroke. During the next month, as our defences and our forces grew in strength, so the plan for the counter-stroke was developed; and a scheme was eventually prepared for striking at the enemy as he approached Matruh. This plan was studied in detail by the commanders",

To give all X-craft ample time to reach their objective, and to guard against loss of surprise through one X-craft attacking before the remainder, X-craft were forbidden by their orders to attack before or00Z, 22nd September, but were free to do so at any time after that, setting their charges in accordance with the firing rules table given in the operation orders. As all X-craft Commanding Officers had agreed between themselves not to set their charges to fire in the 0400-0500 firing period, it was expected that they would carry out their attacks somewhere between 0500 and o800Z, laying their charges set to fire about 0830Z on 22nd September, by which time it was hoped that they would have been able to withdraw from the area.",

            "description": "21st September, General Leese said he considered the fighting to have been as bitter as at Alamein and Cassino. The German artillery fire was very heavy and well-directed and the many counter-attacks were made in considerable strength; one village changed hands ten times. Eighth Army claimed to have “ severely mauled eleven German divisions and taken over eight thousand prisoners. The cost was over fourteen thousand casualties, of which over seven thousand in British infantry units, and two hundred and ten tanks lost. The tanks were easily replaceable, but the men were not and I was forced to take very unwelcome measures to keep up the strength of formations. x British Armoured Division, which had played a distinguished part in so many battles in Africa, was to be disbanded in less than three months after its arrival in Italy. A brigade of 56 Division was be reduced to a cadre basis. Finally, all United Kingdom infantry battalions were to be reorganised at once on the basis of three rifle companies.* Yet, although the price had been heavy, no one in Eighth Army doubted that a real victory had been gained, for it was confidently expected that, after breaking into the flat country of the Romagna, we should be able to exploit rapidly to the Po. It was not long, however, before, as the Eighth Army historian puts it, ‘‘ the tactical implications of the local agricultural methods were realized ’’ and the continuous water lines were found to be more serious obstacles than the mountains.",

By the 25th the enemy was generally back behind the Usa but not in very good order and advances were made all along the Army front. In the plains we had cleared the whole eastern bank of the Fiumicino by 29th September but the enemy was still holding out in the foothills south of Route 9 when the rain descended with great violence for four successive days. All the fords over the Marecchia and Uso became impassable and the approaches to the bridges, necessarily more congested, were in very bad condition; the Fiumicino, normally a shallow trickle, swelled to a width of thirty feet and its speed and depth made it impossible for infantry patrols to cross. Going off the roads became quite impossible. The enemy took heart from this to maintain a steadfast resistance and it was not until 5th October that the",
