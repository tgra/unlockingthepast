New: Zealand: dire t  froin Servic  Flying Training  Schools, and who  ther fore lacked operational training,

(2) To convert  p rsonnel 6f No. 36 and No. 100 (T.B.) Squadrons from Vildebeestes to twin-engine aircraft in anticipation of their re-equipment with Beauforts.

(c) To train pilots from New Z aland on  twin-engine aircraft to fill vacancies in  Bomber Squadrons.

Training aircraft were provided. from Wirraways thrown up by No. 2x (F) Squadron when it  re-armed with Buffaloes, and by Blenheims  borrowed from No. 34 (B) Squadron. The Wing Commander Training at A.H.Q. (Wing Commander Wills-Sandford) . was appointed Commanding Officer. The Unit had to be disbanded on 8th December, on the outbreak of hostilities, but it had completed most valuable work.

Lack of Armament Training Facilities,  

70. Up till October 1941, the only armament training facilities in the Command were on Singapore Island, and at an improvised air range near Penang. Maximum use was made of the Singapore ranges, but they were very insufficient to meet requirements. In October 1941, the new Command Armament Training Station at Kuantan was opened, but there was time for one squadron only to comple) a cours  before  the outbreak of war.

qi. The air firing situation was * particularly unsatisfactory. There was an acute shortage of target towing aircraft, and the few available were slow.  . an

Lack of Transport and Communication Aircraft.

72. The lack of transport and communication aircraft was acutely felt during the pre-war period when training  was all important. G.H.Q. and  H.Q:M.C, had, frequently to ask for communication flights, aircraft  for,, which had necessarily  to be found, mainly by G.R. Squadrons. Although such requests were pruned- and co-ordinated, flights were nevertheless sufficiently frequent to interfere seriously with the training of squadrons, many of whose Vital flying  hours were thus expended. Furthermore, visits to sub rdinate units by AHO: staff had to be consspendingly curtailed,

F ighter Squadrons,

73. In  June-July r94t a Fighter, Bron Operational Cadre was formed to take-over the training and operation of all fighter  aircraft in Singapore: the Senior Officer (Group Captain E.. B. Rice) at the same time being appointed Air Defence Co-ordinator, Malaya. ,

- 94. The following -Fighter Squadrons, with ah establishment  of -16 LE. and 8 IR. Buffaloes, were formed on th  dates shown:

 No. 243  ( ) a formed in April, : 194I. Personnel were found as in the case of No. 67 Squadron, but a slightly higher proportion were F.T.S. personnel,

No. 453 (F) Squadron, formed October

1941. The Squadron and two Flight Commanders were appointed from U.K. This was an R.A.F.   infiltration   squadron* filled from F.T.S's in Australia. Some of the personnel were not entirely suitable for a Fighter Squadron, and the Squadron  Commander was in Australia selecting replacements when war broke out. _ No! 488 (F) Squadron, formed in OctoberNovember 1941. The Squadron and two Flight Commanders came from U.K. This was-an R.N.Z.A.F. infiltration squadron and was filled from F.T.S's in New Zealand with excellent material; but their standard of flying on arrival was backward. This squadron had taken over the aircraft on which No. 67 (F) Squadron had trained, and many of these were in poor condition.

No. 21 (F) Squadron, R.A.A.F., which had formed as a General Purpose Squadron in Australia and moved into the Command in 1940, was in October 1941 re-equipped with Buffaloes and converted into a Fighter ~ Squadron, with 12 I.E. and 6 LR. aircraft. The Squadron had been  previously equipped with 2-seater Wirraways, some of which were  returned to Australia, the remainder  being retained to assist in training Nos. 453 (F) and 488 (F) Squadrons.  It will be observed, therefore, that the pilots of this squadron had not been selected originally for- fighter aircraft, and some were not in fact entirely  suitable for this roe. 2. *

75. The main role  of the Buffalo Squadrons was  day defence  only,. primarily of the Singapore area, but night flying training was instituted to ensure that pilots could, take off before dawn and Jand after nightfall. ;

76. Except for No. 488 (F} Squadron all the above squadrons were considered operationally tramed.by the outbreak of war. No. 488 (F) Squadron was deficient in squadron and flight training and was not passed as operationally ready until the latter-half of December I94I. Training and assessment. of operational readiness had, however, been- based on an under-estiniation of the eriemy. The tactics thus taught and practised prov d -unsuitabl  and costly, against the Japanege- Navy  ow fighter, .which was greatly superior  to the Buffalo. performance. Mor over, ..advanced training hdd suffered because, prior, to the formation of an O.T.U in  September . 1941 (se . para. 69), alk pilots had joined.
