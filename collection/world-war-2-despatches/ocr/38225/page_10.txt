#5098 SUPPLEMENT To THE

at 0845 and DEVONSHIRE proceeded to the
South to jom HERMIONE off the entrance to
the harbour about rooo.

47. Consideration had to be given to the em-
ployment and subsequent recovery of the
Walrus aircraft It was most desirable to use
my own observer for the bombardment and it
was most undesirable to leave the Walrus on
the catapult when the ship went into action.
After an exchange of signals with the Rear-
Admiral Aircraft Carriers and ILLUSTRIOUS
it was decided to catapult the Walrus before
opening fire and land it in Ambararata Bay
where it could run up on the beach and remain
until an opportunity offered for its recovery in
calm water. The weather on the Eastern side
of the island was consistently unfavourable for
a recovery at sea. - While ashore the crew were
joined by other Fleet Air Arm personnel from
force landed aircraft and communication was
maintained by W/T. .

48. DEVONSHIRE arrived in position 10
miles East of Oranjia Point by rooo to find
HERMIONE in action with the coast defences.
She informed me that the Headquarters of the
2gth Independent Brigade had asked for a
general strafe of the peninsula, that No. 1
battery was not firing but that a new battery
had opened up and that the maximum range
was 18,000 yards.

49. HERMIONE was getting very short of
suitable ammunition for bombardment and
DEVONSHIRE had none to waste. I knew
that the centre of resistance was South of
Antsirane and it seemed probable that the
Oranjia Peninsula would capitulate as soon as
Antsirane fell. In the circumstances it appeared
undesirable to damage the batteries unless they
came into action against our own troops ad-
vancing towards the Oranjia Peninsula, since
we would require these batteries for the defence
of the port as soon as it passed into our
possession.

50. Arrangements were made therefore for
one cruiser to maintain her position within
range and in readiness for instant action while
the other stood off to seaward. The area of
operations was limited and made the ships an
easy target for submarine attack unless a high
speed and zigzag were maintained: HERMIONE
had already spent over 24 hours in the area so
the extent of the “‘ pitch ’’ would be obvious
to the submarine. Four ships of the 14th Mines
sweeping Flotilla who were waiting off the
entrance {9 siveep the passage in were instructed
to carry out an A/S sweep of the area.

51. DEVONSHIRE carried out registration
shoots between 1125 and 1300 on Nog, 1 and 2
* batteries, Mamelon Vert and the new position
reported by HERMIONE. The object was to
exercise the gunnery control team in prepara-
tion for more serious work later if called for.
It was found that accurate indirect fire was
impossible in the weather conditions and with
the speed and zigzag in use, mainly owing to
the wander of the gyro compass. With the sun
high in the sky visibility deteriorated in the
target area and made direct fire impossible. It
was decided that if a call for fire came, the

firing would be carried out at slow speed and .

on as straight a course as enemy opposition
would permit. Two conspicuous trees at
Mamelon Vert which had been used as aiming
marks on this occasion were subsequently cut
down by the French. .

LONDON GAZETTE, 4 MARCH, 1948

52. HERMIONE took over between 1300
and 1600, after which DEVONSHIRE tvok
over until dark. The Walrus landed at 1345
after which air observation was maintained by
Swordfish, from ILLUSTRIOUS until 1700.

” 53. Dunng the afternoon dispositions were
made for the night, and the Senior Officer, 14th
Minesweeping Flotilla, was mstructed to_remain
North af a line 115° from Cape Amber during
dark hours in order to avoid any possibility
of a clash between friendly forces during the
night. At 31720 HERMIONE took station
astern and as darkness fell the two cruisers,
withdrew to the Eastward.

54. At 1754 your signal stating that a-
destroyer with 50 Marines would be proceed-
ing into Diego Suarez was received from
HERMIONE. This signal had been missed in
DEVONSHIRE and was only discovered by
chance, but fortunately both cruisers were ina
position to give support when required. At
I749 your amplifying signal was received
ordering cruisers to support ANTHONY in any
way possible. An effort to inform ANTHONY
of my intentions, without giving anything
away or causing her to answer on W/T, failed.

55. ANTHONY was due to enter the pass
at 2010. It was planned to be in a position
five miles og0° from Oranjia Light House at
that time and to bombard the searchlights
when they were switched on. A strong Westerly
set was experienced, and a tum of 360° had
to be made in order not to be early. It was
obviously imperative that the cruisers should
not be sighted until ANTHONY was in, for

otherwise the whole ‘‘ game ’’ would be given
away.

56. At 1957 a position 080° 64 miles from the
lighthouse was reached, and course was altered
to starboard to 347°. At 2008 course was
altered to 257° and when HERMIONE was
round, to 167°, The idea was to have at least
one of the cruisers with guns bearing all the
time. At 2023, while still on the Southerly
course, a searchlight on Oranjia Point was
switched on across the entrance, and an object
was seen in the beam which might have been
ANTHONY so fire was immediately cpened
with 4 gun salvos of 8 inch. With the arrival
of. the second salvo the searchlight went out
and was not seen again.

57. DEVONSHIRE and HERMIONE con-
tinued to patrol across the entrance until 2050
but nothing more was seen. At this time
ANTHONY’s future movements were not
known and it was thought possible that she
might go round into English Bay under cover
of Andrakaka which was in our hands. Course
was altered to seaward for a short time, but
at 2209 gunflashes and tracer were sighted
which were presumed to be ANTHONY fight-
ing her way out, . Fire could not be opened,
for there was not point of aim, and the pos-
sibility of damaging ANTHONY could not be
accepted. At 2128 ANTHONY’s report that
she was clear was received, so DEVONSHIRE
altered course to the Eastward and later to the
South East. At o130 course was altered to
320° to close the entrance at dawn.

Thursday, 7th May.

58. Your intentions to bombard Oranjia
Peninsula were received at 0415. I therefore
continued to the North Westward to join your
