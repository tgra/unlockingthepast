SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 22 JANUARY, 1948

These under-estimates were not attributable
solely to errors on the part of F.E.C.B., but
also to those of other bodies, including my own
General Headquarters.

Japanese Army Tactics and Training. 3!
135. With regard to tactics, in general the
Japanese endeavoured to infiltrate or outflank.
fhey made use of certain novelties such as:—
(a) A type of light infantry screen acting
in advance of their main body. The men
were very lightly clad, had but little
equipment and were armed with a light auto-
matic weapon, the calibre of which was some-
thing under 0.3; they carried only about forty
rounds of ammunition and a few hand
grenades. These light infantry parties used
to work individually, would get round to the
tear of our advance troops, and resorted to
such expedients as climbing trees from which
to fire their automatic or throw hand gren-
ades. Our men frequently mistook these
light troops for Malays or Chinese, but it is
doubtful if the Japanese soldiers were de-
liberately disguised as Malayan natives;

(b) The use of noise, including Chinese’

crackers and strange cries at night; these
tricks, though laughable when one knew
about them, had a certain amount of moral
effect, especially on young Indian troops at
the commencement of the campaign; and

(ce) Inflatable rubber belts to enable men
to ctoss creeks and small rivers.

To combat these tactics the General Officer
Commanding, Malaya, stressed the import-
ance of discipline and steadiness, the necessity
for alertness and cunning on the part of the
individual, and that the way to defeat the
enemy was to attack or counter-attack him on
every possible occasion, ‘‘ Essentially war of
movement and attack, and too much digging
creates defence complex.”

136. An anti-white campaign had started in
Japan in 1936, and it was evident that for long
before the commencement of the war the spirit
of hatred of Europeans, particularly the British,
had constantly been inculcated into the Japan-
ese soldiers. They appear to have been taught
that the killing of Europeans by any method
was a patriotic action.

It is possible that had we adopted the same
course some men might have fought harder at
the start, but it is difficult to inculcate the spirit
of hatred into the Englishman. This is partly
due to his peculiar faculty of seeing a jest in
the most depressing circumstances, and partly
to the fact that hatred is ultimately based on
fear, which is not a natural characteristic of
our race.

Factors affecting Morale of our Forces.

137. The majority of the Indian regiments
laboured under some disability on account of
the inexperience of most of their British officers.
As a rule, there would be two or three senior
officers, with fifteen or more years’ experience,
then a gap until we came to officers who had
joined after September, 1939. Somewhere about
half these officers had experience in India and
could talk the language, but having only from
one to two and a half years’ service they did
not carry the weight which more experienced
officers would have done.

In both British and Indian units there was
only a small leaven of war-experienced officers

565

and men, and it was under these conditions that
young soldiers had to meet the first shock of
the Japanese attack.

138. A factor which had some effect on morale
generally was that, strategically, we were on the
defensive; everyone knew that it was to our in-
terests to avoid war with Japan, which meant
that the initiative and especially choice of
moment for opening hostilities rested with them.

As stated above, the Matador plan provided
for a tactical offensive, provided: adequate
warning could be obtained. As events turned
out, the execution of Matador was impractic-
able, and later events confirmed that the deci-
sion not to carry out this operation was correct.

Then, owing to the comparative weakness of
our forces in Malaya we could neither afford
heavy losses up North nor send up there more
than limited reinforcements, because of the
necessity for retaining a force to defend
Southern Johore and in the last resort the
island of Singapore itself. This was not the
result of a sort of fortress-complex, but because
the essential factor was preservation of the
repair and other facilities in the Naval Base.
The opinion held in London on this point was
made perfectly clear in the latter part of
December when the Chiefs of Staff telegraphed :
‘His Majesty’s Government agree your
conception that vital issue is to ensure security
of Singapore Naval-Base. They emphasise
that no other consideration must compete with
this.”

Holding Northern Malaya was not an end in
itself; it was with reference to the Naval Base
that Northern Malaya acquired its importance.
This meant that Commanders in the North had
to bear in mind the possibility of withdrawal in
the face of superior forces, their action—at any
rate until Johore was reached—being mainly a
delaying one to gain time for the arrival of re-
inforcements from overseas. This applied par-
ticularly to the Kelantan area, and to a lesser
extent, to Kuantan, since in both cases (as
stated in para. 12 above) the line of communi-
cation was a single one and vulnerable to air
bombing.

139. It is easy to talk of the lack of an offen-
sive spirit and of a ‘‘ retreat complex,’’ but
under the conditions described above with-
drawals from the North were necessary; and
the adverse effect induced by having to carry
out a continuous retreat over some hundreds of
miles starting from the early days of the cam-
paign must be attributed to the general situa-
tion rather than to any fault in the original
morale of the troops themselves.

It is possible however, that the need for
offensive action even during a retreat had not
been so stressed during the training of officers
and men as to become a second nature. For
instance, there appeared to be a tendency to
use reserves for supporting a weak portion of
a defensive position rather than retaining them
at all costs for bringing about a counter-attack.
Again, up to the time I handed over command,
there was a tendency to use the Independent
Company in Malaya as a reinforcement and
not to carry out the functions for which it was
specially intended. Further, officers and men
must be taught that occasions will arise when
some parties have got to hold on to the last
man, even though the main body of the force
may be moving back.
