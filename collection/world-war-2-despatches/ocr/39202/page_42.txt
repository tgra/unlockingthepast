of the change was to give the former R.AF.
Element of Photographic Reconnaissance
Force more mobility as a wing which could
be moved forward as required for operational
purposes.

313. Throughout the campaign in Burma,
Headquarters 230 Group thad been charged
with the control of all maintenance and stor-
age units in the area of Headquarters, R.AF.,
Burma, but the Group itself was under the
direct control of the C.M.O., Headquarters,
Base Air Forces. This arrangement was un-
satisfactory because it meant that the R.AF.
operational commander in Burma did not
have complete control of this maintenance
organisation. It was therefore decided to dis-
band No. 230 Group and to absorb the Main-
uanee Staff of the Group into Headquarters,

Burma, with effect from 15th May,
bas “The units tnder No. 230 Group were,
at the same time, placed directly under the
operational groups they served, and the staffs
of these groups were increased to cope with
this commitment by the addition of some of
the posts thrown up from the disbandment
of No. 230 Group.

Withdrawal of 224 Group in Preparation for
“ Zipper”.

514. The main assault on Malaya, scheduled
for early September, made necessary the with-
drawal of No. 224 Group and units from the
Arakan and Burma.

515. This was started early.in May. The
withdrawal was handled directly between Head-
quarters, R.A.F., Burma, and Headquarters,
Base Air Forces. As from Ist June, 1945,
H.Q. 224 Group was placed directly under the
control of H.Q. Base Air Forces for the pur-

pose of mounting operation “Zipper”, but
the A.O.C. 224 Group and his staff retained
the right to visit all units during mounting
and to advise on all matters concerning the

* training of units for their various tasks. Head-
quarters 224 Group undertook the responsi-
bility for force planning.

516. It was decidedly unfortunate, if not
serious, that owing to the acute shortage of
shipping, the withdrawal of units from Burma
did not go off as smoothly as might have
been expected. Many of the units, indeed.
came out of the Arakan with no equipment
or M.T., while the equipment and M.T. of
other units which arrived in India lay on
the docks awaiting the arrival of the units
for many weeks, When units ultimately reached
India they were deployed on airfields which
had been prepared for them, but owing to the
non-arrival of equipment or personnel, the
commencement of training was badly delayed.

Re-organisation of Air Command in 1945-46.

517. In view of the extension of the respon-
sibilities of Air Command, South East Asia,
towards Singapore and beyond, the future
organisation of formations- in the Command
required consideration.

518. The principal factors which necessi-
tated reorganisation were as follows :—

(@) Mopping up operations of the enemy
in Burma would continue for some time,
but, so far as the Air Forces were concerned,
these could be undertaken by one composite
group (No. 221).

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951

(6) Since No. 224 Group had been with-
drawn from Burma for participation in
Operation “ Zipper”, the Group would come
directly under the operational control of
Headquarters, Air Command, during the
next stage of the Campaign.

{c) The Heavy Bomber Group (No. 231)
was no longer suitably located in Burma. It
would be based at the Cocos Islands for
“ Zipper ” support.

. _ @) Photographic Reconnaissance, Special
Duties and Air Supply Operations would
no longer be concentrated on Burma, but
would be required in widely separated
areas. This called for direct control from
the Headquarters of the Air Command of
the groups engaged in these duties.

(e) The above factors reduced the respon-
sibilities of H.Q. R.A.F. Burma, which had
hitherto controlled several functional
groups.

(f) The altered military situation had also
called for the move of Headquarters, Allied
{Land Forces to Kandy, while Headquarters,
Supreme Allied Command, together with the
Headquarters of the three Commanders-in-
Chief, would move to Singapore at the
earliest practicable date.

(g) The 10th U.S.A.A.F. had been moved
to China and. Eastern Air Command dis-
solved. At the same time the R.A-F. Target
Force for South East Asia in Phase II was
not to be as large as originally planned.
519. These factors, it was considered, re-

quired revision of previous operational plans,

and would enable a considerable reduction of
planned overheads to be effected in Head-
quarters and Administrative Services,

520. On the fall of Singapore the following
moves were scheduled to take place:—

(a) Headquarters, Air Command would
move there in company with Headquarters,
Supremé Allied Commander, H.Q. Allied
Land Forces and part of the E.LF. H.Q.

(b) Headquarters, No. 222 Group would
move from Ceylon to Singapore and under-
take responsibilities in that area similar to
those undertaken by Mediterranean Allied
Coastal Forces or Air Defences, Eastern
Mediterranean.

(c) Headquarters, No. 231- Group would
move to Singapore and be possibly em-
ployed either as a heavy Bomber Group
Headquarters, the Headquarters of a Task
Force, or be disbanded.

(d) Headquarters, No. 224 Group would
also move to Singapore area and remain
a composite group, being modelled as neces-
sary to undertake further operations for the
teconquest of Sumatra, Java and Borneo.
521. A small Headquarters, R.A.F. Ceylon,

was also planned to take over area respon-

sibilities for: —

@ Ceylon.

(b) Island Flying-boat, Emergency Land-
ing Grounds and Met. Stations to the south.

(©) Cocos for administrative services.

522. Although the future strategy for South
East Asia Command was not yet d
making it impossible to forecast reliably _ for
the future deployment of forces, it was con-
sidered that the reorganisation as ri
would meet all the probable requirements~
