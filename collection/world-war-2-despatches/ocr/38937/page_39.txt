SUPPLEMENT To tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

the enemy would withdraw, and I was con-
vinced that our spring offensive would find
him still offering a most determined resistance.
It was for this reason that I considered a
regrouping absolutely vital to bring our full
strength to bear at the critical point, while a
continued attack in our present circumstances
would merely weaken us to no good purpose.
First, however, I would try once more to
eliminate Cassino and seize some kind of a
bridgehead; this would mean that there would
be no serious lull in the fighting. _Comment-
ing on the air plan I limited myself to hoping:
‘that the weather will improve in time to
give our air forces a chance to carry out their
part of your plan. At present it is atrocious
and shows no sign of change *’.

I explained my plan, on the lines of the
appreciation of 22nd February, to the Army
Commanders at a conference at Caserta on the
28th. ‘We decided to relieve 5 British Division
in 10 Corps by 88 United States Division at
once and the former should then move to Anzio
to relieve 56 Division. 56 Division thad been
severely reduced in fighting value during its
short period in the bridgehead; General Truscott
on the 26th reported it as inadequate to hold
its present front.* We decided further that,
at a later date, 34-United States Division should
also move to Anzio. Steps were also taken
to prepare the major reorganisation of the front
for the coming offensive.

Fourteenth Army's Second Offensive at Anzio.

While the weather held up our renewed
attack at Cassino it was already clear that the
enemy was preparing another offensive at
Anzio. He no doubt calculated that he had
time enough before our threat to the ‘‘ Gustav '”
line became serious and experience had given
him a justified confidence in the strength of
his defences there. His renewed attack could
not be made in the same force as the
first; there were large gaps in his divisions and
morale had suffered the inevitable depression
that follows the failure of an offensive of which
much had been hoped. Mackensen therefore
planned an attack on a smaller scale, using
LXXVI Corps only; it was designed to narrow
down the bridgehead by driving a wedge into
the eastern flank to cut off the troops defend-
ing the Mussolini canal. If this were success-
ful a further process of attrition might reduce
the bridgehead to dimensions too small for
safety, Four divisions, including two panzer
divisions, were to make the assault, with a
mobile division in reserve: it was to be com~-
bined with diversionary attacks on both flanks,
VI Corps was prepared for the attack on 2oth
February and it was a complete failure:
artillery fire and the firm defence of 3
Division broke up most of the attacks, a small
penetration was made but was soon ironed out
and by the afternoon of ist March the enemy
had acknowledged defeat.t He never again
resumed the offensive and I now could consider
the Anzio bridgehead secure, especially after
we had captured Fourteenth Army’s order of
4th March directing the assumption of the

+ Kesselring ordered at 1840 hours 1 March all
concentrated attacks to be halted; Mackensen had
already called off the offensive. German losses in the
two days amounted to 2,215 (excluding 362 Division's
losses for 29 February).

defensive. In March three Genman mobile
divisions, 26 Panzer, 29 Panzer Grenadier and
Hermann Goering Panzer, were withdrawn from
the line, followed by 114 Jaeger. On the Allied
side 5 Division relieved the 56th between 5th
and rrth March and on the 28th 34 Division
relieved 3 United States Division, which had
been sixty-seven days continuously in the line.
56 Division went to the Middle East but the 3rd
Temained at Anzio in Corps reserve.

I reported on the situation after the repulse
of these attacks in a signal on 5th March, when
I had returned from another visit to Anzio.
Tt was now much improved and, I added, ‘‘ a
more healthy feeling of confidence prevails
throughout ’’. I took the opportunity of
summing up the balance of the six weeks
fighting with reference to the rather mislead-
ing accounts which had been given publicity:

“From various reports I have read from
home it appears that public opinion imagines
that after the initial landing no effort was
made to advance further. This is most
distressing to me and the troops. Reference
should be made to the many casualties
sustained by the British in taking Campoleone
where they were finally held at the foot of
the Colli Laziali, and also the losses suffered
by the Americans in trying to take Cisterna,
where all attacks failed. After this, superior

German forces attacked us in strength and

threw us on to the defensive and we had a

bitter struggle to maintain the bridgehead

intact after being driven back from Campo-

leone. A man may enter the backdoor of a

house unperceived save by the kitchenmaid

who raises the alarm. But unless the in-
habitants hide upstairs there will be a fight
in the passage for the possession of the house.

We are now fighting in the passage ’’.

Third Battle of Cassino.

All this time the New Zealand Corps, now
strengthened by the addition of 78 Division,
was waiting for suitable conditions for the next
attack on Cassino, which was intended to be
our last attack before the spring offensive. In
order to give our experiment in the use of heavy
air attack its best chance we had laid down two
conditions: there should be three fine days
before the attack to ensure that the ground was
dry enough for the use of tanks, especially in
the exploitation into the Liri valley, and there
should be good visibility on the day of the
attack for the benefit of the bombers. For
a fortnight after the repulse of the second Ger-
man offensive at Anzio General Freyberg waited
at twenty-four hours notice until, on the 14th,
these conditions appeared likely to be fulfilled
and the attack was ordered for the next day.
The total weight of high explosive showered
on Cassino amounted to over eleven hundred
tons of bombs and nearly two thousand rounds
of artillery fire, but when the New Zealanders
advanced into the town they found the enemy
still resisting. This was an extraordinary feat
and much to the credit of x Parachute
Division.* After personally witnessing the
bombardment it seemed to me inconceivable
that any troops should be alive after eight
hours of such terrific hammering, let alone
should be able to man their defences. 1 doubt
if any other division in the German Atmy

* The first elements of the Parachutists had arrived
for the second battle, in February, when they held
the heights, including Hill. For the March
assault they were responsible fer the town as well.
