with postponement acceptable is 6th and 7th June.

Weather - <ivitieit ly, before D Day. ' Postponement.

29. You held the first meeting to discuss the weather forecast for D day a.m. gn rst June. The outlook was not very good and it deteriorated further during the next three days. At the  meeting held p.m. 3rd June you decided to allow the movements of the Forces to commence, despite the unfavourable, outlook, in view of the many advantages in launching the operation on the first possible day.. But at the next meeting at 0415 on 4th June it was clear that conditions the next day would iot ~be acceptable and a postponement of 24 hours was ordered. By this time all of Force U from Devonshire and a proportion of Force O from Portland were at sea, and ships and craft had to reverse their course and return to harbour. Instructions for this eventuality were included in the Operation Orders and work d smoothly, except in the case of Force U2A,* who failed to receive the signal ordering the postponement. By ogoo this Force was about 25 miles south of St. Catherine's Point and still steering south. Two destroyers'and a! Walrus aircraft had to be  sent at full speed to turn it

24-hour

round. Had this not been.done it is possible

that the Force would shortly have been detected by. the enemy's radar and this would undoubtedly have resulted in his increased vigilance for the next few dalys.  

30. The craft of Force U had a bad time punching into .2 head sea on their  return westwards and,  although the whole Force was

ordered into Weymouth Bay, a number of .

craft never mariaged to enter it. Considerable anxiety was felt throughout 4th June both as to the need of a further postponement with all its resulting loss of efficiency of craft and assault troops, and whether Force'U would be in a fit state to go forward again early the next morning should the decision be made to go on with the operation. At one time it'was thought that Force U would have to return to Devonshire to re-form,. but, when it was pointed out that this would almost certainly result in thes postponement of the operation to the next moon period, Rear-Admiral Kirk, with characrea verve, announced his readiness to pro-- cee

The Passage.

3r. When the assault forces  again   sailed early on 5th June the weather was still largely unfavourable for landing craft, but more suitable conditions had been forecast for the early hours of 6th June. Wind was W.S.W.+ Force 5 veering to W.N.W. decreasing in force at times bit with strong. gusts; waves were five to six feet in mid-Channel. These conditions made the passage difficult, and , considerable discomfort was experienced  by the troops embarked in L.C.T.f and L.C.I. (L). Although some of the minor landing craft  which were due to arrive p.m. on D day had to put back to harbour and others were delayed, the assault forces all drove on and almost without excep-

tion arrived off their beaches. to time. The performance of the leading groups of Force U was particularly praiseworthy, since, as has been stated, some of these failed to enter harbour on the postponement, and by H hour their, Commanding Officers had been on their bridges - continuously for about 7o hours. Out of the 128 L.C.T. in Group U2A only seven failed. to take part in the  assault, and this e took account of engine failures as well as the stress

 of the weather.

32. To ensure the correct positioning of the northern ends of the ro approach channels that were to be swept across the known enemy minefields 10 F.H. 830 buoys had been. laid by three H.D\M.L. of Force J during the night 3ist May/ist June. The buoys were timed. to transmit between the hours of 1400 and 2200 on six successive days, commencing on 4th June. At 1800 on 5th June, 10 H.D.M.L. took up position to point these buoys for the Assault Forces, and all reports show that this method

_ was wholly satisfactory. A large number of

ships was fitted with receivers to obtain positions from the Gee (Q.H.) and Decca (Q.M.) radio navigational systems, both of which worked -fully according to expectations, and navigation was never regarded as a serious problem. The above additional measures were taken to guard against effective jamming by the enemy p.m. on D-r should surprise have been lost.

Achievement of surprise.

33. There was an air of unreality during the passage of the assault forces across the Channel curiously similar to that on D-z in

 * Husky   as, our forces approached Sicily. The achievement of strategical surprise was always hoped for in   Neptune   but was by no means-certain, whereas that of tactical suiprise had always seemed extremely unlikely. As our forces approached the Fr nch coast without a murmur from the enemy or from their

.own radio, the realisation that once again

almost complete tactical -surprise had been achieved slowly dawned. This astonishing feat   cannot be explained by any single factor and must be attributed in part to all of the following: -the miscalculations of the enemy; the high degree of air superiority attained by our Air  Forces, which, drastically reduced theenemy's air reconnaissance; the bad weather which caused the enemy to withdraw his EBoat patrols to Cherbourg; and finally the radio counter-measures employed by our forces, which, coupled with the diversions against the . Pas de Calais and -Cap d Antifer, -left, the enemy in doubt as to the points at which we would land even when he had become aware that the invasion was in progress. Although the unfavourable weather caused difficulties and damage to craft off the beaches later, the advantages gained by surprise were so striking that your decision to go on despite the weather was amply justified. A postponement of one more day, e.g. till 7th June, would,.in the event, have proved disastrous owing to the conditions of sea off the beaches. The problems arising out of a postponement of 12 to 14 days to the next suitable period are too appalling even to contemplate.
