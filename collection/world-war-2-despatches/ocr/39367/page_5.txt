SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 OCTOBER, 1951

Air Force aspects. It consisted of 29 Squadrons,
13 Royal Air Force, 2 U.S.A.A.F., 3 Royal
Hellenic Air Force, 2 Jugoslav Air Force and
2 Italian Air Force. These forces were divided

etween Greece and Italy. B.A.F, also had
operational control of part of a No. 216 Group
Transport squadron located at Bari, which was
used for special duties operations to Jugoslavia.

OrgER FORMATIONS UNDER THE COMMAND OF
Ar C.-1n-C, MLA.A.F.

41. In addition to the four main fighting
formations, the Air C.-in-C. M.A.A.F., also
had under his control Air Headquarters Malta,
No. 336 Photo Reconnaissance Wing, and the
Mediterranean Air Transport Service.

Air Headquarters, Malta.

(Air Vice-Marshal K. B, Lloyd, C.B.E.,
AF C., Air Officer Commanding.)

42. Air Headquarters, Malta, had at one time
formed part of M.A.C.A.F. but was placed
directly under Headquarters M.A.A.F. in
February, 1945. As the battle front moved
northwards the importance of Malta as an
operational base decreased. It still remained,
however, a natural centre for the direction
of oversea air operations in the Mediter-
ranean. Since Malta was a permanent R.A.F,
base, the A.O.C. Malta had responsibilities in
two directions—his responsibility to the Air
Ministry for the implementation of R.A.F.
long-term policy, arid his responsibility to the
Air C.-in-C, for such war commitments as he
was required to undertake. The latter con-
sisted of the air defence of Malta and North
Africa, the conduct of all anti-submarine opera-
tions within his operational area under the
general co-ordinating direction of A.O.C.,
M.A.C.A.F., and air sea rescue services within
his area. The air defence and anti-submarine
requirements had almost completely dis-
appeared, and A.O.C. Malta’s chief commit-
ment in this direction was the maintenance of
a skeleton organisation which could be rapidly
expanded should a new air or submarine threat
arise.

43. The A.O.C. Malta had therefore under
his command only one air sea rescue squadron
in Malta, and one air sea rescue squadron and
one French single-engine fighter squadron in
North Africa.

No. 336 Wing.

44. This wing, which consisted of one twin-
engined and two single-engined squadrons, had
previously formed part of the Mediterranean
Allied Photographic Reconnaissance Wing. The
latter had, however, been dissolved before I
assumed command when it became American
policy to make each of their air forces as self-
contained as possible. No. 336 Wing remained
as a completely R.A.F. formation under the
operational control of M.A.A.F. It met the
photographic reconnaissance requirements of
all three services—Navy, Army and Air Force
working on priorities allotted to it by the
Mediterranean Photo Reconnaissance Com-
mittee, which also co-ordinated the work of
the American photo reconnaissance elements
of XIIth and XVth Air Forces.

Mediterranean Allied Transport Service.
(Brigadier-General L. V. Beau, Commanding
General.)

45. M.A.T.S. was an integrated British-
American organisation whose principal function
was the co-ordination and direction of all air
transport activities within the limits of the
Command jurisdiction of the Air C.-in-C.
MAAF. -

46. M.A.T.S. was responsible for co-ordinat-
ing those services which the R.A.F. Transport
Command Group in MEDME (No. 216 Group),
and the U.S.A.A.F. Air Transport Command
operated within the Air C.-in-C.’s theatre.

47. In addition M.A.T.S. had under its im-
mediate operational control a pool of American
transport aircraft, which varied in strength, but
which normally consisted of three squadrons. °

R.A.F. Formations in MEDME Not UNDER
ComMMAND OF AIR C.-IN-C. M.A.A.F.

48. All the formations described above came
under the operational control of the Air C.-in-C.
and therefore as deputy Air C.-in-C. I had
such responsibility with regard to them as
was delegated to me by the Air C.-in-C.
However, as Commander-in-Chief, R.A.F.,

, 1 was responsible for certain other
formations which did not come within the
qurisdiction of the Air C.-in-C. These were:—-
(Headquarters R.A.F. Middle East and the
Directorate of Maintenance and Supply.

Headquarters, Royal Air Force, Middle East.

(Air Marshal Sir Charles E. H. Medhurst,
K.C.B., O.B.E., M.C., Air Officer Com-
manding-in-C hief.)

49. Headquarters R.A.F. Middle East was
the basis from which the R.A.F. organisation
in the Mediterranean had been created. It
now had very few operational commitments and
its chief functions were the provision of opera-
tional training and maintenance facilities, serv-
ing the requirements both of MEDME and Air
Command, South East Asia. In March, 1945,
it had only four squadrons under its command
—one air sea rescue, one general reconnais-
sance, one photographic reconnaissance and one
single-engined fighter.

50. There were located in Aden and East
Africa six general reconnaissance squadrons,
but these were under the operational control
of Air Command South East Asia.

The Directorate of Maintenance and Supply.
(Air Vice-Marshal C. B. Cooke, C.B.E., Direc-
tor of Maintenance and Supply.)

51. The Director of Maintenance and Supply
(D.M. & S.) was responsible for all Mainten-
ance and Supply matters within MEDME Com-
mand. The maintenance organisation was a
functional one, and D.M. & S. was responsible
to’ me for the technical direction of all main-
tenance units and operational formations. His
Headquarters, named Rear Headquarters,
(MEDME, was at Algiers, and he controlled
three maintenance groups—No. 206 in Egypt,
No. 214 in Italy, and No. 218 in North Africa.
In my headquarters at Caserta, there was a
small maintenance policy and planning staff,
headed by the Command Maintenance and
Supply Officer (C.M.S.0O.), who was respon-
sible for advising me on behalf of D.M. & S.,
and also for informing D.M. & S. of all policy
decisions so that plans could be prepared to
implement them. . -
