            "description": "248. During the period, 16th October to 7th November, two British and five Italian submarines operated to Leros from Beirut and Haifa. The turn-round was estimated to be fourteen days and it was expected that 150 tons a week could be supplied by this method. The main limitation was the Royal Navy's inability to sail the submarines during the period of the full moon owing to the risks involved. Another limiting factor was the size and weight of the package that could be carried, the ideal being a 16-inch cube . which could be lifted by one man. However, this limitation was overcome by close co-operation between the submarine commanders and the army personnel responsible for loading, and amongst other awkward loads twelve Bofors guns, six  2-pounder guns and one Jeep were. sent, in addition to eighteen | M.M.Gs. and 250 tons of more easily handled stores.",

Naxos and Paros were occupied on 12th October, and on 15th October Simi, which we had evacuated two days before after heavy dive-bombing raids had made the position untenable, was occupied by the enemy. The German Air Force was well dispersed; its heavy bombers were concentrated at Eleusis, its fighters at Kalamaki and Argos, its divebombers at Megara and Marizza, and from these bases constant attacks were made on Leros. Delayed-action bombs put Portolago Bay, on Leros, temporarily out of action on 16th October, and on 17th and 18th October, Castelrosso was bombed for the first time since our occupation.",

Sir, ' JT have the honour to forward my report of the opening phase of Operation   Neptune,  the period covered being from my appointment as Allied Naval Commander, Expeditionary Force, on 25th October, 1943, to the withdrawal of the Naval Task Force Commanders on 3rd July, 1944. The report is lengthy owing to the need to caver, if only superticially, the very many different aspects of what is acknowJedged to be  the greatest amphibious operation in history. Because the report is'so bulky, I have decided to write this covering letter in a form which will enable those who wish to do so to obtain a bird's eye view of the operation  as-a whole, including the preparatory period and the build-up,  without going into detail.",
