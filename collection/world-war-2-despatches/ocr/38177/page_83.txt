SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 1948

5. I know that you have taken and are taking
numerous measures to meet an eventuality such
as I have described; but I must tell you that,
speaking from an office chair at a great distance
from the battlefield, I wonder whether you
should not put your armoured reserve a good
deal further to the north, where it can hit
the enemy immediately ‘the emerges from his
break-through, and before he can establish a
defensive flank, which all our experience
teaches us he will certainly try to do. I sug-
gest that both your armoured divisions com-
plete should be positioned astride the Trigh
Capuzzo. It does not look from the map as if
this would be too far north to meet the main
attack, should it come round the southern
flank, instead of against the centre as I antici-
pate. Your covering troops should give you
good warning of any main enveloping move-
ment on your left, even if you do not hear
of it before it starts.

As always, the difficulty will be to decide
which is the real attack and which the feint.

6. I deel that your reaction to my suggestion
that you should put your armour more behind
the centre of your position will be that your
southern flank will be left bare of any mobile
troops to delay and harass the enemy, and also
of any armoured units to give immediate sup-
port to the Free French. I propose to send
you at once the 3rd Indian Motor Bde., which,
though not absolutely fully equipped, is fit for
battle. I suggest you might like to keep them
on your southern flank, and that this will
obviate any need to leave either of the motor
brigades of the two armoured divisions in this
area. I consider it to be of the highest import-
ance that you should not break up the organisa-
tion of either of the armoured divisions. They
have been trained to fight as divisions, I hope,
and fight as divisions they should. _ Norrie
-must handle them as a Corps Commander, and
thus be able to take advantage of the flexibility
which the fact of having two formations gives
him. Moreover, you will be getting the 1st
Armoured Brigade before long, and it should
join the 7 Armd. Div., I feel, thus making
both divisions similar.

‘As regards armoured support for the French,
I suggest that if you move your armoured
divisions further north you might spare some
infantry tanks for them. I am sending you
up as soon as possible the 7th Royal Tanks,
with one Valentine squadron of 4th Royal Tanks
and two Matilda squadrons of its own, to in-
crease your force of infantry tanks.

As to the rest of the infantry tanks, I suggest
that, if possible, they should be placed so as
to support the infantry in that part of the posi-
tion which is likely to bear the brunt of the
enemy attack. I admit that this may be un-
economical, as tending to immobilise them, but
I feel that it is essential to give this infantry all
possible support in order to encourage them
to hang on. It is of the highest importance that
they should hold on whatever happens, I
will be glad if you will consider this also.

7. Tf you can stop the enemy short of Tobruk
and then get at him in flank with your armour
and in rear with infantry and guns, I feel you
may have the chance of scoring a decisive
success. I think, therefore, that you should at
once lay minefields across the corridor between
the two escarpments to the west of Acroma and
cover these with guns. You will see from the

"sketch what I mean. I suggest also that you

391

should consider mining the coastal corridor in
more depth, so as to stop any break-through by
that route, which, though it might not be
serious, would be a serjous nuisance and divert
effort from the main task of destroying once
and for all the enemy's armour. . es

8. Finally, I suggest that you should fortify
El Gubi and protect it with mines. I am sure
you will feel much more comfortable when you
have something there threatening any wide
turning movement from the south against
Tobruk or from the west against Sollum, un-
likely as this may seem to be. I know you
want to keep 5th Indian Division as compact
and uncommitted as possible for use as in a
mobile role, should opportunity offer, - either
under Gott or under yourself. I am absolutely
certain that this is right. I am sending you,
therefore, at once, the 11th Brigade of 4th
Indian Division to replace 2gth Infantry
Brigade in Capuzzo, in case you still feel you
need another brigade there as well as the 2nd
Free French Brigade. If you don’t, so much the
better; as you might then relieve the gth
Infantry Brigade of the 5th Indian Division in
Tobruk, and so increase your mobile reserve.
You could then use a brigade of the 5th Indian
Division for E] Gubi, if you feel so inclined.

The 11th Infantry Brigade is not mobile,
and I do not want it committed forward of
Sollum unless it is absolutely necessary to do
so. I am bringing the whole of roth Indian
Division from Iraq, and the leading brigade will
be sent up to you as soon as it arrives in relief
of 11th Infantry Brigade, which I shall then
hope to get back here, as it is part of the gar-
tison allotted to Cyprus.

g. I am also bringing from Syria the Guides
Cavalry (armoured cars and wheeled carriers)
which I will give*you if you want them to re-
place a battle-worn unit, or for the pursuit
which I hope to see you carrying out.

Io. I suggest that you must reorganise your
system of command for this battle. For a
defensive battle I feel you must have your
mobile reserve, that is your armoured force,
freed from all static commitments and responsi-
bilities. Your Army falls, as I see it, into two
parts one whose task it is to hold the fort, which
is the Gazala—Tobruk—El Gubi—Bir Hacheim
quadrilateral, and the other whose task it is to
hit the enemy wherever he may thrust and
destroy him. I think Gott should be solely re-
sponsible for the first, and Norrie for the
second. I would relieve the latter of all re-
sponsibility for Bir Hacheim at once.

rz. I am sorry to have inflicted such a long
letter on you, but as I said before, so much
hangs on this battle that I feel nothing must
be left undone by anyone to help to win it.

As you know I have absolute confidence in
you and your troops, and I am sure that if the
enemy attacks, you will deal him a blow from
which he may find it difficult, if not impossible
to recover. This is the object.
