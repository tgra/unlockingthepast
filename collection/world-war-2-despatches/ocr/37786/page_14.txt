made for the provision and distribution of ade-
quate supplies of British Military Administra-
tion currency and for the exchange into this
currency of the local money in the hands of
the embarking troops. In view of the large num-
bers of troops and the large sums involved, this
entailed a considerable organisation.

144. Postal services laboured under severe
difficulties. The need for the strictest security
was a great handicap, the facilities enjoyed by
the Middle East and British North African com-
ponents of the force required adjustment to make
them similar, and the division of complete units
into several parties distributed over the Middle
East in transit to Sicily and in Sicily itself
made the re-direction and diversion of mail ex-
tremely difficult.

145. As maintenance of Eighth Army was a
Middle East responsibility in the initial stages,
there was a large volume of administrative
signal traffic between Middle East and Eighth
Army. On r4th August (with Eighth Army
finally established in Sicily), submarine cable
fullerphone was established between Sicily and
Malta to meet signal traffic back to 15 Army
Growp and General Headquarters Middle East,
by means other than wireless. Malta cleared
traffic to and from Algiers and the Delta by
submarine cable. This fullerphone circuit was
replaced by high-speed morse on oth
September.

146. Whilst Middle East Base played this
important part in the Sicilian operations, Malta,
an outlying portion of my command, also ful-
filled a role which necessitated most careful
planning and administration. The 231st
Brigade was taken from the garrison, trained
and re-equipped in the Middle East, and took
part in the assault and subsequent operations.
In addition to providing this brigade, Malta
was also called upon to use all of its facilities
to the utmost in preparation for the attack on
Sicily.

147. Owing to the lack of accommodation
and other facilities, it was decided that Malta
should not be developed as an advanced base.
Its role, therefore, became that of a combined
advanced headquarters and staging post, In
preparation for the assault it had to accom-
modate the assault troops of the 51st Division,
numerous army and corps troops and Royal
Air Force personnel, the main headquarters of
the 30th Corps and Twelfth (later Eighth)
Army, Headquarters of the Desert Air Force,
Naval Headquarters and Tactical Headquarters
of the Army Group; in all an additional commit-
ment of approximately 30,000 personnel and
2,700 vehicles.

148. Although a large proportion of the
vehicles arrived at Malta in landing craft, the
discharge of the cargo ships placed a great
strain on the movement and transportation
facilities. To deal with this extra commitment
a number of additional staff was sent to the
island as well as extra administrative units,
including two general transport and eight
pioneer companies.

149. Accommodation on Malta, which had
never been large, had been substantially re-
duced by bombing. Twelve tented camp sites
and eighteen bivouac areas, each to accommo-
date 1,000 men and 70 vehicles, were therefore

repared, A well-boring section was despatched
is the island and sixteen bores were sunk for
military and civilian needs in areas where the
existing water supply was insufficient.

150. Twelve hards, selected by the Royal
Navy, were prepared in the Grand Harbour
and Marsh Muscetto Harbour; of these only foar
could tbe used for L.S.Ts. owing either to lack
of draught or to the unsuitability of road
approaches,

151. Even when the Royal Electrical and
Mechanical Engineers personnel in Malta had
been strengthened by a draft from Middle East,
not more than 300 vehicles could be water-
proofed a day. Three vehicle marshalling
parks were therefore organised within two miles
of the hards. There vehicles, after waterproof-
ing, were assembled until they were called for-
ward for loading. These three areas could
accommodate only goo vehicles. Another
vehicle marshalling park capable of holding 600
vehicles was therefore organised about five miles
from the hhards. It was tealised that, after
stage two of the waterproofing, vehicles should
not be driven more than two miles, but in view
of the congestion in the harbour area and the
necessity to hold sufficient vehicles in readiness
for embarkation, this distance was accepted.

152. Royal Air Force units were the first to
arrive, on 3rd June, 1943. From this date
until 7th July, units arrived continuously either
by landing craft or by troopships. Stores of
all natures, both reserves for Eighth Army and
for the maintenance of Malta, were also received
during this period.

153. Advanced holdings were established of
3,200 tons of supplies, 5,000 tons of petro] and
oil and 6,000 tons of ammunition, In addition,
small reserves were held of vital Ordnance
stores, including hospital requirements and
waterproofing kits. Ultimately, a substantial
proportion. a the petrol and oil and ammuni-
tion was not required and was used for Malta
maintenance. The ammunition proved of great
value, especially for emergency demands to
cover unforeseen expenditure.

154. Originally it had been intended that
Malta should be used as a casualty clearing area
for evacuation from the beaches, but as the
Royal Navy objected to hospital ships and car-

â€˜riers calling at the ports the plan was aban-

doned and Malta was prepared as a medical
reserve area only, for the reception of such
casualties as might arrive in normal naval and
military craft destined for the island. For this
purpose, 7,760 ibeds (including 1,000 for con-
valescents) were held ready, but in actual fact
these were not all used. The casualties which
passed through Malta were mainly airborne
personnel and other survivors picked up by
naval vessels.

155. During the period 8th-16th July, a total
of 20,400 personnel, 2,700 vehicles and 3,500
tons of stores was embarked and loaded at
Malta. The call forward of personnel and
vehicles after the initial assault presented some
difficulty, and quick turn-round of craft was
maintained only at the expense of a certain
amount of discomfort to the troops and con-
gestion at the quayside. This arose because
the number of craft available for the next
flight was seldom known sufficiently early,
