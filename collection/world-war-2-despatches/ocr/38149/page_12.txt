batteries, which had been allowed to become
non-operational in November, 1944, . were
fmally disbanded.

23. This bald statement of the progressive
reduction in the country’s anti-aircraft defences
gives no idea of the intensity of the problem
which it presented. The men suitable.for an
infantry or dn R.A.S.C. réle were to be found
in every unit under my command and these
had to be extracted to meet the urgent require-
ments of the field force and had to ‘be re-
placed by less fit men from disbanding units in
such a way as to minimise the effect upon the

- batteries which were at the time heavily
engaged in the flying bomb battle. *

24. Nor were reductions in the defences the
only manpower problems of those difficult
years. I have already mentioned that the
general labour shortage caused the building of
A.T.S. accommodation to fall behind schedule
and as the number of mixed batteries increased
and redeployments of Heavy guns became
more necessary, so the aéuteness of the diffi--
culty increased. Finally, we concluded that we
must -have within Anti-Aircraft Command a
labour force which could be applied exclu-
sively to our own needs and early in 1943
certain batteries were withdrawn from their
operational réle for this purpose.

These were reconstituted as Construction
Batteries and 1,800 men were finally employed
in this manner. In this unspectacular réle
the Construction Batteries made a most valu-
able contribution to the defence of the
country. r

Supplemented by 7,500 unskilled workers
from disbanding Light Batteries, they were
largely responsible for the success of a ‘vast
building operation during the flying bomb
battle to which I shall refer later.

New Equipment.

25. Concurrently the equipment problem be-

came easier. The 3.7-inch gun on a static
mounting remained the standard Heavy equip-
ment with a number of similar guns on mobile
mountings as a supplement. A special 3.7-inch
barrel was designed for the 4.5-inch guns
and the conversion of these weapons began at
the end of October, 1943; the work was still
proceeding at the end of the war but all the.
72 4.5-inch guns in the London area were
modified by the end of November, 1943; this
gun, which was known as the 3.7-inch Mark 6,
was remarkable for its high muzzle velocity.
A still more effective Heavy gun of §.25-inch
calibre also began to come from production
during this period. The first guns of this calibre
to go into action were of naval design with twin
barrels and these operated from April, 1942.
A model with a single barrel, designed
especially for anti-aircraft work, began to
appear in May, 1943. :
_ the chief Light anti-aircraft weapon con-
tinued to be the 4o-mm Bofors but it -was
supplemented by increasing numbers of 2o-mm
equipment, largely Oerlikon or Polsten guns,
and from the beginning of 1944 by an increas-
ing number of twin 0.5 inch Brownings in
power-operated turrets,

There was also a steady flow of new radar
designs intended to give greater accuracy than
the earlier models. These later designs were
able to work successfully at high angles of
sight. Auto-following.was introduced by which

the sets were kept on the target, once it had.
been located, by an automatic electric control;
this auto-follow system first operated in action
on the American SCR 584.sets during the flying
bomb battle. : ; ;

Though the numbers of the various equip-
ments in action were, until the closing stages
of the war, always below the totals regarded
as necessary, there was generally a steady and
plogressive improvement throughout the period
covered by this part of my despatch. The only
serious setback occurred .when war broke out
in the Far East. Anti-Aircraft Command gave
up 66 Heavy and 216 Light guns for the new
theatres of war and for six months afterwards
received practically no fresh equipments from
production.

26. At the outbreak of war with Japan in

- December, 1941, the Heavy guns which were
available to me totalled 1,960, made of up 935
static and 465 mobile 3.7-inch guns, 416 4.5-
inch guns and 144 of the obsolete 3-inch guns.
At the end of 1942 the total was 2,100, made
up of 3 twih 5.25-inch guns, 1,200 static and
475 mobile 3.7-inch, 406 4.5-inch guns and 16
3-inch guns. i
In June, 1944, at the beginning of the flying
bomb battle, I had 2,635 guns, made up of 3
twin 5.25-inch and 25 single 5.25-inch guns,
1,672 static, 527 mobile and 149 Mark 6 3.7-
inch guns and 259 still unconverted 4.5-inch

ns, .
The . position with the Light anti-aircraft
weapons when Japan entered the war was that
Thad a total of 1,197, made up of 1,056 40-mm
Bofors, 8 obsolete 3-inch guns, 71 miscellaneous
types of 2-pounders and 62 20-mm Hispanos.

At the end of 1942 the total had increased to -

1,814, of which 1,717 were 4o-mm Bofors, 6
3-inch guns, 5 2-pounders and‘86 20-mm His-
pano and Oerlikon guns. ‘

In June, 1944, the total had risen sharply to
4,589, made up of 2,681 40-mm Bofors, 1,257
20-mm Hispanos and Oerlikons and 651 twin
0.5-inch Brownings. ,

Rocket projectors in action numbered 4,481
at the end of 1942 and 6,372 at the end of

1943. *

In addition to the increase in the numbers
of equipments and to the introduction of new
dypes, certain important inventions were made
for use with the older types. The first im-
portant one appeared in ‘1943 and was the
Automatic Fuze-Settef for the 3.7-inch gun;
the earliest designs had the effect of increasing
the rate of fire of those guns to which it was
fitted by about 50 per cent. while later designs
increased it by over 250 per cent. and greatly
improved the accuracy of the fuze-setting.

‘The second invention was the proximity fuze
which did away with the need for fuze-setting
altogether and was extensively used in the
flying bomb battle. With these fuzes the ex-
.plosion was controlled automatically by their
proximity to the flying body; the, rapid load-
ing by means of Automatic Fuze-setters was
continued with the new fuzes. a

Tactical Employment.

27. The tactical plans for the employment of
guns in Gun Defended Areas did not change
during this period but considerable changes
were made in the tactical employment of
searchlights. ey a
