bearings obtained on South Atlantic Station
and these U-Boats may well have embarked
the survivors or some of them.

5. As pointed out by her Commanding
Officer, H.M.S. DORSETSHIRE has done an
immense amount of steaming and has spent
many days searching for suspected raiders and
supply ships. She has always been an efficient
and rehable ship and her success on this
occasion “has been ‘well earned.

6. Captain A. W. S. Agar, V.C., D.S.O,
RN, has displayed good leadership and much
zeal and ingenuity in conducting these searches
and I desire to bring his name to Their Lord-
ships’ notice for his services in disposing of
this enemy ship.

4. As it does not appear by the terms of
Admuralty letter No. C.W. 2558/41 of 7th
March, i941, that recommendations can be
forwarded for immediate or operational awards,
I intend to submit names in the next hist of
periodical recommendations due on 31st March,
1942. :

I have the honour to report the following
movements which led to the sinking of an
enemy vessel, believed to be either a Raider
cr Supply Ship,* by H.M. Ship under my com-
mand, between 1800 and 182r on Monday, Ist
December, I94I, in position:

2. H.M S. DORSETSHIRE sailed from Free-
town at 1300 Wednesday, 26th November in
accordance with your orders, with the object
of searching for enemy ships in certain locali-
ties near the relatively calm area 720 miles
south and west of St. Helena.

3. At 0700 Monday, 1st December, whilst in
position: :

Latitude 26 degrees 45 minutes South,
Longitude 6 degrees 25 minutes West,
the Walrus aircraft was flown off on a tnangu-
lar reconnaissance to the south east to a depth
of 70 miles, the ship’s course and speed being
162 degrees, 17 knots. Nothing was sighted and
course and speed were altered at 1100 to III

degrees, 184 knots.

of DORSETSHIRE prior to

4 At 1515 the aircraft was again flown off on
a similar search, with orders to commence the
first leg of the search to starboard for one
hour (i.e to the southward), then at right
angles to the mean line of advance of the ship
for one hour, after which to rejoin. Visibility
was maximum about 25 miles, sea calm with
a slight swell

Admualty footnote —
* The ship was the German submarine supply ship
PYTHON, a motor vessel of 3,664 tons.

First Sighting of Enemv. .

5. At 1653, while the ship was on the port
leg of a zig-zag, the lookout in DORSET-
SHIRE’S crow’s nest reported the mast of a
ship bearing 032 degrees. Although the Walrus
was out of sight to the southward, I decided
to close the sp at once and if necessary recall
the aircraft by W/T on Low Power. Course
was altered to 031 degrees and speed increased
to 25 knots to investigate. It 1s my opinion that
this was the “ first sighting ’’ and due to a very
good lookout being kept.

6. Shortly afterwards, the ship sighted was
observed to be making quite a lot of smoke and
remained hull down until 1717, which con-
firmed my opinion made later, that she was
stopped when sighted, and later on, sighting
DORSETSHIRE, increased to full speed and
altered course directly away from us. S

7. Speed Was increased to 30 knots to closc,
the ship’s company ordered to their action
stations, and aircraft recalled by W/T. (This
recall for some reason: still unexplained, did not
reach the aircraft )

8 Small patches of oil were observed on the
water, including one defimte track which was
not that of the target These tracks all pointed
to the direction in which the ship was first
sighted, and gave rise at once to the suspicion
that a U-Boat might be in the vicinity. A
further alteration of course was in consequence
made by DORSETSHIRE to starboard (i.e. to
the southward).

* Sighting of Boats.

9 At 1708, an object closely resembling the
conning tower of a submarine was sighted on
the port bow, distant 6 miles. Four other
objects were also sighted in the same position,
which later were identified as boats in tow of
a power boat making a total of five or six in
all.~These were definitely identified by 1720.
I assumed therefore that the ship in sight was
an enemy, and that she was either a Raider
or Supply Ship.

ro The theory that she was a genuine British
ship endeavouring to escape from DORSET-
SHIRE—a supposed German warship—and
that the boats in the water contained survivors
from a ship just torpedoed by a U-Boat, could
not altogether be rejected Signals made to the
ship by:searchhght and flags however produced
no result, neither did she break W/T silence
to make a ‘“Q’’ message (raider report).

Acton uf Enemy After Warmng Salvo

rz At 1725, I ordered two warning shots to
be fired, one night and one left of the target,
at a range of twelve miles. Within two minutes
a burst of white smoke. appeared from the stern
of the ship, which rose vertically in the almost
still atmosphere. This may have been either
a smoke screen made from the stern, a smoke
float dropped in the water to attract a sub-
marine, or an explosive charge to scuttle.

12. I decided in the circumstances to keep
DORSETSHIRE moving at high speed, and
outside a range of eight miles, so as to reduce
as much as possible any msk of attack by
U-Boat.* There could therefore be no considera-

were mm the vicimty has simce been confirmed - There
were two, and one of them fired a torpedo at the ship
but missed Bae
