 When taking off for the Ishigaki strike; one - Avenger crashed into.the sea, but the crew were rescued unhurt by the safety destroyer, - At 0827 an enemy aircraft approached the Force at a great height. Our fighters could not get high enough to intercept through lack of oxygen, and .the enemy entered the -artillery zone.. Fire was opened in, blind control, but the enemy was never seen and retired to the  westward. . Before deciding to disengage from the carriers for bombardment I weighed up the following considerations :   (a) The need for bombardment in an endeavour to reduce A.A, fire ashore. * (b) Conditions for bombardment near the target had been reported as excellent. (c) The effect on morale of ships of the * bombarding force would be most beneficial.

To be balariced against this I took into con- .

sideration the fact that the Fleet had been sighted. That in itself was nothing strange, and had happened several times before without being followed by any attack on the Fleet.

After discussing the situation with A.C.1, I detached with the bombarding force at 1000 in position 23  54  N 125  ro  E and closed Miyako at 24 knots. The carriers provided an additional CAP for this force as well as aircraft for spotting. : ,

At 1155 the bombarding force passed through position 24  33.5  N  125  ro  E on the bombarding course of 070  at 15 knots. H.M. Ships KING GEORGE V and HOWE were in open order line ahead and screened by 25th Destroyer Flotilla and H.M. Ships EURYALUS and BLACK PRINCE who occupied the two port, i.e, inshore, positions on the screen. H.M.S. SWIFTSURE, H.M.N.Z.S. GAMBIA and H.M.C.S. UGANDA in open order line ahead were stationed 270  3 miles, ie. fire off

 port quarter of the Fleet Flagship. Conditians were ideal.

At 1205 fire was opened. H.M. Ships

EURYALUS and BLACK PRINCE carried out  

a simultaneous   air burst  shoot on the A.A. defence area of Nobara airfield) H.M. Ships KING GEORGE V and HOWE bombarded Hirara airfield and the A.A. defence area to the north of the airfield, respectively. On comple-  tion of the   air burst   shoot H.M. Ships SWIFTSURE and H.M.N.Z.S. GAMBIA bombarded  Nobara airfield, and H.M.C.S.  UGANDA Sukama air strip.

In spite of comparatively close ranges, no form of opposition from the shore was encountered, Fire was ceased at 1250.

Photographs show that the runways at Nobara and Sukama were-well hit and that all rounds from H.M.S. HOWE fell in the target area, but no  photographs were obtained to show results by. H.M.S. KING GEORGE V.

A few minutes after bombardment was commenced I received a signal from A.C.1 to say that H.M.S. FORMIDABLE had been hit  and was reduced to 18 knots. I accordingly informed the Bombarding Ferce and instructed ships .to speed up the bombardment.. As signals were corrupt and the situation not -quite clear I ordered the cease fire a little earlier than planned and at 1247 turned the force to the southward 4nd closed the carriers at 25 knots:

- As soon as the Bombarding Force had disengaged, A.C.x formed the. eight destroyers

-left.. with him so. that two -destroyers were -equally spaced between each carrier and: on the line joining adjacent carriers. This pro-

"vided the best natural gun support and clear

arcs of fire.

At about rI00 three small groups of bogeys were detected to the westward, and were soon followed up by a fourth.. Probably 16-to 20 enemy aircraft were employed with some acting as decoys. Fighters engaged one group working round to the southward, but one Kamikaze group penetrated to the carriers and was first detected when a plane was seen diving on the Force. Analysis shows that this group escaped detection either because, in the absence of the Bombarding  Force, too many  of the reduced number of radar sets were fully engaged- tracking the diversionary planes and too few acting as warning sets, or else because they made a very low approach followed by a  very high climb at about 15 miles range.

There were no bandits on the screen within 20 miles when at 1131 a Zeke was seen diving from _a great height on to H.M.S. FORMIDABLE and engaged by gunfire. A.C.1 thereupon manoeuvred his Force under wheel at high speed by successive emergency turns. Though reported hit  by close rang  weapons from his target, the Kamikaze crashed into the flight deck of H.M.S. FORMIDABLE n ar the  island structure arid started a large fire in  the deck park of aircraft. : A.C.1 manoeuvred the formation to keep in close  touch with the damaged ship, whose speed was -femporarily reduced to 18 knots. .

The Kamikaze appeared to release his bomb just before the aircraft hit the deck, causing the following damage: casualties 8 killed and 47 wounded; x Corsair and 10 Avengers damaged, beyond repair; all radar except one set put out of action; both barriers damaged, the forward one irreparable; flight deck holed 2 feet square, indentation ro feet square and 2 feet deep at the centre; armoured deck splinter passed through hangar deck, horizontal partition between down takes, escape  hatch which was shut, and so to the centre boiler room where it caused slight damage and loss of steam, and finally pierced the inner bottom. |

Two minutes Jater, at 1133, 2 enemy aircraft crashed in flames ten miles to the southward, the result of our fighters.

At 1134 a Zeke flying fromi forward to aft off the starboard bow of H.M.S. INDOMITABLE was engaged by 4.5 in. guns and temporarily disappeared in cloud.. It soon Teappeared diving at the ship as steeply as.  about 60  from the  starboard beam. The Force was turning to starboard at the time and H.M.S. INDOMITABLE's wheel was increased to hard.over. As the plane approached it was heavily engaged by close range weapons from the ship and set on fire; it flattened out at-the last  moment, deck landed on the  flight deck, and bounded over the side, taking the radar arrays of the port midships directors with  it. The bomb appeared to explode shortly -after. the  plane submerged. : .

At ir42 another Zeke dived steeply on H.M.S. INDOMITABLE whose close range weapons and those of H'M.S..QUALITY hit  him hard and often. The aircraft burst: into flames and crashed into the sea about ro. yards-off the starboard bow of the ship.    ..
