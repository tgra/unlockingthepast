‘CONCLUSIONS
Japan’s defeat. ’

540. Japan, in her disastrous war against the
.Allied Powers, was defeated largely by her own
misjudgment—embarking upon a policy of
expansion which lengthened too far her lines
of communication without providing adequ-
ately armed forces for their protection and
maintenance.

541. Expansion brought the Japanese, in
their initial flush of success, to the very thres-
hold of India at a time when the Allies were
least prepared to resist her westward march.

542. Defeat for the Japanese in South East
Asia, I consider, had its begnning in the air
battles over the Arakan in late 1943 and the
opening months of 1944, when Allied air
superiority was obtained.

543, It is my opinion that the cardinal weak-
‘ness in Japan’s war of aggression was un-
doubtedly a badly balanced war machine, which
showed too heavy a bias in favour of land
forces, and a much too weak air force, also
air potential,

344. Without air support, the J: apanese
Anny in South East Asia fought a losing battle
after Allied air superiority had been won. The
numbers actually killed during their campaign
in Burma were enormous, whilst the number
that perished in the jungle will never be
known. This Japanese Army provided a grim
reminder to any Army that embarks upon
operations without adequate air support.

Close Support operations.

545, According to the Japanese, it is im-
possible to state definitely which of our Allied
fighters had the greatest effect morally upon
their ground forces in South East Asia, as each
fighter had its own characteristics. The effect
differed according to the nature of the target
attacked and the time of the attack, whether
by day or by night. On an assessment of the
Allied fighter aircraft individually, however, it
appears that the enemy considered the Spitfire,
a Thunderbolt and the Mustang surpassed
all others.

Fighter, and fighter/bomber offensive opera-
tions. ‘

546. The effect of the Beaufighter and
Mosquito attacks on Japanese shipping in the
Gulf of Martaban during the early months of
1945- was such that the enemy stopped move-
ment of shipping by day, and did movements
only at night. In this way enemy shipping was
conserved.

347. On the other hand, the harassing attacks
these aircraft carried out on the enemy’s road,
rail and river transport areas was exceedingly
effective. While it cost them few casualties
to. men, the air. attacks, according to the
Japanese, made troop as well as supply move-
ments virtually impossible. Materials and food,
they stated, became difficult to move, and this
had a bad effect upon the civilian population.

548. Our policy of surprise raids on the
enemy’s rear airfields was most effective. In
this respect the American fighter attacks on
these airfields were not- only effective, ‘but
greatly. helped’ to ~ reduce the - operational
strength of the Japanese Army. Air Force. -

Heavy Bomber Operations. .

549. The heavy bomber attacks which our
aircraft carried out on Rangoon, and on supply
dumps in the’ vicinity, cannot be compared, in
effectiveness, to the heavy air attacks made on

“bridges, railway tracks, marshalling yards and

important installations in other enemy ocoupied
areas. The dumps in the Rangoon area which
were targets of attack were, according to the
enemy, destroyed to some extent, but they did

* not greatly affect Japanese morale. The bomb-

ing of Rangoon itself, however, which was
continued for almost a month before the
enemy’s evacuation, had a marked effect upon
their morale. The effect of the bombings on
the civilian population appeared to be small
because only military targets were bombed.

550. Bombing raids on military installations
in the rear areas were admitted by the
Japanese to be most effective, and many targets,
some highly important to the Japanese war
effort, were destroyed. The attacks, it appears,
could have been even more effective had our
bombers struck at the targets over a wider
area, as enemy installations were immediately
divided up into sections and scattered once a
target area was hit. .

Air Mining Operations Affect Supply.

551. I consider it exceedingly gratifying, and
indeed, interesting, to have it confirmed by
the Japanese themselves that the isolation of
large sea transports, as the result of our air
mining operations, seriously affected the
Japanese supply situation. The mines were
Jaid by our aircraft in the Rangoon River and °
off the Tenasserim and Malayan coasts. The
sowing of these mines, the Japanese stated,
was directly responsible for’ the sinking of
important supply ships.

552. Our air mining programme, which
‘began on 21st January, 1945, and was discon-
tinued on 24th May, 1945, since the stage was
then being set finally for the assault on Malaya,
resulted in a total of 925 mines being dropped
in the specified areas. The minelaying opera-
tions were 86.9 successful—only 29 mines being
dropped foul, and 80 being brought back by
aircraft to base. . . .

553. From a tactical point of view, I was
interested to learn that, of all the weapons
which we used against the Japanese in Burma
-—rockets, machine-guns, cannon, bombs and
Napalm—the machine-guns had the most effect.
both morally and physically, upon their groun
forces. . ; en fe

554, During the advance of our. ground
troops, the feints and dummy -atiacks by our
supporting aircraft proved very effective in
keeping the’ Japanese under“ cover—a. highly
important factor when troops are storming
strongly-held positions. 2

555. Close support by the Japanese Army
Air Force was negligible. Its development
was dependent upon adequate air strength, arid
as the Japanese Army. Air Force gradually
dwindled away to nothing,.close support -for
their ground forces was therefore impracticable.
