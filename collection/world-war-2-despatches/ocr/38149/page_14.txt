in May, 1941, when’ the greater part,,of the
German, air forces were transferred to the
Russian front. After May there were a few
major raids (e.g., on Birmirigham on 4-5th
June, Southampton on 21-22nd June, and Hull
on 17-18th July). The scale of attack, how-
ever, gradually decreased, and for the:rest of
- the year, apart from occasional attacks on other
targets, the remaining German forces in the
West were thrown mainly into the Battle of
the Atlantic by attacks on ports and shipping
and by heavy minelaying: ‘The position in the
Atlantic was still most precarious and the
,attacks made were designed to increase our
"shipping difficulties,

33. Attacks on convoys continued, and
activity was most intense on the East Coast,
Hull being frequently subjected to attacks by
aircraft which were either on navigational and
operational training or which failed to locate
the shipping they had come to attack. The
Thames Estuary, St. George’s Channel and the
Mersey were also continually mined.

34. The fact that much Of this activity never
came overland and that the defences were not
therefore able to do much to hinder it caused
us much concern and I therefore proposed that
anti-aircraft forts might be situated out in the
various estuaries to hamper these attacks.

35. Mr. G. A. Maunsell, a well-known con-
sulting engineer, produced a design for a
spider-like tower which, in its fully developed
form, would carry 4 3.7-inch guns, 2 40-mm.
Bofors, x searchlight and a radar set. Work
began on these towers at once but the first
was not ready until October, 1942, when much
of the ‘minelaying effort had subsided.

Although it had originally been intended to
place them in a number of different estuaries,
tidal and other difficulties finally caused the
Project to be limited to the Thames and the
Mersey. In ‘the former, in particular, the
Maunsell Forts covered an approach which had
always been a serious gap in the defence system
and they played an important part in the de-
fence of London when heavier raiding began
again: later.

-36. -Overland night raiding began again sud-
denly in April, x942, and was apparently stimu-
lated largely by a desire for revenge for Bomber
Command’s attacks on German cities. The
main stream of Geiman raiders kept clear of
Gun Defended Areas and in these so-called
“ Baedeker ”’ raids attacked open towns and
cathedral cities; where any of the raiders
strayed into range of the gun.and rocket de-
fences of a Gun Defended Area, the defences
went into action with success. Exeter was
particularly a target for the enemy in the first

* phase of these attacks.

Within 72 hours the defence of 28 towns

» from Penzance to York which had hitherto

been undefended was put in hand. A total
of 252 guns were withdrawn chiefly from Gun
Defended Areas in the North and West. Suc-
cess was almost immediate and in the last
two raids of the April full moon period the
defences destroyed 4 enemy aircraft and prob-
ably destroyed or damaged 4 more. With the
May full moon raiding began again and
Canterbury was subjected to severe attacks,
but this form of attack also petered out in the
following months. '

1.37. A less spectacular move, of 120 Heavy
guns, was made. at the same time as the
* Baedeker ’’ deployment to augment the de-
fences of ten South Coast anchorages in which
was assembling a fleet for the invasion of North
Africa in the late Autumn. I was still much
concerned .at this time with the shortage of
equipment, for almost all new production was
being diverted to the Far East and the defences
of the west coast ports Were dangerously weak.
As large American forces were at the time dis-
embarking there, an attack on that area might
have had ‘sérious consequences. Moreover,
there was a distinct possibility that we would
have to yield a large number of guns to the
field forces under a plan, which did not actually ©
mature, for the invasion of North Europe in
1943- ;

38. Meanwhile on 27th March, 1942, a day
battle had begun, - This was in answer to our own
fighter sweeps across the channel and consisted
of tip-and-run low level raids on coastal towns
by fast fighter-bombers. There appeared:.to
be no military significance in these attacks nor
were they on a scale to do much harm.

It would appear that one of the most striking
lessons from these raids was the very great
value of A.A. guns and balloons in mi!
civilian casualties and damage, quite apart from.
the infliction of casualties on the attacking’ air-
craft. Objectives with no balloons and few
guns (e.g., Exeter) suffered badly in these raids,
whereas those with adequate static defences
came off comparatively lightly.

39. The weapon with which to counter the low-
flying raider was the Light gun but the supply’
of these was seriously limited. Not only had
I yielded up some for the Far East but new
production was also fully absorbed by that
theatre of war. When 189 guns were needed to
help defend the anchorages on the south coast
I was able only to provide 76, and many of
those were withdrawn from the defence of vital
industrial plants. Further, no less than 57 dif-
ferent coastal towns between St. Ives and
Aldeburgh had been attacked by September,
1942, and the problem of defending all of these
and also others which might be subject to attack
would have required a number of guns far in-
excess of those available. As it was, in June;”
1942, when guns from production began to
come forward: once more, we allotted 104 of
these to what were termed the Fringe Target
towns.

- 40; Towards the end of September, 1942, it
was clear that the attacks,, however unimpor- ’
tant from a military point of view, must be
stopped and it was at that time that the equip-
ment situation had eased sufficiently to allow
steps to be taken. Production had improved
and Anti-Aircraft Command was receiving a
greater share of it; inland industrial targets had
had their defences replaced and these could
be denuded once again, and the Admiralty were
steadily returning the guns lent them a year
previously. My intention was now to join the
battle with all the forces I.could' muster with a .
view to inflicting such losses on the enemy that
he would have to give up this form of attack.
No half-measures could be successful. By the
end of September, 1942, 267 40-mm. Bofors
guns had been deployed on the. coast, another
tro. eould be withdrawn from factories and I
was informed that I could expect 142 from
Production in October, 1942.
