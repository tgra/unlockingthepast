Aide Memoire of 1th September, was, therefore, to maintain internal security, and to prepare for an unopposed occupation of Crete and  Rhodes when-the German garrisons should be withdrawn. For this, I was to have under my command at. least two armoured divisions, one infantry division, and the equivalent of three further divisions of unbrigaded troops. I was to hold reserves and reinforcements for these six divisions and, in addition, for troops awaiting transfer to Italy, and I was to maintain permanent transit arrangements for New Zealand, Australian, Indian and African troops anywhere in the Mediterranean theatre. The maintenance of British troops in Italy was to be progressively undertaken by bases in Italy as they were developed during the ensuing six to nine months, and Middle East was to maintain its own  * garrison  , including services for the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force, to provide Eastetn Group Supplies for the Mediterranean theatre, to maintain any. forces extra to the six divisions of   garrison  troops which might be in the Middle East, and to continue production for local consumption and to meet the requirements of the other Mediterranean theatres. No provision was made for sending troops to Turkey or to the Aegean.",

            "description": "The effects of this German misappreciation lasted for some time and it was not until the zgth that the German Corps Commander issued a strong Order of the Day which showed that he had at last realized that a serious attempt at a break-through was intended. In spite of this on the 30th elements of both 5 Corps and the Canadians crossed the River Foglia and captured the advanced positions of the   Gothic   line before the enemy had time to man them. On 3xst August and 1st September a further advance gave us a stretch of the main defences some twenty miles long, from the coast to Monte Calvo, The works were not manned, many of the minefields were still carefully marked and set at safe and in one case some recently arrived troops were actually captured while sweeping out the bunkers which they were to occupy. The parachutists, all of whom had acknowledged, by imitialling, an order from Kesselring stating that the   Gothic   line was the last hope in Italy before the Brenner and that they were to hold their positions for three weeks, pulled out of Pesaro on the night of ist September and raced back behind the Conca. In the fighting so far they had suffered very heavily, up to half the strength with which they went into action; it was only their hasty retreat which prevented them from being encircled by an outflanking move of the Polish Corps.",
