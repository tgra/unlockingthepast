problem in Burma. These were the reasons
that were the motive of my qualified acceptance
of the Generalissimo’s offer. It should be noted
that a Chinese ‘‘ Army ’’ was approximately
the equivalent in numbers of a British division
but with a much lower scale of equipment.

I am quite satisfied that my decision was
justified by the military situation as it appeared
to me at the time. Nor had I any reason to
know that the Chinese .attached great’ political
importance to the acceptance of the offer. The
Generalissimo himself showed comparatively
little interest in the matter and made no attempt
to press me; three-quarters of the lengthy dis-
cussions I had with him were devoted to the
question of the establishment of an Allied
Council at Chungking and to consideration of
an ambitious plan for defeat of the Japanese in
1942. . .

From subsequent experience of the slowness ot
Chinese troop moves, I think that even if I
had accepted the whole of the Fifth and Sixth
Armies at once they would actually have
reached Burma very little, if any, sooner than
they eventually did.

As things turned out, I admit that it would
have saved much criticism in China and in the
U.S.A. had I accepted the Generalissimo’s
generous offer whole-heartedly and at once. I
do not, however, think that it would have made
any difference in the end to the defence of
Burma.

12. When I returndl to India, I found that
the troops I was counting on for Burma were
being taken from my control for the
reinforcement of Malaya. Already the War
Cabinet had ordered one brigade group of the
18 British Division and two brigade groups
of the 17 Indian Division to Malaya, as well
‘as anti-aircraft and anti-tank artillery. The
remainder of the 18 Division was also put
under orders for Malaya shortly afterwards.
Thus of the two complete divisions on which
I had reckoned one divisional headquarters
and one brigade only remained. I still
believed the African brigades available and ex-
pected the first to arrive in Burma by the
middle of February. It was not until that date
that I received a cable to say that the leading
brigade was delayed. Actually it did not em-
bark in East Africa till after Rangoon had
fallen.

13. On 23rd December and 25th December
the Japanese made two large scale air raids on
Rangoon. They caused practically no military
damage but civilian casualties in the first raid
were high, and the flight of the population
from Rangoon began. From now to the final
evacuation of the city, the working of the essen-
tial services, the provision of labour to unload
ships and the cessation of all business became
a major problem for the Government and a
serious military embarrassment. The presence
‘on all routes leading towards India of many
thousands of refugees, which soon grew to hun-
‘dreds of thousands, was another problem that
occupied both civil and military to the end of
the campaign.

TRANSFER OF BurMA TO A.B.D.A. COMMAND.

14. On 30th December, 1941, I received a
telegram appointing me to the newly constituted

South-West Pacific Command (afterwards
known as A.B.DA.). Burma was in-
cluded in this Command. J at once

recommended that the defence of Burma

should remain the responsibility of Com-
mander-in-Chief, India, for the same reasons
for which I had previously urged __ its
transfer to India from the Far East Com-
mand (see paragraph 3). I was, however, over-
ruled on the grounds that Marshal Chiang-Kai-
Shek must feel himself connected with the new
South West Pacific Command. I think that
this decision was a serious error from the mili-
tary point of view. From my headquarters
in Java, 2,000 miles distant from Rangoon,
and concerned as I was with an immense area
and many international problems, it was im-
possible for me to give as close attention to
the defence of Burma as was desirable; nor
had I any reinforcements at my disposal to aid
Burma, They must come almost entirely from
India. Moreover, administration of the forces
in Burma had necessarily to be conducted from
India; and it is always wrong to separate opera-
tional and administrative responsibility.

General Sir Alan Hartley who succeeded me
as Commander-in-Chief, India, did everything
possible to meet Burma’s requirements. What
was lacking was the close personal touch of
the responsible commander. During the five
weeks that Burma remained under A.B.D.A.
Command, I was only able to pay two hurried
visits; and owing to faulty signal communica-
tions, messages and reports from Burma some-
times took several days to reach me in Java.
It was during these five weeks that the fate of
Burma was decided.

15. I took over control of South West Pacific
Command on 15th January, and established
A.B.D.A. Command Headquarters in Java,
near Bandoeng, a few days late. During the
first half of January there had been little sign
of enemy activity against Burma. The maxi-
mum scale of Japanese attack was still estimated
as one division against Moulmein and one divi-
sion against Kentung with possibly brigade
groups against Toungoo and Mongpan. I admit
that I did not at this time consider the threat to
Burma serious; I over-estimated the natural
difficulties of the wooded hills on the Burmese
frontier. Nor did I realise the unreliable
quality of the Burma units nor the lack of
training of the British and Indian troops.

I was certainly guilty of an error of judg-
ment in minimising the danger to Burma, but
it is doubtful whether, even if I had appre-
ciated it thoroughly, I could have done much
more to help Burma. India had been sucked
dry of trained troops by the requirements of
Middle East, Iraq and Iran; and those most
nearly approaching completion of their train-
ing had been sent to reinforce Singapore. Such
as could be extracted from frontier garrisons
and internal security duties were being sent to
Burma as rapidly as possible. The same
applies to administrative units. India was
deficient of equipment for her own needs and
could not meet those of Burma as well. Finally,
and most important of all, India had no
modern air force with which to support the
Burma Army. ,

JAPANESE ATTACK ON BURMA

16. The Japanese advance on Burma began
with engagements in the neighbourhood of
Tavoy which was occupied by the enemy on
xgth January. Meanwhile the garrison at
Mergui further south was withdrawn without
being attacked. On 2oth January, fighting
began in Northern Tenasserim with an attack
