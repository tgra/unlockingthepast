            "description": "By this time good progress had been made with the re-formation, in France, of the twenty divisions destroyed at Stalingrad, and other exhausted divisions from the Eastern Front were resting there. If the precedent of 1942 had been followed these re-formed divisions should have been employed once more in Russia; instead, any idea of a serious offensive in the east was renounced and they were to be made available for the defence of the southern front. There were no organisational difficulties in their employment in Italy for there were already in existence there the installations which had served for the transit of divisions bound for the war in Africa and Kesselring, the Commander-in-Chief, South (Oberbefehlshaber Siid), was already on the spot. The first necessity was to provide for the security of the islands; two divisions went to Sicily and one to Sardinia and an S.S. brigade to Corsica.

On the 19th July General Ettore Bastico took over the Supreme Command in Libya from General Garibaldi. It is probable that the appointment of General Bastico, a reported expert on mechanised warfare, was intended as much to show that Italian interests in Libya were at least equal to German interests in Libya as to reorganise the Italian forces and revive their morale."
