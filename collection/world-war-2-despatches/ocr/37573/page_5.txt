SuMMaRy oF OPERATIONS OF B.E.F. in FRANCE
From IST To 18TH JUNE, 1940.

"1. After the evacuation of the main British
Expeditionary Force from Flanders in the first
week of June the only British troops remaining
in France were the 51st Division, which had
been holding a sector of the Sarre Front, and
the incomplete ist Armoured Division, which
had begun its disembarkation on zoth May
and had been rushed up piecemedl in a
desperate effort to relieve the sorely tried right
flank of the B.E.F. By the ist June this

attenuated Division, which was incomplete
when disembarked and had lost heavily in its
first engagement on- the Somme, could only
muster roughly one-third of its quota of tanks.

2. These two formations, the 51st Division
‘and the rst Armoured Division, the only British
fighting’ formations remaining in France, were
placed under the orders of General Altmayer,
ing Tenth French Army, which held
the left sector of the Somme front from Amiens
to the sea, The handling of the British troops,
which had been delegated to General Altmayer
by General Weygand, was co-ordinated and
supervised by a British Military Mission at
Tenth Army Headquarters.

3. The frontage allotted to the 51st Division
on the Somme sector was sixteen miles in
extent, an excessive amount, but probably not
much greater than that which many French
divisions were holding at the time owing to
their depleted resources. The Division had
already been in action on the Sarre front, and
had had a long and arduous journey from the
Eastern frontier to its new sector. On 4th June
the 51st Division Commander was ordered to
carry out an attack on the Abbeville bridge-
head, for which operation the newly arrived
French 31st Division was placed under his
orders, as well as 160 French tanks and a con-
siderable reinforcement of French artillery. The
attack, however, was not a success, mainly
owing to the difficulty of arranging effective
co-operation between British and French
infantry, guns and tanks at such short notice,
and the 51st Division suffered fairly heavy
casualties.

4. On the following day (5th June) the Ger-
mans launched a powerful offensive against the
whole front held by the Seventh and Tenth
French Armies, from St. Quentin to the sea.
The 51st Division was by this time in an
exhausted condition, after 12 days of continual
movement and battle, and was holding too wide
a front to be able to resist effectively. The
Tenth Army Commander, when asked to relieve
the Division from the front, replied that he
had no reserves available. The Division fought
bravely, but was forced back by German in-
filtration between its widely scattered posts.
Owing to the extent of its frontage the division
had no depth in its defences, and had no time
to organize rearward defences, nor any reserves
with which to counter-attack. It was forced
back to the line of the river Bresle, the next
natural obstacle, 15 miles in rear.

5. Meanwhile the 1st Armoured Division was
re-fitting south of the Seine. Its tanks were
in poor mechanical condition, owing not only
to battle casualties, but also to the long road
distances they had been forced to cover and
to the lack of opportunity for adequate main-
tenance. It was in fact in no condition for
offensive operations.

6. On the 7th June the Germans put in a
smashing attack with their 5th and 7th
Armoured Divisions on the point of junction
between the two Corps of the Tenth French
Army. This drive was directed from west of
Amiens on Rouen and the lower Seine, with
the object of splitting the Tenth Army and cut-
ting off its IX Corps between the Seine Estuary
and Dieppe. The IX French Corps then com-
prised the British 51st Division on the extreme
left, and then further east the 31st and goth
French Divisions and the znd and 5th Light
