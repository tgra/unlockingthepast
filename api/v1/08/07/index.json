            "description": "39. At z040 hours on ~7th August a report was received of an Italian column having entered Bulhar, 40 miles .west of Berbera. H.M.S. Ceres, patrolling off this coast, engaged this column and stopped its advance. At 1050 hours on the same day the enemy began a series of attacks against the 2nd Black Watch and the two Companies 2nd K.A.R. at Barkasan, which lasted till dark. The attack- ing force consisted of at least a brigade of fresh troops with artillery and tanks, which had been brought forward in M.T. An attack on the left of the position was first repulsed; and then a battalion attacked the centre Company and in spite of heavy casualties began to surround the forward posts. The position was restored by the Company Commander,. Captain D. MacN. C. Rose, who, with three carriers, led his Company Headquarters and reserve platoon in a bayonet charge which: threw the enemy back some 500 yards. Later the enemy again attacked the left and centre with infantry sup- ported by eight to ten tanks, of which at least two were larger than light tanks. This attack was also checked by the use of the reserve Company. At least one medium and two light tanks were destroyed by the fire of the Bofors. Towards evening a serious threat by another enemy battalion began to develop against the right flank, and there seemed a danger that the whole force might be cut off from its trans- port and line of retreat. A gradual withdrawal was therefore ordered. \u2018The rear parties of The Black Watch hung on to their posts until night fell and the whole force -was able to reach its transport and embus without interference, the enemy failing to take advantage of his superior numbers or to press home his attack."

But the Allied side need not wait until Badoglio felt secure enough to move; the optimism of the early days of the Sicilian invasion, which had become dashed with more sober reflections as the deadlock before Catania continued, was reborn. At a conference at Carthage next day, 26th July, attended by General Eisenhower, Admiral Cunningham, Air Marshal Tedder and myself, we decided \u201cthat greater risks might now legitimately be taken. Accordingly on 27th July General Clark, com- manding the Fifth Army, was directed to pre- pare plans for seizing the port of Naples \u201c\u2018 with a view to preparing a firm base for further offensive operations.\u2019\u2019 The target date was to be 7th September and an outline. plan was to be submitted by 7th August.

After the departure of these ships, nearly all personnel of the Troupes Frangais du Levant had been repatriated."
