But both Corps Commanders asked for twenty-four hours\u2019 respite so that they might assemble and prepare their forces. In the course of the day, however, two important facts were discovered which changed the whole com- plexion of affairs: it became clear that the enemy had no intention of withdrawing, and furthermore that the greater part of his striking force was still lying astride our minefield \u2018with a considerable number of tanks in its midst. We could muster about two hundred and twenty medium tanks, and the enemy almost certainly no fewer. Consequently General Ritchie decided that it was necessary first to reduce the main body of the enemy, since they might threaten Tobruk and the Army\u2019s rear while the projected offensive was in progress."

            "description": "67. The Strategic Air Force carried out one more duty during the period, the reinforce- ment with crews and aircraft of the transport squadrons maintaining the life-line to forces cut off on the Imphal Plain. On 19th May forty Wellington crews were attached to Troop Carrier Command to help the over-worked crews there, and five aircraft and crews were detailed to carry 250-Ib. bombs to the tactical squadrons operating at high pressure in the Imphal Plain. Despite bad weather, 544 bombs were delivered by 31st May. In the same period, No. 490 U.S. (Mitchell) Squadron delivered 380 tons of ammunition to the forces defending Imphal. The offensive power which these loads represented contributed to the eventual breaking of the Japanese offensive and enabled the normal transport aircraft to concentrate on delivering jother supplies of which the Army was in urgent need."

II Corps was to secure the -high ground north of Valmontone, seize the northern part of the Alban Hills and pursue any enemy attempting to withdraw northwards across its front. -The Germans were still resisting desperately and still apparently with the same orders, to keep us out of Rome at all costs. Even now, with Fifth Army on the Alban Hills and their centre disintegrating under Eighth Army\u2019s blows, they continued to hope that the situation might yet be stabilized; captured enemy documents show that as late as 2nd June von Mackensen was still ordering resistance to the last and making plans for the redisposition of his forces with apparent confidence in the possibility of success. It is a striking example of German reluctance to yield ground even in the most serious circumstances, carried this time to a disastrous extreme."
