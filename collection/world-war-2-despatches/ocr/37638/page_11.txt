well as to Palestine; and finally there still
remained the remnants of the Italian forces in
Abyssinia to be cleared up if possible before
the rainy season set in.

To deal with these many responsibilities my
resources were completely inadequate. To
equip the forces for Greece I had had to strip
many units of weapons and transport and all

equipment that could not be carried had been”

lost. Transport was still reaching Middle East
in very limited quantities and was the chief
obstacle to completing for war a number of
units and formations. My armoured troops,
except for the detachment in Tobruk, consisted
only of one weak battalion of Cruiser tanks and
one, also incomplete, of “‘I’’ tanks. The
formations which had fought in Greece, the
6th Australian Division and the New Zealand
Division, required rest, reorganisation and
Te-equipment, but were at present divided
between Crete and Egypt. The 7th Australian
Division was complete but had one brigade
locked up im Tobruk.
Division was in the Tobruk defences. The 6th
Division had never been completely formed. It
had only two infantry brigades (22nd Guards
and 16th) and one other battalion, the Buffs.
The 14th Brigade, which should have completed
it, had been transferred to Crete. Of these two
brigades, the 22nd Guards Brigade had 50 per
cent. of its t rt, while the 16th Brigade
and the Buffs had practically none. It had
only one field regiment of artillery and only
two field companies of Engineers. The Polish
Brigade was not complete in transport. The
ist Cavalry Division in Palestine had been
stripped of its artillery, Engineers, Signals and
transport to provide for the needs of other
formations; it could provide one motorised
cavalry brigade by pooling the whole of the
divisional motor transport. Of the unbrigaded
infantry battalions, two were under orders to
teinforce Malta, and the remainder were hard
put to it to find the necessary guards and
escorts for the prisoners of war (of whom there
were still over 100,000 in Egypt) and other
internal security duties in Egypt and Palestine.
All these battalions were short of transport and
were equipped for static duties only.

From the above, which included no single
complete formation available, I had to provide
for the defence of the western frontier of Egypt,
the defence of Crete, the restoration of the
situation in Iraq and for a possible commitment
in Syria. The German attacks by air on the
Canal which began in February caused a fresh
commitment, since large numbers of observers
were required to watch for mines dropped-in the
Canal, Eventually the Egyptian Army took
over a large part of this duty, and thus gave
most effective aid to the defence of the Canal.

The 4th Indian Division was on its way from
East Africa and the rst South African Division
would be available very shortly. But the move
of both of these divisions depended on the
provision of shipping, which was hard to come

y.

49. The enemy advance in Cyrenaica had
been checked on the frontier of Egypt and the
active defence of the garrison of Tobruk con-
stituted a menace to the enemy’s line of com-
munications, which was likely to prevent his
further advance. He had made one determined
attack on Tobruk on 1st May and had been
severely repulsed with heavy losses in tanks

and in men. But the garrison of Tobruk was
small for the perimeter it had to defend and it
was known that another German armoured
division, which might include as many as 400
medium tanks, had been landed in Libya and
was on its way to the forward area, where it
was expected to appear early in May. If the
enemy also reinforced this air forces in Libya
and delivered a determined attack on the
Tobruk defences and harbour, we might he
hard put to it to maintain the Tobruk garrison.

50. The 6th Division, as already stated, had
been preparing and training for an operation
against the Italian Dodecanese. Since, however, _
the Navy had been unable to support any ex-
pedition against the Dodecanese while engaged
in convoying our troops to Greece, it had been
necessary to postpone the operation until the
completion of the move to Greece. When the
German counter-offensive against Cyrenaica
took place, it was necessary to move the 6th
Division from their training areas to man the

defences of Mersa Matruh, to guard against a

German break through to the Delta. The 7th
Australian Division (less one brigade in Tobruk)
had also to be used for the defence of the
Western Desert, and the Polish Brigade to man
the Delta defences. The one incomplete
armoured brigade was also allotted to the
western defence of Egypt.

Thus, practically the whole of the resources
at my disposal had to be used to safeguard the
Egyptian base against the threat from the west;
the one mobile force which could be improvised
in Palestine, the cavalry brigade group, was
soon to be despatched to the rescue of Habban-
iyeh in Iraq; and my only reserves in Egypt
and Palestine were the New Zealand and
Australian reinforcements.

51. There was on its way across the Mediter-
ranean a convoy of ships containing some 200
tanks to re-equip the 7th Armoured Division
and to counter the German armoured troops in
the Western Desert. They were due to arrive
in Egypt on 12th May, and all preparations to
equip these tanks with the necessary fittings
for use in the desert, and to place them in
action with the least possible delay were made.
The great majority of these tanks, however,
were “I” tanks, the limited range and slow-
ness of which made them ill-suited for use
against fast moving German tanks in the wide
open spaces of the Western Desert.

The convoy duly reached Egypt on 12th May
with the loss of one ship containing 57 tanks,
which was sunk by a mine. The problem now
was whether these tanks could be manned and
put into action before the German reinforce-
ments arrived in the forward area. It was
originally hoped that it might be possible to
get all the tanks unloaded, through the work-
shops and ready for action by about the end of
May. This estimate was to prove optimistic.

The Defence of Crete.

52. Meanwhile the arrangements for the
defence of Crete were my particular preoccupa-
tion. Evidence accumulated fast of the
German intentions. There was a large con-
centration of German aircraft in the south of
Greece, and eign d of ee pee of
airborne troops and of preparations for ai
attack on Coolerbi a large scale by air and by
