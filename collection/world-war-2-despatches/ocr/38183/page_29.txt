SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 22 JANUARY, 1948

‘Cameron (protecting the South of Victoria),
which had been heavily bombarded by the
Japanese, and the Middlesex Regiment beat off
an attack on Leighton Hill. The enemy, how-
ever, penetrated through the A.R.P..tunnels
and street fighting began at Wanchai. The con-
duct of the civil population, which had thus far
suffered some 4,000 casualties (1,000 killed),
was, however, good and had become increas-
ingly so since, the first depression after the
evacuation of the mainland.
On the same day the forces isolated in the
- South of the Island made an effort to counter-
attack towards Stanley Mound, but to no avail.
On the 24th December the Royal Scots, fol-
lowing heavy enemy attacks, were driven off
the top of Mount Cameron, and Leighton Hill
was captured after bombardment. The posi-
tion in the South of the Island was unchanged.
On the 25th December, in the early hours of
- the morning, street fighting took place as the
enemy fought his way towards the centre of the
town, but another Japanese demand for sur-
render was refused. Two hours later, how-
ever, the Governor was advised by the Military
and Naval commanders that further effective
resistance could not be made, and, after carry-
ing out a series of demolitions, our forces were
ordered to lay down their arms. The Chinese
kept their word and had endeavoured to assist
the defence of Hong Kong by advancing on
Canton, but their force was not strong enough
to produce any serious effect on the Japanese.

XIV.—OPERATIONS IN BURMA AND SARAWAK,
Burma

127. A fresh field of operations opened in
Burma on the gth December, when a landing
was reported at Prachuabkhirikun, a clear
threat to Mergui and the Tenasserim Peninsula.

On the rrth December, Tavoy was bombed.
A further enemy landing at Chumporn (Siam)
gave access to the southernmost tip of Burma,
and an advance on Victoria Point threatened.
In the next two or three days the Japanese
advance materialised and coincided with raids
on Mergui by about fifty aircraft, propaganda
leaflets being dropped as well as bombs. An
effort was made to cut off the Japanese advance
southwards by crossing the Siam frontier to
demolish the railway a few miles south of
Prachuabkhirikun, but the strength of the op-
position and the heavy rains proved too great
for the success of this expedition. The situa-
tion was still in an undeveloped stage, but with
a clear threat to Southern Burma, when on the
15th December Burma reverted to the province
of the Commander-in-Chief, India. (See para.
29 above.)

Sarawak,

128. The general problem of the defence of
‘Borneo was indicated in para. 16 above. The
‘oil denial scheme was put into operation at the
outbreak of war and completed by the 11th
‘December. The landing ground at Miri was also
demolished and the forces at Lutong evacuated
by sea to Kuching in H.M.S. Lipis. *,

The Company of 2/15 Punjab Regiment re-
joined the rest of its Battalion, which formed
the regular garrison of Kuching and the remain-
ing individuals—from the and Loyals and S.S.
Police—were ‘brought on to Singapore.

Considerable anxiety and uneasiness was felt
by the authorities in Kuching owing to the ab-
sence of Naval and Air Forces. It was pointed

563

out to them, however, that many places in
England had stood up to bombing without any
direct defence, and that they would be expected
to do the same. It was evident, however, that
the morale of the population of Kuching was
in a bad way. This, in my opinion, was partly
due to the fact that the ruler, Rajah Brooke,
was absent—actually in Australia. He had a
great deal of influence with the natives, and
in view of the situation he should have returned
to his country immediately on the outbreak of
war, if not before. As it was, the Sarawak
Rangers proved quite unreliable, and the 2/15
Punjab Regiment were left to carry out the
defence by themselves.

The complete control of the South China Sea
exercised by the Japanese reduced the problem
of the capture of Kuching to a mere calculation
of the strength necessary to overcome the resist-
ance that they would probably meet. They
appear to have attacked it with the equivalent
of one Brigade Group.

129. Japanese naval forces were not long in
appearing in strength before Miri. By the 16th
December, some ten warships had been sighted
in company with a tanker off Miri and Lutong,
and these ships became the object of our attacks.
On the 17th December, 6 Glenn Martins and 5
Buffaloes of the Netherlands East Indies Air
Force delivered an attack from Sinkawang, but
scored neither hits nor near misses. The same
day, Dutch bombers from Samiuwkoa located
and attacked this force, a Dutch navy Dornier
scoring a direct hit on a destroyer. Encounters
between Dutch Buffaloes and the Navy Zero
fighters revealed the clear superiority of the
Japanese aircraft. Reports of a Japanese land-
ing at Lutong and Baram Point were received,
and on the 18th December renewed attacks on
enemy shipping in this area were made, with-
out success, by a mixed force. Eight Glenn
Martins from Sinkawang had to return without
delivering their attack owing to the bad
weather, The following day 6 Netherlands East
Indies Glen Martins claimed a ‘hit on a cruiser
and some near misses. The roth December,
however, was also marked by Japanese air
attacks, Kuching aerodrome and town being
bombed by about 15 heavy bombers and one
seaplane. Civilians suffered approximately 100
casualties, while the main material damage was
the destruction of the Borneo Company Benzine
Stores, The air war was also carried to Dutch
Territory by a heavy attack on Pontianak,
much of the city ‘being destroyed.

An expedition clearly aimed at Kuching was
then sighted on the 23rd December, and 5
Blenheim IVs, attacking this on the 24th
December, scored one hit on a transport and
some near misses. Air support from Sinkawang
was no longer possible in view of the damage
to the aerodrome from’ a Japanese attack, and
the Dutch aircraft were withdrawn to Palem-
bang.

The 2/15 Punjab Regiment carried out
demolitions on the aerodromes, held: up the
Japanese for a time, and eventually moved in
accordance with orders, along a jungle path,
to join up with the Dutch, though this necessi-
tated abandoning practically the whole of their
equipment.

It was, noteworthy that Malay labour at
Kuching disappeared as the course of. opera-
tions approached the area.

According to later reports, some 800 of the
2/15 Punjab Regiment joined the Dutch and
