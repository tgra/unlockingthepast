to the meagre resources available in the Middle
East to meet its very wide responsibilities. It
was necessary to keep the commitment in
British Somaliland to a minimum, hoping to
the last that the French would continue the
struggle at Jibuti, of which I had had repeated
assurances from General Legentilhomme. The
poverty of Berbera as a port made landing slow
and difficult when reinforcements did arrive.

VI. APPRECIATION OF SERVICES.

49. I wish especially to bring to notice the
work of Brigadier A. R. Chater, D.S.O.,
O.B.E. Throughout a most difficult and trying
period his work and spirit have been admir-
able. His disposition of his slender resources
has always been made with sound judgment;
his appreciations of the situation have been well
founded; and the way in which he has inspired
and led the forces under his command has been
admirable. I consider that his services in
Somaliland deserve special recognition.

50. Major-General A. R. Godwin Austen
showed great skill in his handling of operations
during the short period he was in command.
He took over while a battle was in progress,
grasped the situation rapidly, and by his per-
sonal energy and spirit did much to inspire
the resistance. It was due to his well thought
out arrangements that the evacuation was
carried out with so little loss.

THE SOMALILAND CAMPAIGN.
INTRODUCTION.

On 6th July, 1940, G.H.Q. Middle East
asked O.C. Somaliforces whether, if the French
at Jibuti accepted the terms of the armistice,
he considered that British Somaliland was un-
tenable and that troops should be gradually
withdrawn. 0.C. Somaliforces replied that
with certain additional military forces he did
not consider the position in Somaliland unten-
able provided he could rely on his Naval re-
quirements and on air support from Aden.

2. In forwarding Somaliforce signal to
G.H.Q., A.O.C. Aden stated that ‘‘ a measure
of air support could be provided but air forces
here (in Aden) are small and have prior com-
mitment with convoys and in defence of Aden.”’

3. The role of the air forces in Aden has
been clearly defined:—

(a) Protection of convoys.

(b) Neutralisation of enemy air forces as
far as possible to achieve (a) above and to
protect shipping at Aden.

4. Permission was, however, obtained from
H.Q. R.A.F. Middle East for a flight of air-
craft to give close support in Somaliland to the
best of their ability. It was never intended
by Higher Command to use any more than
this flight in close support of the Army except
in the case of emergency.

OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE RoyAL
Atr Force.
From outbreak of War with Italy up to Start
of Advance on Somaliland.
5. Forty-four reconnaissances were carried
out on the Somaliland-Abyssinian frontier.

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 5 JUNE, 1946

These entailed thirteen detachments to Berbera
each of about three days’ duration. During
this time our casualties were two officers
wounded, one aircraft lost and one damaged.

From 5th August to 19th August.

6. The following was carried out:—

(a) Twelve separate reconnaissances,

(b) ‘Nineteen  bombing-reconnaissances
employing thirty-two aircraft.

(c) Twenty-six bombing attacks on enemy
troop concentrations, and transport employ-
ing seventy-two aircraft.

(d) Standing fighter patrols were main-
tained over Berbera for thirteen days employ-
ing 36 sorties.

In addition to the above, No. 223 Squadron
carried out six long distance raids on enemy
bases in the back areas, including Addis Abeba.
The intention was to draw the enemy fighters
away from British Somaliland. The total num-
ber of sorties for these operations was
thirty-two. , ;

7. During these operations approximately
sixty tons of bombs were dropped and the total
number of sorties was 184.

Casualties.
8. Our casualties were as follows: —
(a) Seven aircraft lost.
(b) Ten severely damaged and a number
slightly damaged by enemy action.
(c) Twelve killed.
(d) Three wounded.

g. During the period under review the follow-
ing enemy aircraft were shot down or
damaged:—

(a) By fighters—One shot down and one
heavily hit.
(b) By bombers—Two shot down in
eS.

Achievements.

to. Long range fighters were used in stand-
ing patrols for the protection of Berbera against
air attack during the evacuation. It will be
noted that this port was reasonably immune
from air bombardment during this critical
period. Had this not been so the evacuation
might have been badly held up with unfor-
tunate consequences.

11. In co-operation with the Royal Navy our
air forces effectively delayed and finally stopped
the Italian advance along the coast road
from Zeilah to Berbera.

DirFIcuLTIES UNDER WuicH THE RoyaL Am
Force was WorkInc,

12. Although the maximum air effort pos-
sible was afforded in support of the Army in
Somaliland it may not have appeared impres-
sive from the ground. The difficulties under
which we were working were as follows:—

(a) There was no protected aerodrome

from which either our fighters or bombers
could operate in Somaliland. The two
aerodromes—one at Berbera and one at
Laferug—-were quickly made untenable by
enemy bombardment which was practically
unopposed by ground defences. Two of our
fighters were destroyed in the initial stages on
the ground owing to lack of protection nox-
mally afforded by the Army. Fighter air-
craft therefore had to be withdrawn.
