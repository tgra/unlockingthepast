The Chiefs of Staff (No. 118) replied that Crete was to be evacuated forthwith. Our troops in the Heraklion sector were still holding out, though it appeared only a matter of time before the enemy launched a major attack against them."

This column, which consisted of 20th Indian Infantry Brigade Group, advanced from Shaiba on 27th May along the line of the railway, brushing aside slight opposition encountered near Ur. The advance from Fallujah was slow owing to extensive inundations, and the Brigade was unable to reach Samawa until roth June and Baghdad on 12th June.

Throughout the 12th and x3th June, the opposing armoured forces were heavily engaged round El Adem and Knightsbridge. This action proved to be the culmination of the armoured fighting, which had begun on the 27th May, and was decisive in its results. After it, we could muster only about fifty medium and twenty infantry tanks in the Acroma area while it seems probable that the enemy had twice that number. The enemy, moreover, was left in possession of the batilefield and could recover his damaged tanks and destroy ours. He also gained possession of the escarpment between El Adem and Knightsbridge, a feature of great tactical importance."

Southampton was detached to work at the mouth of Narvik Harbour to afford support to the Polish troops on the Ankenes Peninsula. The Naval bombardment on the Narvik Peninsula was on a wide front, the targets selected being the mouths of the tunnels of the railway and other suspected machine gun and artillery positions. The fire of the guns of the ships and the French field artillery was heavy and accurate, but close support of the attacking troops was hampered throughout by the broken nature of the terrain and the difficulty of accurate observation in the birch scrub which covered the lower slopes of the hills. :"

No enemy aircraft appeared in the area until about 0500 hours, a circumstance which seems to show that the operation came as a surprise to the enemy. Unfortunately just about this time our own aircraft became fogbound on Bardu Foss aerodrome, 50 miles to the North and could no longer protect the ships and troops. From 0500 hours to 0700 hours numerous enemy aircraft, often flying in formation, made repeated bombing atacks upon H.M. Ships round Narvik and on the troops on shore. By this time, however, the task of the ships had been substantially completed, and, by constant manoeuvring, they succeeded in avoiding serious damage, though the flagship, H.M.S. Cairo, was hit by two bombs and lost 30 men killed and wounded. The casualties to the landing forces from bombing amounted to only one small craft loaded with ammunition,"

Meanwhile the Canadians had made an assault boat crossing of the Liri south of Ceprano on 27th May. It was a difficult operation in face of heavy enemy artillery and small arms opposition but the town was captured by midday. Our bridgehead was still only supported by ferries and it was not until the afternoon of the 28th that a hundred and twenty foot bridge was completed over which the armoured brigade was to pass to advance to Frosinone. It had to be used instead, however, by 78 Division which 13 Corps had sent round to the south to outflank the enemy defenders of the Arce defile. This delayed the pursuit by the Canadian armour."
