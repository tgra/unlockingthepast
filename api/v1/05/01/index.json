            "description": "In the open desert country of Cyrenaica superiority in armour was in my opinion the essential of any offensive. To achieve this we needed at least half as many tanks again as the enemy, taking into account the relative efficiency of the German tanks and our own. Over and above that we needed a reserve equal to at least twenty-five per cent. of the number deployed with units. Judging from past ex- perience, the reserve should have been double that figure; but I was prepared to take that risk. Estimates of relative strengths, based on information then available and on the assump- tion that no troops or equipment would have to be diverted to the Northern Front or elsewhere, showed that we might hope to attain the desired Position by the 1st May.*"

With the realisation that their defeat was imminent, the Germans showed their willing- ness towards the end of April to come to some agreement whereby food and other necessary supplies could be introduced into Holland under flag of truce. By the 1st May details of the scheme had been agreed with the Germans, and Allied Air Forces commenced dropping emer- gency food-stuffs to the Dutch population in ten selected areas. Royal Air Force and United States heavy bombers continued to drop some 1,500 tons of food a day until 8th May, when: the first Allied coasters arrived in Dutch waters and were given safe conduct and access to the port of Rotterdam,"

            "description": "At Tobruk the enemy made a further deter- mined attack on Ist May, employing 60 tanks supported by infantry and accompanied by heavy air attacks on our troops and defences. The enemy succeeded in breaking the outer defences of the perimeter but failed to pierce our main defences. Fighting continued for two days and on the 1st May, Hurricanes of Nos. 73 and 274 Squadrons maintained fighter patrols to protect our troops and,, artillery against enemy fighter and bomber action. The Hurricanes encountered enemy fighters, in greatly superior numbers but shot down 4 Me.r109\u2019s in flames, with the loss of 1 Hurricane. Our troops successfully counter- attacked, destroying 11 enemy tanks and inflicting other heavy losses. The enemy how- ever, retained a hold on 5,000 yards of the outer perimeter and our line was adjusted accordingly. A further attack by the enemy on the 2nd May was repulsed, after which the enemy effort there appeared to be temporarily spent."

It was hoped that it might be possible to re-equip the 7th Armoured Division before the end of May and to assume the offensive at the beginning of June. Meantime, however. the enemy was also being reinforced and was expected to bring forward an additional Ger- man armoured division by the middle of May. There was always the possibility that the enemy might forestall us and advance on the Delta before we were in a position to take the offen- sive ourselves. Defensive preparations in the Matruh area had therefore to be made at the same time."

D-day was fixed at 11th May and H-hour at 2300 hours; postponement would only be on account of bad weather and would be for periods of twenty-four hours, the decision to postpone being taken not later than 1600 hours on D-day. The breakout from Anzio, which it had already been agreed should be prepared for D plus 4, would take place when a penetration of the enemy\u2019s second line of defence on the main front (i.e. the \u2018\u2018 Hitler\u2019 line) had been achieved. It was hoped that there would be sufficient air resources to meet all the demands of both Armies but, if not, priority would go in the first phase of the attack to Eighth Army and in the second, the breakout from Anzio, to VI Corps. Until the attack was about to open the air forces would continue with their existing plan of attacks on enemy lines of communication. The effects of this were most valuable but, since this was the first time we had tried anything of this nature, there was a certain tendency to over- estimate them. I felt it necessary to emphasize that our intelligence staff credited the Germans with at Jeast four weeks supplies at full opera- tional rates and ventured the prophecy that we should have at least twenty-one days actual fighting, quite apart from days spent in move- ment, before the enemy could be defeated. It was actually twenty-four days from the open- ing of the offensive to the entry into Rome."

Before leaving Shwebo I had arranged for General Stilwell to me\u00e9t me at Ye-U at 1800 hours that evening in order to co-ordinate plans for the withdrawal from the Mandalay-Irrawaddy position. At this meeting, at which Commander 1 Burcorps was present, General Stilwell agreed that a withdrawal could no longer be delayed and the code words to put this into effect were issued at 1845 hours. General Stilwell also agreed that the situation at Monywa demanded the withdrawal of 7 Armoured Brigade from its position in sup- port of 38 Chinese Division east of the River Mu and orders were therefore issued for 7 Armoured Brigade to move forthwith on the axis Ye-U\u2014Monywa.

            "description": "62. The situation created by the Japanese occupation of Monywa was serious since it cut off all the Imperial Forces west of the River Mu from the direct approach to Ye-U through Monywa and also prevented the move of any forces up or across the Chindwin. Further, there was no regular formation of Imperial Forces in position to oppose an enemy advance \u2018direct on Ye-U. The Commander x Burcorps at once ordered the 16 Infantry Brigade to move with all speed via Shwebo to cover the approaches to Ye-U from the south. The situation in Monywa, however, improved due to the prompt action of Commander x Burcorps and the courage and tenacity of the troops and by the morning of the 1st May the town was again temporarily in our hands."
