Corps had teached’ the line of the. river
Pisciatello. .

On 17th October 2 Polish Corps, which had
taken over the sector on the left of 5 Corps
Previously under ro Corps (and commanded
in the interim by the Headquarters of the dis-
banded x Armoured Division) opened an
attack to improve our communications in the
mountains.
the minor road which leaves Route 7z at San
Piero in Bagno and joins Route 67 at Rocca
San Casciano, crossing the valleys of the
Bidente and Rabbi. Possession of Route 67
would be of the greatest importance for improv-
ing communications between the two Armies.
The Poles made good progress in the mountains.
Galeata, commanding the upper Bidente
valley, fell on 19th October and Strada, in the
valley of the Rabbi, on the 2zst; here the enemy
showed signs of an intention to resist more
strongly. Meanwhile in the plains Cesena had
been entered on 19th October and on the 2oth
4 Division seized a precarious but tenaciously
defended bridgehead over the Savio in the
neighbourhood of Route 9. Further to the south
x0 Indian Division established two more bridge-
heads and in the southernmost built up rapidly
for an assault on Monte Cavallo, on the water-
shed between the Savio and the Ronco. By the
2ist there were no enemy forward of the Savio
except in the coastal sector, where they still
held Cervia. .

Intentions now were for the Poles to press
down the valley of. the Rabbi towards Forli while
5 Corps advanced on the same objective on
the axis of Route 9. The Polish attack began on
22nd October but made little. progress until the
25th. 5 Corps also met heavy resistance to
attempts to break out from its Cesena bridge-
head over the Savio. ro Indian Division cap-
tured Monte Cavallo and began to thrust north-
wards. Resistance ceased on the 24th, however,
when the enemy carried out.his sole voluntary
withdrawal on this front. The tactical situation,
in particular the threat from Monte Cavallo,
. would indeed have forced a withdrawal in the

near future but an even more pressing reason
was the situation on the Fifth Army front where
the crisis of the defence of Bologna had now
been reached. Three first class divisions, 29 and
90 Panzer Grenadiers and 1 Parachute
Division, had been withdrawn in succession to
the central sector and it was vitally n
“to reduce the front of LXXVI Corps to allow
for this reduction in strength. The line chosen
was the river Ronco. . By the 25th both the
Canadians and 5 Corps had made contact with
. this line but the rain, which was at that very
time foiling Fifth Army’s attack on Bologna,
now reached a new high pitch of intensity.
On the 26th all bridges over the Savio, in our
immediate rear, were swept away and our small
bridgeheads over the Ronco were eliminated
and destroyed. The'Poles continued to advance
and on the 27th captured Predappio Nuova.
The situation remained more or less ui »
like the weather, until the 3xst when the enemy
was forced back opposite 5 Corps to a switch
line from the Ronco at Forli airfield to the
Rabbi at Grisignano.

This was a most discouraging period for
Eighth Army. The weather was abominable
and the country difficult. Every river and
canal was subject to sudden rises and floods

which. not merely made the seizing of a bridge-

The principal object was to clear’

head in face of opposition desperately difficult
but was liable also to interrupt at any moment
maintenance and the movement of reinforce-
ments. Some miles of waterlogged ground were
gained but despite our best efforts it was im-
possible to prevent the enemy, making full use
of these natural advantages, from withdrawing
sufficient troops to block Fifth Army’s advance.
The capture of Cesena and Forlimpopoli, and
even of Mussolini’s birthplace at Predappio,
were not sufficient recompense for the failure
to capture Bologna. Eighth Army’s strength
was now also. declining, for early in October it
had to release 4 Indian Division and the Greek
Mountain Brigade Group to go to Greece. This
was the beginning of a process which was to
cost British troops in Italy eventually two more
divisions.*

Plans for the Winter Campaign.
Operations in Italy in the winter of 1944

- to 1945, the bitter and continuous fighting in

the Apennines and in the waterlogged plains
of the Romagna, can only be properly under-
stood against the background of the general
strategic picture of the war against Germany
on all fronts. The main factor determining the
situation was the decision by General
Eisenhower, as Supreme Allied Commander in
the West, that it would be necessary to fight a
winter campaign on that front the effect of
which would be either to bring about directly
a German collapse or at least, by the attrition
caused, to ensure that result next spring. The
Italian campaign from its very inception had
been designed to second and supplement the
invasion of the west, even before that invasion
was launched, and the Allied Armies, in Italy
were therefore now called on once more to
make a direct contribution to the winter cam-
paign on the Western front. I considered four
possible courses to make that contribution: to
transfer troops from Italy to the west,‘ to
employ troops ‘from Italy in Jugoslavia, to
continue the offensive on the Italian front at
full stretch to the limits set by exhaustion and
material shortage or to halt the offensive now
and build up for a renewal in greater strength
at a later date. All these courses were judged
solely by the criterion of which would have
the greatest effect on operations in the west.
The first was rejected because there was, on
the current programme, no need for extra
troops in France and the current maintenance
situation would not allow any from Italy to
be accepted as yet. To transfer troops to
Jugoslavia was a project which I was then
actively coisidering; it would have certain
advantages, as I shall show, if we could first
drive the enemy in Italy back to the Adige
line, but it would have no effect on the Western
front and would only begin to have one on
the Eastern front next spring. Of the two
courses which involved continuing to use our
full resources in Italy the one which General
Eisenhower- considered more advantageous to
him was the continuance of the offensive. I
thoroughly appreciated this reading of the situ-
ation. It was for this reason that operations
were pressed on in Italy despite all the diffi-
culties of climate and terrain, of deficient man-
power and material.

* One brigade of 46 Division in November ; 4 British
Infantry Division during December ; remainder of 46
Division during January and February.
