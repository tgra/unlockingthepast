to render withdrawal impossible. The Divi-
sional Commander was told at the same time
not to give up more ground than necessary and
that an intermediate position should be
occupied.

It appeared afterwards that the attack was
not, in fact, nearly so heavy as had been
originally reported and there seems little doubt
that more seasoned troops could have main-
tained their position for the time being.

75. Withdrawal commenced. On the 2and
January the withdrawal commenced and un-
fortunately there was a certain amount of
confusion.

The Brigade, however, managed to dis-
engage and during the succeeding day withdrew
without further molestation from the Japanese
to Moulmein not, howevers without losing
most of its animal transport, its signal equip-
ment, many of its weapons and all its M.T.

Part of the losses in transport etc. was due
to the ferry boat being sunk which rendered
impracticable a withdrawal by road and neces-
sitated a move across country by a track im-
passable to vehicles. The operation, as the
small number of casualties showed, was not a
very happy start to the operations for the
defence of Burma. The company of 1/7 G.R.
that the enemy attacked in the first instance did
especially good work and the 4 Burma Rifles
showed up very well.

On the 23rd January in view of the dis-
organised state of the troops at his disposal
and the fact that the enemy were believed to
be in considerable strength the Commander of
the 17 Indian Division represented the view
that he considered it desirable to move his

Division right back to the area Bilin—Kyaikto .

—River Sittang where he could concentrate his
troops in a strong position and establish a
secure base from which to deliver a counter
stroke.

76. Decision to hold Moulmem, In my
opinion a withdrawal on this scale was quite
unjustified and I decided that at any rate
Moulmein should be held and if time permitted
I proposed to move up the 2 K O.Y L.I. from
x Burma Division to reinforce it. I did not,
however, intend to have a brigade closely in-
vested in that place. Arrangements for a
withdrawal were therefore to be planned. The
first requirement was to regain touch with the
enemy, which had been entirely lost as a re-
sult of the withdrawal and was not really re-
gained until the enemy attacked Moulme:n on
3oth January.

By the 25th, H.Q. 16 Indian Infantry
Brigade was established at Martaban with
1/7 G.R. less two companies, one of which
was still missing from the Kawkareik position,
two companies of the 4 Burma Rifles and the
1/9 R. Jats. The 46 Indian Brigade was
ordered up to the area about Bilin. This
Brigade which consisted of 7/10 Balnch, 5/17
Dogras, 3/7 Gurkhas had arrived in Burma on
the xr6th but without its transport which did
not arrive till 30th. It was, as already ex-
plained in Part I, by no means fully trained.

On the following day roo men of the
1/7 G.R. turned up having marched across
country to the Salween.

The enemy d.d not press forward his advance
with any great speed and it was evident that

he was bringing forward more troops and
probably deploying on a wider front. Reports
were received to the effect that they were in
some strength just east of Paan and this was
confirmed the following day.

77. Attack on Moulmem. Early on the morn-
ing of the 30th January the Japanese started
an attack on the aerodrome situated about four
miles beyond Moulmein and held by the de-
tachment of the Kokine Battahon The Burma
Frontier Force. This detachment fought well
and continued to hold on to the aerodrome
until ordered to withdraw at midnight.

Moulmein itself was held by the four
Battalions of the 2 Burma Brigade,
3 Burma Rifles, 4 Burma Rifles, 7 Burma
Rifles and 8 Burma Rifles, with the
12 Mountain Battery R.A.; extended along
a seven mile perimeter. 4/12 F.F.R. less
one company was in reserve. At noon
Brigadier Ekin took over the command
and at that time found the situation to be in
hand, but having visited the units and seen
something of the position he came to the con-
clusion that in the face of a heavy enemy
attack it would be very doubtful whether this
extended line could be held. Orders were
therefore issued by the Brigadier for the line
to be withdrawn towards Moulmein in order
to form a ‘‘ Box ’’ which it was hoped would
be Proof against penetration.

During this operation a battalion of the
Burma Rifles failed to take up their allotted
position with the result that there was a gap
between the 8 Burma Rifles and the 4/12
F.F.R. and this latter unit was soon at close
grips with the enemy and had a difficult time.

At 1g00 hours the situation.was certainly
serious and as no reinforcements were yet
available for sending into Moulmein it looked
as though it would be necessary to withdraw
from the town. As he estimated that there
were probably not more than a thousand
Japanese attacking, the Brigadier thought that
there was still a possibility of holding the town
and told the Divisional Commander on the tele-
phone that he would make a final decision
later.

The Brigade Commander, however, made
preparations for withdrawing if necessary and
sent Major Ward, R.E., commanding the 1
Field Company Burma Sappers and Miners,
to collect all available launches alongside the
jetties. He managed to collect fifteen and to
keep them there until they were required
These boats were manned by local crews and
in charge of serangs and they worked ex-
tremely well under very trying conditions.

78 Decision to Withdraw. During the night
it became increasingly obvious that a with~-
drawal would be necessary and on this being
reported to the Divisional Commander he
agreed and considered that it should be carried
out as soon as possible

At about 0730 hours on the 31st January the
embarkation began and by 1000 hours eleven
ships had left with troops. Throughout this
time the Japanese were closing in round the
jetties and considerable fighting was-in pro-
gress. However, the bulk of the troops got
away although the ships in their passage over
to Martaban were subject to machine gun fire
and shelling.
