            "description": "39. Towards the middle of February it had become clear that the German infiltration into Roumania was likely to develop into a \u2018drive\u2019 through Bulgaria, with Salonika as the preliminary objective. The Greek Govern- ment recognised this as a very real threat, but they were anxious to avoid any action originat- ing from their territory which might precipitate events. Though they were continually calling for more air support, they did not accept the offer of British Troops until 22nd February when at a Conference held at Tatoi, attended by the King of Greece, Prime Minister Korysis (who had succeeded the late General Metaxas),"

            "description": "218. The full effect of the expansion of the \u201c Big Ben \u2019\u2019 fighter-bomber force was seen in the second half of February, when Fighter Command made 548 sorties: and dropped 108 tons of bombs\u2014precisely the same weight in two weeks as in the previous six. At the suggestion of my Chief Intelligence Officer, who recommended that we should try the effect of concentrating our efforts on a single target for at least a week, nearly three-quarters of this bomb tonnage was aimed at the Haagsche Bosch; where severe damage was done, par- ticularly on the 22nd February, when a film studio which the Germans used for storage was gutted. An almost complete cessation of rocket fire over a period of more than sixty hours followed this attack; and\u2019 on the 24th February photographic reconnaissance failed to reveal a single rocket anywhere in the square mile or so of wooded parkland that the Haagsche Bosch comprised. Other evidence strengthened the inference that the Germans had been driven from the Haagsche Bosch, at least for the time being, and suggested that they had been forced to improvise facilities in the racecourse area at Duindigt, further to the north."

            "description": "55. The plan of the Commander of the 12th (A) Division for the capture-of Gelib was as follows. The 22nd Brigade Group was ordered to proceed from Mabungo along a track which was marked on the map, but of the con- dition of which nothing was known, to,cut the toad to Mogadiscio some 18 miles east of Gelib. Meanwhile the Gold Coast Brigade Group was to advance south from Mabungo, and the Ist S.A. Brigade Group north from Ionte. This operation was carried out with complete success on 22nd February. All three brigades com- pleted their tasks in an exemplary manner, but I must particularly mention the march, practi- cally across country, of the 2and Brigade Group, which called for the greatest endurance and skill, and also the rapid manner'in which ist S.A. Brigade was able to fight its way north in the face of opposition, and be the first to enter Gelib at 1000 hours on the 22ndi February."

Brigade to contact friendly natives, entered Moyale without opposition, the garrison having hurriedly withdrawn to Neghelli on the day Mega fell. 2nd S.A. Infantry Brigade following up the Irregulars occupied the town the next day and found that the enemy had abandoned a large quantity of war material, including one field and four medium guns."

            "description": "This was, in brief outline, the problem which faced me in planning the battle for Rome. The solution eventually adopted was first given expression in an appreciation of 22nd February and the plan there proposed was agreed on at an Army Commanders\u2019 conference at Caserta on 28th February. In essence it involved making Fifth Army responsible for the sea flank, including Anzio and the Aurunci Moun- tains south of the Liri, and bringing the weight of Eighth Army into an attack up the Liri valley. It would mean a great effort of regrouping and would take a considerable time. This would in any case be inevitable, for all troops in both Fifth and Eighth Anmies were exhausted and time was necessary, not only for them to be rested, but also for the arrival of reinforcements."

Steps were also taken to prepare the major reorganisation of the front for the coming offensive."

On the north bank, 114 Brigade continued opera- tions about Pakokku. On the right flank of 4 Corps, west of the river, 28 (East African) Brigade had repulsed enemy attacks south of Letse. Further west, a detachment composed of the Chin Hills Battalion and the Lushai Scouts was pushing back the Japanese rear parties in the area of Point 468, west-north- west of Letse. As already stated (paragraph 87) 17 Indian Division (less its air-transportable brigade) and 255 Indian Tank Brigade, had concentrated in 7 Indian Division\u2019s bridgehead at Nyaungu by the 22nd February. The success or failure of the whole Fourteenth Army plan depended on its subsequent opera- tions and they will be described separately."
