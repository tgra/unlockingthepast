SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

and geographical vagaries in mind it was essen-
tial to evolve an administration covering Royal
Air Force commitments which would effectively
meet the situation in South East Asia.

146. The extensive re-organizations which
took place during 1944-45 were effected against
a background of strict and cumbrous control of
expenditure by the Government of India, and
of dependence upon India through the organiza-
tion known as the War Projects Co-ordination
and Administrative Committee for the provi-
sion of resources. There was, too, a crippling
shortage of manpower in precisely those trades
which make for good administration—non-fly-
ing officers (notably signals and maintenance
staffs), clerks G/D., equipment assistants, cooks
and the like. Moreover, the growing body of
Air Command continually bumped its head
against the Command manpower ceiling. It
is not intended to infer that the RAF. in
South East Asia was badly served in relation
to other commands, for it was well under-
stood that the allocation of manpower had to
be assessed in relation to theatre requirements.
Nevertheless, it was considered that perhaps
the incidence of and the remedies for the grow-
ing pains experienced were not fully recognised
at home. ‘

The Move of Headquarters, Air Command, to
Ceylon.

147. The move of the Command Head-
quarters to Kandy was compelled by the in-
sistence of the Supreme Allied Commander that
his Commanders-in-Chief should work beside
him. It was, however, rendered the more
acceptable to Air Command on account of the
growing need for divorcing operational and
higher administrative control from the exten-
sive and complicated negotiations necessary
with the Government of India and with G.H.Q.,
India, relative to administrative services, which
had tended to hamper the primary tasks of the
Allied Air Commander-in-Chief.

148. The institution of H.Q. Base Air Forces
at New Delhi, had, therefore, many advantages.
It liberated the Air Commander-in-Chief and
his staff from direct day to day responsibilities
for developing India as a base, and thus
enabled him to address his attention more
closely to the general problems of planning
and policy control.

149. Before Base Air Forces was established
and re-organisation was under consideration, it
was generally supposed that a vertical split
between the Air Staff and Administrative
Branches offered the best solution to a com-
plex problem. This meant that operations
sections of the staff would move with the Air
Commander-in-Chief to Kandy while the
administrative sections remained at New Delhi.
It was intended that administrative representa-
tion at Kandy should be effected by the pro-
vision of small cells or projections of the
administrative ‘branches concerned, which
would work in an advisory and liaison capacity.
This at the time, was broadly the view of Air
Chief Marshal Sir Richard Peirse.

150. Difficulties ahead if such an administra-
tive set-up was adopted at New Delhi as
suggested, were foreseen by Air Vice-Marshal
Goddard. The reins of higher administrative

control and policy, he considered, must in the
first instance, be held firmly at Air Command
in order to effect perfect co-ordination with the
Air Commander-in-Chief and the operational
branches at Kandy. Beside, the geographic
factor was an important consideration, for Delhi
was fifteen hundred miles from Kandy.

151. A new scheme which would more effec-
tively meet the situation once re-organisation
was established and yet ensure the retention
of higher administrative control at Air Com-
mand, was brought up for consideration during
the visit of Air Vice-Marshal Goddard to
London in July, 1944. This revised project
was, in the main, largely adopted when, at the
beginning of October, Headquarters Air Com-
mand moved to Kandy and Headquarters Base
Air Forces was formed at New Delhi.

152. The essence of the new arrangement
lay in the retention at New Delhi of an admin-
istrative staff competent to deal with all ques-
tions, save the important policy matters, direct
with the analogous departments of General
Headquarters, India, and the Government of
India. This ensured adequate Air Force
representation at the centre of political power
in India and, at the same time, avoided the
creation of a duplicate headquarters under Air
Command for which neither the men nor the
means were to hand. The administrative ser-
vices, whose heads remained in Delhi were,
nevertheless, represented at Kandy by re-
sponsible and independent skeleton staffs under
a senior officer competent to inform and advise
on his own specialist topic as required, so that
broad policy might properly be formulated at
the Headquarters of Air Command.

153. During October and November, 1944,
there persisted a considerable amount of uncer-
tainty as to the basis on which the administra-
tive machi would ultimately rest. For
instance, as matters of high policy were decided
at Kandy, it was decided by the Air
Commander-in-Chief that he must have by his
side the head of the service primarily ‘con-
cerned. This applied successively to the
Principal Medical Officer, Command
Accountant, the Command Welfare Officer and
the Command Catering Officer, and finally to
the Air Officer in charge of Training.

154. The situation was finally crystallised
and clarified in October, when a revised’ direc-
tive was issued to the Air Marshal Command-
ing Base Air Forces. For all day to day
matters affecting administrative services, the
heads of those services were solely responsible
to the Air Marshal Commanding Base Air
Forces. But when matters of administrative
policy affecting the Command as a whole arose,
then the heads of the administrative services
were responsible to the Allied Air Commander-
in-Chief through the Air Officer (Administra-
tion) (A.O.A.), Headquarters, Air Command.
Similarly, when matters of new Command
policy came under discussion and the agree-
ment of the Government of India was required,
the heads of the administrative services con-
cerned were empowered by the Air Com-
mander-in-Chief, through the A.O.A. Air Com-
mand, to deal with their opposite numbers in
G.H.Q. India, on behalf of the Air C.-in-C.

155. As a corollary to this arrangement, the
staff officers under the A.O.A., Air Command at
Kandy were not established as mere liaison
