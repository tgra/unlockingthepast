SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

showed them to be retiring on to their new
positions. There was still doubt as to whether
they meant to make a main stand on these
positions, or merely to delay us on. this line.
One report received on the 16th December
definitely stated that the enemy would not hold
Mandalay, but would continue withdrawal
southwards. This was a contingency which had
to be borne in mind. If the enemy had stood
to fight north and west of the Irrawaddy, it
was General Slim’s plan to destroy him there.
But he had always had in his mind an alterna-
tive plan which he could employ if the enemy
decided—as he did in fact—to fight east of
the river. The time had now come to put
this alternative into action.

61. The essence of the new plan was a re-
grouping and redirection of the two Corps. 33
Corps, consisting of 2 British Division, 19 and
20 Indian Divisions, 268 Indian Infantry
Brigade and 254 Indian Tank Brigade, was
directed to capture the area Monywa-Mandalay,
thus holding the Japanese forces by frontal
attack. 4 Corps, consisting of 7 and 17 Indian
Divisions, 28 (East African) Brigade and 255
Indian Tank Brigade, was to be switched from
the left of the Army to the right flank, and,
thrusting down the Gangaw valley, was to seize
a bridgehead at Pakokku and capture the com-
munications centre of Meiktila. It was this
blow at his most vital point that was to be
the basis of the enemy’s destruction, and it
was hoped he would not realise its significance
until too late.

By cutting the enemy’s L. of C. at Meiktila,
a main frontal attack across the Irrawaddy
would be avoided, the escape route cut, and,
by isolating the northern flank of the Japanese
Army, the enemy would be forced to give
battle in the Mandalay Plain. 19 Indian
Division, transferred to 33 Corps under the
regrouping plan, would play an important part.
Crossing the Irrawaddy, it would threaten
Mandalay from the north prior to 4 Corps’
thrust at Meiktila. This, it was hoped, would
concentrate the enemy’s attention on Mandalay
and maintain his main forces in the northern
sector. Subsequent exploitation was to be by
33 Conps down the Mandalay-Rangoon railway
axis and by 4 Corps down the Irrawaddy
Valley.

62. On the 19th December, the above plan
‘was embodied in an Operation Instruction
' issued to the Commanders of 4 and 33 Corps.
In it the Army Commander stated that it was
his intention to exploit the rapidity of the
enemy’s withdrawal to the utmost, and, in con-
junction with Northern Combat Area Com-
mand, to destroy the Japanese forces in
‘Burma, to advance rapidly to the general line
Henzada-Nyaunglebin, and to seize any pos-
sibility that might offer of capturing a South
Burma port.

63. To achieve this object, formations were
‘to regroup not later than 0001 hours on the
“26th December as follows :—

2 British Division
19 Indian Division (ex 4 Corps)
33 Corps J 20 Indian Division
. TPS 268 Indian Infantry Brigade
(ex 4 Corps)
254 Indian Tank Brigade

1893

7 Indian Division
17 Indian Division (when available,
expected the Ist February)
Lushai Brigade (ex 33 Corps)
255 Indian Tank Brigade (ex Army
reserve)

11 Cavalry

28 (East African) Brigade (ex Army
| reserve) '

Norte.—The above redistribution left 5
Indian Division, which had been withdrawn
to rest in the Kohima area, in Army reserve.
17 Indian Division, allotted to 4 Corps, was
still in India, but would be available for
exploitation. The organization of these two
Divisions was being changed ; in each of them
two brigade groups were being motorised,
and one brigade group made air-transportable.

A.L.F.S.E.A. reserve (in India) consisted of 23
Indian Division, but it would be joined by
11 Cast African) Division (already withdrawn)
and Lushai Brigade (about to be withdrawn).

64. The tasks allotted to 33 Corps were:—
(@) To capture or construct airfields in the
Ye-U—Shwebo areas.
(6) To capture Monywa.
(c) To capture Mandalay.
(d) To be prepared to advance on the
general axis Mandalay-Nyaunglebin.
Nore.—Up to this date, 33 Corps had been
acting on an Instruction issued on the 1st Octo-
ber which directed them to advance eastwards
and capture the Ye-U area, with the object of
establishing airstrips.

65. The tasks allotted to 4 Corps were: —

(a) To capture Pakokku.

(b) To seize a bridgehead across the
Irrawaddy.

(c) To capture Meiktila and the Meiktila
gtoup of airfields.

(@) To be prepared to advance southwards
on the general axis Myingyan-Henzada.
Note.—The previous Instruction to 4 Corps,

dated the 7th December, directed its concen-
tration in the Ye-U—Shwebo area by the 15th
February at the latest (see paragraph 32).

66. This Instruction also laid down that the
Kalemyo-Gangaw-Pakokku road would becon-
structed to a standard sufficient only to pass
4 Corps through, and that it would not be
maintained thereafter. The Kalewa—Ye-U—
Shwebo road was to be constructed to a fair-
weather standard only, since time and the
available engineer and transport resources
would allow no more.

With regard to administration, the alloca-
tion of air supply lift was laid down (1 shall
refer later in this Despatch to the actual ton-
nage allotments), and the following important
instructions were given :-—

{a) Temporary airstrips were to be con-
structed every 50 miles, capable of taking
C-46 aircraft.

{b) Formations, when beyond maintenance
distance from Indianggyi, were to move by
march route, owing to the shortage of avail-
able air-lift and the consequent need for the
maximum economy in motor fuel.

(c) The potentialities of the Chindwin
River as a supply-carrying L. of C. were to
be exploited to the utmost, since we were
not able to construct an all-weather road
route from Kalewa to Shwebo.
