The refineries in Sumatra, par-\nticularly those at Pangkalan Brandan and\nPalembang, produced at least half the oil used\nby Japan, including about three-quarters of\nthe aviation spirit. Further, their employment\neliminated the wasteful transport of crude oil\nto Japan for refining.\n\nThis despatch by the Commander-in-Chief,\nEast Indies deals with two attacks by carrier-\nborne aircraft of the Royal Navy on the oil\nrefineries at Pladjoe and Songei Gerong in the\nPalembang area. The Pladjoe refinery was\nthe largest and most important in the Far\nEast. Information later obtained from\nJapanese sources revealed that by the end of\nMay, 1945, four months after the attack, this\nrefinery was only up to half production.\n\nThe following Despatch was submitted to the\nLords Commissioners of the Admiralty an\nthe 14th March, 1945, by Admiral Sir Arthur\nJ. Power, K.C.B., C.V.O., Commander-in\nChief, East Indies Station.\n\nEast Indies Station.\n14th March, 1945.\n\nOPERATION “MERIDIAN ”\n\nBe pleased to lay before Their Lordships\nthe accompanying report received from the\nFlag Officer Commanding Aircraft Carriers,\nBritish Pacific Fleet covering Operation\n“Meridian”, , which was planned for the\ndestruction of the two oil refineries at Songei\n\nGerong and Pladjoe in Sumatra. I am in\n\ngeneral agreement with the report.\n\n2. From the evidence now available, I con-\nsider “ Meridian ” achieved its object and dealt\nthe Japanese oil industry in Sumatra a severe\nblow from which only a very partial recovery\nwill be possible. In addition to the destruction\nof these oil plants, the Japanese were defeated\ndecisively in the air fighting.\n\n3. While in Ceylon before leaving for this\noperation, every opportunity of equipping and\ntraining the air squadrons was taken. Two\nsmall scale operations were carried out against\noil targets in the north of Sumatra in Decem-\nber and January, whilst a full scale rehearsal\nfor “Meridian” was carried out at sea off\nCeylon in January. The passage to the scene\nof operations provided opportunities for exer-\ncising the fleet.\n\n4. The results of the training before the force\nleft Ceylon showed that it had reached a\nstandard just acceptable for an operation ‘of\nthis magnitude.\n\n5. Meteorological conditions in the opera-\ntional area were as forecast and the inter-\ntropical front then moving south with the sun\nPresented serious difficulties to flying. The\nscale of defence in the vicinity of the target\nwas formidable.\n\n6. Throughout the operation all difficulties\nwere overcome and a notable success was\nachieved by very careful planning, the\ncourageous conduct of our aircrews, and the\ndistinguished leadership of Rear-Admiral Sir\nPhilip L. Vian, K.C.B., K.B.E., D.S.O.\n\n(Signed) ARTHUR J. POWER,\nAdmiral,\nCommander-in-Chief.\n",

I am not able to report that the object\nset, “To put refineries at Palembang out of\naction”, was achieved. Of the two refineries,\nSongei Gerong, the smaller, is assessed as out\nof action on photographic analysis, but\nPladjoe, which covers an extensive area and\nin which the essential plants are widely\nseparated and generally duplicated, needs\nprobably another raid if all work is to stop.\n\n3. The stage was set for such a final raid—\nfighter opposition largely overcome, enemy\nspecial army attack corps shot down, weather\npossible, position of the Fleet not known—\nbut there was not enough oil.\n\n4. The speeds—13 to 17 knots cruising, 22\nknots off the Sumatran coast—were lower than\nI have been accustomed to use in similar situa-\ntions, or would choose to use: even then the\noil available proved short by 24 hours’ con-\nsumption of what was needed.\n\n5. The inter-tropical front, which lay\nobstinately against the Sumatran coast until\nthe 23rd January, whilst it provided a con-\nvenient screen in which to operate, detracted\non the whole from success because spray and’\nthe torrential rains affected the serviceability\nof the large number of aircraft necessarily\nparked on deck,\n\n6. Whilst the weather was bad at 0400, it\ncleared for flying off at 0600 on the 24th. On\nthe 29th proceedings were hampered by low\ncloud and rain storms, and the fact that so\nconsiderable an air group formed up success-\nfully in such conditions offers a fair measure\nof the good drill of the squadrons.\n\n7. The squadrons put the maximum of\nhuman endeavour into the execution of the\nplan; that they achieved so great a measure\nof success against a not easily accessible and\nheavily defended target justifies an outlook of\nhigh promise for the future, besides being ever\nmost creditable to the officers and men\nconcerned.\n\nI wish in this connection to mention to you\nin this despatch the name of Major R. C. Hay,\nD.S.C., Royal Marines, who, as Ait Co-\nordinator, controlled the approach and with-\ndrawal of the Striking Forces in a very able\nmanner, obtained a series of valuable photo-\ngraphs, and found time also to shoot down\nthree enemy aircraft with his own guns.\n\n8. The overall cost of the operation in air-\ncraft lost from whatever cause was 41; air-\ncrews 17. Of the 12 aircraft known to have\nwaterlanded the crews of 10 were recovered ;\nthe position of the eleventh was never fixed :\nthe last landed within 25 miles of the rescue\nsubmarine in the Malacca Straits and was not\napparently saved.\n\n9. The relatively high proportion of aircraft\nwaterlanded is a natural reflection of the resolve\nof aircrews to avoid becoming captive to the\nJapanese: the resultant rescue problems are\nsometimes difficult to solve.\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 5 APRIL, 1951\n\n10. It seems from their behaviour and sub-\nsequent Japanese broadcasts that the Sally*\nbombers which attacked the Fleet on the 29th\nJanuary were manned by suicide crews. The\naircraft used proved unsuitable for this form\nof attack. The crews were determined,\nachieved co-ordination and, flying low, pene-\ntrated the inner, carrier, ring; but a plan of\nattack appeared to be lacking and the aircraft\noffered easier targets than ever I have seen.\n\nThe attack was broken in the main by Sea-\nfires whose orders were to break off at Bofors\nrange. With total disregard for safety they\nvery courageously followed their targets into\npoint blank pom-pom range of the ships, and\nin most cases shot down or crippled them. One\nat least was shot down by a Hellcat which was\nflown off in the middle of the engagement, and\ncertainly one by ships’ gunfire. Generally the\nfire, and fire discipline, of the Fleet was of a\nlow standard.\n\n11. Whilst not seriously tested, the steaming\nquality of the Fleet proved adequate for require-\nments ; but the figures for oil consumption were\nhigher generally than those published.\n\n12.

During the night of 21st-22nd January\nand again on the night of 22nd-23rd January,\nForce 63 approached the flying off position.\nOn both nights it was decided to turn back to\nthe westward, owing to bad weather and un-\nfavourable weather forecasts.\n\n5. The final approach of the first operational\nperiod was made on the night of 23rd-24th\nJanuary in better conditions. At dawn the\nweather was fine with no low cloud: the\nmountain range to be crossed by the strik\nwas clearly visible. .\n\nOrder of Battle\n6. @® The order of battle of the aircraft on\nthe strike and sweep was: —\n\nPladjoe Striking Force\nINDOMITABLE, 12 Avengers, 16 Hell-\n\ncats.\nILLUSTRIOUS, 12 Avengers, 16 Corsairs.\nVICTORIOUS, 12 Avengers, 16 Corsairs.\nINDEFATIGABLE, 12 Avengers, 12\nFireflies.\nMana Strike\nINDOMITABLE, 4 Avengers, 4 Hellcats.\n\nFighter Ramrod Sweep over Enemy Airfields\n\nVICTORIOUS, 12 Corsairs,\nILLUSTRIOUS, 12 Corsairs.\n\n(ii) The number of bombers was related to:\n\n(a) The number of fighters available for\nescort.\n\n(b) Estimate of enemy fighter strength.\n(c) Ranging capacity of carriers.\n\nFirst Strike—Fly Off\n\n7. At 0615 on 24th January the combined\nstriking force of Avengers, with their fighter\nescort, started to fly off from a position seventy\nmiles east of Engano Island. This force took\ndeparture at 0710. Its target was the key\nbuildings of the Pladjoe refinery.\n\n8. The second range of aircraft consisted of\nthe Fireflies of the main strike, the twenty-\nfour Corsairs of the fighter sweep, and the\nsmall strike on the nearby Mana airfield.\n\n9. Ships were slow in preparing the second\ntange, and were hampered by aircraft of the\nfirst range returning for emergency landings.\nFlying off the second range was not com-\npleted until about 0720. Partly as a result of\nthis the Fireflies did not join up with the\nstriking force until that force was approaching\nthe deployment point.\n\n10. The wind was variable, at one time veer-\ning to the north-east. So long however as the\nforce manceuvred to seaward of Position TAT\n\nAdmiralty foomotes :—\n\n* Wind force 3—gentle breeze (7-10 knots); force 5—\nfresh breeze (16-20 knots).\n\n} Position TA—the flying off position, in latitude 05°\n41° S., longitude 103° 32’ E,\n\n1805\n\nthe wind was sufficiently steady from the north-\nwest to keep the force fairly near the flying off\nposition.\n\nFirst Sweep and Strike—Narrative\n\n11. (i) The fighter sweep passed the main\nstrike on its outward journey and surprised the\nenemy on Lembak airfield. By the time this\nsweep had arrived at the Palembang and\nTalangbetoetoe airfields the enemy was more\non the alert and flak at the latter airfields was\nmuch more intense and accurate.\n\nGi) The Ramrod sweep achieved its object\nand, by destroying 34 aircraft on the ground\nand damaging numerous others, effectively\ncrippled the encmy’s fighter defences.\n\n12. (i) The enemy’s air raid warning appears\nto have been given at about the time the main\nstrike crossed the coast.\n\ni) The striking force was not intercepted by\nenemy fighters until it was within fifteen miles\nof the target. A number of enemy fighters,\nprobably about twenty, attempted to attack the\nforce from this time onwards. They were\ndriven off by the fighter escort.\n\n13. @) The Avengers and Fireflies in their\nattacks had to fly throvigh anti-aircraft fire and\na balloon barrage.\n\n(i) The anti-aircraft fir: was encountered\nfrom both heavy and light batteries. It was\nintense throughout, inaccurate at first, but in-\ncreasing in accuracy as the attack progressed.\n\nGii) The balloons were flying at about 2,000\nfeet when the striking force approached the\ntarget, and were raised to heights varying\nbetween 4,000 feet and 6,000 feet as the attack\ndeveloped. A number of Avengers dived\nthrough the balloon barrage to press home their\nbombing attacks.\n\n(iv) The withdrawal route passed over flak\nbatteries near Palembang town. The rendez-\nvous position was half covered with cloud and\nsome pilots had difficulty in recognising it. The\nform up was satisfactorily carried out, however.\n\n14, @) A first interpretation of the photo-\ngraphs of the target during and after the\nattack showed probable hits on one power\nhouse, three crude distilleries, two other dis-\ntillation units, a cracking plant and a reform-\ning unit.\n\n(ii) The wireless station three miles north-\nwest of the town was also left in flames.\n\n15. The fighter escort reported fairly stiff\nenemy opposition and claimed 13 single and\ntwin engined fighters destroyed, with six\nprobables. Japanese broadcasts later admitted\nthe loss of 14 fighters.\n\n16. Six Corsairs, one Hellcat and two\nAvengers failed to return. It is known that\nat least two members of the crews made safe\nlandings and may have been taken prisoner.\nIn addition, one Corsair pilot and one Seafire\npilot had to bale out over the fleet. Both\nwere picked up uninjured.\n\n17. The small striking force sent to Mana\nreported little activity there. (One aircraft was\ndestroyed on the ground and bombs were\ndro) on the runway. One Hellcat pilot\nwas slightly wounded by A.A. fire.\n",

An air-\ncraft followed the returning striking force and\nwas recognised on the plot as hostile too late\nfor a successful interception.\n\nGi) The Force retired to the south-west at\n22 knots.\n\nWithdrawal and Second Oiling\n\n19. At 1415 a group of “four plus ” enemy\naircraft was detected by radar, the fleet then\nbeing 42 miles south of Engano Island. This\ngroup circled the island and finally faded to\nthe north-west at 1430. The high Combat\nAir Patrol, which had been sent out to inter-\ncept, was recalled. It is thought that no\nfurther attempt was made to locate the fleet.\n\n20. URSA was topped up with oil from\nKING GEORGE V during 25th January and\nwas detached in the evening to proceed to\nCocos Island with signals for despatch. She\nrejoined while the fleet was fuelling.\n\n21. Force 63, including the aircraft carriers,\noiled in two bodies on 26th and 27th January.\nILLUSTRIOUS and VICTORIOUS also\ntopped up with aviation spirit. Oiling was\nslow owing to buoyant hoses parting at the\njoints.\n\n22. At this stage it had become clear that\nthe fuel situation would allow no more than\none further strike at Palembang. .\n\nSecond Strike Plan .\n\n23. i) As a result of experience gained in\nthe first operation the orders for the second\nstrike were modified in two respects.\n\n(ii) First, the fighter sweep was flown in two\nparts, the timing of the flight plans being such\nthat the two independent squadrons should\narrive simultaneously at the two main enemy\nfighter airfields. The squadrons were ordered\nto establish patrols over the enemy’s airfields\non completion of the sweeps.\n\nGil) Secondly, the bombers were instructed\nto turn right handed after bombing and pro-\nceed to the rendezvous passing south of the\ntarget. This lengthened the withdrawal route,\nbut the alteration was made at the request of\nthe two Avenger Wing Leaders, in order to\navoid the heavy A.A. fire encountered round\nPalembang town.\n\n24. Plans were also made to fly off from an\nalternative position north of Engano Isfand.\nThis northern position was not used, as it\nseemed very unlikely that the enemy would\nbe able to move U-boats to the West Sumatran\ncoast in time to interfere with the operations.\n\nDefence of the Fleet\n\n25. It was appreciated that the enemy\nwould know that we intended to strike a\nsecond time. They had probably captured\nprisoners who knew that more than one strike\nwas intended. ‘We had attacked only one of\nthe two main refineries in the first strike, and\nmight reasonably be expected to return to deal\nwith the other.\n\n26. It was therefore decided to reduce the\nescort of the main strike, make this up to some\nextent ‘by using the Fireflies throughout as\nclose escort fighters, and retain at least four\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 5 APRIL, 1951\n\nfighters in each of VICTORIOUS, ILLUS-\nTRIOUS and INDOMITABLE ready to back\nup the standing air patrol from INDEFATIG-\nABLE.\n\n27. It was not expected that the enemy\nwould be able to reinforce materially his de-\nfensive fighters, but it was expected that he\nwould make a real effort to attack the carriers,\npossibly with one of his special attack\nsquadrons.\n\nOrder of Battle\n28. The order of battle of the aircraft on\nthe second strike and sweeps was:—\n\nSongei Gerong Strike\nINDOMITABLE, 12 Avengers, 16 Hell-\n\ncats.\n\nILLUSTRIOUS, 12 Avengers, 12\nCorsairs.\n\nVICTORIOUS, 12 Avengers, 12 Corsairs.\nINDEFATIGABLE, 12 Avengers, 10\nFireflies.\n\nFighter Ramrod Sweeps\nLembak Airfield\nILLUSTRIOUS, 12 Corsairs.\n\nTalangbetoetoe Airfield\nVICTORIOUS, 12 Corsairs.\n\nArmed Reconnaissance—Mana Airfield\nINDEFATIGABLE, 2 Fireflies.\n\nSecond Strike—Flying off\n\n29. Force 63 arrived at Position TA at 0600\non 29th January to find heavy rainstorms in\na belt 30 miles off the coast, but the Sumatran\nmountains apparently clear of cloud. H Hour\nwas postponed from 0615 until 0640. At this\ntime the carriers were in a clear patch between\ntwo rainstorms, but others soon arrived.\n\n30. The striking force formed up well. in\nspite of poor conditions and took departure\nat 0732, two minutes after the planned time.\nTheir target was the Songei Gerong distillery.\n\n31. The second ranges of aircraft were pre-\npared much more quickly than on 24th Janu-\nary. As a result the Fireflies joined up with\nthe main body before it crossed the coast, and\nthe Ramrod sweeps kept their appointments\npunctually at the enemy airfields. ’\n\n32. The weather conditions round the flying\noff position improved quickly after 0730 and\nthere was a steady north-westerly wind\nthroughout the operation.\n\nSecond Strike and Sweep—Narrative\n\n33. The enemy was more alert than he had\nbeen on 24th January, and was apparently\nkeeping a standing fighter patrol airborne.\nThe Ramrod sweeps found little on their air-\nfields, but their presence on patrol over the\nairfields may have prevented the enemy re-\ninforcing his existing patrols. The total claim\nof these two squadrons was four aircraft\ndestroyed and two damaged.\n\n. 34. The main strike met no opposition from\nenemy fighters until after they deployed. The\nstep-aside deployment plan used for this target\ngave our escorting fighters a more difficult task\nthan the circular deployment used at Pladjoe.\n",

The enemy’s A.A. defences had been\nimproved both in quantity and quality since the\nfirst strike. The first squadron to go in (No.\n857 Squadron) bore the brunt of the A.A. fire\nand was lucky not to suffer heavier losses,\n\n36. The balloon barrage was reported to be\nless severe than at Pladjoe and again many\nAvengers dived through the balloons to drop\ntheir bombs at low altitude. Two aircraft of\nNo. 854 Squadron were lost through colliding\nwith balloon cables.\n\n37. The bombing results were excellent and\nbombs were concentrated in each of the target\nareas: important plants which were specific\ntargets received direct hits. Photographs taken\nduring and after the attack show a sea of\nflames in both the distillery and the power\nhouse areas.\n\n38. The withdrawal round to the southwards\ngave the Avengers a long passage back to the\ntendezvous.\n\nNo. 854 Squadron in particular received\nlittle support from our escorting fighters during\nthis period and all the aircraft of the squadron\nwere attacked by hostile fighters. The standard\nof Japanese air gunnery was reported as poor:\nthough all the Avengers suffered some damage\nnone were shot down. Lieutenant (A) G. J.\nConolly, R.N.V.R., distinguished himself by\nshooting down a Tojo* with an Avenger’s front\nguns.\n\n39. The form up at the rendezvous was\ncarried out expeditiously, and the striking force\nreturned to the fleet without being further\nattacked. The total losses over the target were\nfour Avengers, one Firefly and one Corsair.\n\n40. In the course of air combats the fighter\nescort claimed seven enemy fighters destroyed\nand three probably destroyed.\n\n. 41. As a result of damage from enemy\nfighters and A.A. fire, nine aircraft of the strike\nhad to ditch ; the crews of eight were recovered.\n\n42. An armed reconnaissance of Mana air-\nfield by Fireflies found that the only form of\nactivity was a football match.\n\n43. The strike started to land on at 1010,\nlanding on being completed at 1100.\n\nOwn and Enemy Aircraft Losses\n\n44. Our own losses of aircraft from all\ncauses in both strikes totalled 41: 16 by enemy\naction, 11 by ditching, and 14 in deck crashes,\netc. 38 enemy aircraft were claimed destroyed\non the ground, with 30 certainly and 7 prob-\nably destroyed in the air.\n\nEnemy Air Activity Round Fleet—29th\n\nJanuary\n\n45. There was no radar indication of any\nenemy aircraft in the vicinity of the fleet until\n0900. This bogey} was sighted by Seafires at\n0917: it was a fast single engined aircraft\nwhich escaped by diving into clouds.\n\n46. At 0939 a few enemy aircraft approached\nfrom the north. They probably did not sight\n\nAdmiralty footnotes :—\n* Tojo—Japanese army fighter.\n+ Bogey—unidentified aii\n\n1807\n\nthe fleet, which was then under low cloud.\nSeafires were sent to intercept and shot down\none Dinah* twenty-eight miles west of the fleet.\n\n47. At 1026 a group of twelve plus enemy\naircraft were reported approaching from the\nnorth. Corsairs and Seafires of the fighter\npatrols were vectored out. The Corsairs\nTeported sighting two single engined enemy\naircraft carrying bombs which were chased far\nto the eastward. One Corsair from VIC-\nTORIOUS failed to return.\n\n48. At 1028 a few enemy planes were\ndetected passing the fleet on a southerly track\nsome 40 miles to seaward. No fighters were\nsent to intercept as the enemy seemed to have\nno knowledge of the fleet’s position.\n\n49. At 1152 a raid was detected approaching\nlow from the southward and seven Seafires of\nthe low patrol were sent to intercept. This\nSeafire patrol was flying wide of the fleet to\nthe northward when given their first vector.\nThey intercepted the raid as it was sighted from\nthe fleet. The enemy formation, which was\noriginally reported by radar as “one large”,\nconsisted of one Helen} and six Sallies.\n\n50. The Combat Air Patrol was due to be\nchanged at this time and three Helicats took\noft from INDOMITABLE as the ship opened\n\n51. The standard of fire discipline and fire\ncontrol in the fleet was low. The enemy attack\nwas broken up by our fighters, which dived in\na most determined manner through our own\nanti-aircraft fire and pressed in to close range\nof the enemy bombers.\n\n52. The enemy formation attacked from the\nport quarter of the fleet upwind, height about\n50 feet. They broke up when the Seafires inter-\ncepted and appeared to try to carry out low-\nlevel bombing attacks on ILLUSTRIOUS and\nINDEFATIGABLE. From the form of the\nattack when it first developed it was thought\nthat the enemy aircraft were carrying torpedoes\nand the fleet was accordingly mancuvred so\nas to present a difficult torpedo target.\n\n53. Most of the attackers succeeded in\nreaching the main body- and were shot down\nclose to the ships. Of the seven aircraft which\nattacked, certainly six and probably all seven\nwere destroyed. It is believed that the enemy-\nlosses were accounted for by\n\nSeafires—two or three\nSeafires and Corsairs—one\nSeafires and Hellcats—one\nHelicats—one\ngunfire—one,\n\n54, During the attack ILLUSTRIOUS was\nstruck by two shells fired by our own forces\nand suffered 12 fatal casualties and 21\nwounded.\n\n55. From 1212 to 1430 the fleet was\napparently shadowed by an aircraft which re-\nmained 45 to 60 miles to the eastward. It is\npossible that this aircraft may have been keep-\ning track of us by receiving either our radar\nor our beacon transmissions.\n\n56. At 1818, a quarter of an hour before\nsunset, a single aircraft approached from the\nnorth-eastwartd at 15,000 feet.

Form Up\n\nVICTORIOUS group was flown off and\nformed up in 25 minutes. At this time (0645),\nall the groups appeared ready and the Strike\nLeader NDOMITABLE) should have com-\nmenced his circuit of the force, since time for\ndeparture was 0655. He was so long in coming\nthat I flew over to INDOMITABLE’s sector to\nsee if there was any trouble. But their squad-\nrons were all formed up and the additional\ncircuit made was unnecessary and delayed\ndeparture at least five minutes. On future\noccasions I will break R/T* silence if necessary,\nto prevent similar delays.\n\nCircuit of the force was commenced at 0650\nand departure taken at 0704. The strike was\nthus nine minutes late, but it was just as well,\nsince if they had been on time, the Fireflies\n(INDEFATIGABLE) would not have joined\nup before the strike reached the target.\n\nAdmiralty footnote :—\n* R/T—radio-telephone.\n\n3. Base to Coast\nAll went according to plan here except that\nthe escort, instead of remaining at the same\nheight as the bombers, as had been previously\narranged took up their correct escort intervals.\nAn accurate landfall was made at 0718 at\n4,500 feet. .\n\n4. Coast to Target\n\nThe climb was continued to 7,000 feet in\norder to clear the mountains. This height was\nnot lost again, as had been arranged, and I am\nnot clear why the Strike Leader had to alter\nthis part of the plan. The weather was ex-\ncellent for the strike. Thin 10/10th at about\n20,000 feet which enabled pilots to look into\nthe sun with ease ; and very low 10/10th stratus\ncovering large areas. Visibility was about 60\nmiles and the wind from the south-east.\n\nThe formation of both the strike and escort\nwas exceptionally good. For reasons unknown,\none Avenger from INDEFATIGABLE’s squad-\nron started to straggle. I have a photograph\nof this and have sent it to the squadron in the\nhope that it will teach them what not to do.\n\nAt 0738 we passed over Matapoera at 7,500\nfeet and observed three landing strips. Details\nof these have been reported separately. At\n0803 the strike reached 12,000 feet. This was\nonly 12 minutes before the attack and I do\nnot consider soon enough. From the escort\npoint of view, we want the strike at its top\n",

I judged their time of\njoining to be 0806 and almost immediately\nafterwards they went ahead to strafe their\nspecial target. I do not think they heard the\nrequest for the balloons to be strafed.\n\nAt about 0808 the enemy A.A. defences\nopened fire whilst the strike ‘was still out of\nrange, indicating that they had had warning\nof our approach.\n\nAlmost immediately afterwards the escort was\nengaged by an estimated 25 Tojo fighters,\nalthough I myself only counted about 12 at the\ntime. Their initial height was 13,000-15,000 feet.\n\n6. The Attack\n\nThere seemed to be a rather long delay after\nthe enemy had opened fire until the first bombs\nfell (about six minutes). When surprise has\nobviously not been achieved, as in this case,\nthe time interval must be cut down to a mini-\nmum and the bombing become more concen-\ntrated.\n\nI did not see the Fireflies attack, but the\nfirst group of bombs to fall struck several oil\ntanks with the inevitable result; it seemed\nthat all subsequent attacks had the same effect.\nThe target of No. 1 Wing (INDOMITABLE\nand VICTORIOUS) appeared well hit. No. 2\nWing (ILLUSTRIOUS and INDEFATI-\nGABLE) appeared to have destroyed only half\nof theirs. During this period, when not engaged\nwith enemy fighters or occupied in avoiding\npredicted flak, I was able to secure a series of\noblique photographs of the bombing. When I\nfinally left the target area (about 0823), the\nAvengers were just about to leave the rendez-\nvous and I did not see them again.\n\nThroughout the attack the enemy had just\nsufficient fighters to saturate the escort. Enemy\npilots showed as much contempt for Japanese\nheavy A.A. as we did and fights were raging\nall over the target area. It was almost funny\nto see the aircraft scrapping and all the while\nthe A.A. bursting at all heights up to 15,000\nfeet. As far as I know no one was lost by\nthis fire and very few damaged.\n\nThe presence of 3 or 4 twin-engined aircraft\nseemed to indicate some air-ground control of\nA.A. or fighters. No noticeable difference was\nobserved after three of these twin-engined air-\ncraft had been shot down.\n\nR/T discipline during this air battle was\ngood. No report was received from Force X-\nRay. An immense column of black smoke to\nthe north-west of the target indicated their pas-\nsage, but when I left they still had not arrived\nat Talangbetoetoe. Thus, although they\nachieved very ‘excellent results, they wéfé ‘téo\nlate to be of any material help to the strike.\n\n1809\n\n7. Withdrawal\n\nOnce again the withdrawal was insufficiently\nprotected by the escort. The Fireflies appeared\nto be the only aircraft there and they were\nunable to prevent several attacks by fighters\ntaking place. There is no doubt more of the\nescort could have got there and discipline on\nthis point must be tightened. At 0825 the\nenemy fighters appear to have been ordered\noff, as no further attacks developed after this\ntime and the escort quickly formed up on the\nstrike. In my attempt to rejoin the formation,\nmy flight became. engaged with four Tojos of\nwhich I: shot down two and the remaining two\nin my flight damaged one each. :\n\n8, Return to Base\n\nReturn was without incident. The top cover\n(VICTORIOUS) dispersed two Tojos which\nwere attempting to shadow the formation. The\nfleet was several miles to the north of her\nadvertised position. Attempts to home by\nbeacon, as usual, failed. The reason for this\ncontinued failure of the beacon is not clearly\nunderstood. A very large number of aviators\nreport failure each time with a lucky one or\ntwo reporting success. At any rate this matter\nneeds most careful attention. At 0928 the\ngroup broke up for landing which was carried\nout speedily and with skill.\n\n9. General\n\nT think this has been one of the better strikes\nthe Fleet Air Arm has ever accomplished. +\n\nThere was some initial confusion in the\noperation orders since most places in South\nSumatra appear to have more than one name.\n\nMaps were good and briefing excellent.\nDespite the unwelcome appearance of enemy\nfighters, balloons and intense A.A., the\nAvengers wrote off a good 60 per cent. of their\ntargets and, now we know the form, succeed-\ning strikes should be better still.

The Strike Leader\nshould collect 30 minutes after take off and\ndepart 10 minutes later. At 0733, I observed\nan air crew being picked up by a destroyer:\nit seemed a little early in the day to start losing\naircraft.\n\n3. Base to Coast\n\nAt 0740, the strike commenced climbing and\nthe escort took up position. An accurate\nlandfall was made at 0752 at 5,500 feet.\nFormations had by now all closed up and the\nescort was very tidily in position. I lost sight\nof the fleet at about 10 miles owing to masses\nof low cumulus. But over the land, conditions\nwere much improved. There was thin 10/10th\nat about 14,000 feet and over the eastern plain\nof Sumatra 10/10th cloud, 500 feet thick,\ncovering large areas. In fact, the weather\ncould not have been more ideal.\n\n4. Coast to Target\n\nOn passing over Lake Ranau, one Avenger\ncommenced straggling and soon after turned\nfor base. I reported this to INDOMITABLE\nbut got no reply. The climb was continued\nover the mountains to 7,500 feet. The forma-\ntion of the strike and escort was very good.\nThe weather, however, got worse and I had\nsome doubts whether we would be able to see\nthe target. As the top cover was being forced\ndown by cloud, requests were passed to the\nStrike Leader to fly lower. But he continued\nto climb to 10,000 feet and caused embarrass-\nment to the escort above him. '\n\nThe journey to the target was otherwise un-\neventful. At 0830 I shifted to R/T Channel\nC and heard Forces X-Ray and Yoke at work.\nThey were on their targets about 15 minutes\nbefore we struck and by the sound of things\nthey were far too late. Most of their reports\nwere of Bandits* airborne. ‘\n\n‘At 0835, the vexed question of balloons\ncropped up and the escort leader, much to the\nrelief of the bombers, decided to use the Fire-\nflies for this work. At 0840, the target could\nbe seen, fortunately quite clear of clouds. The\nballoons were about 4,000 feet. All fires from\nthe previous raid on Pladjoe were out. Shortly\nafter, the Fireflies reported “ Out Lights ”, the\nbombers deployed according to plan and I\nmoved ahead to observe the target.\n\nAlmost immediately, the heavy A.A. opened\nup on the Fireflies. Several groups of about\n10 rounds were observed extremely accurate\nfor height and range but, fortunately, out for\nbearing. My flight also attracted the atten-\ntions of the gunners but they were completely\nunable to cope with gentle evasion. All this\n\nAdmiralty foo:note :—~\n* Bandits—enemy aircraft,\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THe LONDON GAZETTE, 5 APRIL, 1951\n\ndrew quite a bit of the A.A. away from the\nbombers. But just after the deployment,\nseveral enemy fighters were seen diving down\non them. I observed no reaction by the top or\nmiddle cover. The plan for guarding individual\nsquadrons by sections of the escort appeared\nin most cases to be a failure. Both squadrons\nof No. 1 Wing received the unwelcome atten-\ntions of Jap fighters which did not cease until\nthey commenced to bomb. During this period\nno protection was afforded by our own fighters.\nI believe No. 2 Wing were more fortunate.\nAbout three balloons were destroyed but I don’t\nthink they were worth the attention the Fire-\nflies gave them.\n\n5. Attack\n\nI commenced photographing at 0850 as the\nfirst bombs fell. From visual observation,\nsome targets were severely hit and the photo-\ngraphs have confirmed this. Bombing by No. 1\nWing was truly impressive. By the time No. 2\nWing commenced bombing, it was getting a\nbit difficult to see. The first squadron of that\nwing (ILLUSTRIOUS) set off some oil tanks\nin the vicinity and certainly were very close to\ntheir target. Some of the last aircraft to bomb\nobviously could not observe their correct target\nand so, quite rightly, chose another. One stick\nwas seen to burst along the wharves. It seemed\na pity that so many aircraft were put on to\none small target whilst Pladjoe was completely\nclear and could have been bombed accurately.\n\n6. Withdrawal to Rendezvous\n\nAbout three minutes after the last aircraft\nbombed I finished photographing. I then\nclimbed from 6,000 feet to 10,000 in order to\ntake vertical line overlap photographs as the\nflak had died down. I soon had to change\nmy mind as a Tojo was coming for us. In\nshooting this one down, we descended to 0\nfeet and, attracted by the gunfire, an Oscar*\ncame along, and by 0905 he, too, was dead.\n\nDuring this time the radio was giving me\nan interesting picture of a long stream of\nAvengers dribbling out of the target area to\nthe rendezvous, 30 miles away. It was evident\nsome of them could not find it. Nor could I\nfrom 7,000 feet even though I searched for\nsome time. During this period there was quite\na vicious air battle of which I can give no detail.\n\n7. Rendezvous to Base\n\nThe return was without opposition of any\nkind. There seemed to be a little confusion\nas to who was going to escort the stragglers.\nFormation on the return was good and the\nescort in position. I climbed to 10,000 feet\nand swept the area astern of the formation but\nno enemy aircraft attempted to shadow. After\nthe strike had crossed the coast I examined\nLake Ranau for any survivors but saw none.\nI then proceeded to the submarine rendezvous\nfor the aircrews forced down and took oblique\nphotographs of all the river mouths in the bay\nin question.\n\nR/T discipline up till now had been 100 per\ncent.'improved. But crossing the coast seemed\nto be the signal for complete radio chaos.\nPrimarily the Avengers giving their damaged\n\nAdmiralty footnote:—\n* Oscar—Japanese army fighter,\n",
