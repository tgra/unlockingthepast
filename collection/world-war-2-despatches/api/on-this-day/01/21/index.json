            "description": "Before we could approach the task of throwing the enemy out of E] Agheila, however, we were obliged to wait for reserves to be accumulated and the administrative situation to improve, so that we might concentrate sufficient troops for this difficult undertaking. Until that time came, which I judged would be about the middle of February, we must content ourselves with leaving only light forces to watch the enemy. It seemed highly unlikely that he would be in a position to attack us before then, but the Eighth Army and the 13th Corps issued instructions against this contingency. On the 21st January the improbable occurred, and without warning the Axis forces began to advance."

On the right was the 2orst Guards Motor Brigade, organised in four columns, each consisting of a company of infantry, a field battery and:some anti-tank and light anti-aircraft gums, watching a front running south for  sore fifteen miles from the coast near Marsa el Brega; the third battalion of the brigade was in reserve at Agedabia.

The left column, which included about thirty German tanks, moved up the main road; the centre and southern columns, ihe latter containing about thirty-five German tanks, moved to the south of the road and along the north bank of the Wadi Faregh. Initially things went well for us, but the Support Group to the south then tan into sand dunes and was overtaken by enemy light tanks which caught some of its infantry and artillery hampered by the difficult going. To the north the Guards Brigade were not in difficulty, and General Messervy told both his subordinate commanders to continue in their delaying role, but cancelled his orders to hold the Agedabia E]l Haseiat line to the last, as the reserves of supplies which this line was intended to cover had not yet been placed in position. Enemy dive-bombers and fighter aircraft attacked our troops  heavily and persistently throughout the  day. Unfortunately our forward landirig grounds were marshy after the recent heavy rains, and this hindered our aircraft giving our troops during the initial thrust the  full protection and support which they previously and subsequently received."

The decisions reached at this conference, which concerned chiefly the organization for future operations, will be recorded later. The Commander Westforce reported, however, that he was organizing a counter-attack with 2 Loyals, withdrawn from the Segamat front, to recapture the Bukit Payong feature with the object subsequently of re-opening communications to the Muar Force. To this project I gave my approval. That it was not subsequently carried out was due\"partly to delay in the provision of transport for the move forward of the 2 Loyals and partly to the difficulty of providing artillery support. Having studied the problem carefully I am now of the opinion that the chances of a single battalion being able to advance 7 miles through that type of country and relieve the Muar Force in the time available were remote. The remaining infantry in the Yong Peng force were by that time too exhausted to be able to take a useful part in the operation."

The attack was launched at 0530 hours on the 21st January, having been postponed for one day owing to- severe sandstorms. gth Australian Brigade followed the 16th through the gap at 0830 hours. The fire of our artillery was heavy and accurate, and the enemy opposition was not great. Both brigades were established on their objectives by twelve noon with small loss. Armoured carriers of the Divisional Cavalry Regiment reached a point on the edge of the escarpment 3,000 yatds above Tobruk early in the afternoon, but were compelled to withdraw owing to accurate fire from the enemy coast defence and anti-aircraft guns at Tobruk. Determined opposition was encountered about Palastrino, a point in the middle of the perimeter 9,000 yards South-West of Tobruk. Elsewhere successful exploitation carried the advance to the edge of the escarpment overlooking the town. And by nightfall the Western and South-Westem portion of the perimeter, amounting to about one-third of the whole, was in our hands,"

This force was moved partly by sea and partly by the Nile Valley route, The first flight consisted of the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade Group plus 68 Medium Regiment, less one battery, and certain other units which arrived at Port Sudan on 30th December. This brigade was moved to the Port Sudan-Gebeit area. The remaining parts of the force were due to arrive by sea on 7th, 14th and 21st January. The part moved by Nile Valley route, consisting of the 5th Indian Infantry Brigade Group and the Divisional Cavalry Regiment, plus otner nits, was due to arrive at Wadi Halfa over a period of five weeks from about 3oth December. For its success the attack needed a waning moon and gth February was provisionally fixed. It will therefore be  seen that there was very little time between the arrival of the last units of Force Emily and the attack. This was compensated for by the fact that the units of Force Emily were all seasoned troops and had had active service experience,"

They pressed home their attack with gailantry, throwing bombs at our troops, and were only stopped 25 yards from the gun positions by the guns firing point-blank, and by fire from L.M.Gs., rifles, and even anti-tank rifles. An attack by an enemy battalion from Keru was repulsed by Skinner's Horse. Throughout the day there was considerable enemy air activity though no great damage was done. Signal communication was very difficult, the wireless being variable owing to the proximity of the hills, atmospherics and distortion. By the evening, 3/14 Punjab and 32 Field Regiment had arrived at Sabdarat. 5th Infantry Brigade, less 4/6 Rajputana Rifles, all its carriers and much of its M.T., had arrived at Kassala and was there joined by a detachment of four  I   tanks. 3/14 Punjab Regiment were unfortunate in being the only unit to suffer casualties from enemy air action, during the concentration period.

After operational experience had been gained, the mining commitments were increased to include drops in the areas of Sonchkla, Chumborn, Port Swettenham and _ Singapore. Mine-laying operations were discontinued after 24th May, 1945, because the stage was then being finally set for Operation   Zipper , and to have continued mine-laying beyond that date might have had serious repercussions when Allied landings took place on the west coast of Malaya."
