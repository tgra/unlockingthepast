It is of the utmost importance that similar uncertainty should be avoided in any future operation and that Flotilla Officers should be thoroughly trained.

48. Scramble Landings. Landing craft for 1, 2, 3 and 4 Beaches were very late in getting away from AWATEA, and one group had to be left behind. A number of craft lost touch with the escorting motor launch on the way inshore, in spite of reductions of speed. Troops were landed at Bains Romans and various beaches to the west. The two craft detailed for Rep 1 Beach found their objective unaided, though 14 hours late. Six landing craft approached the Tot de la Marine, some two miles south-east of their'intended beach, and came under heavy fire. Four were sunk and the  remaining two withdrew.

.' 49. C Sector... Owing to the delay in the teceipt of orders some confusion arose as to the beaches to be used. The pilotage party were only briefed for Ain Taya beach whereas the use of three beaches was contemplated.

A short conference was held in U.SS. SAMUEL CHASE where it was decided that   ML. 273 should take a flight to C Brug, the original beach; that M.L. 295  should lead a flight to C Rep Beach, keeping  station on the port quarter of M.L. 273 until reaching Bordelaise Rock, where they would break off; and that the pilot in Flotilla leader's craft should lead the Commando flight to C GREEN for the assault on Matifou.

Owing to delay in forming up, the assault flights for C BLUE and Rep Beaches did not leave until H hour - 50 minutes, At Bordelaise Rock, M.L. 295 attempted to lead off the craft for C Rep, but they all continued to follow MLL. 273 to C BLuE, where they touched down at H hour+25 minutes. Several craft for C Green were also mixed up in this flight, including those with ammunition for the Commando at C GREEN.

The flights for C GREEN were not finally loaded and assembled until H hour - 15 minutes, and as the convoy had by now drifted some 4 or 5 miles from its release position they did not  touch down at C Green Beach until H hour + 1 hour 50 minutes.

50. General. Generally speaking all landings were hampered by the unfortunate necessity of long delays in lowering craft and forming up into flotillas. The obvious solution to this is that ail L.S.Ls carry sufficient landing craft to embark their own first flight and that these landing craft be lowered with their full load.

All landings, except that at Dot de  la Marine, were effected without opposition, which was fortunate, as, had there been any serious naval or military opposition, the confusion which arose at B and C Sectors might well have been disastrous.

31. At 0040, the ships of the slow convoy K.M&'S.A. 1 began to arrive at B Sector, where H.M.S. BULOLO was lying, and they arrived at the correct times at the release positions of A and C Sectors.

52. At A Sector the L.S.I. of the fast convoy started to close the beach at 0100, the slow convoy following them in. Owing to the drift from proper release positions ships were not



finally anchored until 0356. The ferry service then began to operate satisfactorily.

53. At 0130, as Cap Matifou battery showed no signs of activity, SN.O.L. (C) moved his L.SI. in to within 4,000 yards of the beach. At 0200, searchlights from the battery picked up and held H.M.S. ZETLAND, but neither side opened fires HM.S. ZETLAND turned away and made smoke and the transports were not illuminated. At 0340,.ZETLAND was again picked up by this searchlight, and Cap Matifou battery opened fire on the westward transports. ZETLAND closed the battery and opened fire on the searchlight, which went out showing a glow as though it had been hit. At 0400, ZETLAND was picked up by another searchlight and the battery again opened fire. ZETLAND closed the-battery, dealing successfully with this searchlight too.

54, At 0131, I ordered H.M. Ships BROKE and MALCOLM to carry out Operation   Terminal  .*

55. At 0237, information was received that Sidi Ferruch Fort had been captured without opposition, and I ordered KEREN and the ships at B Sector to close B Wuire Beach. Ships had by now drifted some 7 miles to the south-westward, and it took them over 2 hours to reach the anchorage. Once anchored, the ferrying of personnel ashore proceeded rapidly.

56. By 0515 D day, the information received in H.Q. Ship was as follows :
