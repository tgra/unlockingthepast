This immunity was due to clouds and low visibility ; but it did not unduly disturb the enemy, for his U-boats were in contact and shadowing from 10th September onwards. It did, however, prevent the early and comparatively small scale air attacks which had been directed against previous convoys; and thus had the unexpected and unfortunate result of depriving the guns and fighters of the practice and experience which would have helped them to deal with the first massed attack.",
