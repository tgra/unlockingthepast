The only incidents which occurred to mar the precision of this remarkable concentration were the loss by submarine attack of four ships in convoy, the CITY OF VENICE and ST. ESSYLT in K.M'S. 18B on the 4th July, the DEVIS in K.M.S. 18B on 5th July, and the SHAHJEHAN in M.W.S. 36 on the 6th July. The passage of the convoys was covered most effectively by the operations of the North-West African Coastal Air Force, of No. 201 (Naval Co-operation) Group, of squadrons operating under Air Headquarters Air Defence, Eastern Mediteranean, and, on D-1 day, ofthe North-West African Tactical Air Force Squadrons based on Malta. Their problem was one of a complexity equal to our own. It was solved with conspicuous success, since no bomb was dropped on any convoy—the majority were not sighted by enemy aircraft—and all reports showed that the fighter cover was excellent.",

These continued until, on rst July, a letter was received from the Italian Commander asking for a meeting which was fixed for 1100 hours on 2nd July. . At this meeting terms of surrender were discussed and settled. Our troops entered Debra Tabor on 3rd July and took over all important installations. The enemy garrison marched out on 6th July, and, after receiving the honours of war, laid down their arms. Patriots occupied the forts and native quarters. Prisoners captured were 2,400 Halians, 2,000 natives and a miscellaneous collection of M.T., sufficient to lift x,200 men. Six guns and a quantity of ammunition were also taken. The surrender of Debra Tabor was strange, considering the Italian Commander at Gondar intended to relieve this garrison on 15th July.",

On 6th July I cabled to Colonel Chater that he should prepare a scheme for evacuation, as I considered that our position in Somaliland would be untenable, if the French at Jibuti ceased to fight. At this time there were in Somaliland one battalion K.A.R. (Northern Rhodesia Regiment) and one Indian battalion (1/2 Punjab Regiment), which had been sent from Aden a few days previously, besides the Camel Corps. Another battalion and a battery were on their way from Kenya, and I was considering diverting them to Aden if it was decided to evacuate Somaliland. Colonel Chater replied that when the additional battalion and battery arrived he did not consider his position untenable, even if Jibuti gave in. As General Legentilhomme continued to assure me of his determination to fight on, whatever happened, I allowed the battalion and battery to be landed at Berbera.",

On 16th July Arezzo fell, on the 18th IV Corps reached the Arno east of Pisa, on the same day the Poles captured Ancona and on the roth the Americans entered Leghorn. The Poles had had heavy fighting at Loretto and Filottrano; it took six days of fluctuating attack and counter-attack to clear the latter and the main attack was delayed thereby till the morning of the 17th. IV Conps had to beat off a final counter-attack on Resignano on roth July, and for the next two days progress to the east of the town was still slow. From the 13th to the 15th the advance was more rapid as the Germans fell back to their next delaying positions. gi Division was the first unit in IV Corps to reach the Arno, capturing Pontedera on 18th July, but on the’ left 34 Division was held further south in thé hills behind Leghorn and first entered the city at oz00 hours on the rgth. The Germans had devoted greater efforts than ever to render the port unusable. The dock area was heavily mined and boobytrapped, all the quays had been cratered and the harbour entrance was almost wholly blocked by sunken ships. By 23rd July 34 Division had captured the southern part of Pisa. All bridges over the Arno had been destroyed and the enemy was firmly posted on the north bank all along the Corps front. Leghorn harbour remained under fire from long-range artillery.",
