SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

556. Throughout the 13th February both the
Japanese aircraft and artillery were active.
About midday there was a particularly heavy
and accurate air attack on the Orchard road
area, the main thoroughfare connecting Singa-
pore Town with the Tangln area. The
Alexandra Ammunition Magazine came under
shell and mortar fire and at midnight deliveries
had to be temporarily suspended owing to fires.
Our own artillery was also active throughout
the day. Most of the field artillery was now
sited on open spaces in the Singapore Town
area. All remaining batteries in the Faber Fire
Command of the Fixed Defences came into
action and themselves came under enemy
artillery fire.
shot down by our anti-aircraft defences.

557. On this day the Rear-Admiral Malaya,

’ after consultation with me, gave orders for the

destruction of the large oil stocks on Pulau
Bukum. These comprised both naval fuel and
lubricating oils and the Asiatic Petroleum Com-
pany’s petra} reserves. I had previously
opposed the’ destruction of these stocks on
account of the adverse moral effect which I
ant:cipated 1t would have on both the troops
and the civil population. I now informed the
Rear-Admiral Malaya that, though I would do
my utmost to prevent the enemy seizing Pulau
Bukum, I could no longer guarantee the
security of the stocks there. The Rear-Admiral
who was personaily responsible for the destruc-
tion of the naval stocks, felt that he could not
risk further delay. ‘ The demolition was carried
out that afternoon. It was partially, though
not entirely, successful.

558. The effect of the collapse of civil labour
now began to make itself more and more felt.
At the Docks all civil labour had disappeared
and the Harbour Board Staff was no longer in
control. In the Town area debris from the
bombing and shelling remained untouched, the
dead remained unburied and water ran to waste
from the mains from lack of labour to clear
the demolished buildings.

559. In the afternoon the Governor moved
his headquarters from Government House to
the Singapore Club in the centre of Singapore
Town. P
560. I regret to have to report that the flotilla
of small ships and other light craft which, as
stated above, left Singapore on the night
r3th-14th February encountered a Japanese
naval force in the approaches to the Banka
Straits. It was attacked by light naval craft
and by aircraft. Many ships and other craft
were sunk or disabled and there was consider-
able loss of life. Others were wounded or were
forced ashore and were subsequently captured.

Included in this flotilla was a patrol boat on
which were the Rear-Admiral Malaya and his
party and the Air Officer Commanding Far
East. This boat was driven ‘ashore on a
deserted island by a Japanese destroyer and its
engines dismantled. After some weeks on the
Island the Rear-Admiral and the Air Officer
Commanding Far East both died.

I wish here to pay a special tribute to the
loyalty of Air Vice-Marshal Pulford, the Air
Officer Commanding Far East. Though at
Iberty to leave Singapore at any time on or
after the 5th February he preferred, froma

sense of duty and of personal friendship to
myself, to remain there until the 13th February
and would have remained longer had I wished
him to do so. This gallant officer’s self-
sacrifice cost him his life.

Section LV.—EvVENTS OF THE 14TH FEBRUARY,
1942.

561. During the day the Japanese renewed
their attacks. Their main thrust was again
made against the western front of the Southern
Area, Here very heavy fighting at close
quarters went on throughout the day in which
the Loyal Regt. and the Malay Regt. especially
distinguished themselves. By the end of the
day our troops had been driven back by the
weight of the attack to the line Alexandra—Gill-
man Barracks—Keppel Golf Course. Further
north the enemy reached the Alexandra Hos-
pital area but were prevented from making
further progress by the 5 Bedfordshire and
Hertfordshire Regt. and a composite Royal
Engineer Unit. The 44 Brigade took up a
position on the line of the Tanglin road in the
Mount Echo area.

Japanese troops entered the Alexandra
Miltary Hospital and attacked some of the staff
and patients. Later many of the staff and
patients were removed from the hospital by
me papanese and were massacred in cold
blood.

562. On the A.I.F. front there was little
activity, though some bodies of the enemy mov-
ing down the railway were engaged by
artillery and small arms fire and dispersed.

563. On the front of the 18 British Division
the 1 Cambridgeshire Regt. continued to hold
its position west of Adam road where it had -
shown great determination in resisting enemy
attacks during the last two days. To the right
of this battalion the enemy developed a strong
attack, supported by artillery and tanks, at
about 1800 hrs. and succeeded in advancing
nearly a mile until they were held up by
defences on the line of the Mount Pleasant’
road. A deep dent in our line was thus created:

At the junction of Braddell and Thomson
roads east of the MacRitchie Reservoir the’
enemy gained some ground but was driven back
again by counter-attack. Further to the right,
the left flank of the 53 Brigade was driven
back south of Braddell road, but the right flank
succeeded in maintaining its positions north of
the road.

On the Serangoon road front the enemy
attacked strongly from the direction of Paya
Lebar Village but was stopped by units of the
1z Indian Division after advancing to within
a few hundred yards of the vital Woodleigh
Pumping. Station.

564. On the eastern front of the Southern
Area there were’ some local engagements
between troops of the 1 Manchester Regt. and
enemy detachments.

505. During the day there was fairly heavy
shelling of selected areas by the enemy artillery
which now had the advantage of observation
from the Bukit Timah hills. Our own field artillery
with due regard for ammunition economy,
teplied whenever suitable targets presented
themselves. ‘

566. Several enemy aircraft were again
brought “déwn by our anti-aircraft guns but
casualties in the Town area were heavy.
