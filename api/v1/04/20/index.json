This Division had hard fighting before it was able to break through the defences which the enemy held astride the Dimapur\u2014Kohima road and gain touch with the garrison which by that time had been driven on to one small hill called Summer Hill in the centre of the area."

            "description": "228. Early in April, 5 Brigade of 2 British Division and 268 Indian Brigade, advancing south-west from Myingyan\u2014Natogyi area and destroying many isolated enemy detachments en route, encountered stubborn resistance at Mount Popa. This is an extinct volcano, 5,000 feet in height, whose steep slopes afforded excellent defensive facilities. Here a force of about 600 Japanese, supported by field and medium artillery, held out until the 20th April, when they were finally eliminated, losing much equipment including vehicles and guns. While this action was in progress, the remainder of 2 British Division was being flown out to India. The fly-out began on the 1lith April from Myingyan and was completed by the 25th. For administrative reasons, it had become necessary to reduce the forces in Central Burma by one division, and 2 British Division was required as the follow-up division of the force for operation \u201c Dracula,\u201d the capture of Rangoon by a combined airborne and seaborne landing, which was discussed in the last section."
