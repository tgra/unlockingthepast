SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON. GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1950

Now its ships, spread over a wide area, were
exposed to the powerful enemy U-boat and air
forces. The enemy took prompt advantage of
this situation, operating both weapons to their
full capacity. . In spite of widespread searches
by a few Coastal Command aircraft which "had
proceeded to North Russia after their patrols
and by minesweepers and corvettes in these
waters, a fortnight elapsed before the results
of these attacks and the fate of the various
ships of the convoy were fully known. * Of the
thirty-four ships remaining when the ‘convoy
was scattered, twenty-one, including the fleet
oiler ALDERSDALE and one rescue ship,
were sunk, and thirteen, including one which
was frefloated after running aground in Nova
Zemlya, eventually reached Archangel.

Postponement of P.Q.18

- 23, There was not time for another convoy
operation before the withdrawal of many Home
Fleet cruisers and destroyers for Operation
“ Pedestal”’*. P.O.18 had therefore to be
postponed until early in September. The
possibility of running the westbound convoy
alone during this interval was examined, -but
adequate submarine cover could not
provided.

24, Much of the ammunition reserves in- -

tended for North Russia had been lost in ships
of P.Q.17: there was also a shortage of food.
Four destroyers, the MARNE, MARTIN,
MIDDLETON and BLANKNEY, were there-
fore sailed on 20th July to Archangel with
ammunition to replenish the escorts and ships
of Q.P.14 and with provisions: they were
sighted by aircraft on 21st July near Jan
Mayen Island, but their voyage was otherwise
without incident.

Independent Sailing of Russian Ships :
25. Two Russian merchant ships, at the re-
quest of the Soviet Government, were sailed
from Iceland on 11th and 12th August respec-
tively to attempt the passage unescorted. This
they eventually achieved after a long voyage ex-
tending well into the Kara Sea. i

Air Co-operation

26. Further attempts were made during
August to arrange air co-operation in the Far
North. Two officers on the Staff of Air Officer
Commanding, Bomber Command came to
Scapa at my request to discuss the possibility
of an attack by heavy bombers on the enemy
ships at Narvik ; this operation was dependent
on there being a suitable aerodrome in North
Russia for the bombers to land and refuel after
their attack. I promised to arrange the trans-
port by sea of the necessary ground staff and
>t to such an aerodrome if it could be
found, *

27. Two squadrons of Hampden torpedo air-

craft were flown to North Russia, ready to sup-
port P.Q.18.: Their ground staff, stores and
torpedoes were carried to Kola in the TUSCA-
LOOSA, escorted by the RODMAN,
EMMONS and ONSLAUGHT. I had recently
+ received a. disquieting report about conditions
in Russian hospitals in which the seamen from
the escorts and merchant ships of these con-
voys were treated: the personnel and stores of

the British medical unit, which resulted from
my representations, also took passage in the
TUSCALOOSA, and as much ammunition and
food as possible was sent. .

28. On instructions from Moscow, the medical
unit was-later refused permission to land at
Archangel ; while that portion which had been
landed by. the TUSCALOOSA at Vaenga was
ordered to leave. The stores were left in North _

“Russia but the personnel had to return to the

United Kingdom in Q.P.14._ I renewed my
representations for the strongest pressure to be
brought to bear to induce: them once more to
change their minds. » 3

Sinking of ULM

29. While the TUSCALOOSA was on passage
indications of German activity east of the
Barents Sea were accumulating. A Russian
ice-breaker was attacked by an unidentified sur-
face ship east of Nova Zémlya and several
places were bombarded. I considered the re-
tention of the TUSCALOOSA’s. force in North
Russia, pending further intelligence, but
Senior British Naval Officer, North Russia re-
Presented that the Murman anchorages were
under constant air attack and that a longer stay

* than necessary was most undesirable.

30. The TUSCALOOSA, with her escort re-
inforced by the MARTIN and MARNE,-sailed
again for Iceland on-24th August. A sweep by
the three British destroyers was ordered, to the
southward of the TUSCALOOSA, to intercept
any enemy vessels leaving Northern Norway for
the Kara Sea. The German minelayer ULM
‘was met at 2230, south-east of Bear Island, and
sunk by these destroyers. The British and
American ships were located by aircraft and
shadowed intermittently on the following day,
but no attack developed.

Operation EV-—Passage of P.Q.18 and Q.P.14
31. Plan. The experience of P.Q.17 had
shown that the enemy was now ready to bring
his heavy surface forces against the convoys,
well to the eastward in the Barents Sea. Nor
could it be assumed that he would continue to
leave the westbound convoys alone. The cover
provided by the battlefleet, while the convoys
were east of Bear Island, had always been more
threatening than real; for I had strong objec-
tions to taking heavy ships into the Barents Sea,
far from their bases and exposed to heavy con-
centrations of U-boats and shore-based aircraft,
with little hope of bringing the enemy to action.
The battlefleet screen absorbed a number of
destroyers which could otherwise be used to
provide real cover, close to the convoy. In the
variable visibility which prevails in those lati-

. tudes, the presence of a strong force of

destroyers would constitute a threat which the
enemy, in spite of the longer range of his.guns,
would probably be reluctant to face.

32. I therefore decided to rely for surface
cover on a strong force of destroyers, under the
command of the Rear Admiral Commanding,

lome Fleet Destroyers (Rear Admiral R. L.

urmett, C.B., O.B.E.), flying his flag in the
SCYLLA, and to accept the consequent re-
striction on the movements of the battleships,
for which small screens of low endurance only
were retained. The destroyer force was to
transfer off Nova Zemlya from P.Q.18 to
Q.P.14, leaving the former to complete its voy-
age with the normal anti-submarine escort, re-
inforced by any forces which the Russians might
