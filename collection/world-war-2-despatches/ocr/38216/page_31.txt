SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

Relatwe Strength of Air Forces Malaya.

309. To carry out efficiently all these tasks
was beyond the strength of the Air Fortes
available, On the afternoon of 18th January,
the serviceability state of the Aw Forces in
Malaya showed 74 bomber and G.R. aircraft
and 28 fighters, all based on Singapore with
the exception of a small detachment at Kahang.
Moreover, many of these aircraft were obso-
lete or obsolescent. Against these it was esti-
mated that the Japanese were maintaining in
Malaya at this time a force of 150 fighters and
250 bombers. Concentration was therefore
made, in general, on one task at a time in the
order of priority indicated in the directive,
but influenced by the situation.

Arrival of Further Convoys and of Air
Reinforcements.

310. Special attention, as the directive in-
structed, continued to be paid to the provision
of protection for reinforcing convoys arriving
at Singapore. Further convoys came in on
22nd, 24th and 28th January, bringing ‘the
remainder of the 18th Division, except for a few
units, a Brigade Group from India, two to
three thousand troops from Australia, and more
anti-aircraft units.

311. Five Hudson sorties were made daily
over wide areas around the convoys to detect
the approach of Japanese naval forces. One
Catalina was. maintained on anti-submarine
patrol, and during the final approach to
Singapore a fighter escort of six aircraft was
maintained. All other aircraft were kept at
short call as the convoys approached, in case
the enemy should attack them.

312. Three reinforcing Catalinas arrived on
7th January and were allotted to No. 205 (FB)
Squadron.

313. During the third week in January, the
51 Hurricanes which had arrived on the 13th
January (para. 276), were being assembled
Preparatory to joining Buffaloes in the defence
of the Island. Spares were ample but tool
kits were scarce.

314. On their arrival they were immediately
unloaded, and the majority dispersed to pre-
viously selected concealed positions, where they
were erected and wheeled to nearby airfields
for test; the remainder proceeded direct to
No. 151 M.U. for erection at other dispersed
points. The speed with which these aircraft
were erected was a very remarkable achieve-
ment (see Postscript).

315. Twenty-four pilots from Nos. 17, 135
and 136 (F) Squadrons had arrived with them:
some had had experience in the Battle of
Britain. When A.H.Q. first heard of their
diversion to the Far East, it had been planned
to give aircrews a spell before employing them
in operations. This spel} was obviously de-
sirable, not only because of the length of their
sea voyage, but also because of the need for
acclimatising pilots to local conditions, How-
ever, events had moved too fast and the stake
was too high for delay to be acceptable. The
Hurricanes had to be used immediately they
had- been erected and tested. They were in
action as a squadron by the 2oth January,
exactly a week after they had been landed in
cratés.

316. The aircraft were accompanied by some
ground personnel of No. 232 (F) Squadron,
deficiencies being made good by personnel from
the transit camp. They were based at Seletar
and Kallang, and the whole operated as.
No. 232 (F) Squadron.

317. Sixteen Hudson III’s arrived in
Singapore from the United Kingdom, the first
of-them during the third week of January.
They were allotted to 62 (B) and No. 8 (GR)
R.A.A.F. Squadrons, They came at somewhat
scattered intervals, and as long as the air
route to the Far East remained open, i.e.,
until mid-February. The balance of the 52
which had been expected were unable to get
through ‘before the enemy cut the air route
from India.

318. Two reinforcing bomber squadrons,
Nos. 84 (B) and 211 (B) Squadrons, began to
arrive on 23rd January from the Middle East.
They were diverted to Sumatra, for reasons.
which will be related in due course. They, too,
arrived at scattered intervals and were far from
complete when the enemy cut the air route.
Their ground crews and equipment were to
follow by sea (para. 417).

A.H.Q. was notified that a further 48 Hurri-
canes, over and above those mentioned in
para. 313, would be flown into Singapore from
H.M.S, Indomitable about the end of January,
and that 39 more in crates were en route by
sea.

Further withdrawal of the Army—to Singapore
Island.

319. Despite the arrival of reinforcements the
position on land continued to develop adversely
during the second half of January.

320. On the west coast, the Japanese took
full advantage of their command of the sea
to land behind the Army positions. Between
the 16th and 18th January there was a suc-
cession of landings on the Johore coast between
Muar and Batu Pahat, which, combined with
heavy frontal attacks, forced our troops to with-
draw to the line Batu Pahat—Mersing.

32r. On the East coast, the long expected
landing in the Mersing—Endau area took place
at Endau on 26th January. The lateral com-
munications available in north Johore per-
mitted a junction between the Japanese forces.
in the east and west of the peninsula, while
a Japanese advance from the Endau area
threatened the communications of the main
British forces in the west.

322. Our losses ‘in the west coast battle and
the new threat from the East dictated a general
withdrawal of our forces to Singapore Island
itself, a decision which was taken on the 27th
January. The withdrawal was achieved in
good order. Nevertheless it had been hoped
that the arrival of reinforcements would per-
mit the holding of a bridgehead in Johore, but
this now proved to be impossible.

Aw Action against the Japanese Advance:
West Coast.

323. The Japanese exploitation of their
superiority at sea led, on the west coast as
well as the east, to a number of air recon-
naissances and sweeps being undertaken over
the left flank of the Army. Attacks against
Japanese-held aerodromes in Central Malaya
were also carried out.
