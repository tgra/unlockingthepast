CONVOYS TO NORTH RUSSIA, 1942. °

Admiralty foreword :—

The safe passage of convoys carrying vital
war supplies to North Russia was one of the
chief commitments of the British Home Fleet
from August, 1941, until the end of the
European War in May, 1945.

Like the passage of the Malta convoys, it
involved a series of major fleet operations.
The Russian convoy routes, in contrast to the
complete freedom of movement of the Atlantic
Toutes, were restricted to the east and south
by an enemy-occupied coastline and to the
west and north by ice. The convoys them-
selves were subject to attack by surface forces
over a large part of their 2,000-mile passage,
to air attack for 1,400 miles, and to U-boat
attack throughout their entire run. The severe

’ Arctic weather added to their- navigational

difficulties during winter months, but they ran
a greater risk of attack between March and
September owing to the continuous daylight
of the Far Northern summer. Nevertheless, in
spite of these very adverse conditions, under
British command, and’ almost entirely under
British naval and air escort, forty outward and
thirty-five homeward bound Russian convoys
made the passage during a period of nearly

four years.

The first, which sailed from the United
Kingdom in August, 1941, only two months
after the German invasion of Russia, arrived

safely, and by the spring of 1942 twelve more.

had made the passage with the loss of only
one out of 103 ships. From the spring of
1942, however, the threat of attacks on the
convoys increased, for the Germans were
already preparing to stop the flow of supplies
to Russia with every means at their disposal,
including the basing of heavy ships in Norway,
among them the new battleship TIRPITZ.
This new and evergrowing threat could be

met only by giving greater protection to the.

convoys, but the general war situation still very
severely limited. the numbers of allied escorts
available in northern waters.

In July, 1942, the Russian convoys suffered
their first and greatest disaster when Convoy
P.Q.17 lost twenty-one of its thirty-four ships
during a series of heavy enemy daylight
attacks lasting a week. The next convoy,
P.Q.18, which sailed in September—the August
convoy to Russia was abandoned in favour of
a convoy to Malta—was also heavily attacked
and lost thirteen of its forty ships. Then
followed a break of two months, during which
all available escorts -were taking part in the
Allied invasion. of North Africa. After the
invasion the Russian convoys were resumed,
and on 31st December strong German forces,
endeavouring to attack the convoy, “were
engaged i in the Barents Sea. A German heavy
cruiser, the MIRAL HIPPBR, was
crippled, an enemy destroyer was sunk and the
whole convoy reached Archangel without loss.

During the next two years the Russian
convoys ran only during the long dark months
of winter and lost only three ships, all in
January, 1944, No further losses were sustained
until March, 1945, when one ship was sunk.
This proved to be the final casualty and
brought the total losses in outward bound
Russian convoys to sixty-two, or 7.8 per cent.
of the 792 ships sailed in them during the war.
In the homeward bound convoys, twenty-eight,
or 3.8 per cent., of the 739 ships sailed were
lost. The total casualties in merchant ships
on the Russian route were 829 officers and
men. The Royal Navy, too, paid a heavy
Price, for two cruisers, six destroyers, three
sloops, two frigates, three corvettes and three.
minesweepers were sunk with the loss of 1,840
‘officers and men.

The forty outward bound convoys carried to
Russia the huge total of £428,000,000 worth of
