Tenth east. General von Mackensen, the for-
mer commander of Fourteenth Army, had
been relieved from his command after the fall
of Rome and replaced on 6th June by General
Lemelsen. To his assistance Kesselring directed
all the newly arrived reinforcements, 356 Infan-
try Division from Genoa, zo Luftwaffe Field
Division from Holland, and the 162nd from
Leghorn. The last named heralded its arrival
with a charge of Cossack cavalry; this was the
first. we had seen of an arm of which we had
heard such interesting reports but it proved in-
effective against Fifth yy and the experi-
ment was not repeated in Italy. In Tenth
Army XIV Corps, retreating up the Rieti axis,
had in the area of Carsoli and Orvinio a mixed
group of 305 and 94 Infantry Divisions and,
Tied up north of the Aniene river from east
of Tivoli to the Tiber, x Parachute, 15 Panzer
Grenadier and Hermann Goering Divisions.

13 Corps was the pursuit for Eighth
Army and the plan was pape two
armoured divisions in the lead, 6 South African
up Route 3, the Via Flaminia, west of the
Tiber, and 6 British up Route 4, the Via
Salaria, east of the Tiber; 4 British Infantry
Division with 25 Tank Brigade followed up the
latter on the minor road leading due north from
Tivoli through Palombara.* The French were
already across the Aniene, east of Rome, which
gave an initial advantage to the pursuit on the
it wan a bd left the South Africans were

ampered by having to pass through II Corps

to use the Rome bridges decom the Fiber. They
were clear through, however, by the morning
of the 6th and by that evening a dashing ad-
vance of thirty-three niles brought them to
Civita Castellana. East of the Tiber our ad-
vance was more strongly opposed, in particular
by the Hermann Goering Division which gave
6 British Armoured Division a stiff fight for
Monterotondo; 4 Division also met resistance
on the Palombara road from 15 Panzer Grena-
dier Division and 1 Parachute Division.

The situation was developing so favourably
west of the Tiber that on the morning of 7th
June I sent fresh orders to both Armies and
to 5 Corps: ,

‘x. The enemy has been greatly weakened

. by the fighting since 11th May and is now
thoroughly disorganised. He is certainly in
no position at present to launch a serious
counter-attack. He will continue to suffer
seriously during his retreat from attacks by
our Air Forces and advancing columns.

2. To take full advantage of this situation
Eighth Army will advance with all possible
speed direct on the general area Florence-
Bibbiena-Arezzo and Fifth Army on the
general area Pisa-Lucca-Pistoia, Armies will
maintain general contact on their inner flanks
but will not wait on each other’s advance.
Enemy resistance will be by-passed wherever
possible in order to reach the above vital
areas quickly. Eighth Army will be respon-
sible for any protection that may be neces-
sary on its right flank.

3. To save transportation resources and
bridging material 5 Corps will not follow up

*I intended to employ only the minimum force
necessary in the pursuit; among other reasons
maintenance ruled out a large force, as railhead was
still back in the Cassino area. The remaining divisions
were grounded in areas where they could be easily

the enemy on their front. If the advance

of Eighth Army fails to force the enemy to

abandon Ancona, Polish Corps will be moved
forward later on Eighth Army’s eastern axis
to take Ancona from the west.

4. The Commander-in-Chief authorizes
Army Commanders to take extreme risks to
secure the vital areas mentioned in para-
graph 2 above before the enemy can re-
organise or be reinforced.”

On these orders the pursuit was pressed
rapidly. The main difference was that 13
Corps was no longer directed on the Terni-
Rieti area but farther afield; this meant that
the South Africans were no longer to turn east-
wards to cross the Tiber to seize Narni as
originally planned, but to press on to Orvieto.
Here again a difficult question of routeing was
involved since both they and II Corps were in
danger of arriving simultaneously at Viterbo.
I decided to give precedence to the armour and
II Corps was halted in place until the South
Africans were through. Meanwhile VI Corps
made rapid progress up the coast in spite of
the arrival of two fresh German divisions. On
the gth it captured Tarquinia and a task force
from 1 Armoured Division, operating on
the inland flank, cut into II Corps’ territory
to capture the Viterbo airfield. On the rrth,
however, VI Corps was relieved by IV Corps
and moved to Naples, coming under command
of Seventh Army for operation ANVIL. II
ad pushed forward with 85 and
up the axis of Route 2 and
consolidated the position between VI and 13
Corps. It was relieved by the French on oth
June. On the oth Eighth Amy had also
carried out a regrouping; the Tiber was now
to be the boundary between 13 and 10 Corps,
with the latter commanding all the troops for-
merly in 13 Corps east of the river. The final
result was to give 13 Corps 78 and 6 South
African Divisions, with 4 Division in reserve,
and 10 Corps 6 British Armoured and 8 Indian
Infantry Divisions, with 10 Indian as reserve.
The Canadians were grounded south of Rome.
The Polish Corps, which had passed to Army
Group reserve on 26th May after the capture
of Piedimonte, assumed command of the Ad-
riatic sector from 5 Corps on 17th June, re-
maining under direct command of my head-
quarters until 29th June when it passed to
Eighth Army. The enemy had begun to fall

. back in the Adriatic sector on 8th June and on

the roth we occupied Pescara and Chieti.
For ten days after the regrouping the pur-
suit continued, though the enemy was now
offering stronger resistance. Kesselring had at
last managed to shift sufficient strength west-
wards to feel secure against a serious outflank-
ing by Fifth Army up the west coast and he
was beginning to feel the benefit of the fresh
reinforcements he had received from elsewhere.
He could now put twenty to twenty-one of his
twenty-six divisions into the line. The revival
of his strength was shown by the stiff action at
Bagnoregio which delayed the fall of Orvieto
to 78 Division until 14th June. IV Corps on
the extreme left also had to fight hard for
Orbetello and Grosseto; the latter fell on the
15th but little advance had been made beyond
it by the zoth, for the Ombrone river was a
difficult obstacle. During the same period .of
roth-2oth June the French, under a provisional
“Pursuit Corps ’’ Headquarters commanded
