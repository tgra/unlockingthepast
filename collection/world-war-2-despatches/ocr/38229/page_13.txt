SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948

that the only course open to us to maintain our
effort in support of the Army in Burma—once
our airfields and warning at Rangoon had been
jost—was to establish base landing grounds in
India, operational landing grounds at Akyab
and Magwe with advanced landing grounds in
the Rangoon area to provide what fighter and
bomber support could be given. Failing im-
mediate instructions to the contrary, I proposed
in my telegram putting this plan into action.

128. Arrangements were accordingly made
to leave a mixed Wing one Hurricane Squad-
ton, one Blenheim Squadron and half an Army
Co-operation Squadron, organised as a ‘mixed
Wing, with one Squadron of the A.V.G. in
Upper Burma, based at Magwe, one mixed
Wing of one Hurricane Squadron, one Bomber
Squadron and one G.R. Squadron at Akyab
and to build up and feed these two Wings from
a base organisation in India,

129. The decision which set the size of the
Wing left at Magwe was based on the amount
of maintenance in the country on the 2oth
February. It was calculated by the staff that
there was sufficient maintenance in this mixed
Wing for a period of three months. As re-
gards Akyab, access by sea was still open and
maintenance therefore would be satisfactory.
There was no overland communication between
Magwe and Akyab, ‘The route from India in
the North down the Manipur Road had not
been completed.

130. The decision to tbase the force in
Northern Burma at Magwe was made because
it lay behind two lines of observer corps tele-
phone lines, one down the Valley of the Salween
towards Rangoon and the other down the
Valley of the Irrawaddy. It was proposed to
attempt to evacuate the R.D.F. set if Rangoon
fell. By this means it was hoped to provide
sufficient warning at Magwe to secure the base
against anything but the heaviest scale of at-
tack. Since Singapore had fallen on the 15th
February the weight of the Japanese air force
could now be turned towards Burma. I there-
fore expected that if Rangoon fell, with the
considerable number of airfields now prepared
in the Rangoon area, heavy reinforcement of
Japanese aircraft would be flown in at will
to Burma. The enemy would have control of
the communications and the free use of the
Port of Rangoon and thus a large air force
could be maintained. ,

131. I received no reply to my telegram.*
Action was commenced. “I had received a
personal telegram from Air Headquarters, India
on the 19th in which the A.O.C.-in-C. informed
me that if the necessity arose he had prepared
a plan for the withdrawal of my force to India.
On the 2oth we requested air transport to be
flown to Magwe, whence it would work a shuttle
service between Magwe and Akyab. Onward
transport of personnel from Akyab would be
by sea. The personnel to be evacuated num-
bered some 3,000, the majority of whom were
in the Rangoon area. A proportion were moved
by sea, the remainder by air.

132. On the arst the Postmaster General
reported to me that the telephone system in
Rangoon would cease functioning at. 18.00
hours that day. Except, therefore, for our

single R.D.F. set—worn-out and of the wrong

kind—there would be no warning for the de-
fence of Rangoon and our airfields. Arrange-
ments were at once made toiman the observer
centre in the Central Telegraph Office with
R.A.F. personnel. This limited warning con-
tinued until within a few days of the fall of
Rangoon.

133. Beyond the general statement by the
Army that in the event of the evacuation of
Rangoon they would proceed to the North and
generally in the direction of China, there was
always the element of doubt as to whether they
would proceed to China or fall back towards
the Manipur Road and so towards India. Rear
Headquarters had been established at Maymyo
and stocks were being back-loaded up country
to the Mandalay-Maymyo area. The initial line
of withdrawal, I had always been infonmed,
would be along the Prome Road, a road 150
miles in length. ‘

134. Our air bases in general lay on the other
main route to the North—up a Valley of the
Sittang. The main railway system ran through
this Valley to Mandalay and branched to
Myitkyina in the North, and Lashio in the N.E.
The Burma Road lay along the same route to
Mandalay and Lashio.

135. In consequence, from the air point of
view the Prome route was unsatisfactory since
there were no air bases of any kind of with-
drawal between Rangoon and Mandalay’ suit-
able for the operation of modern fighters and
bombers with high wing loading—except
Magwe, and that had no accommodation, no
pens and no dispersal. Indeed the only other
aerodromes were at Myitkyina, 600 miles to the
North (runway incomplete) and Meiktila—our
depot of the future—where a runway was
finished. But Meiktila was rather too much to
the North and East to be effective in the initial
stages and had only slight warning facilities.

136. I had foreseen the possibility of having
to operate my mixed fighter and bomber effort
in what might well be—and later proved to
be—a tense situation, in which the Army would
be attempting to withdraw along this single
line of communication. There would ‘be no

opportunity of dispersing off the road and no~

cover from air attack. Accordingly, I had a
series of strips cut into the hard paddy land
along this line of communication and on the
1st March, when the C.-in-C., India, visited
Rangoon, I was able to report that I was pre-
pared to operate on this route.

137. But operating a numerically inferior
force from such landing grounds against a
weight of air attack without adequate warning
was a risky and fortuitous operation. Tihus
I had grave doubts about our ability to main-
tain ourselves in being. But when and if this
situation arose we should have done our ibest
to secure the Army against enemy air action.

138. Against this threat, therefore, the loca-
tion of our ‘‘ kutcha ’’ strips had been kept
as secret as possible and a very useful number
had been prepared in the vicinity of Mingaladon
and towards the North and West up the Irra-
waddy to Prome.

139. At night all first-line aircraft, bombers
and fighters, were flown off the parent airfields
at Mingaladon and Zayatkwin to ‘‘ kutcha ”’
strips. Thus the location of our fighting force,
when based on such temporary airfields, was
not readily obvious to the enemy. Pilots and
