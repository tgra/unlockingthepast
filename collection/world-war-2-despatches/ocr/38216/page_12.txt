98. The strain fell particularly héavily upon
‘the A.O.C., who despite ‘the great increase
‘of work which was caused by che expansion
of his Command, undertook’ much stipervisory
staff work which he would’ have delegated to
others in normal circumstances. He did so
‘in order to ensure that it was properly carried
out.- This reacted unfavourably on his health,
-which was poor even when he arrived. He
‘overtaxed his strength, and was a tired man
“when war descended on Malaya.

:Equipment .Problems

99. The equipment position was. bad: in
many important items. Except for buffaloes
«there were. no reserve aircraft. whatsoever in
-the Command. There was an acute shortage
of spares, especially for Blenheims and even
more for Hudsons, and also of all tools. MT.
was very short, with an effect- on mobility
that has already been noted. Small armis were
dnsufficient to arm more than a proportion of
R.A F. personnel. All these were items which
were badly needed during t94r in Europe and
Africa, and the requirements of the Far East
had necessarily to take second place.

On the other hand, stocks of petrol and
bombs laid in with G.H.Q.’s particular assist-
ance were good.

Personnel Problems.

too. The following major personnel problems
affected the efficiency of the Command : —

(i) There were no reserve aircrews. _ .
(ii) The strength’ of the Command in air-
men was ‘doubled ‘during the last six months
of 1941, but most of these reinforcements
came direct from training establishments in
.the United Kingdom and needed further
training. At the same time, a number of
time-expired airmen were relieved, with the
result that at the outbreak of war three-
. quarters of the strength was new to Malaya.
(iii) A number of ‘the reinforcements were
posted to ‘the Command in Anticipation. of
the completion of the expansion programme.
They arrived faster than the’ expansion pro-
gramme could absorb them. A surplus was
-therefore built-up, whicl: “was ‘émployed
partly as infantry guards on Singapore Island
_ to relieve the Army of such, duties. -
(iv) Special” courses were . “organised ~ in
musketry and, in the expectation ‘of the defec-
~ tion’ of.“native. employees,” in ‘cooking and
M.T. driving.

" (iv) Arrangements were made tee hospital
sation and ‘evacuation of R.A.F. sick and
“wounded; these facilities were provided” by
the Army everywhére except within ‘the
bounds of R.A.F. stations, where they were
provided by the R.A.F. M.S.

“RELATIONS WITH G.H.Q.

102, The Commander-in-Chief, Far East (Air
Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham)
being an Air Force officer naturally took a keen
personal interest in the R.A.F.; and relations
between G.H.Q. and A.H.Q. were correspond-
ingly close. ~
_ 103. But G.H.Q., had no administrative date,
only an operational one. It was felt at A.H.Q.
that the lack of the former prevenied the latter
from fully appreciating the day-to-day impacts
of the multitude of administrative problems
which arise in the subordinate command during
the period of ‘preparation for war. Without
this full experience the operational staff must
haye found it hard to grasp in their full signifi-
cance the difficulties which faced’ the subordi-
nate command. This statement is made in
no critical spirit of G.H.Q.’s staff, who were
sympathetic and helpful about matters which
came their way, but merely to disclose the

-weakness of an organisation which is vested

with operational responsibility but which has
no administrative branches of its own through
which to keep its finger on the pulse of the
administrative problems arising at the level of
the subordinate command.

104. The difficulty which G.H.Q. experienced
in obtaining-full and accurate intelligence about
air matters in the Far East has already been
referred to (paras. 67 and 68): Its estimation
of the Japanese Naval Air Arm was high. ~Its
estimation of the Japanese Army Air Forces
was that, although numbers were great and they
were’ known to possess long-range fighters,
‘efficiency was low and that, despite their fanati-
cal bravery, reasonable opposition would turn
them - from:their targets: -- *

105. To turn to the ehemy’ s probable actions.
For most’ of 1941, G-H.Q. was'in doubt about
the ‘date and place Japan would challenge the
Allied position in the Far East. The chance
that she would do so early was reduced when
in the late summer of 1941 the U.S.A. decided
to, reinforce the Phihppines. Further support
for, this view cairie from the Chinese, who, in
the early summer of 1941,-considered that" the
next major” Japanese effort” would,'bé made ‘on
tlie line Hanoi-Kunming to cut the Butma foad:
_. Nevertheless, © * throughout * “the a -Summér,
G.H.Q. stressed thé“néed, for .pressirig on with
alt. preparations” hegessiry” for “meeting , an
attack, realising that Japan could ‘strike at her
selected moment so long as_no British goes was
based on Singapore. . .-

, Early in Novembei, toes the C.-iri-C, ‘Te;
affirmed the opinion that Japan was unlikely to
attack Malaya ‘now that ‘the N.E. monsoon had
Set, itt, because the heavy surf, ‘which “beats
afon, the beaches of the East coast of Malaya
throughout. the season, would. make’ it diffierlt
for -assaulting- troops to land.’ It was reckoned
that, the attack, although possible," was-unlikely
before-February, 1942; by which time the mon-
soon would ‘be over.. - ,

By 22nd November,’ “however, ‘the Japanese
intention of further aggression had’ become clear
to the C.-in-C. (para. 140).
