with skill and determination. At this time his
troops were rather better at moving on the
hill than were ours, and a certain amount of
the lessons of Frontier Warfare had to be
unlearnt due to the influence of artillery,
mortars, L.M.Gs. and. aircraft on mountain
warfare. During the night 7/8th February,
5th Indian Infantry Brigade moved into the
Happy Valley, and on the early morning of
8th February, 4/6 Rajputana Rifles attacked
the Acqua Col. This was found to be
wired and strongly held, and they were unable
to reach their objective, eventually consolidat-
ing on a ridge below the col. 5th Indian
Infantry Brigade remained in this valley some
days, being subjected to fairly heavy attacks
from the enemy airforce. Pressure against
11th Indian Infantry Brigade on Cameron
Ridge and Rajputana Ridge features was
severe, and a second attempt to secure Brigs
Peak, which would relieve pressure on 11th
Indian Infantry Brigade and give us artillery
observation of Keren, was decided upon. This
attack was carried out by 3/1 Punjab Regi-
ment at 1500 hours in the afternoon of roth
February supported by a heavy concentration
of artillery fire on Brigs Peak and M. Sanchil.
The attack was successful and Brigs Peak was
captured. Part of M. Sanchil was also
captured, but had to be evacuated as the
battalion was seriously reduced in numbers.
During these operations our casualties in
officers had been heavy. Lt.-Col. Whitehead,
commanding 3/1 Punjab Regiment, Lt.-Col.
Purvis, 4/11 Sikhs, Lt.-Col. Edwards, x Royal
Fusiliers, Lt.-Col. Scott, Skinner’s Horse, and
Major Proctor, of 3/1 Punjab Regiment, were
all seriously wounded.

Second Attack on Acqua Gap.

For the second attempt to force the Acqua
Col., 29th Indian Infantry Brigade, which
was garrisoning Barentu, was placed under
command 4th Indian Division, with the limita-
tion that it was only to be used to exploit
complete success, and was under no circum-
stances to be employed as a reinforcement.
The reason for attacking the Acqua Gap was
that, in spite of the administrative difficulties
of maintaining two brigades in the Happy
Valley, this attack if successful, would cut
across the enemy’s line of communication at a
most vulnerable spot, and offered the chance
of cutting-off and capturing the greater part of
his forces in Keren and on the hills to the
West. The period between roth and 12th
February was very trying for the troops hold-
ing Brigs Peak and Cameron Ridge. The
enemy counter-attacked continuously, and
during the early hours of 11th iat 3/t
Punjab Regiment were driven off Brigs Pi
back on to Cameron Ridge.

The second attack on the Acqua Gap was
carried out by 4/11 Sikhs on the right, directed
on the Sphinx (M. Zalale) and the 4/6 Raj-
putana Rifles directed on a feature known as
Hill 1565. Although attacking with great gal-
lantry these battalions were unable to reach
their objective, and owing to the shape of the
ground and the length of telephone cqm-
munications necessary, adequate artillery sup-
port was not forthcoming. Commander 4th
Indian Division decided to terminate the opera-
tion. 29th Indian Infantry Brigade were
withdrawn from the Valley, and returned to
Barentu. During the night of 13/xqth

SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 10 JULY, 1946

February the rest of our forces were also suc-
cessfully withdrawn. Both of these brigades
had to withdraw through the bottleneck
described above, under observed and registered
artillery fire from the enemy’s guns on Fort
Dologorodoc and surrounding features. In
spite of this, and in spite of the activity of the
enemy’s artillery, the total casualties during
withdrawal were two men slightly wounded.

After the second unsuccessful attack on the
Acqua Gap it was clear that any further
assault on the Keren position would be a major
operation. Shortage of transport made it im-
possible to maintain both divisions in the Keren
area and at the same time build up sufficient
reserves of ammunition, petrol and rations. It
was decided that 2gth Indian Infantry Brigade
should remain in Barentu. The rest of 5th
Indian Division was withdrawn to the area
between Sabdarat and Tessenei where it could
maintain itself from the railhead at Kassala
with its own first-line transport. All second-
line transport was put under control of H.Q.
Troops in the Sudan. While it was in this
area, 5th Indian Division carried out intensive
training in mountain warfare for the purposes
of studying tactics and making every man as
physically fit as possible. For the purposes of
deception, measures were taken to induce the
enemy to believe that a thrust was intended
from Barentu to Arresa and thence on to the
plateau directed on Adi Ugri. During this
period of patrol and administrative activity it
was left to 4th Indian Division to hold the
heights already secured opposite Keren and to
make preparations for the reception at short
notice of 5th Indian Division.

The Red Sea Coast.

As early as 21st January, Commander 7th
Indian Infantry Brigade had reported that the
enemy was withdrawing from the Karora area
and asked permission to start a minor operation
against the enemy garrison there. This per-
mission was given. The idea of a thrust down
the Red Sea Coast had been previously con-
sidered and at first it had been used to divert
attention from Kassala. It was difficult to get
accurate estimates of what water was avail-
able, but, after consultation with the Royal
Navy, it was considered feasible to direct a
force of approximately one brigade group from
Port Sudan via Suakin—Karora—Nakfa—Cub
Cub and on to Keren from the north.

The forces available were 7th Indian In-

fantry Brigade, less 4/11 Sikhs, which had
previously been motorised and sent to join
Gazelle Force. The battalion garrisoning
Khartoum, 4/16 Punjab Regiment, was
released. One battery, 25 pounders, No. 4
M.M.G. Company, S.D.F., 12 Field Company,
Sappers and Miners, and 170 Light Field
Ambulance were withdrawn from Keren front
and sent to join 7th Infantry Brigade. Added
weight was given to this force by the arrival
in the Sudan of Free French Forces. These
were 14 Battalion Etranger of the Foreign
Legion, plus certain supporting troops, and
Troisiéme Battalion de Marche (Tchad), known
as Battalion Garby. The Foreign Legion,
seasoned troops who had seen service in
Norway, arrived by sea. Battalion Garby
entered the Sudan by overland route from
French Equatoria. These two units, under the
command of Col, Monclar, were formed into a
Demi-Brigade, known as the Brigade d’Orient.
