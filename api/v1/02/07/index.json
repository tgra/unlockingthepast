The War Cabinet accordingly directed that no operations were to be undertaken beyond the frontier of Cyrenaica, which should be held with the minimum possible force necessary to secure the flank of our Egyptian base, and that it was essential to be able to send the largest possible army and air forces from the Middle East to assist the Greeks against a German attack through Bulgaria, At the same time the operations against the Italian Dodecanese, which were in preparation, were to be pressed on and «undertaken at the earliest possible moment.",
