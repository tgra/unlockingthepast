of Leghorn.* To show our hand was obviously
i ible; the bluff must be played out to
the end for we too were deeply concerned by
the German reinforcement of Italy; but unless
we could do something to counter this fear
of the Germans all might yet be lost. An offer
was therefore made that we would fly an air-
borne division into the Rome area, to land on
airfields already seized by the Italians, which
would co-operate with the five Italian divisions
around the capitalf in holding it against the
Germans until our invading force could effect
a juncture. The risk was obvious; not only
might we lose the division flown in (82 United
States Airborne Division was nominated) but
it would also mean that it would not be avail-
able for its very important réle in the Sale:no
assault, the forces for which were already quite
weak enough. We decided, however, that the
risk must be taken and on ist September
General Eisenhower informed me of a message
received from the President and the Prime
Minister: ‘’ We highly approve your decision
to go on with AVALAN! and to land an
airborne division near Rome on the conditions
indicated ’’.

An unexpected difficulty now arose because
Castellano claimed he had no authority to sign
the armistice and must first consult his Govern-
ment. He was told plainly that our terms, in-
cluding the new offer, must be accepted or re-
jected by the night of rst-2nd September and
that, whatever their decision, we should proceed
with our plan for carrying the war to the
Tfalian mainland. I have wondered since
whether we should have been able to make
good those bold words if the Italian decision had
been negative, but at the time I had no doubt
they would accept. On the other hand the
military situation had been changing to our
disadvantage every day since the plan for
Salerno had first been proposed, in view of the
constant arrival of fresh German forces.{ How-
ever, the bluff was not called; within our
specified time on Ist September the King and
Badoglio agreed to our terms and at a quarter
past five on 3rd September General Smith,
on behalf and in the presence of General Eisen-
hower, and General Castellano, on behalf of
Marshal Badoglio, signed the Military Terms of
Surrender. The scene of the signature was a
tent in an almond grove near Cassibile; thir-
teen hours ibefore, to the thunder of six
hundred guns in the Straits of Messina, the
Eighth Army had begun the first invasion of
the continent of Europe.

German Dispositions in Italy.

Before proceeding to an account of our opera-
tions in Italy I must complete the picture of
the problems which faced us by detailing the

* Marshal Badoglio wanted us to land also at
Ancona. Amphibious operations are difficult for the
non-expert to understand, as has been clearly demon-
strated by the published works on the Italian campaign.
It may give a better sense of proportion to point out
that the seaborne assault force for the Normandy
landifigs, the supreme effort of the United Kingdom
and the United States, was five divisions.

~ One motorised and three infantry divisions and
an armoured division in process of re-formation which
was being equipped with German tanks.

An alternative plan for Fifth Army had been
prepared for study on 24 August, in case the increase
in enemy strength should make AVALANCHE
impracticable. It was suggested that Fifth Army
should substitute a direct assault.on the Heel of
Italy for the landing at Salerno; this operation could
not have been carried out before 21 September.

enemy forces opposing us and the strategy:
which they had decided to adopt. On the latter :
point we were fairly well informed and ‘had:
acquired an additional source of information in.
General Castellano who told us all the Germans.
had so far revealed to their allies. In order:
to give a true picture I must step back a little:
in time and fill in the background of the general;
German strategic position in 1943. 4
At the beginning of the year the German High *
Command saw themselves faced with the cer-
tainty of a serious defeat in South Russia and’:
the high probability of complete disaster in
Africa. The loss of Stalingrad would tear a.
great gap in the southern end of the Eastern
Front; the loss of Tunisia would open all
southern Europe to the attack of the 10- *
American forces in North Africa. For -the
moment the danger in the east was the greater.
Tunisia was still holding out and was expected :
to continue to do so; indeed both Kesselring
and Jodl have since stated that they had ex-
pected to be able to retain the bridgehead in’
Tunisia indefinitely; all the available reserves:
therefore, less those already allotted and en
route for Africa, must be sent to Russia. These:
reserves came, as always previously in times’
of stress on the Eastern Front, from France,“
which was still. being used as the place where’
battered divisions were re-formed and new divi-"
sions activated. No less than nineteen divisions
were despatched in January and February’
from France to Russia; they were successful, _
aided by the coming of spring, in stabilizing®
the front. But as the thaw on the steppes;
brought the long opposing battle lines to a
standstill, 7 Armoured Division entered Tunis.”
through the Bardo Gate and a German Com-’
mander-in-Chief wandered disconsolately down _
from the low hills of Cape Bon to surrender
to an officer of 4 Indian Division. To the twenty :
divisions lost at Stalingrad there were now ta’
be added over one hundred and thirty thousand .
men* swallowed up in Tunisia, as a final item
in the balance of losses already sustained in.
two years of fruitless campaigning in Africa. . '

The first German reaction was to reinforce
the Balkans. By the end of May their ‘forces!
there had risen from seven to thirteen divisions,
and by the end of August to nineteen; in par-:
ticular a strong corps of four divisions, includ-'
ing a crack armoured division from France, was‘
formed in the .Peloponese. It was necessary, -
however, to give-some attention to Italy. It:
might be felt that the Alps were sufficient pro-
tection to the Reich without a glacis to the'
south of them but there were disadvantages
involved in the abandonment of Italy which’
rendered such a course intolerable except in:
extremis. The loss of an ally, involving the!
disappearance of the’ Romté-Berlin Axis from -
the political scene, the loss of useful auxiliary
troops who were, numerically, Paya the.
greater part in the garrisoning of the Balkans,
the direct threat to the Balkans themselves -
from attack either across the Adriatic or™
across the relatively lower Julian Alps, the-
loss of airfields from which strategic attacks -
against Germany herself could be greatly aug- -
mented and directed against hitherto immune !
areas, and the loss of Italian industrial produc-..
tion, were dangers to be avoided at almost all

* German losses only. Total Axis prisoners iri the’!
final capitulation amounted to 248,000. *** gh
