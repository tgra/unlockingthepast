            "description": "unfortunate in that their first major battle had been against such experienced troops and so dashing an enemy commander but, as General Eisenhower reported on 26th February, they were resolved to benefit immediately from the battle experience gained by the intensive train- ing of all formations. Their improvement was indeed continuous and outstanding throughout the campaign. Another result of the battle had been that Allied formations of all three nation- alities were very mixed up over the whole front and my first intention was to carry out a thorough reorganization. On the day I assumed command, in an order issued on 19th February, I laid down the following principles. Separate"

            "description": "25. The climax of the main battle in central Burma was meanwhile not long delayed. During December the Fourteenth Army struck eastwards, and with the occupation of Wuntho by 4 Corps on the 20th, secured its left flank by laying the basis for a continuous front with the Northern Combat Area Com- mand. The railhead at Ye-U was occupied by 33 Corps on New Year\u2019s Day, and the Japanese stronghold \u2018at Monywa was finally teduced on the 21st, by when 33 Corps had reached the general line of the Irrawaddy, on which it was evident that the enemy had resolved to make a stand. Bridgeheads had however been secured by 20 Division on the left bank of the river at Thabeikkyin and Singu, and in the great bend of the Irrawaddy the Japanese stoutly defended the approaches to Sagaing on the right bank. In these two sectors, where the contending forces were not separated by the river, bitter fighting continued throughout the second half of January and the first half of February. To the north- east, the Northern Combat Area Command forces were moving southwards across the Shweli valley and towards Lashio ; Hsenwi was a on 19th February, and Namtu on the"

            "description": "201. On the 16th February, naval forces, commanded by Captain D. C. Hill, R.N., landed 53 Brigade at Ru-Ywa against slight opposition. Enemy gunfire from the Tamandu area was dealt with by the NARBADA and JUMNA. This initial success, and the subse- quent build-up, were largely due to audacious minor operations carried out during the three nights preceding the landing. Detailed recon- naissance by 3 Commando Brigade of the man- grove swamps west of Ru-Ywa revealed an unoccupied island four miles from the proposed bridgehead. A battery of medium artillery was unobtrusively transported to it by naval land- ing craft, a light airstrip was constructed, and supplies dumped. The enemy never succeeded in\u2018locating this battery and its support proved invaluable. The Japanese made a determined attack on the bridgehead on the 19th February,"

            "description": "100. On the Northern Combat Area Com- mand front 36 British Division (less 29 Brigade), advancing on Mongmit from the north, effected a strongly opposed crossing of the Shweli River during the first week of February. The first attempt failed, but the second one, made with increased air support, was successful near the bend of the river north of Myitson. Myitson fell on the 9th February and the advance continued against stiff resistance. On the 17th, the enemy counter- attacked in strength, using flame-throwers and rouch artillery. They succeeded in penetrat- ing our forward positions, but were ejected by a Spirited attack by an Indian battalion after bitter hand-to-hand fighting. Our further progress towards Mongmit continued to meet with determined resistance. 29 Brigade, advancing on Mongmit from the west, captured Nabu on the 18th February and, by the end of the month, had reached a point approximately half way between Nabu and Mongmit, Further east, 50 Chinese Division entered Namtu on the 23rd February, captur- ing eleven locomotives and a quantity of tolling stock. Further east again, 30 Chinese Division captured Hsenwi on the night 18th\u2014 19th February against light opposition. This village lies on the Burma Road about 30 miles north-east of Lashio. The enemy in this sector appeared to be falling back to posi- tions immediately north of Lashio, with a view to defending that town."
