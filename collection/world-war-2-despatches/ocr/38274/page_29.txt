medical use, and was converted into a coastal
hospital carrier for fifty lying and seventy
sitting cases.

Two other hopsital ships in use were the
“Wu Sueh’’ and “ Melchior Trueb’’. The
former was unsatisfactory in nver evacuation,
and had to be fitted with improved cooling
plants. The latter was converted during thé
period into a satisfactory ocean-going hospital
carrier with accommodation for two hundred
and ninety-four patients,

54. Tratning of Medical Personnel.

This has progressed in spite of difficulties
such as low standard of recruits, differences of
language, lack of trained instructors, and little
time for training. .

A medical school of jungle warfare was
started in the 26th Division Area (Arakan) in
July, which was attended by selected officers
from all Divisions in North East India.

55. Medical Stores.

During the period, the situation as regards
medical stores nmproved, but there have been
temporary shortages at times, of,supplies of
Mepacrine and Pamoquin (for malaria).
Except for this there were no difficulties other
than those connected with certain known items
of which there is a world shortage.

56. Incidental Medical Matters.

Pathology assumes importance when the
bulk of sick are suffering from malaria, dysen-
tery or veneral disease, and progress was made
in the provision of laboratories and clnical
slide-rooms.

Dental facilities improved in all areas, and
men were no longer evacuated unnecessarily for
dental treatment.

A Facio-Maxillary unit was opened in
Calcutta where cages of grave head injuries
can receive adequate treatment.

Arrangements for dealing with mental cases
also were developed by the formation of a de-
finite network of centres and subsidiary centres
in North East India. This will prevent tem-
porary cases being evacuated.

Diversional therapy also received attention,
and a Red Cross Diversional Therapy Service
has ‘been formed which will extend over the
whole of North East India. It should be par-
ticularly welcome in forward hospitals where
amenities are scarce, In this as in other direc-
tions where the Red Cross has extended its in-
valuable help, our indebtedness to this organisa-
tion has continued to be great. I wish to record
my gratitude for the assistance it has given.

57. Welfare among Troops and Familhes in the
India Command.

With the great increase in the numbers of
British personnel in India that took place since
the beginning of 1943 their welfare became a
tmnatter of increasing concern. It has an obvious
bearing on morale, and in this is linked with
the soldier’s-outlook for the future.

Living in a tropical climate under conditions
devoid of most ordinary comforts and unable
to buy in the ordinary market many of the
commodities that make up the every day needs
of the civilised mortal, large numbers of British
soldiers have had to work under lonely or

2679

depressing surroundings in back areas, and with-
out the stimulus of contact with the enemy,
It 1s for these, just as much-as for the men
in forward zones, that welfare work 1s of zmpor-
tance, and it has been carried on ceaselessly
in spite of many and varied difficulties and
handicaps,

‘One of the difficulties has always been a lack
of ‘buildings suitable for welfare activities, and
welfare funds were very largely expended in

. providing them. ’

A great deal has been done by enthusiastic
officers in the field, particularly in the forward
areas of Eastern India. The work of the army
welfare officers has been supplemented by the
efforts of Toc H, the Y¥.M.C.A., and the
Women’s Voluntary Services, which have
opened many new institutes and canteens in
spite of difficulties in obtaining sufficient staff
to serve the troops on as wide’a scale as is
necessary in a country of such vast distances
and such difficult climatic conditions, and so
undeveloped according to western standards,

In August, 1943, it was possible to appoint
welfare offcers to all the major areas of the
Eastern Army, thus relieving the strain on the
few officers who had hitherto borne the whole
burden.

Funds were provided for welfare on a per
capita basis, but how best to use these funds
is ultimately a problem for the unit to decide—
a problem which hasnever+been easy in the jungle
areas and under the monsoon conditions in
which the Eastern Army had to live and fight.
In response to requests from units, however,
Jarge quantities of books, games, sports gear,
gramophones, etc., for both British and Indian
Troops were sent out from the Eastern Army
amenities depot in Calcutta. As the volume
of the supplies increased it was found necessary
to establish two sub-depots to facilitate distri-
bution further forward, and these were accor-
dingly set up at Gauhati and Chittagong.

Supplies of such things as those mentioned
above have been generally plentiful, with one
major exception. There have never been
enough mobile cinema units available in India,
and despite persistent efforts to obtain more
of them, there are still far too few to cope with
the numbers of troops they have to serve~
Eastern Army was allotted the major share of
those available, but the fact remains that the
provision of more projectors and more up-to/
date films is a matter of paramount importance
and urgency. Entertainment was provided by
touring British and (Indian concert parties, some
organised by G.H Q. and the rest by the Bengal
Entertainment for the Services Association
(B.E.S.A,).

‘Officers were not forgotten, and H.E. the
Viceroy generously contributed large sums of
money from his War Purposes Fund for the
equipping of leave hostels and the subsidization
of hotels and the foundation of clubs in Chitta-
gong, Comilla and Gauhati.

The important subject of family welfare, on
the British side, was dealt with by the
S.S A.F.A. sub-office set up in Calcutta, and
this was followed in July, 1943, by the establish-
ment of a Legal Aid Section which by the °
end of October had already dealt with 160
applications for legal advice and assistance.
