It professed great friendship for Britain and sent two goodwill missions to Singapore to cement this friendship. Nevertheless, the Japanese continued to reconnoitre Siam and to make preparations for utilising that country as a Base: they accelerated the provisioning of the aerodromes at Singora and Patani, which they also extended to make them suitable for modern aircraft. As November 1941 progressed, evidence of Japanese activities increased until, on 22nd November, 1941, the information at G.H.Q's | disposal was sufficient to indicate that Japan was about to embark upon a further major",

Briefly, this appreciation considered that any further major action by Japan in the near future would take place from South Indo-China against Siam, rather than from North IndoChina against the Burma road. G.H.Q. did not, however, disregard the possibility of Japan making a   gambler's throw   against Malaya or even against Singapore itself. G.H.Q. concluded that the most likely operation which would be called for on our part in -the immediate future would be to the set plan   Matador,  namely an advance by our land forces into South-East Siam? A.H.Q. was accordingly instructed to make all preliminary moves and to be ready to support   Matador   at 72 hours  notice, and was informed that this support for  * Matador   was to take precedence over the preparations then being made for an International A'r Force to operate in South China. A.H.Q. was also warned that the full reconnaissance plan for detecting the approach of a sea expedition against Melya might be ordered later.",

I pointed out on 8th November that, on the present programme, my Armies would still be ten thousand vehicles short by xst January and that it would be impossible to mount  an amphibious operation before 25th December. If the craft were then withdrawn it would be impossible to lift as much as a division with what would remain. However, we decided to go on planning on the assumption that sufficient might be available. The SEXTANT conference was due to open in Cairo on 22nd November and General Eisenhower agreed to press there for the retention of the landing craft which I thought Necessary.",
