Irrawaddy attacked the 17 Division recon-
naissance unit, the 1 Glosters, at Paungde and
fighting continued throughout the day. Com-
mander 1 Burcorps decided that this was a
good opportunity for offensive action. Accord-
ingly a force consisting of one armoured regi-
ment and two infantry battalions attacked
early on the 2oth March and recaptured
Paungde, but during the day a strong enemy
force appeared at Padigon, six miles to the
‘north. Another enemy force in considerable
strength, after surprising and overcoming a
commando unit on the west bank, crossed the
river from Padaung and occupied Shwedaung
establishing road blocks across the main road,
thus cutting off the force at Paungde.

28. During the following 48 hours fierce
fighting took place and, although the tactical
situation was not unfavourable to the. Imperial
Forces, the familiar Japanese tactics of estab-
lishing road blocks in their rear forced the 17
Division to abandon their main object of
destroying the enemy in the Paungde area in
order to reopen their. L. of C. This brought
about the withdrawal of the r7 Division to the
Prome area, which was completed by the
evening of the 30th March. During this fighting
the enemy was actively assisted by traitor
Burmans and some Japanese were found to be
wearing Burmese clothes. The commando unit
referred to in paragraph 27 was surprised by
Japanese soldiers who had disguised themselves
in this manner.

29. Withdrawal to the Dry Zone. On the
30th March the Commander-in-Chief in
India arrived by air in Burma and on the
ast April I accompanied him by air from
Mandalay to Magwe, proceeding by road to
Corps Headquarters at Allanmyo. At a con-
ference which took place here on the afternoon
of the rst April the Commander-in-Chief agreed
that, in view of the difficulties of the country
and the fatigue of the troops in 17 Division,
a withdrawal from Prome to the Allanmyo area
should commence forthwith, and that this with-
drawal might have to be continued even further
north into the dry zone south of Taungdwingyi,
where the country was more open and more
suitable for the employment of tanks. On the
evening of the 1st April the enemy attacked
Prome and penetrated the defences held by the
63 Infantry Brigade securing the high ground
south of the town, The 17 Division was forced
to withdraw on the and Apml north and north-
east of Prome. On the 3rd April the 17
Division moved back through 1 Burma
Division, in position in the area Dayindabo-
Pyalo, to the area Ywataung-Kyaukpadaung-
Bwetkyichaung, the 48 Infantry Brigade and
the 7 Armoured Brigade, less one regiment,
moving during the night of the 3rd to 4th ‘April
to Satthwa. On the 3rd April xr Burcorps
issued an Operation Instruction covering the
possibility of a withdrawal to the line Minhla-
Taungdwingyi and the withdrawal from Prome,
which was originally intended to stop at Allan-
myo, was, in view of the tired state of the
troops, continued to this line, which was
reached by the night of the 4th-5th April ex-
cept by the 2 Burma Brigade, moving up
the west bank, which did not reach Minhla
till the night of the 8th-gth April.

‘During this period: the enemy air force was
very ‘active and there was a considerable

amount of bombing and machine gunning in
the forward area.

30. Dispositions for the Defence of the Oil-
fields. The dispositions of 1 Burcorps on the gth
April were on the general line Minhla,
Migyaungye, Nyaungyatsan, Thadodan and
Taungdwingyi. It will be noted that the
stretch of front from Minhla to Taungdwingyi
was over 40 miles and that in consequence
there was no depth. With this in mind, I had
on the 4th April requested General Tu Yu
Ming, commanding Chinese Fifth, Army, to
send one ‘Chinese regiment* to hold Taungd-
wingyi so as to enable 1 Burcorps to form a
reserve. General Tu informed me that he had
already ordered one battalion to Taung-
dwingyi. The fire power of the Chinese bat-
talion was, however, not more than that of a
company of Imperial troops. A regiment
was therefore promised.

After further consideration I decided that at
least one Chinese division was required to hold
Taungdwingyi and accordingly I asked the
Generalissimo, who arrived in Maymyo on the
6th April, to make a division available for this
purpose. He promised that he would do so.
In the event, however, only one Chinese bat-
talion reached the Taungdwingyi area. The
failure of the Chinese to supply a division for
the defence of Taungdwingyi had the most
serious consequences.

31. Lack of Information. I feel it 1s necessary
to comment here on the lack of intelligence at
my disposal, Owing to the hostility of the local
population and to the total lack of air recon-
naissance, information was most difficult to get.
It appeared, however, from such identifications
as were obtained that z Burcorps were opposed
only by the Japanese 33 Division but that this
Division was assisted by a considerable num-
ber of traitor Burmans. On the Chinese front
only the Japanese 55 Division had been identi-
fied. The operations which took place about
this time illustrate clearly the advantage which
the initiative confers on a highly trained force
which has the assistance of the local popula-
tion in a country of great distances and poor
communications. The successes which the
Japanese gained cannot all be ascribed to their
superior training and, at this time, superior
morale.

32. Destruction of the Oilfields. On the roth
April it became apparent that enemy columns
were moving north on tracks south-west of
Taungdwingyi. On the r1th April a Corps
striking force consisting of the 7 Armoured
Brigade and the 48 Infantry Brigade moved
south to attack the most easterly of these
columns. Contact was established on the
morning of the 12th April and by 0800 hours
the 48 Infantry Brigade was being heavily
pressed and bitter fighting took place in which
the Corps striking force more than held its own.
Another enemy column on the east bank of
the Irrawaddy was attacked by the 1 Burma
Brigade. Owing to the non-arrival of the
Chinese division which had been promised for
the defence of Taungdwingyi, the Commander
1 Burcorps now felt that he could not continue
to hold Taungdwingyi and also cover the direct
approach to the oilfields, and he represented
this opinion to me. To have abandoned
