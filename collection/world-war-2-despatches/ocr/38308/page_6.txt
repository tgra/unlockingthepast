This matter of differentiating between our
own aircraft and the enemy becomes daily .of
more importance. With the suicide attack and,
as is inevitable, with our own fighters pursuing

the enemy right on to’ the Fleet’s guns there -

is only a matter of seconds in which to act.
Presented at-certain angles there is. very little
difference between the suicide-equipped
Japanese single-engined aircraft and some of
our own fighters. On'the other hand the means
of controlling, particularly of. stopping, the fire
of the innumerable small guns that are’ now

scattered about ships, often with poor com- -

munications, makes the problem difficult.

At dusk the Fleet disengaged to the south
eastward and CTF. 57 assumed tactical
command. Le ‘ ;

and April.
It was evident from experience a the day buetoxe

Sakishima airfields and it was therefore decided
to cancel the planned bombardment in favour
of air operations: : ‘
The absence of enemy ‘activity noticed by
the first fighter sweep the previous day made

it appear likely that the enemy might be leav-.

ing the’ airfields at first light. In consequence
two aircraft from “H.M.S.’ INDOMITABLE,
having. been flown’ off by moonlight, were sent
to Ishigaki at o510. ‘ Two other aircraft flown
off at the same time and destined for Miyako

were unable to proceed owing to radio failures.

No activity was reported from Ishigaki.

"At 0630 from a flying-off' position 23° 12’ N
126° 02’ E a-fighter Ramrod left to attack all
airfields before the Fleet withdrew. Little

activity was noticed, but one airborne Zeke* _

was shot down over Ishigaki by Helicats.

After landing on the fighter Ramrod at 1045,

the Fleet withdrew: to fuelling area Midge,
maintaining a CAP of 12 aircraft until dark.

Tt was very disappointing to have to cancel

the bombardment again, for although in so far.

as cratering, etc., is concerned. the large bombs

of the aircraft are the more effective, I particu- -

larly wished to bombard for. the’ sake, of the
personnel concerned: many of these are very
young and untried.

Once however enemy aircraft begin staging
through or operating from an aerodrome. the
most profitable means of destroying them is
by.air and not by guns.

At 1450 H.M.S. ILLUSTRIOUS —
man overboard. _Figliters of the CAP and

destroyers were sent to search and the .Fleet -

was turned 360° for.a period. Unfortunately
the man was not recovered.

CTF 57 resumed tactical command.

During the period’‘23rd March to 2nd April
inclusive our losses of aircraft were 25, 'com-
pared to 47 enemy destroyed or probably
destroyed and 38 damaged .on the ground.
Enemy vessels sunk and ‘damaged’ were—
I lugger sunk, 13 other small vessels probably
sunk, and over 40: small craft damaped.

_ 1930. The’ Fleet having disengaged from’ the
Tanker Group, set course at 20 knots for the
operational area. Owing” to ‘the numerous ,
delays in fuelling, the two battleships had to

. proceed nearly 50 per cent. Short of their full

stowage and aircraft carriers had been able to
embark only sufficient Avgas for the forth-
coming two days’ operation.

I judged it essential to Jeave with these short-
‘ages in order to be back at the time promised.

I do not like battleships steaming about short
of fuel for although they should have enough
oil for the operation as planned, it leaves little
in hand to meet'any change of programme, and ~
if a‘ship short of fuel received under-
water damage her ‘position might ‘become .
embarrassing. °
