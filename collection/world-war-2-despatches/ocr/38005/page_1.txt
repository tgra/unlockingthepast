Rear Admiral ee” Home Fleet,
HA.M.S. Woolwich.
25th April, 1940.
Be pleased to lay before the Board a narra-
tive of the First Battle of Narvik, which has
been prepared ‘by the Commanding Officer,
H.M.S. HOTSPUR, the senior surviving officer,
and the report of the C.O. H.M.S. HAVOCK.

H.M.S. HOTSPUR.
25th April, 1940.
Sir, .
I have the honour to forward herewith re-
ports from H.M. Ships HOTSPUR and
HOSTILE on the destroyer raid on Narvik
on roth April, 940. As senior surviving
officer of this raid, I feel I should also attempt
to give some co-ordinated account. In doing
so, I am using information obtained from
H.M. Ships HOTSPUR, HOSTILE and sur-
viving officers from H.M.S. HARDY. No
report has yet been received from H.M.S.
HAVOCK and of course, nothing is available
from H.M.S, HUNTER.

2. HARDY (Captain B. A. W. Warburton-
Lee*), HUNTER (Lieutenant-Commander L.
de Villiers), HOTSPUR (Commander H. F. H.

Layman) and HAVOCK (Lieutenant-Com-
mander R. E. Courage), left Sullom Voet at
dawn on 7th April, in company with the
Twentieth Destroyer Flotilla and joined
RENOWN north of the Shetlands. The whole
force proceeded in company towards Vest Fiord,
destroyers being eventualy detached to lay the
minefield off Eggeloysa at dawn, 8th April,
1940.

3. After guarding the minefield for a few
hours reports of 2 enemy destroyers were re-
ceived from GLOWWORM and ships of the
Second Destroyer Flotilla joined RENOWN
southwest of the Lofoten Islands before dark.

4. At daylight on oth April, rg4o, the
RENOWN encountered SCHARNHORST and
HIPPER. The Second Destroyer Flotilla,
stationed astern of RENOWN carried out a divi-
sional concentration on HIPPER but the range
was probably too great. All destroyers were
soon left behind in the heavy seas, but not
before both HARDY and HUNTER had nar-
rowly escaped being hit.

5. The Second Destroyer Flotilla was then
detached to patrol east of the Lofoten Islands.
After about two hours this patrol was broken
off on receipt of orders to go to Narvik. Just
‘before leaving her patrol position HOTSPUR
made visual contact with REPULSE.

6. (Available reports tended to show that
Narvik was only lightly held so the flotilla was
stopped off Tranoy at about 1600 to obtain in-
fonmation and HOSTILE (Commander J. P.
Wright) joined. It was then learnt that the
enemy held the place in force.

7. The following “‘ Most Immediate ’’ mes-
sage was sent by Captain (D), Second Destroyer
