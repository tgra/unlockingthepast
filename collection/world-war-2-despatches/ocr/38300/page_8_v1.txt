16. The attack was carried out by all aircraft according to plan.

In only one case, where the pilot of an- aircraft was grazed by a shell splinter at the time

_of releasing his torpedo, was the accuracy of

the attack affected.

17. One Albacore was shot down by enemy:

which is missing is thought to have met the.

same fate. One other Fulmar engaged an 'M.E.109 . without definite result, and was. 7 attacked by another M.E.109 which was driven off by means of a   Tommy   gun from the back seat. to

Ig. Returning aircraft were landed on from 1615 to 1658. The time taken in landing on twenty-one aircraft, some of  them in  damaged condition, in forty-three minutes without any mishap was  the result of good backing up by pilots and of good drill by the handling parties on deck and in the hangars.

21. For the last nine months, FURIOUS has been employed as a Transport Carrier, and it was a tonic to all concerned to learn that once more she  was to be used operationally.

22. A full scale rehearsal, as carried out by

VICTORIOUS had to be abandoned as far as FURIOUS was concerned. No flying, except for action purposes, could be carried out oni pare owing to the necessity of conserving ue.

23.  On the day, the work of the Flight Deck

Party and Squadron personnel, coupled. with the close backing up by pilots when Janding on,  

was excellent, and this alone enabled a most exacting programme, which allowed no latitude, to be adhered to in every detail. .

in turn 

pline was of a very high standard.

|  AM. ee VICTORIOUS. i 30th July, 1941. ;

 The following brief report  of the part taker by aircraft from H.M.S. VICTORIOUS ip

_ Operation's E. F.  is submitted. .

2A striking  force consisting of 12 g. ATRAtRS

_ of No. 827 Squadron and 8 Albacores of No. 828

Squadron was flown off in one tange at 1400 on 3oth July. Alt aircraft were armed with torpedoes fitted with duplex .pistols set -to noncontact at 14 feet. At 1430 a fighter escort of

  g Fulmars of No, 809 Squadron, and a fighter

patrol of 3 Fulmars of 809 Squadron was flown

off, the former Having been ordered to over-

take the striking force en route for the objective

and the latter to Patrol over the Fleet,

3. The ents escort  on making a: Jandfall: proceeded at a height of 4,000 feet to-a position ~  between Renoy: and Prestoy Islands where

: heavy anti-aircraft fire was encountered. It was {

therefore decided to circle this area in the hope ( of drawing the fire from the striking force. }

4. Approximately ten minutes  later at least three -M.E.10gs and six M:E.110s were seen approaching from the direction of Vadso and

-Kirkenes aerodromes,

5. During the ensuing combats two M.E.110s and one M.E.109 were shot down for certain and confirmed, and a further M.E.1z0 was possibly shot down. Two of this Squadron are missing, but the pilot of one was seen to escape by parachute. '

6. 827 Squadron, on making a landfall. at Rabachi peninsula, formed sub-flights astern, - proceeded at low altitude. down | Jarfjord, (  climbed the intervening hills, and then attacked   shipping in Bokfjord.

7. Five aircraft fired at the. BREMSE  and two hits were reported. The remaining aircraft. _ fired at shipping anchored IN.E. and N.W. of Prestoy. Torpedoes -were observed running correctly towards two targets but owing to heavy fighter opposition encountered at this time it was impossible to observe the results. During the retirement heavy fighter opposition continued and one JU.87 was shot down for certain / by a front gun, and a probable M.E.109 with i arear-gun. Six Albacores were lost. The air gunner for whom th  probable M.E 109 is claimed, died in the aircraft and was buried at  , sea after the aircraft had returned to the ship.

 8. 828 Squadron which approached Rabachi peninsula about half a mile astern of the leading squadron, formed  sub-flights in line astern and led away through the hills to attack shipping at the northern end of Bokfjord:
