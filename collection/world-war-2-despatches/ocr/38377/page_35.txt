of the JU.88s made the fighters’ task a hope-
less one. It will be a happy day when the
fleet is equipped with modern fighter aircraft.

1g. As the force moved east it was to be
expected that the U-Boat and air threat would
progressively increase. Additional anti-sub-
marine measures were taken to counter the
U-Boat concentration which was believed to
have been disposed in an area near Galita and
our vigilant A/S screen had the satisfaction of
} achieving a “‘ kill ’’ of one Italian submarine.*
_' H.M.S. ITHURIEL delivered the coup de
grace to-this submarine by ramming it and in
doing so badly damaged herself and put her
\ sei gear out of action. The submarine when
it came to the surface after being depth
.~ charged was obviously “‘ all in ’’ and I thought
the expensive method chosen by the Com-
manding Officer, H.M.S. ITHURIEL, to sink
it quite unnecessary. Moreover, J was dis-
- turbed at the resulting absence of ITHURIEL
from the screen when an air attack was

impending. i

20. Throughout the day the force was under

y continual observation by aircraft which were
protected, progressively more strongly; by
fighters. During the day the force was sub-
jected to three very heavy air attacks; whilst

\ Force X, after parting company, was attacked
at dusk by bombers and torpedo bombers.

-21. During daylight hours our fighters,
though frequently greatly outmumbered, con-
tinued their magnificent work both in report-

* ing approaching raids and in shooting down
‘ enemy aircraft. Success also attended our A.A.
guns though more from their deterrent effect
‘than from the accuracy of their fire.

22. In their daylight attacks, the enemy
employed every form of air attack, including
minelaying ahead of the fleet, which, so far
as I know, has not been used before by the
, enemy.

23. Despite the great numbers of aircraft
employed in the four heavy attacks on the fleet
up to 1900 on D.3, it is gratifying to record that
the only casualties were one M.T. ship with her
speed reduced by a near miss, one destroyer
torpedoed but afloat (though later sunk by own
“ forces), and the INDOMITABLE put out of

flying action but capable of steaming at 28}
knots. ;

24. I had intended that Force Z should tum
to the westward on reaching the entrance to the
Skerki Channel at f915 and had warned the
fleet accordingly. The damaged INDOMIT-
ABLE, on fire forward and aft, caused me,
however, to advance this time by twenty
3 minutes, and at 1855 I ordered Force Z to
turn and Force X to proceed to Malta. The
withdrawal of Force Z was apparently un-
noticed by the enemy and its separation from
Force X not discovered by him until about
2030. e

25. In view of the magnitude of the enemy’s
air attack at 1830 to 1850 it seemed improbable
that a further attack on Force X on any great

scale would be forthcoming before dark, and
having reached the Skerki Banks, it was hoped
that the submarine menace was mostly over.
The dangers ahead of Force X seemed to lie
principally in attacks by E-Boats during the
night and by aircraft the following morning.

’ 26. Thus the enemy’s successful submarine
attack at 2000 when NIGERIA, CAIRO and
OHIO were torpedoed was unexpected and its
effect far reaching. The time was a critical
one, for the change from four columns to two
columns was being made .and for this
manoeuvre the cruisers were much needed ds
leaders of columns. The torpedoing of H.M.
Ships NIGERIA and CAIRO, the temporary
non-effectiveness of H.MS. ASHANTI
(Captain (D), 6th Destroyer Flotilla) while
embarking Rear-Admiral Commanding, roth
Cruiser Squadron, and the detachment of 4
Hunt destroyers to stand by the damaged
cruisers, deprived (a) Force X temporarily
of its Commander, (6) two columns of their
leaders, (c) the convoy of nearly half its escort,
and (d) the force of its two Fighter Direction
ships. On hearing that NIGERIA and CAIRO
hhad been torpedoed I ordered CHARYBDIS,
ESKIMO and SOMALI to reinforce Force X.
From about 2035 to 2100, the convoy was
subjected to a very severe dusk air attack by
dive bombers and torpedo bombers. ASHANTI
and PENN laid a smoke screen to cover the
light western horizon, but this did not -prevent
the attack being effective. EMPIRE. HOPE
and GLENORCHY were both bombed and
sunk, the latter blowing up with no survivors.

A separate torpedo bomber attack sank
DEUCALION at 2130 near the Cani Rocks
when under escort of BRAMHAM .

The Commanding Officer, H.M.S. KENYA
describes the state of the convoy subsequent
to these misfortunes as chaotic. I think this
may be'an exaggeration for though necessarily
the convoy was in a confused state there is
no evidence to show that any ship of the con- |
voy was steaming other than in the correct
direction. Furthermore we know that 11 of
the convoy got safely, though some not un- «
damaged, as far as Kelibia,* by early morning.

D.4 (13th August). .

27. The attenuated line ‘of merchant ships
and the reduced number of escort ships pro-
vided easy opportunities for attacks by the
E-Boats which were lying in wait off Kelibia.
Here three of the merchant ships which failed
to reach Malta were torpedoed. Of these the
WAIRANGI, it is believed, was hit in the
engine room and was permanently disabled,
but the ALMERIA LYKES was hit before the
bulkhead of No. 1 hold and could well have
continued steaming to Malta.

28. In the early morning MANCHESTER
was torpedoed, supposedly by an E-Boat or
possibly mined, and-after the ship’s company
had abandoned her in the ship’s boats and
Carley rafts she was scuttled by order of her
Commanding , Officer.

- 29. The E-Boat attacks during the night
added further to the disorganisation of the con-
voy and at daylight. the scattered ships were
