SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

Rangoon after the 1945 monsoon. Now we
were aiming at capturing Rangoon by land
advance from the north, an operation which
for long had been regarded as impracticable.
There were additional reasons for this change.
After the Yalta Conference, the Chiefs of
Staff had sent the Supreme Allied Commander
a new directive. This was not only influenced
by the speed and success of our advance in
Burma, and the opening of the Ledo/Burma
Road, but also by the general quickening of the
tempo of the American operations against
Japan in the Pacific and in the Philippines.
The new directive ordered South-East Asia
Command to defeat the Japanese Army in
Burma and capture Rangoon; thereafter to
open the Straits of Malacca and to capture
Singapore. After the Chiefs of Staffs’ promise
to give us the necessary transport aircraft, on
the 5th February I received a directive from
the Supreme Allied Commander ordering me
to “seoure the Ledo/Burma Road, capture
Rangoon by ist June, 1945, and destroy the
main Japanese forces in Burma excluding the
Tenasserim.” In furtherance of the second half
of his directive from the Chiefs of Staff, Ad-
miral Mountbatten decided to capture the
island of Phuket, as an air base and a station
for the assembly of naval landing craft, with
a target date in June 1945. This proposal was
put up to the Chiefs of Staff on the 26th Febru-
ary, and received their general approval on the
2nd March.

94, 34 Indian Corps was formed for this
operation. It had been obvious for some time
that if operations were to be extended beyond
the Burma theatre, additional formations
would be required, and in particular another
Corps Headquarters. There was only one
immediate source of man-power, namely
Special Force, until the redeployment of forces
from Europe began. I therefore recommended
the immediate formation of a Corps Head-
quarters and Corps Signals to plan and train
for future operations and, in February, the
Supreme Allied Commander asked the Com-
mander-in-Chief, India, to implement the
formation of such a Headquarters from the
assets becoming available from the disband-
ment of Special Force. By the end of
February, H.Q., 34 Indian Corps, had been
established at Poona, becoming an assigned
formation. Placed under its command were
23 Indian Division, which was the General
Headquarters, India, reserve division, but
which was released for my operations by
General Auchinleck ; 81 (West African) Divi-
sion, which had just come out of the Kaladan,
and 3 Commando Brigade, which had carried
out highly successful operations at Akyab,
Myebon and Kangaw with 15 Indian Corps.
Planning by 34 Indian Corps for the Phuket
operation began in Delhi on the Ist March,
under Lieutenant-General O. L. Roberts, who
was appointed to the command of the Corps
early in March. (See also Sec. XVIII.)

95. Returning to the operations in Central
Burma, if the Japanese reactions to our suc-
cessful crossings of the Irrawaddy are to be
understood, it is necessary to look at their plans
and the situation as it must have presented
itself to them at the time. It had been the
intention of the Commander of the Japanese
Burma Army that the main battle should be
fought on the banks of the Irrawaddy. By the

second half of February it must have been
clear that this battle was not going very well,
but the position did not yet seem irretrievable.
At that time 19 Indian Division had broken out
of their bridgehead at Kyaukmyaung and
begun their advance on Mandalay (i refer later
to these operations), but they had not yet
crossed the formidable Chaungmagyi Chaung,
which most effectively bars the approach to
Mandalay from the north. 2 British Division
had only penetrated five miles inland from
Ngazun. 20 Indian Division were being bitterly
attacked and were still confined to a narrow
semi-circle of ground. They had not yet
linked up with 2 British Division. 7 Indian
Division had already captured Pagan, but
believing, as they did, that 4 Corps was still
operating on the left of 33 Corps, the
enemy regarded this crossing merely as a diver-
sion which could be dealt with by the troops on
the spot. General Kimura therefore decided to
restore the generally adverse situation by a
counter-offensive. The main effort was to be
by 15 Army, which, reinforced by most of
18 Japanese Division, was to launch an offen-
sive with 18 and 31 Divisions from Madaya
and Sagaing towards Wetlet (on the Shwebo
railway line from Sagaing). On the right
flank of this counter-offensive 33 Army, with
56 Division and a regiment of 18 Division,
was to hold the areas round Lashio and
Namtu, whilst on the left 28 Army was to
defend the Irrawaddy valley about the
Yenangyaung and Mount Popa areas and
launch an offensive in the Pakokku area. The
scale of the latter—it was to be made by a
composite force of less than divisional strength
—showed that the real threat in that area was
not yet appreciated. The general offensive
was to begin on the 10th March.

96. This plan involved considerable move-
ments of formations, which, in view of the
state of the Japanese communications and our
air superiority, were executed with remarkable
speed. Besides the move of 18 Japanese
Division (less a regiment) from opposite
Northern Combat Area Command to the
Mandalay area, the remainder of 49 Japanese
Division (less the two regiments already com-
mitted on the Northern Combat Area Com-
mand front and in the Yenangyaung area
respectively) together with a regiment of 55
Japanese Division (from the Henzada-Bassein
area) were ordered up south of Mandalay. In
addition, a regiment of 2 Japanese Division,
destined for Siam, was stopped at Pegu and
counter-marched north. From the Arakan
frorit, 54 Japanese Division was ordered to con-
centrate north of Yenangyaung and to block
the An and Taungup-Prome roads with detach-
ments. This attempt at reinforcement from
Arakan by the Japanese must have been in the
nature of a forlorn hope and reflects their lack
of knowledge of the situation there. Thanks to
the energetic operations carried out by 15
Indian Corps, very few troops reached the
Irrawaddy from Arakan. In short, General
Kimura decided to abandon Arakan, weaken
South Burma and reduce the forces holding
the Northern Combat Area Command front to
a minimum in order to concentrate his troops
in the Mandalay sector which he regarded as
‘a vital one. As will be seen later, he was too
ate.
