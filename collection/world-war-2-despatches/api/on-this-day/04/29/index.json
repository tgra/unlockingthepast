On 21st April the Iraq Government formally agreed to the arrival of the British troops in Iraq under certain conditions: the principal stipulations being that no further troops should land before those who had already arrived had crossed the frontier out of Iraq, and that at no time should British troops in Iraq exceed one mixed Brigade. However, although the Iraq Government was adamant on this question and_the situation remained very tense, further British ancillary troops disembarked at Basra without incident on 29th April."

            "description": "By 29th April I had decided that it was necessary to reinforce First Army again and change the point of attack further to the north. The heavy pressure which we had been bringing to -bear since the 22nd had gained us a foothold at the entrance to the plain of Tunis and had stretched the enemy's powers of resistance almost to breaking point, but if I was to finish the campaign quickly, to fit in with the time-table for Sicily, a sudden powerful stroke was necessary. The events of the past week had shown that Eighth Army was unable to make any vital contribution by attacks on their front; indeed, in spite of the pressure they had kept up, the enemy had found himself able to withdraw ali his armour from the southern front. I therefore ordered General Montgomery on 30th April to despatch at once to First Army the best formations he could spare to reinforce the main blow from"

The Elbe was crossed on 29th April and spearheads made straight for Lubeck in order to seal off the Schleswig-Holstein peninsula. At the same time, moving by road, a U.S. airborne corps of two divisions, together with 6 British Airborne Division, formed a defensive flank facing East on the line DarchauSchwerin/Wismar. Orice across the river our operations were virtually unopposed. The plan for outflanking Hamburg  by a manoeuvre similar to that used at Bremen was actually under way when, on 2nd May, the Germans came out to negotiate its surrender. Across the Elbe the countryside was packed with a mass of German soldiers and refugees, fleeing from our own advance and from that of the Russians: with whom we established contact on 2nd May. :"

But when Rashid Ali was informed that a second brigade would shortly be landed, he sought to refuse permission until the original brigade had moved out of Iraq. While the question was still under discussion Rashid Ali and the pro-Axis elements in Baghdad decided to take action against the Royal Air Force station at Habbaniyah, to which place the British women and children in Baghdad had been transferred on 29th April, in view of the obviously threatening attitude of certain elements in Baghdad."

            "description": "The conference was eventually called, after some mishaps, on 29th April and attention was at once directed to proposals for strengthening the assault in the south-east. General Leesey represented Eighth Army's point of view. He argued that the Army was, on the present plan, divided into two halves which were too widely separated to be able to support each other and possibly too weak for either to be able to achieve their respective objects. He therefore proposed that both Corps should assault the east coast, one in the area of Avola and the other on either side of the Pachino peninsula (Cape Passero); this would give a firm base for the conquest of the island. Admiral Cunmingham did not approve of the suggested change. Apart from his conviction, on general grounds, that in amphibious operations the landings should be dispersed, he considered it essential to secure the use of the south-"
