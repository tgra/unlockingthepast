Partly’ owing to the above thentioned diffi-
culties and partly owing to the conditions of
the campaign, there fs no doubt that the
‘wounded have suffered very considerable hard-
ship. The D.M.S., Colonel Treffrey Thomson,
and his staff, have made every effort to im-
prove matters but would be the first to agree
that there has been much in the medical
situation to cause them very serious concern.

Apart from the difficulties met in dealing
with our own casualties the virtual breakdown
of the civil medical services has imposed con-
siderable additional strain on the military
organisation. Furthermore, the arrival of
Chinese troops with practically no medical
organisation at all has rendered it necessary io
provide not only stores and equipment that
could ill be spared but also medical units, staff
and beds in our own hospitals.

51. Amenities. A great deal has been done
in the face cf much difficulty by Lieut.-Colonel
A. Campbell, Chief Amenities Officer, to
provide some small amount of amenities to the
troops.

52. Canteens. No canteen organisation
existed before the war, and although a Defence
Services (Burma) Canteen was set up in
‘January or February with the assistance of
India, it never really got started.

As will easily be realised the canteen situa-
tion was a potent contributory factor in
lowering the morale of both officers and men.

53. Transportation. The Director of Trans-
portation arrived in the country on 2gth
January. There were no military transporta-
tion units whatsoever, except a Docks
Operating Company which did very good work.

The railway administration was not to be
convinced of the necessity of raising some
military units, operating under military control,
to run the railways in the operational area.
India was unable to provide them and it was
not found possible to raise them locally.
Experience elsewhere suggests that if this had
been done, the railways would have stood up to
the strain better than they did. The same
remarks in general apply to the Irrawaddy
Flotilla Company, but the personality of the
Manager, Mr. Morton, ‘assisted by some British
officers enabled the organisation to do some
excellent work in the later stages after it had
been taken over by the military. The lesson
is that transportation must be organised for
war.

VII. THE INTERNAL SITUATION.

54. Ciutl Officials: In view of the fact that I
and most of my staff were entirely new to
Burma we were naturally dependent on civil
officials for assistance in those cases where local
knowledge was required. I should like there-
fore to pay a tribute to the unfailing support
and assistance I received throughout from the
Honourable Mr. John Wise, Defence Counsellor,
and by Mr. Potter, head of Military Finance.

55. Internal Situation. As regards the
internal situation there were from the beginning,
many alarmist reports. There is no doubt that
the enemy had thoroughly organised their
sympathisers in Burma before the outbreak of
war, and received very great assistance from
them. On the other hand, a larger proportion
of the population and subordinate officials
remained loyal than many of the British

.

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948

officials expected, and though there were many
treacherous attacks on our troops there were
also ‘many cases of willing assistance being
given to stragglers and others.

The worst feature of the situation was the
attitude of undisciplined elements towards the
unfortunate Indian population who were robbed
and maltreated in a most shameful manner, in
spite of the efforts of many well disposed
Burmans to help them.

With the progress of invasion and the
organisation of the so-called Free Burma Army,
the situation naturally grew worse, but it is
fair to say that during the period covered by
this report, the traitor forces achieved remark-
ably little, though their presence was a constant
threat which imposed a corresponding strain
on our military organisation.

56. Martial Law Throughout the period
covered by the Report, the Government were
opposed to the institution of Martial Law, partly
owing to its association in the minds of the
people with the civil rebellions of former
years.

During the last days of Rangoon when
looting, arson, etc., were already rife, it was
decided to hand over the town to the military.
A military commandant was appointed, but this
was too late in the day to enable him to make
any material improvement in the situation.

37. Policy as regards Evacuation The pohcy
of H.M.G. as regards evacuation was quite
clear. If it proved to be impossible to hold
Rangoon it was essential that the demolition of
the oil refineries, oil storage and other im-
portant installations should be as complete as
possible. It was also laid down that it was not
desirable that the Army should become bottled
up in Rangoon, which was in itself indefensible,
but that it should if necessary withdraw in
order to carry on the war in Upper Burma.

This would in any case retain for a time the
possession of the oilfields, cover the projected
road to India, protect important aerodromes,
and perhaps most important of all, ensure our
continued co-operation with the Chinese forces.
A considerable period was also required to
complete the necessary arrangements for the
demial of the oilfields to the enemy. As regards
the oil it was found possible by moving certain
plant from Rangoon to develop a very con-
siderable output of M.T. petrol and 87 octane
spirit in the ouilfields—amounting possibly to
about two million gallons a month—a most
valuable example of foresight on the part of
my staff.

58. Demolittons. At that time all the in-
formation available pointed to the fact that if
it was not possible to hold Rangoon and the
oilfields, the greatest service that could be
rendered to the Allied cause would be a
complete denial of the oil and refinery resources
of Burma. It had been suggested that the
Japanese war effort might collapse for lack of
oil.

This involved very detailed planning and
a vast amount of highly technical preparatory
work. This was carried out under the general
supervision of Mr. Forster, whose enthusiasm
and drive combined with his previous
experience, was most valuable. He was most
ably assisted by Captain. Scott, R-E., and
members of the various oil companies who had
