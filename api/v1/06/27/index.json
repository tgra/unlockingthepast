On the 27th June, before these orders could take full \u00e9ffect, the enemy breached our minefields south of Matruh and, reaching the coast toad, partially surrounded the roth Corps which was holding Matruh and Bagush. During the next two days these troops managed to break through the enemy and reachel El Alamein, though they lost heavily in the process and had to be withdrawn to the Delta to reorganise and refit. Meanwhile, the r3th Corps on the southern flank fought desperately and with some success to stem the enemy\u2019s advance. The enemy lost no time in following up our \u2018withdrawal from Matruh, and on the 1st July Jaunched an attack against the 1st South"

The strong mountain positions north of Perugia, extending almost to the east shore of the lake, were unsuitable for operations by 6 British Armoured Division; the Germans rapidly appreciated \u2018this and were able to withdraw 15 Panzer Grenadier Division to the west side of the lake to oppose 13 Corps. They also pulled out 94 Infantry Division and sent it back to North Italy to reform completely with fresh drafts, On 26th June 10 Corps regrouped; 10 Indian Division arrived and 6 Armoured was sent across to reinforce 13 Corps. The same day 8 Indian Division scored a gratifying success \u2018by the capture of Monte Pilonica, east of the Tiber. Between the river and the lake the Germans now began, on 27th June, to fall back"
