held command of the sea, advance beyond
Moulmein by the Japanese would be open to
a British flank attack.

Continuing north, there were again only
tracks until reaching the road leading from the
Bangkok-Chieng Mai railway, through Chieng
Rai and thence via Kentung to Taunggyi. On
the Siamese side of the frontier this road was
good; on our side it was fair-weather only for
part of the way.

There were only tracks leading from Burma
into Northern Indo-China, and these involved
the crossing of the River Mekong. Into China
itself there was a fair track from Kentung to
Puerhfu, and, secondly, the main road from
Lashio to Kunming. A road from Bhamo joined
the latter near the frontier.

Westwards, a start had been made on a road
communication with India, but this was by no
means complete when war broke out.

Landing grounds had beer established in the
Tenasserim Peninsula with the object of facili-
tating the movement of aircraft between Burma
and Malaya; the main ones were at Tavoy,
Mergui and Victoria Point. The last was very
isolated, and it was realised that it probably
could not be held for long if war with Japan
broke out.

1g. It was estimated that the total force
which the Japanese could bring against Burma,
using land communications only, would be
about two divisions, of which one division
would be on the road running through Chieng
Rai. The Chiefs of Staff considered in January
, 1941 that, although four enemy divisions could
be maintained at railhead on the Bangkok-
Chieng Mai railway, it was unlikely that even
one division could be maintained on the Burma
side of the frontier, owing to the limited road
communications. The situation would, how-
ever, be completely altered should the Jay
get control of sea communications in the Bay of
Bengal. In that case, their capture of Mergui,
and possibly Tavoy, would only be a question
of time. They would be able to outflank our
positions at Moulmein, and our line of com-
munication thence with Rangoon; and, should
Singapore fall or be invested, would be able to
bring by sea against Burma a force much
greater than two divisions,

zo. Turning to the Chieng Rai line of
advance, owing to the indifferent road on our
side of the frontier and the shortage of Mechani-
cal Transport, it was impracticable to maintain
a big force east of the Salween. The policy,
. therefore, was to fight delaying actions as far
forward as possible, and to make the Salween
the main line of defence.
“Owing to the. heavy growth of trees along
the Japanese lines of advance, conditions were

not generally favourable for air reconnaissance. -

On the other hand, there were certain open
defiles against which air bombing would
probably have been very effective, and it was
hoped that sufficient air force would be avail-
able to deter the Japanese advance to a great
extent. For this purpose aerodromes were
constructed with the object of being able to con-
centrate either on Central or South Burma, and
against either the Mesod road or the Chieng
Rai road.

Demolitions were prepared along the enemy
lines -of advance, especially on the Chieng Rai
road.

Engineering Programme.

ax. There was a great shortage of engineers,
both civil and military. In planning the engi-

-Reering programme, priority was given first to

aerodrome construction and accommodation for
the Royal Air Force; secondly, to road con-
struction for strategical and tactical purposes,
including ferries; and then accommodation for
troops and stores, including ammunition.

In the time available there was no opportu-
nity to complete elaborate concrete defence lines;
all that could be done was to constnict field
defences on the probable lines of approach.
There were limitations even to this: first, the
difficulty of working and the prevalence of
malaria in the rainy season; secondly, the num-
ber of troops available; and thirdly, the lack of
Mechanical Transport, until the Autumn of
1941, which severely limited the number of men
that could be maintained near, and east of,
the Salween River.

Strength of Forces.

22. The composition of the military forces in
Burma when war broke out is shown in Appen-
dix G, and the situation regarding Anti-Aircraft
guns in Appendix F. F :

As will be seen, the organisation was some-~
what complicated from the desire to make every
possible use of local resources. Originally, the
Burma Frontier Force had been independent
of the General Officer Commanding in peace,
and only came under him in time of war. His
Excellency Sir Reginald Dorman Smith decided
to put the Burma Frontier Force under the
General Officer Commanding’s control in peace
as well, thus simplifying the organisation. The
change was effected on the roth November,
IQ4r.

The Independent Company was abolished
before war with Japan broke out, the British
portion being used mainly for additional squads
for Chinese guerillas, and the Burmese return-
ing to their original units.

23. In the Singapore Ccnference of October
1940 it was recommended that as regards the
Army, the force immediately required for the
defence of Burma was as follows: —

5 infantry brigades and two additional
battalions;

I field regiment and 1 battery;

2 mountain batteries:

I anti-tank battery;

theavy A.A. regiment (24 guns);

I light A.A. battery, non-mobile (16 guns);

1 light A.A. battery, mobile; and

I company light tanks.

This was exclusive of the Burma Frontier
Force and of the Territorial! and Auxiliary
forces allotted to internal security duties. It
was also stated that an additional requirement
for the long-term problem was: one Division,
less certain units, which made the fighting
portion of this Division as follows: —

2 infantry brigades, each ‘of 3 battalions;
I reconnaissance unit;

I field regiment (24 guns);

1 medium regiment (16 guns);

t light A.A. regiment (48 guns);

I anti-tank battery; and

1 machine gun battalion.

In their comments of January 1941, on the
Conference, the Chiefs of Staff stated that they
considered both the threat of attack, and the
demands for land forces, had been overstated. .
