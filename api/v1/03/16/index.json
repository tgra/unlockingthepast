            "description": "117. In the Meiktila area, there was con- tinuous fighting. While mobile columns of infantry and tanks were successfully operating against the enemy who were attempting to close in on the town, inflicting heavy casualties and capturing many guns, the Japanese were con- centrating on capturing the airstrip, two miles north of Meiktila, on which our supplies de- pended. On the night 15th-16th March, their attacks reached the north-west corner of the airstrip where they dug in. They were success- fully counter-attacked but their guns still dominated the strip, and the air-transportable brigade of 5 Indian Division, which was then being flown in landed under artillery fire. Several aircraft were destroyed, but the American Air Commandos were undeterred and no sortie turned back. The enemy then attacked in strength and succeeded in capturing the airstrip. This resulted in an immediate severe curtailment of supplies, including ammunition, since we had to fall back on \u201c dropping \u201d as opposed to \u201clanding.\u201d There followed a week\u2019s fierce fighting to regain the strip. The enemy dug in in the broken country to the north, which was almost impassable for tanks, and strengthened the position with numerous anti-tank guns and minefields. This meant that the clearance of the strip was a job for the infantry, together with elements of the R.AF. Regiment and R.A.F. Servicing Com- mandos, and it was achieved against the most determined opposition with the magnificent support of R.A.F. fighter-bombers. The Japanese artillery, however, still covered the airfield at almost point-blank range and further bitter close-quarter fighting was necessary be- fore the enemy was routed. The whole area was cleared by the 29th March. The enemy\u2019s suici- dal resistance cost him nearly all his guns and we inflicted tremendous casualties."
