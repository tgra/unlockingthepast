railway trucks. A fuel supply for the Kow-
loon, power station was thus assured, but
the margin was so close that on one occasion
the power house was within 15 minutes of
closing down completely.

412. Railway workshops were also under the
initial supervision of a R.AF. staff, which
was later augmented by suitable personnel
through arrangements with Civil Affairs.
Under R.A.F. supervision these workshops
completed repair to three locomotives, some
twenty goods wagons, and three passenger
coaches. As a result, the rolling stock
augmented by this output from the railway
workshops was sufficient to meet the require-
ments of the railway within the colony.

413. Even Hong Kong’s municipal water
supply included an element of R.A.F. super-
visory staff, though in this respect the water
supply as a whole had suffered little during
enemy occupation and therefore met existing
requirements.

414. The morale of our Air Forces in the
execution of these extraordinarily varied tasks
was wonderfully high, and once the initial
excitement and novelty associated with their
misemployment in the role of shock troops,
guards, policemen and municipal authorities
had worn off, R.A.F. units took stock of the
situation and tumed their attention to the
tasks of resuming their nonmal service duties.

THE LIBERATION OF ALLIED
PRISONERS OF WAR AND INTERNEES

Operations “ Birdcage” and “ Mastiff”

415. The relief and liberation of almost
100,000 Allied prisoners-of-war and internees
confined in Japanese prison camps throughout
the vast territories of South East Asia, is an
episode in the Far Eastern War which relied
almost entirely upon Air Power for its success
in the initial but vital stages of its operation.

416, It would be inaccurate to record that
the Air Forces alone were responsible for the
ultimate rescue and liberation of these thou-
sands of prisoners, but the Air Forces of this
Command carried out vital tasks as follows: —

{a) Spread the news of Japanese surrender
in millions of leaflets dropped over the prin-
cipal towns and known sites of Japanese
prison camps scattered throughout South
East Asia.

(b) Warned Allied prisoners-of-war and
finternees of their impending liberation.

(c) Dropped medical supplies, medical
teams, administrative personnel and W/T
operators to make first contact with prisoners
and to signal back vital information regard-
jing numbers imprisoned and supplies re-
quired.

@) Air dropped, or air landed, quantities
of food, clothing and other necessities to
relieve the privations suffered at prison
camps.

(e) Evacuated by air hundreds of
prisoners from Malaya, Siam, French Indo-
(China, Sumatra and Java, including cases
of very serious illness.

417. In a message to all formations of Air
Command which took part in the inauguration
of this task on August 28th, 1945, the opera-
tion was described as “ the greatest mercy mis-
sion of the war ”.

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 195i

418. It was a mission of paramount import-
ance to thousands of families in Britain, the
Dominions and, indeed, in Holland, who
eagerly awaited information about relatives
interned and captured during the Japanese
conquest of Malaya in 1942.

419. In Singapore alone, about 35,000
Prisoners were held in the various Japanese
prison camps throughout Singapore Island)
the most notorious of which was the Changi
Gaol. The inmates of these camps had been
subjected to coarse indignities and even torture.
_ 420. The feeling in Britain found expression
in a message from the British Foreign Secretary
to the Supreme Allied Commander, South East
Asia, in which he drew Admiral Mountbatten’s
attention to the numerous enquiries which the
Government had received since the publication
of atrocity stories from Singapore and else-
where, and saying that there was grave concern
in respect of Sumatra, since deaths actually re-
ported by the Japanese through the Inter-
national Red Cross were much higher in pro-
portion to numbers anywhere else in the Far

ast.

21. It can be seen, therefore, how well
suited was Air Power to perform this vitally
important task involving great distances across
great tracts of land—a task also in which speed
was essential for its success.

Operation “ Birdcage” launched.

422. As soon as the Japanese surrender had
been universally accepted and confirmed, action
was taken to issue instructions contained in
specially prepared leaflets to: —

(@) Japanese Prison Guards.
(b) Allied Prisoners-of-war.

(c) Local Japanese forces.

(@ The local native population.

‘423. The operation to implement this action
was allotted the code name of “ Birdcage,”
and was launched by the Air Forces of Air
Command on August 28th, operating from
bases in Ceylon, Cocos Islands, Bengal and
Burma.

424, Thereafter, Operation “ Mastiff”, was
planned to ensure that medical aid, comforts,
food, clothing, R.A.P.W.I. Control Staffs where
necessary, and any other essential preliminary
needs were introduced into the camps as early
as possible.

425. Operation “ Birdcage” was completed
by August 31st. In the space of four days,
leaflets had been dropped over 236 localities
and 90 prisoner-of-war camps throughout
Burma, Siam, French Indo-China, Malaya and
Sumatra. Where sorties were at first rendered
abortive by weather and by difficulty in locat-
ing targets or by mechanical trouble, ‘they
were persisted with on the following days. Very
few priority targets remained uncovered. One
group of towns in the hinterland of Malaya
was successfully covered only at the third
attempt.

426. In addition to Liberator sorties flown
from bases in Ceylon, Cocos Islands and
Bengal, Thunderbolts operating from Burma
dropped one million leaflets on thirteen locali-
ties in Southern Burma extending as far south
No target was left un-
covered. One Thunderbolt was lost during
these operations—the aircraft crashing in
flames at Kraburi.
