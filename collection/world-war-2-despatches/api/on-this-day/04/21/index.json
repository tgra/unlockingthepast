On 21st April the Iraq Government formally agreed to the arrival of the British troops in Iraq under certain conditions: the principal stipulations being that no further troops should land before those who had already arrived had crossed the frontier out of Iraq, and that at no time should British troops in Iraq exceed one mixed Brigade. However, although the Iraq Government was adamant on this question and_the situation remained very tense, further British ancillary troops disembarked at Basra without incident on 29th April."

The base at Namsos was now being regularly bombed and General Carton de Wiart reported that the maintenance of his force in this area was becoming difficult and that, unless some respite from the enemy bombing could be gained, it might well become impossible. Bombing of Andalsnes was also taking place and considerable damage had been done. Arrangements were then made with the Royal Air Force to land Gladiators on a frozen lake at Lesjaskog, between Andalsnes and Dombis, as soon as the"

He lost heavily, including 33 tanks destroyed by us and over 450 prisoners. That he did not succedd in seriously disorganising our ffinal deployment for the big attack was a tribute to all units concerned, as naturally the confusion at one time was considerable when enemy tanks appeared in the dark amid our batteries, being deployed ahead even of our Forward Defended Localities. But the fighting against 46 Division on g Corps front did delay the launching of the attack there for four hours and created some confusion and fatigue amongst the troops of 138 Infantry Brigade forming up for the assault."

By nightfall, they had reached Yeni, 43 miles from Toungoo and 218 miles from Rangoon. 161 Brigade took over the defence of Lewe airfield after its capture by the armoured column, preparing it for the glider fly-in of aviation engineers. They also cleared the northern part of Pyinmana, the Japanese garrison still resisting stubbornly in the southern sector. Meanwhile 123 Brigade passed rapidly through 161 Brigade and reached Thawatti, almost catching up with our armour three miles further south. Continuing their rush south, both our tanks and our infantry reached a village 15 miles north of Toungoo on the 21st April. On this date, the enemy in Pyinmana were finally liquidated. ."

The deep penetration made by the Japanese 33 Division at Yenangyaung appeared to present a favourable opportunity for a counter stroke but, owing to the nature and extent of the country, this was beyond the capacity of 1 Burcorps alone, as considerable forces were required merely to find the enemy should he elect to move into the jungle. General Stilwell agreed to make available for a counter stroke the 200 Chinese Division and one regiment of the 22 Division in addition to the 38 Division, and arrangements were made to set in motion the moves of these formations towards Kyaukpadaung and Ywamun as soon as possible. Having made these arrangements I accompanied the Commander 1 Burcorps to his Headquarters between Meiktila and Kyaukpadaung. On arrival there I found that the attacks of the 113 Chinese Regiment and the 2 Royal Tanks had succeeded in clearing the northern bank of the Pinchaung but that 1 Burma Division had been unable to clear the Japanese from the south bank. 1 Burma Division were being attacked by an enemy column which had moved north from Magwe and columns sent out by the 17 Division from Taungdwingyi and Natmauk had not succeeded in relieving the pressure. I told the Corps Commander that 1 Burma Division must fight its way out and that, if necessary, it would have to abandon its wheeled transport. Commander 1 Burcorps issued orders to this effect on the evening of the rgth and by the morning of the 2oth r Burma Division had succeeded in extricating itself with the loss of a great part of its M.T. On the 21st April, 113 Chinese Regiment crossed the Pinchaung and entered the outskirts of Yenangyaung where it inflicted considerable casualties on the enemy."

On the 21st April it was reported that the whole of the Chinese 55 Division had been scattered by the Japanese attack, and on the 22nd that the Japanese had captured Hopong and were advancing north towards Hsipaw and Lashio with armoured forces and motorised infantry. It was never possible to discover the exact strength of the Japanese thrust but of the weakness of the Chinese forces between them and Lashio there could be no doubt. A good deal of damage was done by panic in the rear areas, especially at Lashio, and I sent Brigadier Martin, my chief liaison officer with the Chinese forces, to attempt to restore order and confidence there, which he succeeded in doing. Under the orders of General Stilwell, 28 Chinese Division (less one regiment) was moved during this period from Mandalay to Hsipaw, but the disorganisation of the railways made this movement very slow. I therefore took steps to protect my rear by sending a detachment from the British Infantry Depot at Maymyo to hold the Gokteik Gorge on the Lashio Road. On 23rd and 2qth April the Chinese 200 Division captured Taunggyi and advanced towards Hopong. On the aqth April I asked General Stilwell to come and see me at Maymyo. The situation, however, did not permit of his leaving his Headquarters and therefore on the morning of the 25th April, in company with my M.G., G.S., I went to General Stilwell's Headquarters at Kyaukse  and I arranged to meet there General Slim, Commander 1x Burcorps. Here I learned that the enemy were putting heavy pressure on the Chinese 96 Division which was holding the front, that this Division was breaking up and that the Japanese were advancing from"
