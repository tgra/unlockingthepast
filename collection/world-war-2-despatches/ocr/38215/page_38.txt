211. Summary.—After sixteen days of con-
tinuous and exhausting operations our troops
on the west coast were back behind the River
Perak. What would have happened had Opera-
tion MATADOR been put into effect in good
time is a matter for speculation. It is almost
certain that it would have eased the air situa-
tion by denying to the enemy some of its fighter
bases. On the other hand, had we been un-
able to hold the strong enemy thrust on the
Kroh front our communications to North
Malaya and subsequently to East Malaya would
have been severed and our whole structure of
defence undermined. For the frustration of the
enemy’s plan to destroy our forces in this way
we are indebted particularly to the fine fighting
of the troops on the Kroh and Grik roads and
to the quick reaction of all commanders to the
very real threat which the enemy’s thrust on
this front constituted.

212. Operations im the Ipoh area —On the
gand December the Commander 3 Indian Corps
decided to held the areas south of Ipoh as
under : —

One Brigade Group between Kg. Sahum
and Tapah.

One Brigade Group covering road and rail-
way north of Kampar.

One Brigade Group covering road and rail-
way north of Bidor with a battalion at Ct.
Jong and the Independent Company at Telok
Anson.

On the 23rd December the Commander 3
Indian Corps issued instructions to the Com-
mander 11 Indian Division, the gist of which
were as under *—

(a) The Commander 11 Indian Division
would assume control of all combatant troops
north of the Rivers Slim and Bernam.

(b) The enemy was to be delayed for as
long as possible west of the River Kinta.

(c) The positions at Kg. Sahum—Kampar
—-Tapah and Bidor must be held until the
strategic situation demanded that the Divi-
sion be withdrawn. A rear position was
being prepared in the neighbourhood of the
River Slim.

(2) Local
advocated.

(e) In case communications should be cut,
each battalion was to hold ro days’ supplies
and ammunition.

(f) Fighting patrols were to be employed
to watch the flanks which could never be
‘secure.

(g) Civil labour was being engaged and
handled by the Europeans of the Perak
Volunteer Force.

The 6/15 Indian Infantry Brigade had now
been rested and reorganised. Three days in
the Ipoh area had worked wonders. All units
had been partly, but far from completely, re-

offensive operations were

equipped. The outlook was very much brighter. .

The Kampar position was rapidly put into a
state of defence.

‘213 On the 26th and 27th December the 12
Brigade Group fought a delaying action north
of Chemor (10 miles north of Ipoh) inflicting
heavy casualties on the enemy, whose units
moved forward in close formation. The 5/2
Punjab Regiment, upon which the brunt of the
fighting fell, distinguished itself though it
suffered fairly heavy losses.

SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

During these two days the 28 Brigade Group
continued to watch the line of the River Perak
in the Blanja area,

By the 26th all troops remaining in Ipoh had
moved south. Among the last to leave their
posts were the Chinese and Eurasian girl
operators of the telephone exchange who were
handling military traffic and who continued to
do so in the face of bombing and the approach
of the enemy until ordered to leave. They
deserve the highest praise.

The withdrawal of the 12 and 28 Brigade
Groups began at rgoo hrs. on the 27th Decem-
ber and continued throughout the night. The
12 Brigade Group, to which had been allotted
the task of delaying the enemy’s approach to
the Kampar position north of Dipang, occupied
a position south of Gopeng, while the 28
Brigade Group took up positions astride the
defile road which protected the right flank of
the Kampar position, with one battalion in the
Tapah area.

The newly formed Kedah Armoured Car
Company, manned by European Volunteers,
acquitted itself well during and following the
withdrawal. It now became apparent, how-
ever, that the enemy were using an armour-
piercing bullet against which the armour of the
Marmon-Harrington armoured cars was not
proof. Many casualties were suffered by the
crews of these cars during the subsequent
operations.

214. On tthe 29th December the 12 Brigade

, Group was early in contact with the enemy

who attacked at 1000 hrs The attack was
repulsed but, realising that the enemy was now
in strength, the divisional commander ordered
the brigade to withdraw that evening through
the Kampar position and come into reserve at
Bidor. The enemy followed up the withdrawal
closely and again tanks produced a de-
moralizing effect on the tired troops. The situa-
tion was saved by some excellent work on the
part of the 137 Field Regt. and the 80 A/Tk.
Regt.‘ The large bridge over the River Kampar
at Dipang was destroyed after several abortive
attempts.

The 12 Brigade Group had had a gruelling
time. Since the battle of Gurun it had borne
the brunt of the fighting, and in its doggedly-
fought rearguard actions between Batu Pekaka
and Selama, on the Grik road and in the Ipoh
area it had gained time for the re-organization
of the remainder of the 11 Indian Division and
the occupation of the Kampar position and had
inflicted delay and heavy casualties on tthe
eherny. It had, however, suffered severely
itself.

215. In order to protect the long and vulner-
able communications the 1 Independent Com-
pany had been sent to the Telok Anson area
on the lower reaches of the River Perak. From
here distant boat and cycle patrols were sent
out. It was supported by one infantry
battalion at Ct. Jong. |

216. Operations of Rose Force.—Towards
the end of December a successful raid was
carried out by Rose Force, strength about 40
men, against the enemy’s communications west
of the River Perak. The party was landed from
the sea on the Perak coast but was un-
fortunately weakened by the breakdown of one
of the troop-carrying launches A M.T. column
was ambushed and some lorries and two staff
cars containing high-ranking officers destroyed.
