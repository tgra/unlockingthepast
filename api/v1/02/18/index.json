            "description": "54. I realised that it was quite impossible for the enemy to defend the whole river and that to effect a crossing could only be a matter of time, the only danger being immediate counter- attacks delivered from the rear. I urged the Commander of r2th (A) Division to tap in all along and seize possible bridgeheads, and it was my intention, had he not been successful in doing so with his own resources, to bring up the 11th (A) Division and place the force on a two-divisional front so as to increase the chances of finding a suitable crossing place quickly. On the night of 17th/18th February however, the 1st S.A. Brigade managed to effect a crossing at Ionte. During that night they were. counter-attacked by a force of the enemy from Giumbo; the counter-attack was successfully beaten off with great loss to the enemy. On i9th February the Gold Coast Brigade also succeeded in forcing a crossing at Mabungo. This crossing entailed cutting a track for three miles through the tropical jungle belt mentioned above, which work was successfully and rapidly carried out."

The position, held by 3 Infantry Brigade, was untenable against a heavy attack and it was only by committing 168 Brigade of 56 Division, which had landed as a reinforcement on 3rd February, that it was possible to extricate our troops from the salient by the night of the 4th/5th to a line \u2018covering Carroceto and the \u2018\u2018 Factory\u2019\u2019. VI Corps then went over to the defensive in pre- paration for the enemy counter-attack in force, of whose imminence there was strong evidence. Two positions were to be prepared in rear of the present front lines; the last, corresponding with the initial bridgehead, was to be the final line. 1 and 3 Divisions, both reinforced, plus the newly arrived 1 Special Service Force and a regimental combat team of 45 Division, were in the line; the remainder of the 45th and r Armoured Division, less one Combat Command, were in reserve. As the dimensions of the enemy threat became more, apparent I decided that more reinforcement was nece: and sent in the remainder of 56 British Division; this arrived between 13th and 18th February and relieved x Division on the 13th. On 25th February 18 Infantry Brigade, from the British 1 Armoured Division in North Africa, began to disembark at Anzio."

Consequently, in view of: this serious situation, I telegraphed my apprecia- tion in which I set out the factors of the air situation and indicated three courses of action. Firstly, to remain with the Army during the move northwards towards China. In thege circumstances the |R.A.F. units would have become a wasting force, since maintenance would be difficult if not impossible once Rangoon had fallen, while heavy losses for small return would be inevitable in the event of reinforced enemy scale of attack. Secondly; to withdraw the air force to India when Rangoon was closely threatened. The final course was to leave a mixed force of 1 Hurri- cane Squadron, 1 Blenheim Flight and 1 Army Co-operation Flight, withdrawing the remainder of the force to India. No reply was received to this telegram.*"

The first attempt failed, but the second one, made with increased air support, was successful near the bend of the river north of Myitson. Myitson fell on the 9th February and the advance continued against stiff resistance. On the 17th, the enemy counter- attacked in strength, using flame-throwers and rouch artillery. They succeeded in penetrat- ing our forward positions, but were ejected by a Spirited attack by an Indian battalion after bitter hand-to-hand fighting. Our further progress towards Mongmit continued to meet with determined resistance. 29 Brigade, advancing on Mongmit from the west, captured Nabu on the 18th February and, by the end of the month, had reached a point approximately half way between Nabu and Mongmit, Further east, 50 Chinese Division entered Namtu on the 23rd February, captur- ing eleven locomotives and a quantity of tolling stock. Further east again, 30 Chinese Division captured Hsenwi on the night 18th\u2014 19th February against light opposition. This village lies on the Burma Road about 30 miles north-east of Lashio. The enemy in this sector appeared to be falling back to posi- tions immediately north of Lashio, with a view to defending that town."

Com- mand and the War Office an appreciation which after referring to the severe check that had been inflicted on the enemy on the Bilin River indicated that if, as appeared probable, he was able to renew his attack with fresh troops, it might not be possible to continue to hold the position. It also pointed out that if the battle went badly, the enemy might succeed in crossing the River Sittang- without much difficulty which would render the evacuation of Rangoon an imminent possibility. After reviewing the meagre resources of troops available, and future reinforcements, it is stated that prob- ably the best that could be hoped for was that it would be possible to hold up the enemy on the line of the River Sittang. This would, how- ever, involve an immediate threat to the main road and railway from Rangoon to Mandalay which was the main route of supply of China and for the evacuation of civilians, stores and base installations from Rangoon. After refer- ring to the difficult problem of whether to start evacuation of non-essential personnel at once, with its obviously bad effect on morale, or risk congestion and confusion at a later stage, it con- cluded by stating that five divisions in all were essential to the defence of Burma of which two would be required for the defence of the River Sittang. It expressed doubts, however, as to whether sufficient troops could arrive in time to save Rangoon and said that unless they could do so more quickly than was at the time visualised, the risk of losing Rangoon within the next few weeks was considerable. The accuracy of this was very fully borne out by events. On the 2oth February, after the de- cision to withdraw to the River Sittang, a further telegram was sent which, after describ- ing the condition of the troops, dealt in some detail with the necessity for taking preliminary measures for the evacuation of Rangoon. It stated that after consultation with the Governor and Combined Commanders, it had been de- cided to commence certain measures under the evacuation scheme which would not, however,"
