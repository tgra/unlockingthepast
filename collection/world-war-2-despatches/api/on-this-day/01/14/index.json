On the left the New Zealanders and 7 Armoured Division felt with some caution round the southern end of the enemy's anti-tank screen. By the evening we had reached the Wadi Zem Zem and seized the main crossing at El Faskia. The battle of the Buerat line was now over in a day and the enemy began to withdraw on his whole front, making for the hilly country covering Tripoli on the south-east. His maim anxiety throughout was for  his desert flank, since his left, retreating by the road, had to make a fairly wide circuit through Misurata and Zliten He went back fairly slowly, therefore, on his right, pivoting on Bem Ulid until 90 Light Division on the coast had teached Homs; then he drew his southern forces back to Tarhuna and by the rgth was again facing south-west on the general line Homs Tarhuna. The two divisions on our left found great difficulty in coming to grips with the enemy for the country was very difficult and, in the early stages, strewn with mines 51 Division, on the coast, met less enemy resistance but was delayed by heavy demolitions and mines all along the road. It was not until the early hours of 18th January that the division entered Misurata and the evening of the igth when it entered Homs. We were now in close contact with the enemy all along his new position, By this time too our fighter aircraft had been installed on new landing grounds at Bir Dufan, south-west of Misurata, where they could attack the enemy in the hill country all the way to Tripoli.",

As there is only a ferry crossing over the broad  tiver at Muar, all wheeled transpart had to pass through Segamat which thus became a bad bottleneck.

The Divisional Commander reported that the position at Kampar was satisfactory. As regards future strategy, he expressed confidence in his ability to hold the enemy north of the Kuala Kubu Road Junction until at least the 14th January. He was therefore instructed that he was not without permission to withdraw his force beyond that road junction before the r4th January, and that he was to continue to 1mpose the maximum delay on the enemy's advance. I impressed upon all commanders the importance of taking adequate measures to prevent penetration by enemy tanks down the main road a danger which I considered a very  real one in-view of our complete lack of tanks with which to counter it.",
