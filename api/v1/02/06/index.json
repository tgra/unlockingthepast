At 0930 hrs. on the 6th February our air reconnaissance sent out from Palembang in Sumatra reported one cruiser, four destroyers and four merchant ships at anchor in the Anambas Islands some 250 miles north-east of Singapore. We concluded that this was a sea- borne force assembling for an attack either on Singapore or on some objective in the N.E.1."

The difficulties of this opera- tion will be appreciated when it is realised that throughout the entire battle the enemy had the high ground, and all movements, whether in M.T. or on foot, were clearly visible to his O.Ps. O.Ps. on Fort Dologorodoc and M. Sanchil have the road almost in enfilade for miles. O.Ps. on M. Samanna and M. Amba overlooked all administrative areas of the for- ward brigades. During the night 4/5th February, 3/14 Punjab Regiment went through 2 Camerons on Cameron Ridge and occupied Brigs Peak, but were driven off on the after- noon of the next \u2018day. \u201c1/6 Rajputana Rifles occupied the extension of Cameron Ridge south of Brigs Peak, and although severely counter- attacked, held on.

A special security route had \u2018been chosen for him run- ning east-south-east by compass-bearing to the north-western slopes of Belaya, but this proved too difficult for M.T. and he eventually reached Belaya by horse on 6th February. In the meantime Colonel O.C. \u2018Wingate had been appointed commander of the forces in Gojjam, and Brigadier D. S. Sandford became Political and Military Adviser to the Emperor."

The New Zealanders had relieved the Americans south of Route 6 on 6th February to allow the latter to concentrate for the attack; but it was now clear that they would be obliged, not merely to debouch through a gateway flung open for them, but to capture the gate themselves. II Corps went over to the defen- sive on 12th February. My plan now was for 4 Indian Division to capture Monastery Hill while the New Zealanders would seize a bridge- head over the Rapido. The Corps would then exploit up the Liri valley, but this was not to start until weather conditions were favourable enough to allow the movement of armoured forces off the roads. At the same time I ordered Fifth Army to make plans for resuming the offensive with VI Cotps."

In the event the two attacks went in on the same day, 16th February. A preliminary to the New Zealand Corps attack was the destruction of the Monastery of Monte Cassino by air bom- bardment and artillery fire. This famous building had hitherto been deliberately spared, to our great disadvantage, but it was an in- tegral part of the German defensive system, mainly from the superb observation it afforded. It is doubtful, however, whether the ruins after the destruction were not more valuable to the enemy than the intact buildings; as we were to find in the town of Cassino below, heavy bombardment often produced better defensive positions than it destroyed. The attack which went in on the r6th made no pro- gtess. 4 Indian Division ruefully decided that the Cassino position was almost as strong as Keren, still their invariable standard of com-"

            "description": "388. On the qth and 5th February, Seletar, Sembawang and Tengah came under steady observed shell fire, and all operations had then to be carried out from Kallang. The Japanese bombers concentrated their attack on this station, and the landing area was soon so riddled with craters that only by constant and arduous labour was a landing stp 750 yards long main- tained in operation. Even so, by 6th February our pilots experienced very great difficulty in avoiding craters when taking-off and landing."

            "description": "192. In the meantime 22 (East African) Brigade were transferred from Akyab to Kyaukpyu, thus releasing 4 Brigade of 26 Indian Division for more active operations further south. 4 Brigade forced a crossing of the Yanbauk Chaung on the 6th February. The enemy were now trapped by the three-pronged advance of 71 Brigade due south from Sane, 4 Brigade south and east from the Yanbauk Chaung, and 36 Brigade north and north-west, after its landing in the south. They were being driven towards Ramree town, in the south-east corner of the island, whence their escape was cut off by the Naval blockade under the orders of Captain E. W. Bush, R.N. On the 8th February, 71 Brigade had reached the hills north of Ramree. There they were heavily engaged, though a patrol which entered the town itself that afternoon was informed that it had been evacuated. The enemy were, however, unable to stop our tanks and, by the 9th, they were driven from their positions overlooking the town\u2014the Japanese defence, determined as it had been, had failed, but they made a final effort to break the sea blockade and extricate their garrison. On the evening of the 11th February, they launched an air attack on our two destroyers, which were guarding the sea approaches. Under cover of this diversion, forty powered craft left Taung- up to rescue their troops in Ramree. The"

            "description": "293. On the 23rd February the Supreme Commander had held a conference at Fort William, and at it approval was given to the outline plan produced by the Joint Planning Staff in their Paper No. 88 of the 6th February. It was appreciated that the Japanese would endeavour to hold Malaya and in particular, Singapore, as a barrier to prevent our entry into the area of the South China Sea. Similarly, without Singapore we would be un- able to extend materially our operations east- watds. The object of the paper was to exaniine the best outline method of reaching Singapore."
