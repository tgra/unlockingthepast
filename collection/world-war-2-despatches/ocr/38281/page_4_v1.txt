2802 damage  on the enemy by the destruction of one or more of his-battleships. The polity I followed was in general accordance with the accepted principles of war and the  ' Fighting Instruc-  tions.  I do not suggest that a rigid adherence to these principles and instructions is either necessary or desirable, but on the other hand T consider that the interests of the country are best served by general adherence to. established principles, and instructions based on  those principles.

Conduct of Officers and Men.

26. Both from. personal observation  and reports I have received, I am able to state that the conduct, of officers and men taking part in this,.engagement left nothing to be desired. It  was. a pleasure to observe the enthusiasm with which the ship's company of RENOWN closed up:.at their action stations on hearing  that enemy forces were in the vicinity and their subsequent disappointment when it was clear that the enemy did not intend to stand and. fight was obvious. - .

NARRATIVE OF THE ACTION BETWEEN BRITISH AND ITALIAN FoRcES ON 27TH NOVEMBER, 1940.

Movements Prior to the Action.

Sunrise on the 27th November was at 0824 (zone. + 2) and at  0800   the situation was as follows:  

. (a) RENOWN in company with ARK

ROYAL, SHEFFIELD and 4. destroyers

: (Group 1) were in position at 37  48  N, 07 

24  E, steering at 083  at 16 knots, a position

of cover, 10 to 20 miles ahead and to the

North Eastward of the convoy having  been

. Maintained throughout the night;

(b) Vice  Admiral Commanding; 18th Cruiser Squadron in MANCHESTER with  SOUTHAMPTON, DESPATCH and 5 destroyers (Group II) were in company with the

.I. convoy in position 37  37  N, 06  54  E. The 4 corvettes were about 10 miles to the Westward of the convoy, having been unable to keep up with the latter.

2. At this time ARK ROYAL flew off a section of fighters, one A/S patrol, one meteorological machine and a reconnaissance of 7 T.S.R.s* designed to cover the area io the West of. Sardinia, and between Sardinia and Africa; the depth of this reconnaissance to the Eastward being just. sufficient to cover Force   D  which was approaching from Skerki Bank. The fighter section on their return to ARK ROYAL Teported that they Z. 506 r0 miles North West .of Bona at 0930.

3. Group I continued to the Eastward so as to  = ready to concentrate with Force   D  should air reconnaissance  reveal the presence of important enemy units in the vicinity of that Force. C.O:S. Alexandria's signal timed 0330/27 indicated. that the presence of Force  <2 might be known to the enemy.

4. At ogoo, in the absence of any report from air reconnaissance, which by that time was ex-: pected to have reached a depth of go miles from Group I, course was shaped to the South West to join the convoy in accordance with the. prearranged plan and provide additional A A. defence by: the. time the. first bombing attack was. likely to develop.

5. The first sighting of the enemy from the air took  place at 0852 when one of ARK ROYAL's reconnaissance aircraft sighted a group of warships and closed to investigate. At 0906 an Alarm Report was made of four cruisers and six destroyers but this report was not received by any ship.

6. At 0920, Group I sighted the convoy and course was adjusted to pass astern of it in

order to place Group I to the South of the con-

voy, and up sun from the latter, whilst carrying out flying operations and thus in the probable direction of.air attack.

7. At 0956, whilst Group I was still on the Port quarter of the convoy, an aircraft report (T.0.0.* 0920) of the presence of 5 cruisers and 5 destroyers was received by V/Sft from ARK ROYAL, 8

8. It seemed possible that this might be a teport of Force   D,  and ARK ROYAL was asked to confirm that this was an enemy report. Steam for full spead was, however, at once ordered and Captain (D), 8th Destroyer Flotilla, directed. to detail 2 destroyers to screen ARK ~ ROYAL. and 2 to screen the convoy. ~ :

9. By ror6, as a result of further reporis from aircraft, and confirmation from ARK ROYAL, the presence of enemy Battleships and Cruisers was established. RENOWN  altered course to 075  to join RAMILLIES and speed was increased as rapidly as possible to 28 knots,

ro. The composition and relative position of the-enemy forces was far from clear, the situa~. tion as viewed on the Plot at 1035 5 being shown in Diagram 1.

11. I decided: 

(i) That  the convoy should: continue towards its destination but on a South Easterly  course in order to keep well clear of any action that might develop;

(ii) To limit the escort of the convoy to DESPATCH, COVENTRY and .2. destroyers;

(iii) To proceed with all remaining forces to concentrate with Force  D  and then attack and drive off the enemy.

-12, To implement these decisions ARK ROYAL was instructed to prepare and fly off.a T/Bt striking foree  and _ to .act independently under cover of the battle fleet. DESPATCH was placed in charge of ithe convoy which was ordered to steer 120  at full speed. Cruisers and destroyers of Force   F were ordered to join Flag Officer Commanding, Force  H , COVENTRY was ordered to join the convoy, and RAMILLIES was informed of Flag Officer Commanding, Force  H  's position, course and speed..
