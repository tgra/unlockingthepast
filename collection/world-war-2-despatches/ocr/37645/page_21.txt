capture of many prisoners as well as securing
Commando Hill from which good observation
was obtained. On the night of the 3/4th May,
Skinner’s Horse and 51 Commando attacked
strongly ‘but met with stiff resistance and had
to withdraw about midnight. Though this
attack may have appeared to Fletcher Force
to have been a failure, it did in fact achieve
its object and the enemy was convinced, until
too late, that our attack was coming from
the direction of the Falaga Pass.

Feint by 3/18 Garhwal Rifles.

On the afternoon of 3rd May the carriers
of 3/18 Garhwal Rifles debouched in the Enda
Medani Alem valley, occupying it by 1730
hours as if anxious to make as much ground
as possible before dark. The tifle companies
occupied in succession the hills to the west
of the village, so timing their movements that
the last thing the enemy saw before dark was
a steady advance towards his position. After
dark vigorous patrolling was carried out and
one patrol succeeded in scaling the precipitous
Bald Hill. This bluff was successful. The
enemy believed he had repulsed a strong
attack. Behind 3/18 Garhwal Rifles noise,
activity and the display of lights, all carefully
controlled, gave added realism to the decep-
tion. The enemy was deceived ‘by these
manoeuvres, and placed his forces ‘to repel an
attack astride the road and from the direction
of Falaga Pass,

The Atiack of 29th Indian Infantry Brigade.

At 0415 hours on 4th May, 2gth Indian In-
fantry Brigade moved forward to the attack
supported by all available artillery. The
attack went with great dash and speed,
capturing Pinacle and Elephant Hill. Beyond
this the ridge narrows and is devoid of cover,
all approaches being commanded by machine-
guns from Bald Hill, and other prominent
features. The maps had given no indication of
the exceeding steepness and narrowness of the
tidge beyond Elephant, Further advance in
daylight was impossible. At o4r5 hours on
5th May, the attack was resumed and Middle
Hill was captured. Between Middle Hill and
Little Alagi the ridge again narrows to a razor-
back about 150 yds. wide, wired, flanked by
precipices and under machine-gun fire. I
Worcesters reached, and at one place went
through, the wire, but became pinned and
could not move in daylight. Middle Hill was
consolidated and the Worcesters were with-
drawn to this area on the night 5/6th May.
2oth Indian Infantry Brigade was now
definitely checked.

Operations by Patriots and South African

Forces.

In other areas Allied forces were closing in on
Amba Alagi. A strong force of patriots under
Ras Seyoum and accompanied by a small force
of S.D.F. had advanced over the hills to
Socota, 50 miles south-west of Amba Alagi.
Here they had captured the Italian garrison
and destroyed the fort. Proceeding eastwards
across-country, they struck the main road about
Quoram and Alomata on 2nd May and then
advanced on Mai Ceu which they summoned
to surrender on 6th May. Elsewhere patriot
forces had been directed to cut the roads
Debarech - Gondar - ‘Chelga, Gondar - Dessie,
pemeneh and communications round Dessie
itself,

South African Forces.

A detachment of 1st South African Brigade,
which had captured Dessie, was sent forward
from Dessie on 30th April, Advancing rapidly,
in spite of road-blocks, by .5th May their
advanced forces had reached Alomata, where
they were delayed by a serious road-block.
Their ‘advance moved so successfully that the
rest of the ist South African Brigade Group,
less one battalion, was ordered to join their
leading troops and operate against Amiba
Alagi. G.O.C, East Africa signalled that he
proposed to place this brigade group under
command Troops in the Sudan on its arrival
at Alomata. This offer was gratefully accepted.
On 8th May rst South African Brigade came
under command 5th Indian Division. Diffi-
culties of communication were considerable.
Wireless was not working very satisfactorily in
the mountains. Touch was made with the
South African Brigade by liaison officers, Later
the Commander 5th Indian Division flew to
meet Commander rst South African Brigade.
From now on the enemy forces at Amba Alagi
were closely beleaguered.

Re-adjustment. :

Since 2gth Indian Infantry Brigade was now
held up, it became clear that more weight was
mecessary on the left flank and that Fletcher
Force needed infantry. The advance so far
had made the L. of C. much more secure and
3/12 Frontier Force Regiment could now
be spared from L. of C. work. This battalion
was sent to join Fletcher Force. 3/18 Garh-
wal Rifles, having accomplished their job of
deceiving the enemy in the centre, were
relieved by Skinner’s Horse and also joined
Fletcher Force, which ‘became goth Indian
Infantry Brigade (less one battalion).

Altack on 8/9th May.

On 2oth Indian Infantry Brigade front an
out-flanking movement further to the south
was carried out. 6/13 Frontier Force Rifles,
with one company 1 Worcesters under com-
mand, descended by night some 2,000 feet into
a narrow valley from which they climbed up to
within assaulting distance of Castle Ridge.
This was attacked silently at o4z0 hours on
8th May, artillery concentrations being put
down to simulate a dawn attack on Little Alagi
and Bald Hill. All objectives except a small
portion of Castle Hill were quickly captured.
On the north end of Castle Hill a white flag
was displayed ‘but when 6/13 Frontier Force
Rifles advanced to take over the position, they
were greeted by a shower of bombs and suffered
severely, A thick mist then came down on
the hill-tops, under cover of which the Italians
were able to assemble for a counter-attack.
This was successful and Castle Hill was re-
captured by the enemy. Owing to the need
for achieving surprise and complicated by the
mist, our artillery had not ranged on Castle
Ridge and could not consequently give
effective support to 6/13 Frontier Force
Rifles.

In the centre demonstrations were kept up
to play upon the enemy’s nerves and keep him
watching this sector. These demonstrations
drew a most impressive amount of enemy fire.
