            "description": "These raids may have been a final effort on the part of the enemy to obtain supplies from Bardia and, perhaps, to rescue some of the troops besieged there. They may also have been intended to provide cover for a heavy assault on the Tobruk salient which was launched at dawn on the 4th December. Troop reliefs had just taken place in the salient pre- paratory to the attack on El Adem, when heavy shelling broke out heralding a day of attack and counter-attack. -Every side of the salient was attacked. The garrison held the enemy off"

            "description": "It proved impossible to launch thet offensive in December. The requisite precondition on which I insisted, an. adequate spell of good weather, was never fulfilled. Had we under- taken an offensive in the weather that prevailed it would almost certainly have fallen short of success and the resulting expenditure of ammunition would have meant the postpone- ment of the, offensive of next spring. Eighth Army took advantage of some fitful spells of clear weather to improve its positions; Ravenna fell on 4th December and Faenza on the 16th and by 6th January our line was on the river Senio and touching the southern shore of the Valli di Comacchio. Here the advance was halted and both sides settled down to an uneasy lull. It is surprising to note that, up to this time, the Germans had shown clearly their in- tention to maintain their strength in Italy. Two infantry divisions were hastily despatched in November to meet a crisis in Hungary but were immediately replaced; one of the new forma- tions was a division from Norway which had travelled all the way through western Germany at the time when Rundstedt\u2019s Ardennes offen- sive was raging without being drawn into it. At the end of the year,. therefore, Kesselring still had twenty-seven* German divisions, four Italian divisions and a Cossack cavalry divi- sion. Though we had failed to break through the Apengines we had succeeded in our mis- sion. The Germans found themselves obliged by the very measure of their success in the winter fighting to await our attack in the following spring on an extended and un- economical line and I was able to accomplish what I had feared impossible the previous autumn, the effective destruction of the enemy armies south of the Po."

            "description": "154. Earlier, during their advance down the Kaladan Valley in the Spring of 1944, 81 (West African) Division had suffered a check at Kyauktaw. They were unaccustomed to open country and Kyauktaw lies in a cultivated valley four miles south of the confluence of the Kaladan River and the Pi Chaung. This time it had been planned to cross the river north of the confluence and to outflank Kyauktaw to the east, while leaving a holding force on the west bank. This would act as a protective detachment against any counter- thrust and mislead the enemy as to our inten- tions. Accordingly, on the 4th December, 6 (West African) Brigade advanced east from Kyingri on the Pi Chaung, with the intention of crossing the Kaladan at a point some ten miles north of the confluence of the two rivers. The first troops of the Brigade made the crossing on the 6th December ; by the 9th the whole of 6 Brigade and Divisional Headquarters were across, and three days later only a detach- ment of battalion strength remained west of the river. Beyond shelling the bridgehead, the Japanese were slow to react to this crossing and subsequent concentration, and it was not until the 15th December that they launched a night attack against 6 Brigade, which was covering the bridgehead. This attack was repulsed after bloody fighting."
