            "description": "My administrative position was very satisfactory. I found on arrival in Middle East a highly developed administrative machine already in existence and staffs well acquainted with the problems of desert warfare. Repaired and reconditioned tanks, lorries and guns were pouring  out of workshops; new equipment was arriving from overseas and being assembled and modified in Egypt. Men from Great Britain and from hospitals in the Middle East were passing in a steady stream to the front, far exceeding battle casualties. The reinforcement and repair organisations had been working at high pressure for many months, but it needed only the knowledge of the forthcoming offensive as a spur to intensify their efforts. Fortyone thousand men joined units at the front between 1st August and 23rd October, besides those arriving with the new formations. In the same period over  a thousand tanks, three hundred and sixty carriers and eight thousand seven hundred vehicles were sent to the Eighth Army. Forty-nine pioneer companies were, assembled and equipped to undertake the many manual tasks that would otherwise have fallen on the fighting troops.",

This proposal was accepted at a further conference of Commanders-in-Chief on 1st August; we agreed that   a lodgement im Calabria was necessary but. hoped to be able to achieve it without using ro Corps at all. In any case our strategy was flexible enough to allow us to switch 10 Corps - to either objective and this was laid down in a directive issued after another Carthage cont ference on gth August. The relevant paragraph directed:   every effort will be made to seize a. bridgehead in Calabria with the resources available after the allocation of the necessary landing craft to 10 Corps.  I informed General Montgomery on 23rd August that he would almost certainly have to undertake the operation with his existing resources and withon ay caer ae an bigger peat",
