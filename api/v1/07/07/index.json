            "description": "On: the 4th July, the oth Australian Division began to concentrate on the coast in rear of the El Alamein fortress, but I had to ask its com- mander, Lieutenant-General Morshead, to detach one of his brigades temporarily to pro- vide some infantry to hold the vital Ruweisat Ridge, which was the key to our whole posi- tion. This division was incorporated in the 30th Corps, in command of which Major-General Ramsden succeeded Lieutenant-Genera] Norrie on the 7th July. The enemy now began to move tanks and other troops-round the left flank of the 13th Corps which had been stretched as far west as Deir el Harra. Our front was now much extended and loosely knit. In order, therefore, to close the gap existing about Deir el Hima between the left of the 30th and the tight of the 13th Corps, the New Zealand Divi- sion was ordered to take ground to the east- ward, their place on the outer flank being taken by the 7th Motor Brigade. The enemy took advantage of this to extend his positions to the south and east and, on the gth July, he occu- pied our defensive locality near Deir el Qattara, which had been evacuated in accordance with my policy of avoiding the isolation of troops in detached posts. The enemy continued to exert pressure on this flank and eventually pushed as far east as Qaret el] Himeimat, but"

However, even when thus reinforced, 10 Corps could have little effect on the battle for Arezzo as the country east of the town is very broken and badly roaded and the Corps\u2019 main task was to press up the Tiber valley to Sansepolcro. It was necessary, therefore, to reinforce 13 Corps and strike at Arezzo by the natural route, from the south- west. The nearest reserves were in x Canadian Corps which had 2 New Zealand Division under command; they had not been needed for the pursuit so far and had been left in the Liri valley for ease of administration and in order to give them time to rest, reorganise and pre- pare for the attacks on the \u2018' Gothic\u2019 line. The most readily available formation was the New Zealand Division at Frosinone and I decided to bring this up; to give it time to arrive the attack would have to be postponed until the 15th. ; This decision was reached on oth July and for the next four days the enemy attempted, by a series of counter-attacks on different points of 23 Corps\u2019 front, to gain the initiative and re-establish his positions where they had been endangered. These were all repulsed with heavy losses and on our side an attempt to increase our hold on Monte Lignano, the main bulwark of the defence south of Arezzo, was also unsuccessful. In the meantime Io"
