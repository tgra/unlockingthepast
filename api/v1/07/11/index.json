            "description": "21. Syracuse was occupied at 2100/10th July, the port peey entered during the forenoon of 11th July and the D+3 personnel convoy arrived there according to plan on 13th July : unloading all twelve ships and sailing them again at 1800 the same day was a notable achievement. Attempts were made to enter Augusta which was reported as having been evacuated at 0500 on 12th July but on her way to do so ESKIMO with Naval Commander Force “A” onboard was damaged in an air attack. Later in the day other ships of Force “A” again entered Augusta, and I myself went in in the evening in BROCKLESBY with Naval Commander Force “A”. At this time the enemy on the outskirts of the town commenced to shell our ships intermittently with field guns and we had to clear out. I strongly support the recommendation of Naval Commander Force “ A” that the foremost elements of the army should have some means of notifying their positions to supporting warships, as on this occasion we saw a large amount of M.T. which we thought belonged to the Eighth Army but which in fact belonged to the enemy. In consequence we missed an excellent and easy target.",

            "description": "35. The second phase of these operations, which took place concurrently with the first phase which I have already described, was the advance of 20 Indian Division along the Imphal Ukhrul road to join the forces about Ukhrul and sever all possible lines of escape of the enemy. Like the first phase, the period was one of great activity, and much fierce fighting. A Japanese force some 2,000 strong had been isolated and was trying to escape to the south-west. Bitter fighting developed between a desperate enemy trying to fight his way out of the net thrown round him and troops equally determined to hold him. Very heavy casualties were inflicted, but our losses were not light. The enemy’s forces were gradually compressed into a small area and 20 Indian Division made contact with 7 Indian Division on the 11th July.",
