south-west was’ entirely impossible until the
‘situation had been retrieved on the front of the
French rst Army.

33. 5th Division was therefore “ordered to
join 50th Division in the Vimy area, and its
commander, Major-General Franklyn, was placed
in command of all the British troops operating
in and around Arras. Frankforce, as it was to
be known, consisted of 5th and soth Divisions
(each of two brigades only), rst Army Tank
Brigade* (previously with Macforce) pew
with Petreforce and the force under O.C. 1
Lancers. Petreforce was by this time very tired
and widely dispersed.

My immediate instructions to General Franklyn
were to. occupy the bridgeheads on the Scarpe,
east of Arras and thus to relieve the remains of
231d Division. He would then be suitably
disposed to advance south and south-east of
Arras on the following day i in conjunction with
the French. -

It will be convenient to conclude the story
of Frankforce here.

"During the evening e 20th May, General
Franklyn completed his reconnaissances for an
attack on the following day to secure the line
of the rivers Scarpe and Cojeul: his intention
was to exploit success by moving on 22nd May
to the Sensée and thence towards Bapaume
and Cambrai. In these plans he had the full
co-operation of General Prioux, Commander of
the French Cavalry Corps, but the light
mechanised divisions were much’ reduced in
strength and probably had no more than one
quarter of their tanks fit for action.

However, one of these divisions was ordered
to advance on each side of Frankforce, while
tzth Lancers watched the right flank on the
Arras—St. Pol road. The hope was not realised,
however, that the French 5th Corps- would also
attack southwards from Douai with two divisions
in co-operation with Frankforce on the 2zst.
A conference had been arranged at 6 p.m. on
the 2oth at General Franklyn’s headquarters but
no representative from that Corps attended.
Finally, at 12.30 p.m. on the 21st I received a
letter from General Blanchard to say that the
Corps Commander, General Altmeyer, thought he
could move on the 22nd or the following night.

Tim :, however, was vital. General Franklyn
adhered to his plans, and at 2 p.m. attacked with
ist Army Tank Brigade, 151st Infantry Brigade
of 30th Division and 13th Infantry Brigade of
5th Division ali under General Martel. The
French 1st Light Mechanised Division co-
operated, though its movements did not develop
so widely to the flanks as General Franklyn
had hoped.

The o, oppesifien was stronger than had been
expected. Objectives for the day were reached,
and in the evening there were heavy dive-
bombing attacks by the enemy. Enemy tanks
had been put to flight : over 400 prisoners had
been captured: a number of enemy had ‘been
killed and many transport vehicles destroyed.

The tank brigade had, howéver, begun to
suffer severely from mechanical trouble; the
tanks had been on the road continuously since
they detrained at Brussels, and the mileage

* At this time their strength was reduced to approxi-
mateiy 65 Mark I and 18 Mark Il tanks. By the end of
the withdrawal from Arras there remained 26 Mark I
and 2 ilark iI tanks.

‘covered’ had-alreatly far exceeded the estimated
life of the tracks which were now beginning to
break through wear.:

It was clear therefore that the attack ‘of

. Frankforce would not maintain its momentum

unless it was reinforced and supported by the
French on its left.. During 22nd May, therefore,
General Franklyn held his ground, and pro-
longed his right flank westwards, while the
‘French Cavalry Corps took up a position at
‘Mont St. Eloi. All day long pressure increased
zound his right flank, and an observation post
of 12th Lancers on Mont St. Eloi could see at
one moment as many as 48 enemy tanks.

Next day (23rd May) the enemy advanced
steadily north-eastwards from the high ground
of the Lorette ridge, and by evening they were
reconnoitring the’ southern outskirts of Béthune
and the road from Lens to Carvin. It was clear
that Frankforce was becoming dangerously
hemmed in. Two roads were still available for
their extrication and at about 7 p.m. I decided
that there was no alternative but to withdraw
Frankforce. This withdrawal had necessarily to
-be in an easterly direction. 5th and soth
Divisions had been engaged with the enemy all
day and had inflicted very severe losses; they
were now ordered to withdraw to the area
around Seclin, where they would be well placed
to take part in any further counter-attack to
the southward which might be staged. Petre-
force was withdrawn to an area north of Seclin.

Thus concluded the defence of Arras, which
had been carried out by a small garrison, hastily
assembled but well commanded, and determined
to fight. It had imposed a valuable delay on a
greatly superior enemy force against which it
had blocked a vital road centre.

aist May—The Organisation of the Canal line.

34. The time had now come to organise, as

soon as possible, the further defence of the
south-western flank of the force.
- The enemy advance beyond Arras had hitherto
been carried out almost entirely by armoured
forces, supported by motorised infantry which
was doubtless increasing in numbers every day.
The situation regarding the enemy’s normal
infantry divisions was still uncertain. It was
therefore of first importance to reinforce the
organisation of the line of the canals from the
Escaut to La Bassée, and to continue it te
St. Omer and the sea. These canals offered the
only anti-tank obstacle on this flank. They were,
however, crossed by numerous bridges, many of
which had already been prepared for demolition
by our own engineers under my Engineer-in-
Chief (Major-General R. P. Pakenham-Walsh),
the Commander of Macforce, and the French
Commanders of the fortified sectors of Lille and
Flanders (Généraux de Brigade Bertschi and
Barthélémy).

It had been proved that even weak garrisons
holding important road centres, such as Arras
and Doullens, were of much value in imposing
delay, for the initial advances of the enemy
always followed the main roads. It was therefore
decided to continue the policy of organising
such “ stops,” not only along the canals but at
all possible centres whether north or south of
the canal line.

Macforce, which had been formed on r7th
May, had been augmented on 18th and 19th by
138th Infantry Brigade (46th Division) which
went into line on the canal between Raches and
