The operations of Special Force began on the night of the 5th-6th March, and be- tween then and the night of the 10th-11th March nearly six hundred Dakota and one hun- dred glider sorties carried 77 and 111 L.R-P. Brigades, totalling 9,500 troops and 1,100 animals, into the heart of Japanese-occupied Burma. The initial r\u00e9le of these glider-borne forces was to secure sites for and to prepare landing strips west of the Irrawaddy. Last minute air reconnaissance disclosed that one of the two potential strips selected, thirty-five miles north-east of Katha (called \u201c Piccadilly \u201d) had been deliberately obstructed. General Sim, who was present at the starting point when this news was received, was faced with the difficult decision whether to launch the operation, since it appeared that the enemy had got wind of it, or to postpone it until fresh plans could be made. He decided to let the operation go forward and on the first night the landings were confined to one strip only, called \u201c Broad- way \u201d, which was some twenty-seven milessouth- east of Hopin on the Myitkyina\u2014Mandalay railway."

            "description": "The retreat was followed up and skilfully harassed in camp at night with light machine- gun fire from two companies of the Frontier Battalion, who inflicted losses on the enemy later reported as four lorry-loads of wounded. The enemy was thus pushed through Jigga fort, and, on 6th March fell into an ambush laid by the 2 Ethiopian Battalion (some 400 men) in a river-bed west of Dambacha. Here some 1,000 casualties, including 180 killed, were inflicted on the enemy column and two of his armoured cars were captured before he had been able to smother 2 Ethiopian Battalion by sheer weight of numbers. The losses of this Ethiopian Battalion were surprisingly light\u2014 one British Officer, 90 men and the whole of the battalion camel transport\u2014but the dis- organisation that they suffered in this gallant action was such as to render them practically valueless for the rest of the campaign: Attacked at the same time from the rear by companies: of the Frontier Battalion and on the flank by patriot bands, which were always more active when he was on the move, the enemy was thoroughly scared. On 8th March he .evacuated Dambacha, and, on the roth, burned down and abandoned Fort Emanuel east of the river Tamcha, thus giving up his original plan of defence of Eastern Gojjam. The commander of Gideon Force and the Frontier Battalion pressed hard on his heels, and on 13th March were in contact with him on the Gulit Hill position just west of Debra Markos. He had concentrated here all the remaining forces of Gojjam except for the garrison of Bahrdar Giyorgis, and a battalion at Mota. Ras Hailu was also called in with his Banda to help in the defence of the town."

            "description": "to4. A column consisting of 3rd\u00b0G.C. Regi- ment, 51st G.C. Light Battery and a troop of armoured cars left Dolo at 0630 hours on r7th March to reconnoitte to Neghelli. Progress was slow owing to minefields and road-blocks. Four miles east of Neghelli opposition was met and overcome, and Neghelli itself was occupied at 0830 hours on 21st March. No administra- tive arrangements could be made at that time to maintain troops in Neghelli, so the column returned to Dolo on 26th March. On 23rd March the Commander rath (A) Division had been ordered by me to do what he could to keep the enemy forces north of Neghelli en- gaged. By making a show of force in this area it was hoped to delay the withdrawal of enemy forces on the route Neghelli-Addis Abeba and thus to contribute to the success of operations being undertaken by rrth (A) Divi- sion in the Harrar-Auasc River area. ' Un- fortunately this message was delayed and be- fore receipt the Neghelli columns, which had never \u2018been intended to stay, had been with- drawn. Accordingly, re-occupation was decided upon provided the necessary admini- strative arrangements could be overcome. A column of 3rd G.C. Regiment less two com- panies, one troop of E.A.A.C. Regiment and a section of 51st G.C. Light Battery left Dolo early on 30th March and reached Neghelli on ist April. In the meantime, however a patrol of r/and K.A.R. from the 21st E.A. Infantry Brigade at Iavello had already re-occupied Neghelli on 30th March. The 3rd G.C. Regi- ment remained in Neghelli and the 1/and K.A.R. patrol returned to Iavello. No enemy were reported near Neghelli but local riots were taking place-between Boran-and:Somaii tribes- men and punitive patrols had to be sent out to round up offenders. The enemy were believed to be holding a position in the area Uaddara and a patrol was accordingly sent out to in- vestigate. The patrol returned on 5th April"

            "description": "164. I had been with General Alexander until 14.00 hours. He had told me of his de- cision to evacuate Rangoon, and the code word for blowing demolitions and evacuation was issued just before midmght on 6th March. With his agreement I moved Headquarters \u2018\u2018 X \u2019\u2019 Wing from Rangoon to Zigon, the first \u201c kutcha \u201d\u2019 stryp from which we would operate in support of the Army\u2019s withdrawal along the Prome Road. A small party of Officers and airmen were left behind to complete the demo- lition of the operations room and the facilities at Norgroup Headquarters. They were then to go on to Mingaladon and help to complete the demolitions at this airfield. This party came out with the Army."
