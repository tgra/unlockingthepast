SUPPLEMENT To tue LONDON GAZETTE, 28 AUGUST, 1946

my General Headquarters should assume the
general direction of the road transport activi-
ties of the United Kingdom Commercial Cor-
poration; and that it should become responsible
for maintaining its fleet of vehicles, and should
take over and hold the large stocks of motor
tyres which had already arrived for the United
Kingdom Commercial Corporation or were on
the water. I was then able to make available a
certain number of experienced transport officers
to assist the United Kingdom Commercial Cor-
poration officials, and to organize a system of
military check posts along the Persian routes to
assist in supervising the working of the service.
Later, at the request of the Russian authorities,
certain military trai units were allocated
to carrying Russian stores, to ensure that am-
munition and certain other types of stores
remained in military charge throughout. The
Tesults of these measures are not yet fully
apparent, but a gradual improvement is being
made in the working of the road transport ser-
vice in Persia. -

22. In the operation of the transport of stores
to Russia a serious hold-up of shipping occurred
in the Persian Gulf. This was already the case
when J assumed command and has been a cause
of anxiety throughout. It has been brought
about by various factors. In estimating the
capacity of the ports to receive stores, and the
tail and road transport to clear them, insuffi-
cient allowance was made originally for the
various difficulties in operation which I have
mehtioned; the tonnages despatched to Persian
Gulf ports have been in excess of the already
optimistic estimates of what could be accepted;
and the high proportion of difficult cargoes,
combiniéd’ with thé ‘slow’ devélopinent of’ port
construction and the slow arrival of lifting
appliances, have accentuated the delays.
Another factor, though in other respects a for-
tunate one, has been that sinkings en route
have fallen below what was anticipated and
allowed for in loadings. Improved performance
in tonnages landed, combined with a temporary
scaling down of loadings, are now rapidly re-
ducing the congestion of shipping which should
shortly disappear.

23. It was obvious during the summer of 1942
that the British personnel available for we
Portation duties in Persia were quite inadequate
to deal with the scale of development planned
and in progress, and that their numbers could
not be materially increased. In August, 1942,
therefore, information was received from the
War Office that the United States Amy was to
take over the operation of the ports and railway
in Persia, and in addition provide a fleet of
motor vehicles to supplement the road transport
service. Major General Donald H. Connolly
was appointed Commanding General, United
States Persian Gulf Service Command, and
arrived in Persia in October, 1942, with advance
elements of his staff. The first United States
Army troops landed in December, 1942.

The process of handing over is still going on,
and although minor set-backs and difficulties
have naturally been encountered, as a result
of willing co-operation on both sides the process
of changing from British to United States Army
administration and control is progressing.
smoothly. With-the miuch larger resources in
personnel and plant. which the Commanding
General United States Persian Gulf Service
Command will have-at ‘his disposal, a rapid im-
provement is to be expected in the output of the
transportation services and a corresponding
increase in the tonnage which can be delivered
to the Russian Army. Although the full re-
sources of the United States Persian Gulf-
Service Command are not yet deployed, and
the transfer of operations is still incomplete,
an improvement-is already apparent; though
in fairness to the personnel of the British, Army.
I wish to place on record that the arrival of
United States Army troops to relieve them has
come at a time when much of the heavy work’
of preparation and development is at an end
and about to show results.

24. The following figures show the tonnages
which have been landed for Aid to Russia and
carried forward by various agencies during the
period of my command:—

‘25. The fact that deliveries so far have failed
to reach expectations does not Jessen the value
of the work performed by the very inadequate
number of British personnel which it has been
possible to allot to this duty. Great credit is
due to the personnel concerned in this work,
who have carried through their task with un-
failing energy in spite of many obstacles and
disappointments they have encountered.

Tue HEALTH AND WELFARE OF TROOPS.

26. During the period under review, the
health of the troops in the Command has been
satisfactory. During September and October,
1942, the rate of admissions to hospital was
comparatively high, mainly owing to the effects

of the hot summer, the prevalence of malaria

in certain parts of the country, and in the case
of the Polish troops to.,the. after effects of their
recent privations. Throughout the winter the
troops have been very. healthy amd their
standard of physical fitness for war is high.

Much valuable work. has been done by the
Medical Services, especially in the prevention
of malaria. :

.A great deal has also been done for the wel-
fare of the troops. .The civil communities in
Iraq and in Persia, the clergy, the philanthropic
bodies and the NAAFI/EFI have all made
valuable contributions to this essential work,
which is more than ever necessary in a country
where so few natural amenities exist.
