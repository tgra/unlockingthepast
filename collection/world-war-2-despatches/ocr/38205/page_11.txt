SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 FEBRUARY, 1948

addition of the reserve, was the smallest, and
enemy tanks had already been seen approach-
ing from the north-east, a presage of what was
to come on the morrow.

Next day, the 11th, Eighth Army continued
to press on up the east coast in the direction
of Catania. 30 Corps on the left extended its
bridgehead to Pozzallo and Ispica, but the
main weight of interest lay with 13 Corps which
pushed on a marching column to Priolo, half-
way to Augusta. The heat was intense and
few vehicles were as yet ashore; contact was
first made that day with the Italian 54 Division,
outside Syracuse. On the American front, in
the meantime, a more serious battle was de-
veloping. The battle group of the Hermann
Goering Division which was disposed to cover
the centre of the island and the Ponte Olivo
airfields made a strong and deliberate counter-
attack on I Infantry Division at Gela. From
o800 hours to 1630 hours these attacks con-
tinued, supported by a battalion of tanks, and
at one stage penetrated to the beach, but they
were repulsed in hard fighting in which the
direct fire of naval escort ships played a con-
siderable part. By the end of the day landing
strips were made available for our aircraft at
Gela and Licata; in Eighth Army’s sector we
had Pachino, and the bridgehead was assuming
very solid proportions,

The German Command put in the eastern
group of Hermann Goering Division to defend
Augusta but the impetus of our assault was
such that, after being held up at Priolo all day
of the rath, 5 Division was able to capture the
town next morning before dawn. Seventh
Army had counter-attacked the Germans oppo-
sing them and by the 13th were firmly in posses-
sion of the three vital airfield areas of Comiso,
Biscari and Ponte Olivo. Both Armies were
pushing ahead impetuously and it seemed as
though nothing could stop them. Ahead of
the troops, the Tactical Air Force bombed in-
tensively the lines of communication in the
centre of the island to hold up the movements
of enemy forces across Sicily. On my right
General Montgomery was developing two
thrusts, one with 13 Corps due north on to
Catania, which he hoped to capture on the
16th, and! one on the left with the Canadians
whom he was hoping to send in a wide out-
flanking movement through Caltagirone and
Enna to come in behind the enemy north of
Mount Etna. This meant that Seventh Anmy
would be free to pivot on its left and strengthen
its grasp on the central portion of the island,
preparatory to carrying out the task for which
I had designated it. 30 Corps would be ad-
vancing straight across the front of Seventh
Army’s right wing where 45 Division, although
fresh from the United States with no previous
battle experience, had been making striking
progress.

I issued orders for the new plan on 13th
July. The new boundary between the two
Armies gave to Eighth Army the road Vizzini-
Caltagirone-Piazza Armerina-Enna; it then ran
due north to the north coast west of San
Stefano, which was 30 Corps’ ultimate
objective. Eighth Army’s attack on the right
began on the night of the 13th, when 1 Para-
chute Brigade was dropped to capture the
Primosole bridge over the River Simetoyat the
southern edge of the Catania plain. 5 Division,
followed by 50 Division;, were to attack north-

wards to make contact with the parachutists,
establish a bridgehead over the mver and
advance on Catama. The parachutist operation
was successful, though only about half reached
the right area, and about two hundred men
with five anti-tank guns seized the bridge,
removed the demolition charges and prepared to
defend the position until relieved. All day on
the x4th they withstood enemy counter-attacks
and only withdrew after dark to a ridge to
the southward from which they could still cover
the bridge. Early on the 15th contact was
made with the main body which had been
delayed by strong German counter-attacks, in
one of which Augusta had been temporarily
lost. The vital bridge was intact and on the
15th we succeeded in getting some troops across,
though it was not until the 17th that we could
consolidate our shallow bridgehead north of the
river. This stubborn and partly successful
defence was due to the arrival of German
reinforcements. A regiment of parachutists from
7 Air Division* was taken from Tarascon, in
Southern France, and brought by air via Naples
to the area south of Catania. It was these
excellent troops who were mainly responsible
for the defence of the line of the Simeto.

On the right, therefore, we had been only
partially successful; the capture of the bridge-
head over the Simeto was a considerable ad-
vantage, but we had been halted south of
Catania. In the centre, the sector of 30 Corps,
we had made steady progress, but the nature
of the country and the exiguous road-net meant
that that progress had been slow. Vizzini was
captured on the r4th, after strong resistance,
by 51 Division assisted by 45 (United States).
The Canadians then went into the lead captur-
ing Grammichele and Caltagirone on the 15th
and Piazza Armerina on the 16th.f Their next
objective was Enna, the centre of the island
and meeting point of a network of main roads
against which the bomber effort of the air forces
had been focussed during the first five days
of the invasion. Seventh Army was now re-
organising in order to meet the needs of its
changed directive. On 5th July General
Patton created a Provisional Corps Head-
quarters to command the left flank of the Army,
consisting of 3 Infantry Division, with under
command 4 Tabor of Goums,{ old friends from
Tunisian days, and 82 Airborne Division.
II Corps continued to command the right flank
with z and 45 Divisions, while 2 Armoured
Division was under Army command. II Corps
had made good progress northwards and 45
Division ‘on its right had co-operated with
30 Corps in the capture of Vizzini and Calta-
girone; on the 16th, however, the Division
reached the new inter-Army boundary and
started to transfer to the left wing of
the Corps, behind 1 Division. 3 Division
in the Provisional Corps made ground west-
wards along the coast and inland beyond Cani-
catti, which it had captured on the 12th. The

* This was the original German airborne division
which had been responsible for the invasion of Crete.
It was at that moment engaged in splitting into
r and 2 Parachute Divisions; 3 Regiment, which
as the one in question here, was assigned, either
already or later, to x Parachute Division.

| War Office footnote’ According to official records,
Caltagirone was captured at o4o0 hours, 16th July,
1943, and Piazza Armerina at o600 hours, 17th July,
1943.

= Goums are composed of French Moroccan native
troops particularly skilled in mountain warfare. A
Tabor is the approximate equivalent of a battalion.
