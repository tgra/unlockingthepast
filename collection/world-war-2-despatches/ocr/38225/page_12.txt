$.N.O.(L) that Windsor Castle had been
captured with negligible opposition,* ‘that
enemy native troops were surrendering, that
the advance was continuing and that own
troops were mopping up in this area. This
was followed by a further report at_o640 that
the Commando. was reorganising in Windsor
Castle area preparatory to advancing on Diego
Suarez North. At about o615 landing craft
from ROYAL ULSTERMAN. proceeded to-
wards Blue Beach, and when close off shore
machine-gun fire could be heard but no flashes
were seen. Shortly afterwards troops were
seen landing, and communication was estab-
lished at 0705 by Aldis, and I was informed
that the landing craft had been machine-gunned
on the way in, but that Army units were now
moving inland. $.N.O.(L) was informed at
0723 that landing had been effected.

17. During this period LAFOREY was
anchored ready to give any bombardment
support required.

18. DEVONSHIRE’s _ signal _ reporting
ROMNEY cutting mines and that the anchor-
age could not be safe until tooo was received
at 0653. From my appreciation of the mine
situation, I informed’ DEVONSHIRE at 0745
that mines were’ unlikely South West of line
Nosi Famaho to Mangoaka, and that the
Southern part of the’ anchorage was clear of
mines. This signal was passed to S.N.O.(L)
by DEVONSHIRE at 0805.

1g. At this time KEREN was seen to be
entering harbour astern of minesweepers. When
the sweepers reached the area Nosi Famaho to
Mangoaka Point a number of mines were cut,
and LAFOREY weighed and proceeded to sink
mines by -machine-gun fire. ;

20. At ogor I closed KEREN to the South
Westwards of the mined area and reported the
situation by loud hailer, informing F.O.C.
Force ‘‘F ” of the existence of the minefield,
that at least six mines had been cut in the last
sweep, and that operations were continuing.
There was, however, a narrow channel through
the minefield marked by yellow and black dan
buoys which I was confident was clear.

ar, At o817 I had ascertained from Blue
Beach Signal Station, which. had been sét up, 7
cables from Basse Point, that the beach was
suitable for landing M.T., S.N.O.(L) being in-
.formed; and at 0849 I offered to take
BACHAQUERO through the minefield to the
vicinity of JJ, preparatory to her being swept
in to Blue Beach. S.N.O.(L) however replied
at ogro that no beach was yet suitable for her,
and told me to anchor, which I did at og20.

22, About 1030 minesweepers were widening
the channel in the minefield, and cut at least
18 mines within a few minutes. As some of
these were drifting towards BACHAQUERO
and ROYAL ULSTERMAN, LAFOREY
weighed and helped to sink them using 2 four-
barrelled machine-guns and rifles. Several
were sunk but none exploded. At 1138
AURICULA struck a mine and was holed
forward.

Admualty footnote —

* It ultimately transpired that the complete eviction
of the defenders of Windsor Castle was not accom-
plished until the morning of D 2.

. 23. At this time all mines still floating had
drifted clear of ships, and LAFOREY was pro-
ceeding up channel to a suitable bombardment
position close to JJ where I anchored at noon.

24. At 1215 AURICULA was still drifting
out of control and down by the bows, with 2
minesweepers standing by. She informed me
that her First Lieutenant was in command and
her Captain wounded and disembarked.

25. At 1232 I asked AURICULA if she had
all the assistance she required, to which her
reply was ‘‘ No, think tow stern first possible ’’.
As LIGHTNING had been ordered to complete
with fuel at 1315 I instructed her to close
AURICULA before oiling and assist, and that
if she was salveable she should be towed to a
lee anchorage. ;

26. At 1300 three enemy Potez 63 twin-
engined reconnaissance bombers appeared over
the anchorage but remained at a respectful
distance without attacking any ship, flying off
in the direction of Windsor Castle. .

27. During the period 1100-1330 the Com-
mando had been advancing steadily with little
opposition and at 1335 informed S N.O.(L) that
they expected to reach Diego Suarez soon.

28. BACHAQUERO proceeded through the
minefield swept channel about 1330 and went
inshore to Red Béach with a minesweeper ahead
of her. 4

2g. At 1408 and 1424 two large explosions,
which were definitely not mines, were seen half
a mile North East of the ship. It is now sus-
pected that they were large shell fired from
some shore battery using Windsor Castle O.P.
as observer.

30. At 1330 I was informed that machine-gun
fire from the observation tower on Windsor Castle
summit was being a nuisance, and at 1526
2g rounds were fired at the O.P. which then
hoisted the white flag. A signal was sent by
light ‘‘ Descendez ou nous continuerons ’’ and
I ask the Beach Station whether the French
were coming down, to which the reply was
“Yes.’’ However they changed their minds
and returned, and at 1658 F.0.0.3 asked me
to re-engage, and a further 36 rounds were fired;
a direct hit was made on the living quarters
just below the summit. The crew of the tower
was seen to come out and disappear over the
lee side. LIGHTNING took over the shoot at
1732.

31. LAFOREY then proceeded to the main
anchorage and fuelled from EASEDALE On
completion at o120/6th, anchored in the South
West of the anchorage and set A/S watch.

32. At o600 returned to the bombardment
billet close to JJ, and was informed that a
French sloop in English Bay was firing on our
troops advancing on Antsirane; F.0.0.2 could
not see this target and F.O.0.1 was in Diego
Suarez, and it was not until o804 that he
obtained transport to take him to observe.

33. At 0843 he was in position and informed
me that the fires caused by INDOMITABLE’s
air attack were out and the battle ensign still
flying At 0855 LAFOREY opened fire and
fired 86 rounds at the sloop. A number of
these were reported very close, one hit was seen,
and at 0930 F.0.0.1 was asked for general
effect. He reported that the bridge was on fire
and the ammunition exploding, but that there
