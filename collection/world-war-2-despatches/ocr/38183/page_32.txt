Royai Airy Force problems.

140. With regard to the Air Force, reference
has already been made in paras. 79 and 88
above to the obsolescence of our Vildebeeste
aircraft and to the effect of lack of reserves.
Apart from this, the necessity for rapid evacua-
tion of the Northern aerodromes had some
effect on the ground personnel, many of whom
were young and inexperienced. There were in-
sufficient rifles or Thompson guns to equip
all Air Force personnel, but they must be pre-
pared to fight, and, if necessary, sacrifice them-
selves in the same way as the infantry; and
further, must spare no effort to ensure that all
material than can possibly be moved is
despatched, or in the last resort destroyed, to
prevent its being of value to the enemy.

14. The Royal Air Force suffered from lack
of staff. It was not so much that more officers
were required at headquarters as that suffi-
cient should have been available to form
another Group Headquarters. A Fighter Head-
quarters had been formed and operated well,
but the rest of the operations had to be canried
out direct by Royal Air Force Headquarters,
with the result that practically all the head-
quarters air staff officers had to be employed
in the operations room, and, including the
Air Officer Commanding, were fully occupied
in working out details of bombing and recon-
naissance, leaving no one to plan and think
ahead. This condition would have been im-
proved had it been possible to form another
group to operate the bombing squadrons, or,
possibly, naval co-operation and overseas
reconnaissance as well as all bombing.

142. As aerodromes in Northern Malaya
became untenable there was a danger of those
in the South becoming too few to allow of
adequate dispersal of the Royal Air Force
Squadrons. The possibility of this had also
been foreseen some months before war broke
out and it had been decided in such an eventu-
ality to move the bombing squadrons to Dutch
aerodromes in Sumatra, retaining most of the
fighter squadrons on Singapore Island. Up to
the time that war broke out this remained
little more than a project owing to the Royal
Air Force staff being fully occupied with other
work. At the end of December, however, the
plans were well advanced, not only for the
move of these squadrons but also for the
ae establishment of an erecting depot in

ava.

143. The need for preserving an adequate
force for the protection of the Naval Base
(see Para, 138 above) applied especially to the
Royal Air Force. This accounts for the com-
parative weakness of the fighter strength in
Northern Malaya at the start of the war and
for fighter escorts not being evailable for our
bombers. From the last week in December
air protection for reinforcement convoys
absorbed most of our fighter strength.

Defence and Denial of Aerodromes.

144. As indicated in para. 103 above, the
primary object of the Japanese appears to have
been to get command of the air, principally by
the attack on our aerodromes by aircraft, or
by their capture. The weakness of our aero-
drome defence is referred to in para. 115 above,
In regard to A.A. weapons, as a result of the
experiences in Crete, I laid down that the
defence of aerodromes was to take precedence

over everything else except the A.A. defence
of the Naval Base. It was decided that the full
scale of the defence would be eight heavy and
eight light A.A. guns; this was altered after
war broke out to four heavy and twelve light,
a scale that was hardly every approached.

145. When our aerodromes had to be aban-
doned, steps were naturally taken to render
them useless to the enemy, particularly by
explosives in runways and other parts of the
landing area. The effect of this action was
generally of disappointingly short duration. The
Japanese were certainly quick in carrying out
repairs, but, even allowing for that, the re-
sults of many of the demolitions as carried out
seem hardly to have repaid the energy ex-
pended and the adverse moral effect on troops
of hearing explosions behind them. A system
of delay-action mines would probably have
been effective provided they could have been
properly concealed; preparations would have
been necessary for this at the time the aero-
dromes were constructed. A heavy tractor
drawing some form of deep plough or scarifier
and working in between craters would have
been a very useful addition; it could not have
gone on working to the last moment, unless
it was intended to abandon the tractor, since
these could only move very slowly and were
likely to block roads if left to the last.

At aerodromes located in wet or low-lying
areas, mines should be located with reference
to the drainage system with the object of dis-
locating it and so putting the aerodrome out
of action for a long period. Aerodromes in our
possession were occasionally rendered unser-
viceable for about twenty-four hours by
Japanese bombing of. runways; this would have
been much more effective had delay-action
bombs been used.

Left-Behind Parties.

146. An attempt was made to organise left-
behind parties in Northern Malaya with the
object of obtaining information and carrying
out sabotage of all sorts in the enemy’s rear.
This duty was entrusted to the O.M. Section
of the Ministry of Economic Warfare under Mr.
Killery. It was, however, started too late and
there was no time to organise it thoroughly.
This was in no way the fault of the O.M.,
but was due to the factors mentioned in para.
g above.

Question of a Military Governor.

147. The appointment of a Military Governor
might have been desirable for Singapore Island
during the later stages, but I was of the opinion
that such an appointment for the whole of
Malaya at the start of the war was not a prac-
ticable proposition. The main reason was that
the organisation of the Colony, with the Fede-
rated and the Unfederated States, was very
complicated and that it was not a practical
proposition for anyone to take it over at short
notice. It would have been found far more
practicable for Hong Kong.

Australia’s Assistance.

148. The Australian Government fully
realised the importance of Singapore to the
defence of the Far East and especially to
Australia and did everything in their power to
help. In November, 1940, there were three
squadrons of the Royal Australian Air Force
