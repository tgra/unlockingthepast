It was not till 27th April that the last of her turrets could be accepted from the contractors and that practice drills with the whole main armament could be started. Captain Leach had been able to report on x7th May, shortly before the Fleet sailed for this operation, that he considered his ship fit to operate; but neither he nor I interpreted that report as implying that she was fully worked up. Her turrets, of a new and untried model, were known to be liable to teething troubles and could already be seen to be suffering them. The effects of all this on her gunnery had been, witnessed by the Rear-Admiral Commanding, First Cruiser Squadron, and he knew, in addi- tion, that her bridge was seriously damaged, that she had taken in 400 tons of water aft and could not exceed 27 knots. The BIS- MARCK 'and PRINZ EUGEN, on the other hand, after working up for many months under ideal conditions in the Baltic, had given evi- dence of a v\u00e9ry high degree of efficiency: the BISMARCK had been hit, but the Rear- Admiral Commanding, First Cruiser Squadron,"

The long range penetration brigade which was making its way across the Chindwin overland towards Katha received its first air- borne suppiies on 10th February, and its main- tenance thereafter became a continuous com- mitment. The remaining two brigades were landed on two strips improvised in the jungle during the nights of S5th/6th and 10th/11th March, and a fourth and fifth brigade were flown into another landing ground during the nights of 24th/25th March and 5th/6th April. The successful accomplishment of the air side of this operation was shared directly by the First Air Commando Unit and by the British and American Transport squadrons which \u2018participated, although the whole operation was only made possible by the high degree of air superiority gained by the tactical air forces in the preceding months."

Smallwood, M.C., who commenced their advance from the Giuba on 23rd February and were in the van of rith (A) Division until the capture of Harrar on 25th March. Thus in 30 days they had covered 1,054 miles, an average of 35 miles a day. The final 65 miles into Harrar entailed an advance through most difficult country in face of opposition from three strong positions, yet the distance was covered in three-and-half days. The Nigerian soldier, unaccustomed to cold and damp, fought his way from the hot and dusty bush to the wet and cold highlands of Abyssinia, where he maintained his cheerfulness and courage in spite of strange conditions and the strenuous climb- ing operations made necessary by the terrain."

            "description": "roth Indian Infantry Brigade attack went in at 0415 hours on 25th March and made rapid progress in securing all its objectives. By about tooo hours the sappers were able to start work on the road-block. They were still under mortar and artillery fire. zoth Indian Infantry Brigade succeeded in consolidating its objec- - tives and, throughout the 26th, work on the toad-block continued. On this day the Italians made one of their last air-attacks against our troops. The R.A.F. with their variety of machines from Hurricanes to Vincents had gained air superiority. By a continuous for- ward policy they had driven their opponents from the air and destroyed their machines on the ground. The army was indeed grateful for the immunity from hostile air-attack thus gained. The advance of the mechanised column and 2gth Indian Infantry Brigade was timed for 0530 hours on the morning of 27th March. During the early hours of 27th March there were indications that the enemy might be withdrawing. goth Indian Infantry Brigade advance went with great speed and it became clear that the enemy\u2019s resistance was broken. By 1000 hours the mechanised force had estab- lished itself in Keren. Throughout the morn- ing white flags appeared on M. Sanchil, Brigs Peak, M. Zemanna and M. Amba. The battle of Keren was won. It had been won by the tenacity and determination of commanders and troops, by whole-hearted co-operation of all ranks, whether forward or back, of whatever race or creed, and by the continuous support given to infantry by the Royal Artillery, who. between x5th and 27th March, fired over 110,000 shells borne by 1,000 lorries from rail- head over 150 miles away."
