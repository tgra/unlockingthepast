5922 SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1941

24th May. Preparations for counter attack and
strengthening of canal defences.

40. During 24th May, I had simultaneously
to prepare for a counter-attack southwards on
the 26th and also to press forward with the
strengthening of the canal line.

To make the detailed arrangements for the
counter-attack I appointed the Commander of
the 3rd Corps, Lieutenant-General Sir Ronald
Adam, who, on my behalf, continued negotia-
tions with General Blanchard, and with ‘the
Commander of the French 5th Corps, General
Altmeyer.

The final plan was for a counter attack with
three French and two British divisions under
the command of General Altmeyer. As a
first stage, on the evening of 26th May, bridge-
heads were to be established south of the
Scarpe, and the main attack was to start the
following morning, with the objective Plouvain—
Marquion—Cambrai. Sir Ronald Adam with
three divisions (two British and one French)
was to advance east of the Canal du Nord, and
General Altmeyer with two French divisions
to the west of the Canal du Nord, his right being
covered by the French Cavalry Corps. This
attack was never carried out for reasons which
will presently appear.*

On the same day, I issued orders to dissolve
the various improvised forces on the Canal
line, and their units were absorbed by the
formations in the areas of which they now were.
I appointed Major-General Eastwood} to take
command of the defences on the Canal line,
and he assumed command early on 25th May.

The position on the Canal line was consider-
ably strengthened during 24th May. 44th
Division began to move into the line between
the forest of Clairmarais and Aire, with 2nd
Division on its left between Aire and La Bassée,
and 46th Division (lately Polforce) from La
Bassée to Raches. It was not till the evening
however that 2nd and 44th Divisions gained
contact with the enemy and for most of the day
the defence of the sector still remained under
the Commanders of Macforce and Polforce.

Fighting of a somewhat confused character
went on for most of the day in and south of
the Forest of Nieppe, and the enemy also began
heavy bombing and shelling of Cassel. The
remainder of Macforce, which included field
and anti-tank artillery, was therefore sent
to reinforce the 13/18th Hussars. .

48th Division (with under its command part
of 23rd Division in the area_Gravelines—St.
Omer) was ordered to send one infantry brigade
to Dunkirk and one to Cassel and Hazebrouck.
145th Infantry Brigade completed its relief

of the improvised garrisons of the two latter .

places on 25th May, but General Thorne found
that the French had-already made complete
dispositions for Dunkirk, and had informed
the British Base Commandant. He therefore
decided to send 144th Infantry Brigade to
Bergues and Wormhoudt. He established his
H.Q. at Bergues, which he- rightly regarded as
the vital point of defence.

The French reinforce Dunkirk.

4t. The local defences of Dunkirk, in
accordance with French practice, were under

* See parg. 43,

pending a vacancy, was attached to the Staff of G.H.Q.

the Admiral du Nord, Admiral Abrial, whose
command included Boulogne, Calais and
Dunkirk. Under his authority the command
of military forces in these areas was assumed on
24th May by Général de Corps d’Armée Fagalde,
commanding the French 16th Corps which up
to now had been fighting on the left of the
Belgian Army. ‘

The French defences of Dunkirk were based
on the peace time organisation of the Secteur
Fortifié des Flandres, and extended only as
far as the Belgian frontier. They comprised
an inner and an outer sector, the inner on the
line of the old Mardyck Canal to Spyker, thence
by Bergues to the frontier and so to the sea ;
the outer on the line of the river Aa to St. Omer
thence by Cassel and Steenvoorde to the
frontier. General Fagalde had at his disposal
certain regional troops in numbers equivalent
to a weak division, who were located in the
outer sector from Gravelines to the Forest of
Clairmarais and whose dispositions had been
roughly co-ordinated with those of Brigadier
Usher. About this time the 68th French
Division arrived at Dunkirk from Belgium and
took over the inner sector. .

On the 24th and 25th May the British posts
on the river Aa were taken over by the French,
who also began to operate the inundations,
which formed part of the defence scheme of
Dunkirk and extended each side of Bergues and
as far as the Belgian frontier north of the
Bergues—Furnes canal.

25th May—Aitacks on the Canal Line and on
the Belgian Army.

42, On 25th May, enemy activity intensified.
Two enemy Corps were reported to be attacking
the French in the area Denain—Bouchain ; the
enemy was also across the canal at St. Venant,
and was developing the bridgeheads between
that place and Aire and also at St. Omer, whilst
further north the situation on the river Aa was
still obscure...

At about 7 a.m. on 25th May, news was
received that in the late evening of 24th May
the enemy had attacked the Belgian 4th Corps
on the Lys with a force reported to be of four
divisions, supported by tanks. The attack
penetrated to a depth of 14 miles on a front of
13 miles between Menin and Desselghem.

It was fast becoming a matter of vital
importance to keep open our line of communica-
tion to the coast through a corridor which was
hourly narrowing. It was no longer possible
to count on using the main road Estaires—

- Cassel—Dunkirk, while the news which had

just been received made it certain that before
long, the whole area east of the Yser canal
would be in the hands of the enemy, since there
was, in fact, no satisfactory defensive position
between the Lys and the Yser canal. There
seemed, therefore, to be a serious risk of the
Belgian right becoming separated from the
British left at Menin, and of the Belgian Army
being forced to fall back in a northerly, rather
than in a westerly direction. I considered it
vitally urgent to prolong the British front
without delay northwards to Ypres, along
the old Ypres—Comines canal, now practically
dry, and round Ypres itself to the line of the
Yser canal.

As an immediate step, r2th Lancers were
sent off early on 25th to watch the left flank of
2nd Corps on the Lys, and gain touch with the
right flank of the Belgians.
