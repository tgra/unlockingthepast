Dentenial Seer zeker ad been in Com-
mand of M.A.A.F. since Jam T5th, 1944.
He was succeeded by Major-General ad
Cannon on March 28th, 1945.

27. By.the beginning of April practically all
the squadrons were based in Italy. An analysis
shows that at this time the Air C.-in-C.,
M.A.A.F., had under his operational command
a total of 258 Squadrons consisting of 155
American, 77 Royal Air Force and Dominion
Air Force, 13 co-belligerent Italian, 5 French,
2 Jugoslav, 2 Polish, 3 Greek and 1 Brazilian.
To man and maintain these squadrons there
were 164,000 American personnel and 79,000
British personnel, besides many of our other
Allies. I should like to mention here the fine
contribution made to the British effort by the
South African Air Force which, at this time,
maintained a total of 234 squadrons in the
Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre.

28. The Air Commander-in-Chief’s Allied
Headquarters was a comparatively small one,
consisting of integrated staff sections for plan-
ning, operations, inteiligence and signals. The
keynote of these sections was the inter-leaving
of British and American personnel.

30. M.A.S.A.F. was predominantly an
American organisation, and consisted of the
United States rsth Air Force, and 205 Group
of the Royal Air Force (Commanded by
Brigadier J. T. Durrant, C.B., D.F.C.,
S.A.A.F.). There were 109 U.S.A.A.F. and
8 R.A.F. and Dominion Squadrons.

31. M.A.S.A.F. formed part of the team of
Allied Strategic Air Forces in Europe, the other
members being the United States Eighth Air
Force and the Royal Air Force Bomber Com-
mand. The aim of these forces was the
Progressive destruction and dislocation of the
German military, industrial and economic
system, and the direct support of land and
naval forces. All M.A.S.A.F, squadrons were
ee in South-East Italy, chiefly on the Foggia

in.

32. M.A.T.A.F. was composed of the United
States 12th Air Force and the Royal Air Force
Desert Air Force, which were roughly equal
in size. The role of M.A.T.A.F. was to pro-
vide the air support required for the opera-
tions of Allied land forces in the Italian theatre.
To perform this task it had 89 Squadrons, con-
sisting of 42 U.S.A.AF., 44 R.AF. and
Dominion, 1 Brazilian and 2 Polish.

33. There were four main operational forma-
tions within the organisation of M.A.T.A.F.—
the Desert Air Force, 22nd Tactical Air Com-
mand, the 57th Wing (Medium bombers) and
the 51st Troop Carrier Wing.

34. The Desert Air Force, commanded by
Air Vice-Marshal R. M. Foster, C.B., C.B.E.,
D.F.C., consisted of a total of 43 squadrons,
and was employed chiefly in support of the
British Eighth Army. It was composed for
the most part of Royal Air Force and
Dominion squadrons (1x of which were South
African Air Force) but it had also under its
operational control three squadrons of American
long range fighter-bomber aircraft in order to

ive it a flexibility not obtainable with the
ritish types of aircraft at its disposal.

35. The 2and Tactical Air Command, com-
manded by Brigadier-General Chidlaw, was
employed chiefly in support of the American
Fifth Army and consisted mostly of U.S.A.A.F.
squadrons. It did, however, have under its
operational control two R.A.F. tactical recon-
naissance squadrons and four R.A.F. and
Dominion short range fighter and fighter-
bomber squadrons.

36. The 57th Wing was a purely American
formation controlling twelve squadrons of B.25
medium bomber aircraft, and’ was employed
anywhere within the Italian theatre as required.
This wing pie an outstanding part in the
strangling of the enemy’s communications.

37. The 51st Troop Carrier Wing was also
a purely American formation, controlling twelve
squadrons of C-47 transport aircraft. It per-
formed a wide variety of functions, including
airborne assaults if required, supply dropping,
and air ambulance work.

38. Headquarters Desert Air Force and
Headquarters 22nd Tactical Air Command were
always located alongside Headquarters Eighth
Army and Fifth Anny respectively. Demands
for air support were passed by each Army
Headquarters to its fellow Air Headquarters.

Air Officer Commanding)

39. The direction of M.A.C.A.F. was almost
entirely an R.A.F. concern by March, 1945, by
which date the formation consisted of seven
R.A.F, and Dominion squadrons, four Italian
squadrons, four French squadrons and two
U.S.A.A.F. squadrons. The operational role
of M.A.C.A.F, was the air defence of Allied
shipping, the attack of enemy shipping, the
air defence of the Italian peninsula (with the
exception of the forward areas where the
responsibility was M.A.T.A.F.’s) and finally
the operation of Air Sea Rescue services in
the Adriatic and the Western Mediterranean up
to the area of responsibility of Air Head-
quarters, Malta. By the Spring of 10945
M.A.C.A.F.’s operational activities had been
greatly reduced, and in fact it had all but
finished its work, and had won a hard battle
against what had once been great odds.
