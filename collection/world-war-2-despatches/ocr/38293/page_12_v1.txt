instructed to send landing  craft to  Monemvasia, since they. could not reach Nauplia in time. for-that night's evacuation.

In  consequence ORION, PERTH: and  STUART proceeded. to a to assist - in the embarkation. -

All ships  were inst ucted that if the Ss eullie! . delayed embarkation, they  were to  take what

troops they were  able and leave at' 0300.

17. SCOT  TISH  PRINCE.   RFA. BRAMBLELEAF arrived safely at Suda a.m. The SCOTTISH PRINCE on passage from Smyrna to Suda was bombed and damaged south of Milo at about noon. H.M.S. GRIMSBY was sent by  the Naval Officer-in-Charge, Suda, to assist. The Senior Officer of convoy G.A.15 detached H.M.A S. VAMPIRE to her assistance. She was not sinking and her crew was put  on  board-again and with'the aid of sothe naval ratings from the GRIMSBY she- ev ntually reached Suda.

18. At 1547: information was- seca from

the Naval-Officer-in-Charge, Suda, of a Gr ek -

yessel with British troops on  board, bombed and requiring medical assistanc  off Milo. The Naval Officer-in-Charge, Suda, was instructed to gend GRIMSBY. if  sufficient information became available.

NIGHT oF 26TH/ 27TH: APRIL.

19. F.O.A-M. had signalled on 25th that position C  each be worked by one Glen ship and'this had

been arranged; But, during the afternoon of.

28th April, I received F.0.A.M.'s 1103/26th asking for a Glen ship to go to S (Nauplia) instead of to T (Tolon). I accordingly asked F.0.A.M.' to communicate direct. with

CALCUTTA if he. required any change, but .

shortly after this GUENEARN was bombed and disabled and reported that. she had sent all her landing craft down the coast to  Monemvasia.

20. Nauplia anid Tolon. I -took ORION, PERTH and STUART to Nauplia to do what was possible te embark GLENEARN's quota: On arrival I detached STUART  to see what  was the position at Tolon while ORION and PERTH went to. Nauplia where. CALCUTTA, SLAMAT, KHEDIVE ISMAIL and four destroyers were already anchored.

At Nauplia there was only one motor  caique

. transporting  troops to SLAMAT. Apart from

this, the  warships  boats did what they could.

KHEDIVE ISMAIL received no troops at all

owing to the lack of any craft to transport them: to her.

 Meanwhile STUART reported at Tolon there was a large number of troops, and a L.C.T., and she (STUART). was already full. . I ordered STUART alongside ORION to embark the 600 troops and sent PERTH and STUART back to Tol n

 to continue the embarkation there.

In the end the ships had to sail with  4.527

troops,  having  left'ashore a number variously

reported as 2,500 and 6,000. .This very unsatis- - factory outcome  is solely due to the bombing

of GLENEARN and the absence of ther boats.

All available craft and the L.C.T. we re fully ; employed  hrongbont,# the available  om, an

s

(Raphina) and T (Tolon) must .

she. had on board from Tolon-



 ax. The ultimate, fate of, the L.C.T. is not known. The motor caique is known to have embarked 19 military. staff  officers and their

batmen, and beachmaster and: some naval ,

ratings. and reached Monemvasia in time for Ve final embarkation there.

23. eee Island. _NUBIAN reported that troops on Zea Island had left Port Nikolo for embarkation elsewhere.

The L.C.T. working: nightly at .Raphtis is believed to have hidden:at Zea each day. It is fairly certain that this party returned in the L.C.T. to Raphtis on the evening of 27th April and were embarked in AJAX or, destroyers. |
