            "description": "On the evening of 12th January, an order was sent to 4th and 5th Indian Divisions ordering r1th Indian Infantry Brigade Group to concentrate forthwith in the Aroma area and warning them that the brigade might be required to seize the Jebel Mokram and Jebel ‘Kawatab, large jebels on the north-east side of Kassala’and approximately three miles from it, not earlier than the night 16/17th January. 5th Indian Division was warned that it might be required to seize the Jebel Ibrahim Tau not earlier than the same night. 5th Indian Division was given permission to move forward agth Indian Infantry Brigade, 68 Medium Regiment, less a battery, and 28 Field Regiment. (These had been held back in Gedaref area for reasons of secrecy and deception.) Gazelle was ordered to be prepared to operate east of Sabdarat. Reliable information revealed that the enemy now intended to evacuate the Walkait (Tsegede) garrison. There were only mule-tracks from this area to Gondar and the L. of C. was to Tessenei. From this it was reasonable to suppose that these forces would retire on Barentu covered for the first part of their move by Umm Hagar garrison. This was confirmed next day by the Manager of the Italian Cotton Scheme south of Tessenei who gave himself up at the Butana Bridge and stated that the enemy intended to retire to the hills “‘ on account of the superiority of our tanks.’’ The date of the attack on Kassala was fixed for 19th January.",

In the last paragraph Fifth Army was ordered to make “as strong a thrust as possible towards Cassino and Frosinone shortly before the assault landing to draw in enemy reserves which might be employed against the landing forces and then to create a breach in his front through which every opportunity will be taken to link up rapidly with the seaborne operation.’’ For this ro Corps was being reinforced by 5 British Infantry Division. This was the second division I had taken from Eighth Army, for 1 Division had been originally intended for it, and I was shorily afterwards to take three more. The Adriatic sector was now of secondary importance to the western sector. The intention was to launch successive attacks by the three Corps on the main front: the French Expeditionary Corps on 12th January against the high ground north of Cassino, II Corps on the 15th to capture Monte Porchia and Monte Trocchio and reach the Rapido river and 10 Corps on the 17th to cross the lower Garigliano in the Minturno area and attack northwards up the Ausente river valley towards San Giorgio a Liri. Finally, II Corps, with its left and right thus protected, would on 2oth January force the Rapido in the area of Sant’ Angelo and exploit rapidly, supported by armour, westwards and north-westwards. Two days later VI Corps was to land at Anzio and threaten",

Complete surprise was effected and a bridgehead quickly established. The Naval Forces were commanded by Captain D. C. Hill, R.N. Naval bombardments were carried out by H.M.ILS. NARBADA and JUMNA. This move rendered the position of all the Japanese forces in Arakan, north of Myebon, precarious. They had either to withdraw through the bottleneck east of Myebon, via Kangaw, or face destruction. The original intention was that 74 Brigade should advance up the various chaungs and capture Minbya from the south, after the Myebon Peninsula had been cleared, Jt was now essential to cut off the enemy troops still in the Kaladan and to relieve the pressure on 81 (West African) Division.",

The village itself was entered unopposed after the enemy positions covering it had been stormed with the aid of heavy air support. 28 (East African) Brigade (Brigadier T. H. §. Galletly) then relieved Lushai Brigade, which was flown out later to India for rest and refit. While the above operations were in progress, 7 Indian Division had begun its advance south. By the 7th January, it had reached Natchaung, some 12 miles south of Kalemyo and a hundred miles from its concentration area at Tamu. It was being followed by 255 Indian Tank Brigade, which on this date (7th January) was concentrated 72 miles south of Tamu. The steady advance southwards on this front was maintained. Enemy resistance in the Tilin area was quickly overcome and Tilin itself occupied by 28 (East African) Brigade on the 22nd January, by an date Headquarters, 4 Corps, had opened at Kan.",

At Kyaukmyaung, the river is some 800 yards wide ; the current is not strong, but shifting sandbanks caused difficulties. The terrain on both banks is flat and covered by scrub, except for open cultivation round the village itself. The leading troops of 62 Brigade actually reached the river on the 12th January, but enemy rear parties between Onbauk and Kyaukmyaung had to be cleared, and engineer equipment brought forward. The first crossing was made on the night 16th-17th January. As at Thabeikkyin, the enemy kept up a steady harassing fire with guns and mortars, but again we were allowed time to strengthen our bridgehead before any infantry or tank counter-attacks developed.",
