the disposal of G.O.C. Iraq and Lt. General
 Quinan was instructed to arrange for its trans-
fer in direct communication with G.O.C.
Palestine and Transjordan.
On 8th August Lt. General Quinan sub-
mitted outline plans for action as follows:—

(a) 8th Indian Division (Major General
C. O.- Harvey).

(i) Seizure of Abadan Refinery at first
light by the 24th Indian Infantry Brigade
Group (Brigadier R. E. Le Hippie) less
one battalion, moving by the River Shatt-

_el-Arab and supported by the Royal Navy.

(ii) Seizure of Khurramshahr by one
battalion of -the 24th Indian Infantry
Brigade supported by one Squadron Guides
Cavalry, moving by land from Tanumah
(opposite Basra).

(iii) Simultaneous advance by the 25th
Indian Infantry Brigade Group (Brigadier
R. G. Mountain) and the 13th Lancers
from Tanumah to Ahwaz, thence to Haft
Kel oilfields with detachments to Kut

* Abdullah and Dorquain pumping stations.

(iv) All moves supported by the Royal
Air Force after first light.

‘“(b), and = Indian Armoured Brigade
_ (Brigadier J. A. Aizlewood).
Simultaneous seizure of Naft-i-Shah and
Qasr-i-Shirin, the latter mainly by the 14/20
- Hussars.
On seizing Naft-iShah an advance was
- to be made without delay to the Gilan area
and preparations to be made for a move
on to Shahabad preparatory to a general
_advance on Kermanshah. In the event of
the latter being necessary the 9th Armoured
Brigade (Brigadier W. R. Tiarks) was to
participate. No air support could be made
- available unless stiff opposition was
encountered.

(c) The Bandar Shahpur operation was to
take place simultaneously as planned. Two
companies of the 2nd Battalion roth Baluch

- Regiment embarked on H.M.A.S. Kanimbla
after dark on 11th August and sailed that
night. The oth Armoured Brigade from
Palestine arrived at Kirkuk and Khaniqin
on r1th August.

Operations in Iran,

30. On 2oth July intimation was received
drom ,His Majesty’s Government that a joint
Anglo-Soviet note to Iran was to be presented
on 12th August. Lieut.-General Quinan was
informed of this and was instructed to com-
plete the preliminary concentration of his troops
by that date. .

* 3x. Lt.-General Quinan informed the
General Officer Commanding Palestine and
Transjordan that he would require the gth
Armoured Brigade, which, in order to achieve
a measure of surprise, he proposed to locate
initially at Kirkuk. He also ordered the follow-
ing moves to be put in hand:—13th Lancers
from Syria and one squadron Guides Cavalry
to Shaiba to join the 8th Indian Division, 25th
Indian Infantry Brigade, less one Battalion,
from Syria to Shaiba. The 24th Indian In-
fantry Brigade was already in the Shaiba-
Basra area and the 18th Indian Infantry
Brigade- due to arrive from India on 1oth
August. This completed the concentration of
the 8th Indian Division.

SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 14 AUGUST, 10946

The 14th/2o0th Hussars were to be employed
in the Naft-i-Shah area,

32. Lt.-General Quinan decided to place
all operations in Southern Iran, including the
seizure of Abadan, under Major-General C. O.
Harvey, Commander 8th Indian Division.
Operations in the Naft-i-Shah area were placed
under Brigadier J. A, Aizlewood, Commander
2nd Indian Armoured Brigade, whose force
was to consist of the 2nd Indian Armoured
Brigade Group (less two regiments), two Indian
Infantry Battalions and one medium battery.

In addition, the following air component
was made available for operations in Southern
Iran, and was to be moved to Shaiba by rath

August.
One Army Co-operation Squadron
(Vincent).

One Fighter Squadron (Hurricanes).
One Bomber Squadron (Blenheims).
Six Bomber Transport aircraft.

33. The presentation of the Anglo-Soviet
note was postponed more than once and it was
not until 17th August that it was finally de-
livered to the Iranian Government. On aist
August information was received from His
Majesty’s Government that the reply to the
memorandum had been eneetstaiary and that
an advance by joint Anglo-Soviet forces into
Iran would probably commence on 22nd
August. The necessary warning orders were
issued and oth Armoured Brigade was ordered
to move to Khanigin on 22nd August. Due
to representations by the Russian Government
a further postponement was necessary and the
final date for the advance was fixed for 25th
August.

34. As the concentration of troops had been
completed by 12th August, these many post-
ponements decreased any chance of achieving
surprise and it was apparent that the Iranian
Government fully expected an early British
advance into Khuzistan and that reinforce-
ments, including light and medium tanks, were
being sent to Ahwaz.

The Iranian forces likely to oppose our ad-
vance were estimated to be:—

In the Ahwaz-Abadan-Khurramshahr Area.

6th Khuzistan Division.

One composite Division, made up of units
from Teheran.

x6 Light Tanks,

xo Armoured cars, 2 sloops, 3 gun boats,
4 aircraft.

In the Senna-Kermanshah Area.
5th Kurdistan Division.
12th Kermanshah Division.
One composite Division from Teheran.
One weak Brigade Group from 13th Divi-
sion en route from Isfahan,

35. The advance into Iran commenced on
a5th August and the operations went according
to plan. 24th Indian Infantry Brigade (less
one battalion) embarked in naval craft after
dark on 24th August and landed at Abadan
at o410 brs. on 25th August. The majority
of the Iranian troops were asleep in their
barracks arid escaped by lorries, but resistance
was met from some well sited machine-gun
posts along the wharves. Street fighting en-
sued and it was difficult to dislodge the Iranian
troops without damaging the refinery buildings,
which were not completely cleared until 1700
