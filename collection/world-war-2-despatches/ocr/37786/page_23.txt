SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 13 NOVEMBER, 1946

the Koyal Navy also stopped stores-ships
sailing to Castelrosso. A numbef of ships was
held loaded in Middle East ports ready to pro-
ceed if suitable opportunity offered, but in fact
they never sailed.

’ 240. During the most difficult, period, after
. the fall of Cos, the system of maintenance to
Leros and Samos was either by caique from
Castelrosso, by caique from Kusadasi in
Turkey, by submarine from Beirut and Haifa,
by destroyer from Alexandria, or by air-
dropping from Cairo, ’

241. At this time Castelrosso’ became, to a
certain extent, the main transhipment point
for the islands. Supplies were taken there
either by caique from Cyprus and Haifa, by
stores-ships from Middle East until the middle
of October, by L.C.T. from Port Said, Haifa
and Cyprus, by other naval vessels from
Alexandria, or by air from Abugir. After the use
of stores-ships to supply Castelrosso had been
vetoed by the Royal Navy, and caiques had to
be relied upon for this service, care was taken
to ensure that only those caiques were used for
this run which refused to sail into the Aegean.
csupply by naval vessels was used only as an
emergency measure. In addition, a number
of flying boats and Italian float planes was
flown from Abuqir Bay to carry forward per-
sonnel and stores urgently required. Origin-
ally, two Sunderlands and four Cants were
available, but this number was reduced by
November, when the daily lift did not exceed
3,000 Ibs., excluding personnel.

242. A limiting factor to the transhipment of
stores from Castelrosso was that there was

available on the island storage space for only -

4,500 tons, of which only 800 tons could be
petrol. However, towards the end of the
operations, three caiques were used as a
floating reserve of about 250 tons of petrol and
oil. Further, owing to the extremely erratic
operation of caiques and schooners, no reliable
estimate of the carry-forward was available for
maintenance planning, All that could be done
was to ensure that supplies and stores of the
tight kind were always available when oppor-
tunity for transhipment offered.

243. In view of the difficulties of supplying
Leros and Samos via Castelrosso, and of the
short distance from Samos to the Turkish
coast, the supply route through Turkey was
developed as fully as wads possible. The
‘primary object of this route was to ship sup-
plies for the civil population. But there was
also hope that certain - military maintenance
might be provided from this spurce and, in
fact, the

_ to be supplied.

244. Up to 11th October, the Turkish supply
route for Samos and Leros was rather impro-
vised and piecemeal, but none the less sub-
stantial shipments continued until, on the rrth
October, I formally placed the main responsi-
bility for the island with Military Attaché,
Ankara, working through Kusadasi, and draw-
ing from the dumps which, with other objects
in view, we had established in Turkey. Asa
result of this decision, and of the decision not
to evacuate Samos and Leros as an immediate
consequence of the loss of Cos, it became neces-
sary to arrange for increased supplies, both for
civil and for military consumption. Suitable
arrangements were made with the Turkish

‘urks allowed certain military stores -

Government, and until the evacuation of the
islands a regular service was maintained.

245. Supplies and stores were moved by rail
and road from the dumps and were.shipped
in caiques from Kusadasi. But since only cer-
tain items, such as rations and a limited range
of ammunition and stores, were available from
these dumps, they were, by agreement with the
Turkish Government, supplemented by stores
{mainly supplies, petrol and oil) railed from
Syria through Turkey to Kusadasi. Despatch
started on 21st October, the first wagons
crossed the frontier on 2gth, and stores ‘crossed
the frontier at a daily average of 7o tons, until
flow was stopped on 17th November after the
fall of Leros. By this time a total of 1,400 tons
had been sent into Turkey.

246. Although it was possible to move stores
to Kusadasi, and the short journey to Samos
presented no difficulty, the main problem was
the onward distribution to Leros, since, after
the fall of Cos, great difficulty was found in
persuading the crews of the caiques to make
the voyage to Leros. However, from 28th
September to 16th November, a total of 3,000
tons was shipped to Samos and of 480 tons to
Leros, including civilian foodstuffs.

247. From 11th October onwards, these sup-
plies from Turkey were intended to be the main
source of maintenance for the garrisons of
Samos and Leros, but they were supplemented
to a very considerable extent from other
sources.

248. During the period, 16th October to 7th
November, two British and five Italian sub-
marines operated to Leros from Beirut and
Haifa. The turn-round was estimated to be
fourteen days and it was expected that 150 tons
a week could be supplied by this method. The
main limitation was the Royal Navy’s inability
to sail the submarines during the period of the
full moon owing to the risks involved. Another
limiting factor was the size and weight
of the package that could be carried,
the ideal being a 16-inch cube’. which
could be lifted by one man. However,
this limitation was overcome by close
co-operation between the submarine com-
manders and the army personnel responsible
for loading, and amongst other awkward loads
twelve Bofors guns, six’ 2-pounder guns and
one Jeep were. sent, in addition to eighteen |
M.M.Gs. and 250 tons of more easily handled
stores.

249. Stores and personnel were also carried
in destroyers, mainly from Alexandria, The
loads that could be carried ‘by destroyer suf-
fered from limitations similar to those carried
by submarine, but much was accomplished by
co-operation and improvisation. In order that
no lift in destroyers or submarines should be
missed through stores not being available,
300-ton dumps were established at Alexandria,
Beirut and Haifa, and too-ton dumps at
Famagusta and Limassol. A priority which
altered from time to time to meet the opera-
tional requirements was laid down for the
despatch of these stores. By this means, 250
tons of stores and ten Jeeps were moved fot-
ward. This work, carried out by the Roya?
Navy under the most hazardous circumstanced,
was invaluable, and one of the main factors
enabling the islands to be held as long’as ‘they
were. Over the period of the operation .H.M.
