SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948

The month of January therefore ended with
our troops west of the River Salween with the
exception of small parties of men who did not
get away with the ships or who had got
separated from their units. Many of these
turned up later having managed to cross the
river 1n native boats or on rafts, etc.

79. Reasons for Withdrawal. The question
may well be asked as to whether it was neces-
sary to evacuate Moulmein. While the initial
attack was probably carried out by only one
enemy regiment there was every reason to sup-
pose that the remainder of a division was
moving up and this afterwards proved to be
correct. With the enemy established to the
north and south of the town and probably on
the island of Chaungzon to the west, no com;
munication with the town would have been
possible and in the absence of any naval or
military boat crews, etc., operations for relief,
even if troops had been available, would prob-
ably have been impossible. The area had not
in any way been prepared for defence and re-
quired at least two infantry brigades to hold a
secure perimeter. Furthermore the water
supply came from outside the only line which
it was possible to hold. In view of these con-
siderations it is quite clear that a decision to
hold Moulmein any longer would almost cer-
tainly have involved the loss of the garrison
and possibly have hastened the fall of
Rangoon.

At one time I hoped that the arrival of rein-
forcements would enable me to establish a
strong force across the River Salween at Paan.
This would have covered the northern flank
of Moulmein and secured its communications
across the River Salween. It would also have
secured the most promising jumping off place
for a counter-offensive.

80. Request for Naval Assistance. About
this time a signal was despatched to G.H.Q.
South ‘West Pacific Command (A.B.D.A, Com-
mand) pointing out that Moulmein would prob-
ably fall and requesting that warships should
be sent to protect the coast as otherwise the
enemy would be able to move up the coast
from Malaya at will.

81, Casualties. The casualties suffered by
our troops up to and including the evacuation
of Moulmein amounted to 617 all ranks, a con-
siderable proportion being ‘‘ missing.”’ It
should be noted, however, that in jungle fight-
ing involving a withdrawal, practically all dead
and wounded are likely to be counted as missing
in addition to prisoners and those who, getting
separated from their umits, may turn up later
as stragglers. There is no doubt that the
enemy suffered considerable casualties at
Moulmein though probably very few at
Kawkareik.

Although the Divisional Commander was
still anxious to withdraw to the Bilin River
and to give up Martaban, I issued orders that
the Division was to fight hard to hold the line
of the River Salween and to give no ground.
As far as possible, however, the Division was
to be dispersed in depth so as to be able to
dea] with enemy infiltration.

The general plan was now to hold Martaban
securely and the line of the River Salween to
the north of Paan, with the remainder of the
17 Indian Division distributed back in depth
along the road to Kyaikto.

1687

. Two companies of the 3/7 Gurkha Rifles
held Martaban while the 1/7 G.R. were about
Paan. The 4 Burma Rifles watched the river
between these two places and the 5/17 Dogras
were ordered to Duyinzaik and to carry out
active patrolling.

82. Reorganisation. A good deal of reorgani-
sation was ‘now necessary within the Division
and it was decided to reconstitute the Brigades
so as to include a battalion of the Burma
Rifles in each Brigade as it was felt that these
battalions would be of greater value when
brigaded with other troops.

83. Reinforcements. On the 3rd February
the 48 Indian Infantry Brigade which had
arrived in Rangoon on 31st January without
its transport and had been held in Army
Reserve, was ordered forward to Bilin to join
the 17 Indian Division. The Divisional Com-
mander was instructed to keep this Brigade
concentrated and not to use it until there was
a real necessity to do so.

84. Enemy Action. Martaban was now sub-
jected to a good deal of shelling and bombing
and small parties of the enemy succeeded in
crossing the Salween at different points. In
view of the enclosed country and long distances
involved it was very difficult to locate them,
especially as no information was forthcoming
from the local inhabitants. Apart from this
there was a lull on the front which gave our
troops a much needed breathing space for re-
organisation. The 1/7 G.R., however, showed
a greater activity in the Paan area. They
maintained a post and patrols on the far side
of the river and had several very successful
encounters with the enemy. Eventually, how-
ever, his increasing strength in this area forced
their withdrawal across the river.

On the 5th February 7/10 Baluch relieved
the 1/7 G.R. opposite Paan who then moved
to Bilin. The 2 K.O.Y.L.I. which had been
transferred from the x Burma Division in the
Southern Shan States moved to Thaton while
the 8 Bufma Rifles and 1/9 R. Jats moved
into reserve at Bilin. .

85. Martaban Road cut. On the goth a
Japanese party which had no doubt infiltrated
through the jungle led by local guides cut the
road at milestone 8 a few miles south of
Paung and established a strong road block
there. Two carriers of the 5 Dogras failed to
force a passage and two armoured cars of the
Rangoon Battalion B.A.F. which came on the
scene a little later were put out of action. In
spite of further “attacks the enemy was not dis-
lodged from his position here. The 3/7 G.R.
later succeeded in opening a way through
Thebyugon and thence across country to
Thaton.

86. Martaban. On the following day (roth)
Martaban was again subjected to a considerable
amount of shelling and a good deal of enemy
activity was observed, all of which indicated
that the enemy were likely to make a renewed
effort in the near future. It was also known
that some parties of the enemy were on our side
of the river.

In view of the situation the Divisional Com-
mander represented his desire to evacuate
Martaban and to withdraw his line in order to
get on to a less extended front. For the reasons
given already I did not wish to give up more
