20. Acting on reconnaissance reports received
up to 1115, EAGLE’s striking force was flown
off at I145 to attack the enemy fleet, which at
this time was believed to be in position 295
degrees go miles from WARSPITE, steaming
North.

This position seems to have been approxi-
mately correct but, owing to an insufficiency
of aircraft in EAGLE, touch was lost at 1135
and, in the event, the enemy battlefleet altered
course to the Southward about this trme and
the striking force failed to find them.

21. WARSPITE’s noon position was 37° 30°
N, 18° 40° E '

22. Al 1215 flying boat 5803 reported 6
cruisers and Io destroyers in position 37° 56’ N,
17° 48’ E.. steering 220 degrees, at 25 knots,
and at 1220 three 8” cruisers in position 37°
55’ N, 17° 55’ E., steering 225 degrees.

' 23 At 1252 the striking force, having missed
the battleflect, sighted a large number of enemy
ships steering to the Southward and, assuming
that the battlefleet last reported steermg North
had altered tc the Southward, worked round to
the Westward of this force and attacked the
rear ship of the enemy line at 1330. At the
time this was presumed to be a battleship,
but from the high speed and’ rapid turning
which was observed it was almost ceriainly a
cruser. The two battleships were by this time
considerably further to the Southward. No hits
were observed. Heavy A.A. fire was encoun-
tered from thé cruisers and attendant destroyers
but the aircraft received only superficial
damage. ‘The striking force landed on at 1434.

24. A search by EAGLE’s aircraft Duty C
reported no enemy ships between bearings 334
and 2gzr degrees to a depth of 60 miles from
38° N, 18° E., at 1330. It was now clear that
at about 1200 the main enemy battlefleet had
‘turned Southward and that the cruiser forces

which had been sweeping to the North-eastward °

had turned South-west to effect a concentration
in approximately 37° 45’ N, 17° 20° E. (See
Diagram No. 1.)

25. At 1340, flying boat 9020 reported 3
battleships and a large number of cruisers and
destroyers in position 37° 58’ N, 17° 55 E.,
steering 220 degrees, and at 1415 that the
enemy’s course and speed was 020 degrees,
18 knots. 11 was now clear that after concen-
trating the enemy had turned Northward again
and that our Fleet was rapidly closing the
eneiny.

At this time the impression was growing that
the enemy intended to stand and fight, albeit
on his own ground and with more than one road
of escape ‘eft open to him.

- Course was maintained to the North-westward

to cut him off from Taranto until it became clear

at 1400 that this object had been achieved,

when course was altered to 270 degrees to in-
. crease the rate of closing

26. Speed of approach was limited by the
maximum speed of ROYAL SOVEREIGN,
with WARSPITE acting as a battle cruiser to
support the 7th Cruiser Squadron, who, being so
few and lacking in 8” ships, were very weak
compared with the enemy’s cruiser force.
- At 1430 the Commander-in-Chief in
WARSPITE was in position 38° 02’ N,
318° 25’ E., steering 270 degrees at 22 knots.
The 7th Cruiser Squadron were 8 miles ahead,
with ROYAL SOVEREIGN, MALAYA and

SUPPIEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 28 APRIL, 1948

EAGLE ito miles asten, EAGLE’s stnking
force landed on at 1434. At 1435, EAGLE’s
Duty C reported the enemy course and speed
as 360 degrees 15 knots and at 1439 that the
enemy centre was 260 degrees 30 miles from
WARSPITE. This ended the approach period
and surface contact was made soon afterwards,

Weather during the Approach.

27. During the’ forenoon the wind veered
from North-west to North by West, force 5,
but later back to North-west again, The sea
was slight, visibility 15 to 20 miles. The sky
was clear up to*0800 but was 2/1oths clouded
at noon.

" The Fleet Action.

28. At 1452 NEPTUNE reported
. enemy vessels in sight bearing 238 degrees.

At 1455 ORION sighted 3 destroyers bear-
ing 234 degrees, 31,000 yards.

At 1500 ORION sighted three destroyers and
4 cruisers between 240 and 270 degrees.

2g. At 1500 (See Diagram No. 2) the 7th
Cruiser Squadron, except the damaged
GLOUCESTER who had been ordered to join
EAGLE, was 10 miles 260 degrees from
WARSPITE and were formed on a line of
sbearing 320 degrees and steering 270 degrees
at 18 knots. NUBIAN and 4 destroyers were
screening WARSPITE.

EAGLE, screened by VOYAGER and
VAMPIRE, was proceeding to take up a posi-
tion 10 miles to Eastward of, WARSPITE and
was shortly joined by GLOUCESTER who, by
reason of her bomb hit the previous day, was
unfit to engage in serious action.

30. The cruisers were then rapidly closing
the enemy forces which were distant 12 to 18
miles between bearings of 235 and 270 degrees.
At 1508 NEPTUNE sighted 2 enemy battle-
ships bearing 250 degrees 15 miles, and the
course of the 7th Cruiser Squadron was altered
to ooo degrees and then to 045 degrees at 1510
to avoid getting too heavily engaged until
WARSPITE was in a position to give support.
At 1514 the 7th Cruiser Squadron’s line of
bearing was altered to 350 degrees and the
enemy cruisers marked ‘‘C’”’ in the diagram
opened fire at a range of 23,600 yards. At 1516
the 7th Cruiser Squadron altered course to

025 degrees and at 1520 to 030 degrees to open
“A” ares.*®

3x. At 1512 the 7th Cruiser Squadron was
ordered by Vice-Admiral (D) to engage an
equal number of enemy ships. NEPTUNE
and LIVERPOOL opened fire at a range of
22,100 yards and SYDNEY opened fire at the
fourth cruiser from the right, thought to be of
the ZARA class. ORION onened fire first on
a destroyer (Z in Diagram No. 2) then on the
right hand cruiser bearing 249 degrees, range
23,700 yards.

32. In the meantime the enemy advanced
forces were sighted from WARSPITE who
epened fire on an 8” cruiser bearing 265
degrees at a range of 26.400 yards This was
a cruiser in ‘‘C ’’ Squadron (Diagram No. 2)
which was then engaging and being engaged
