SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948

was observed by low flying Hurricanes on
reconnaissance. The 63rd Brigade had been
accepted and General Alexander planned the
last stand in the defence of Rangoon. Through-
out this action which tenminated on the 8th
March with the completion of the demolition
and the final evacuation of the Port of Ran-
goon, an interesting air situation arose.

150. It was of paramount importance that
the last vital demolition .on a big scale should
be completed without the mterference of hostile
aircraft and that the movement of the Army
which was disposed astride the Pegu Road and
in Rangoon should be enabled to give last cover
to demolition parties and to withdraw as
planned through the cross-road at Taukkyan
and North up the Prome Road. The Army
was tied to the road on account of the nature
of the country and the fact that it was
mechanised.

151. As already noted, the air actions over
Rangoon on the 24th and 25th had inflicted
severe casualties on the enemy air force. From
that day until the evacuation of the Army from
Rangoon had been completed, until all our
convoys and ships had left the Port in security
and until our demolition parties had been with-
drawn, no enemy bomber attempted to enter
what had previously been our warning zone
round the airfields of Rangoon, i.e., roughly a
circle 40 miles in radius from the centre of
the town.

152. I can only assume that when their last
effort to establish air superiority failed, the
enemy air force were determined not to incur
further wastage unt Rangoon fell. Conse-
quently the demolitions and the withdrawal of
our forces from Rangoon took place in a state
of absolute air superiority.

153. As regards the enemy effort in the battle
of Pegu, air attacks took place against
Maymyo, Toungoo and Bassein, whilst con-
siderable activity was maintained over the
battle area

154. On the 2nd March I gave instructions
for the R.D.F. station, which had been made
mobile to move to Magwe, to provide some
R.D.F. warning for our new air base. Con-
sequently, when the telephone observer corps
system collapsed there was no* warning in the
area except that provided by observation from
military points and airfields.

155. To offset this to some extent a “ Jim
ow ” Hurricane was kept over Rangoon by

jay.

156. During this cntical phase, fearing that
my fighter force might be caught on the ground
and destroyed by surprise low flying fighter
attack, I had moved them out to.a newly pre-
pared ‘‘ kutcha ”’ strip at Highland Queen from
which offensive fighter patrols were maintained.»
To give the impression that the force was°still
at Mingaladon, wrecked aircraft fuselages and
dummies were parked in the readiness position
on the runways.

157. During this critical phase to the 7th
March, the bomber effort was directed against
the enemy wherever he could be found. The
fighters accompanying the bomber raids came
down to shoot up enemy objectives. 96,800 Ibs.
of bombs were released, and a considerable
number of fighter offensive and protective sorties

1727

carried out. Such objectives as enemy troop
concentrations, trains, boats on the Sittang and
M.T. columns were attacked with satisfactory
results. The bombers operated from Magwe
aerodrome using Highland Queen and John
Haig as advanced bases.

158. General Sir Archibald “ Wavell, now
Commander-in-Chief, India—to which Com-
mand Norgroup had reverted—visited Burma
on the 1st and 2nd March. A meeting was held
at Magwe on the morning of the rst March
in which the Commander-in-Chief reviewed the
Jand and air situation. At this meeting H.E.
the Governor, General Hutton and myself were
present. I described the air situation and the
need for reinforcing Hurricanes and Blenheims.
With Rangoon now closely threatened, with
our warning non-existent, with a slender fighter
force of 20 serviceable Hurricanes and a few
Buffaloes, with the A.V.G. force standing at
4 serviceable aircraft at Magwe, it was a posi-
tion in which I said we should be unable to
deny the enemy fredom of air action; while
our bombing effort in support of the Army would
be limited to the efforts of our quickly dwind-
hing force of 16 bombers,

Attack on Highland Queen.

159. On the 6th, an enemy formation of
about 20 plus aircraft which was flyimg over
the Japanese troops advancing through the
jungle towards the Prome Road over-shot its
mark and, by accident and without warning,
arrived flying low over Highland Queen where
our fighters, some bombers and some G.R. air-
craft were on the ground.

160. Fortune attended us on this occasion.
The enemy shooting was bad and some Hurri-
canes were able to take off. Although no claims
were made there were indications that 2 enemy
fighters were damaged or destroyed. Two air-
craft of ours were destroyed on the ground.
The anti-aircraft defence of the aerodrome went
into action satisfactorily. This was a raid
which might well have been a decisive end to
our small air force.

161. I immediately issued instructions for all
aircraft to fly in from Highland Queen to
Mingaladon, whence our last sorties were
carried out.

162. Infiltrations by boat had taken place up
the River Rangoon. Offensive action by our
fighters was taken but movement continued by
might. On the afternoon of the 6th March I left
Wing Headquarters, Rangoon, and flew to my
Headquarters at Magwe.

163. Our fighter force had for some days
been split between Magwe and the forward
bases round Rangoon, Highland Queen and
Mingaladon. The Hurncane force which was
then standing at about 15 aircraft was a mixed
one comprising commanders and pilots of 17,
135 and 136 Squadrons, and operating from
the forward bases was maintained from Magwe,
where maintenance inspections were carried
out. The P.40’s of the A.V.G. which had done
such sterling work were now suffering from
acute unserviceability due to lack of spares
and replacement aircraft. I therefore placed
them in the defence of the air base at Magwe.
This made good my promise to General
Chennault that I would not employ them at
airfields without adequate warning.
