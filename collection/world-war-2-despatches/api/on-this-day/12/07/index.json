The Air Officer Commanding also ordered a reconnaissance by Hudsons starting early on the 7th December, fanning out from Kota Bharu on to the last known bearings of the convoy. No signal was received from the Catalina, and, from information received later, it is almost certain it was shot down, A second Catalina failed to make contact with the convoy. On the morning of the 7th December, visibility East and NorthEast from Kota Bharu was good. The reconnaissance found no ships in the area between Kota Bharu and the Southern end of IndoChina, thus confirming the supposition that the convoy had rounded Cambodia Point, and had followed the four leading ships North-NorthWest into the Gulf of Siam. In this Gulf the visibility was very bad and no positive information was received from this area until the evening, when a report was received that a Hudson had seen, through low clouds, three",

In December,  1941, while the actual strength of the Royal Air Force (see Appendix J) approached very closely to my forecast, the Army strength (see Appendix E) fell far short of the figure which it had been agreed was required to compensate for the deficiency in aircraft. The main deficiencies were:   17 Battalions; 4 Light A.A. Regiments; and 2 Tank Regiments. The strength in A.A. weapons in the Far East on the 7th December, 1941, is given in Appendix 92. The fact that we were entirely without tanks in Malaya was a serious handicap to any offensive land operations, whether on a small or a large scale. There were also very few armoured cars. Many efforts were made to obtain both tanks and armoured cars from various sources. On the rqth August the War Office offered forty light tanks from the Middle East. These tanks were at the time being employed for aerodrome defence, and they were offered to the Far East on the condition that they would be employed in an operational role, and that we could man them from local resources.

Near the opposite end of the prospective theatre of operations, the island of Timor was important as being a definite link in the air communications between  Australia and the Netherlands East Indies. Its occupation by the Japanese would also be a serious threat to Australia: The importance of Timor was noted in the A.D.A. agreement, and it was referred to in A.D.B. Roughly half the island was Dutch territory and half Portuguese; it was the latter half which gave no small anxiety. The Japanese had a consulate in Dilli, the capital of Portuguese Timor, and by November, 1941, had received permission to run a regular flying-boat service to Dilli, and were gradually getting an economic hold on Portuguese Timor. In November, 1941, a small nucleus of Australian troops was sent to Koepang in Dutch Timor, where there was an aerodrome and a flying-boat base. On the rz2th December one infantry battalion, one independent company and a few coast defence troops reached Koepang from Australia, A combined Australian and Dutch force occupied Dilli in the middle of December, 1941. About the 7th December, in accordance with the A.D.A, and A.D.B. agreements, two flights of Hudsons of the Royal Australian Air Force moved to Ambon in the Netherlands East Indies. These were followed later by an infantry battalion.",

An offensive with this object in view was to be launched on 21st November, as already provided for, and it was estimated that it would hardly have reached its objective before the first week in December.* This determined the timing for Fifth Army. By 5th December it would have completed its programme for the relief, rest and training of the four American infantry divisions in II Corps; 13 Corps had only been able to rotate their forces so that only a limited offensive effort  could be called for from them. American artillery ammunition was sufficient for not more than about fifteen days  full-scale offensive operations. In view of that fact and the other considerations which made it inevitable that this should be the last major offensive before the spring of 1945 it was essential that every chance should be calculated to ensure its success and I directed that the actual timing of the offensive, which would be some date after 7th December, must be dependent on the weather and, if necessary, it must be postponed until the weather was propitious. :",

            "description": "General Montgomery's plan for the attack envisaged a heavy, well-prepared assault on the coastal end of the line. 5's was to command the main thrust with 78 and 8 Indian Divisions, and the recently arrived New Zealand Division, under Arm |, Was co-operating on their left. Indian Division had continued to advance on the left of the Corps  front until the Sangro was reached; it was then relieved by the New Zealanders and went into reserve behind 78 Division. The latter was to seize a bridgehead, the Indians were to break into the line, then 78 Division was to   come into the lead again and exploit on to Pescara and simultaneously the New Zealanders were to strike across the river directed on Chieti, from where they were to swing southwest down Route 5 to develop the desired threat against the Avezzano area. D-day was laid down as 20th November in orders published on the 16th, but both the timing and execution of the plan were strongly affected by the weather. It was essential to make full use of our command of the air and our superiority in armour, and both depended on reasonably fine weather. On the 20th the weather broke completely and we could only establish a small bridgehead; on 23rd November the river was in flood and rendered all bridges useless; the same happened on 25th November: when the attack had again been scheduled. The main attack eventually went in on the 27th with 8 Indian Division leading. Mozzagrogna, a key point in the defences, was captured on the 2oth and by the next day a bold use of our armour against ground considered impassable by the Germans gave us the whole ridge above the Sangro from there to the sea. In the meantime ihe New Zealanders had got across the river and on 2nd December captured Castelfrentano. The Division's next objective was Orsogna, which was attacked unsuccessfully on 7th December and again on the 14th equally without success. The enemy had",

The immediate objective was now Ortona, a small port surmounted by a medieval Old Town with a dilapidated castle and an outlying New Town of modern solidly built houses. It was hoped that we should be able to use the harbour for maintenance. On 6th December 1 Canadian Division and on 7th December 8 Indian Division crossed the Moro and drove on Ortona. Every advance was most bitterly contested by 90 Panzer Grenadier Division, which had now arrived complete; instead of the passive defence of 65 Division the Panzer Grenadiers spent lives recklessly in savage counter-attacks. But the acme of stubbornness was reached in the defence of Ortona itself by z Parachute Division which had been brought across from its hitherto inactive front",

            "description": "i Special Service Force and 36 Division attacked the northern third of the mountain mass to gain Monte La nen and bale Maggiore. Air support on that day was heavy and tae the rat time was not reduced by weather. Both Corps  attacks were successful. On 6th December 10 Corps captured the summit of Monte Camino, which they had almost secured on the 3rd but failed to hold against counter-attacks, and on the oth Rocca d Evandro was captured. This brought 10 Corps to the Garigliano all along its front. II Corps captured La Difensa on 3rd December and held it against strong counter-attacks, and on the 8th captured and mopped up Monte La  Remetanea. 36 Division's attack on Monte Maggiore, the northernmost and lowest peak, had succeeded by the night of the 3rd; counter-attacks were repulsed and by the 7th the position could be considered secured.   Between then and the xrth ro Corps took over the whole of the feature from II Corps. Between 29th November and gth December VI Corps on Fifth Army's right made diversionary attacks along the axes of the Colli Atina and Filignano Sant  Elia roads. Very little ground was gained in tangled and difficult country, with peaks rising to over twelve hundred metres. 2 Moroccan Division began to relieve 34 Division on the Corps  right on 8th December. Phase I of the Army Commander's plan was now, however, completed with the capture of the Camino massif and Phase II was ordered to start on 7th December. In this phase ro Corps had a minor defensive r le; the principal objective was the clearing of Monte Sammucro and this was assigned to II Corps. VI Corps was to continue to drive westwards along the roads to Atina and Sant  Elia but on a larger scale facilitated by the accession to its strength of the fresh and mountain trained Moroccan Division. It was hoped that by attacking on so wide a front the enemy would be sufficiently stretched to prevent him massing for the defence of Cassino. The bitterest fighting took place for Monte Sammucro and the village of San Pietro in Fine below it. The attack began on 7th December; the first two high points on Sammucro were seized without exceptional difficulty but after that our troops were held until the 13th by severe German counter-attacks and heavy mortar and artillery fire. On the 8th the Italian Motorised Group failed in an attack on Monte Lungo, in the throat of the gap. The second battle for San Pietro opened on the a5th and succeeded, though at heavy cost in casualties, by the 17th; Monte Lungo was also occupied and, north of the village, we forced our way further along the knife-edge of Monte Sammucro. This was bitter mountain fighting, with great use of artillery and gains in territory small compared with the time consumed and the losses suffered. There was still another enemy position, almost equally as strong as San Pietro, just a short distance ahead, based on the western end of Monte Sammucro and the lower hills covering the village of San Vittore. But 36 Division was exhausted and on 29th December had to be relieved by the 34th before San Vittore was taken. The VI Corps attack on the right had also made little progress against difficulties of ground and stubborn enemy defence; by the end of the year it could only be said to have kept level with the advance of II Corps with",
