(b) Until hostilities break out on Northern
Front the boundary will be:—

(Ninth Army incl.) the political boundary
between Persia and Iraq south to Abu Kemal
—Qasr Muhaiwir—then a line due south to
frontier of Saudi Arabia.

Io. It is essential to avoid disclosing our
weakness or our intentions to the enemy, to
Turkey, or to the local populations, because by
so doing we may encourage the enemy to
attack, drive Turkey into submission, and bring
about a serious internal security situation. My
policy, therefore, is:—

(2) To continue the despatch of stores to
Turkey in accordance with the programme
now in operation.

(b) To maintain garrisons in forward
areas, as nearly as possible on the same scale
as in the past.

(c) To continue slowly with the construc-
tion of roads already started in the forward
areas.

(4) Tenth Army.—To complete work on
defences already im preparation in Mosul
area. To prepare positions for occupation
by two divisions in area Basra—Shaiba to
cover base and port installations.

SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 1948

Ninth Army.—To complete work on
Southern Syria and Lebanon defences for
occupation by five divisions.

(e) To prepare, without delay, defended
bases of supply to enable mobile striking
forces to operate from (a) Haffa (b) Amman.

The projected base at Palmyra will not be
formed at present, but plans will be made
to form it at short notice, or to destroy the
facilities already existing there.

(f) To complete the following bridges : —

Raqqa—(To avoid disclosing a change
in policy) (Heaviest loads).

Haffa—Cl. 24.

Fatha—Cl. qo.

Approaches to the bridge at Deir ez Zor
will be completed, but the bridge will not be
built. Similarly work started on the Khabur
bridges will be completed, but no new work
started.

(g) To prepare defended staging posts at
Rutba and Tel Ghosain.
zz. The policy for garrisoning and stocking

the bases of supply and the staging posts is

given in Appendix ‘‘C’’ and annexure
thereto.*
