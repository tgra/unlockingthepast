178. In addition, heavy attacks were
launched on several special supply or storage

sites which had been observed under construc-

tion.

179. The ski sites were normally well hidden,
either in or at the edge of woods, well camou-
flaged and heavily defended by flak so that
low flying attacks on them were costly. In
photographs their presence was recognised not
only by the shape and layout of the buildings,
particularly the comprehensive water supply
system, but also by the specially built roads and
railways that led to them.

180. It was not appreciated before D-Day
that in addition to these specially constructed
ski sites, there were modified ski sites with all
the facilities of the original sites except for the
distinctive ski buildings and the water supply
system. After D+7, the day on which the
enemy first launched flying bombs against the

United Kingdom, photographic reconnaissance
revealed the existence of 74 of these modified
sites. They were camouflaged more completely
than the original sites and made use of existing
roads and buildings. Details of attacks on
these modified ski sites or launching sites are in-
cluded in my account of air operations in the
post-assault phase.

181. The exact number of flying bombs
which the known number of ski sites were
capable of launching against the United King-
dom if they had not been attacked by
aircraft can only be estimated, but it is
thought that some 6,000 flying bombs per 24
hours is a reasonable estimate. The success of
the air forces, therefore, in attacking and
neutralising Germany’s capacity to use this
secret weapon may be judged in terms of the
figures of actual flying bombs launched after
D-Day. These figures are set out in the account
of the post-assault phase.
