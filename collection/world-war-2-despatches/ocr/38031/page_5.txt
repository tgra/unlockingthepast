ahead at maximum speed with NUBIAN and
MOHAWK; WARSPITE (who was having
slight condenser trouble) and BARHAM
remained in company with FORMIDABLE,

iz. FORMIDABLE’S aircraft were not using
“Duty Letters ’’ so that it was difficult to
follow the series of reports. Their positions
were also being omitted from reports as in the
case of aircraft 5H report timed o905. An
enemy force was being reported to the north-
ward of the cruisers, but it was not clear to the
Commander-in-Chief whether this was in fact
another force or either of those already in
contact. The term “ battleships ’’ was used
on one occasion. On balance it seemed probable
that there was another enemy force containing
battleships, on which the cruisers were retiring;
the Commander-in-Chief, therefore, decided to
keep the air striking force back until the doubt
about this had been cleared up. The aircraft,
however, lost touch with the enemy and at
0939 the Commander-in-Chief ordered the air
striking force to attack the cruisers in contact
with the Vice-Admiral, Light Forces; if another
squadron was sighted first, it was to be attacked
instead.

12. At this time Force ‘‘ X ’’ was estimated
to be 75 miles 300 degs. from the Commander-
in-Chief, being reported 16 miles 320 degs. from
the Vice-Admiral, Light Forces. In order to
increase the speed of the fleet, BARHAM was
ordered to follow in the wake of the screen in-
dependently of flying operations. VENDETTA
was sighted ahead having been detached by
the Vice-Admiral, Light Forces to join the
battlefleet on account of engine trouble. The
Commander-in-Chief ordered her to proceed
independently to Alexandria.

13 By 1030 there was still no further news
of the enemy to the northward and it seemed
possible that Force ‘‘ X’’ in contact with the
Vice-Admiral, Light Forces, was after all the
only enemy squadron in the vicinity; but at
1058 the Vice-Admiral, Light Forces reported
two battleships bearing 002 degs. 16 miles from
him and steering 160 degs. The Vice-Admiral
Light Forces turned away to the south-eastward
making smoke, but was evidently placed in a
most uncomfortable position with the cruisers
on his starboard quarter and the battleships (to
be known as Force ‘‘ ¥Y *’) to port. The Com-
mander-in-Chief ordered FORMIDABLE to put
the air striking force on to the battleships and

decided to close the Vice-Admiral, Light Forces *

as quickly as possible rather than work round
between the battleships and their base. The
doubt as to whether GLOUCESTER would be
able to maintain the Vice-Admiral, Light
Forces’ reported speed of 30 knots weighed in
favour of this decision, but the Vice-Admiral,
Light Forces’ 1123 showed that he was still
keeping the battleships at a range of 16 miles.

14. The Vice-Admiral, Light Forces was esti-
mated to bear 280 degs. 65 miles from the Com-
mander-in-Chief at 1135 steering 120 degs. but
there was some doubt as to the accuracy of this
owing to possible difference in reference posi-
tions. In order, therefore, to be certain of
making contact with the Vice-Admiral, Light
Forces as early as possible, the Commander-in-
Chief altered course to 290 degs. at 1135 and
to 270 degs. at 1200. FORMIDABLE was
detached with two destroyers to operate aircraft
independently, VALIANT was still in company
and BARHAM had been keeping up well.

GAZETTE, 31 JULY, 1947

Surface contact lost-—First air attack.

15. At 1200 Force ‘‘ Y’’, which was now
reported to consist of only one LITTORIO class
battleship with destroyers, was estimated to
bear 290 degs. 45 miles from the Commander-
in-Chief; the destroyer screen was detached
ahead to join the Captains (D), but at 1210 the
Vice-Admiral, Light Forces reported having lost
touch with the enemy battlefleet and five
minutes later the air striking force returned with
the news that the battleship had last been seen
at 1145, steering 270 degs. with cruisers 20
miles to the south-east. The striking’ force re-
ported one probable hit on the battleship. A
JU. 88 had been shot down by a Fulmar.
Second heavy Enemy Force reported.

16. A new force (to be known as Force
‘*Z’) was now sighted to the northward by
Flying Boat Duty V. It was reported to con-
sist of two CAVOUR class battleships, one
POLA and two ZARA cruisers and five
destroyers in position 35 miles west of Gavdo
Island steering 315 degs. 25 knots.

Contact made with the Vice-Admiral, Light
Forces.

17. At 1230 the Vice-Admiral, Light Forces
was sighted bearing 220 degs. 12 miles with all
his force undamaged. The Commander-in-
Chief altered course to 290 degs. and ordered
the second air striking force to attack the LIT-
TORIO battleship. The Vice-Adwniral, Light
Forces’ signal timed 1245 was the first intima-
tion to the Commander-in-Chief that the enemy
had turned northward, but this was later
assumed to be a signal error and the enemy
to have turned westward as reported by the
striking force.

By 1250 it was evident that Forces “‘ X’”
and “‘ Y ” had turned back and there was no
prospect of overtaking them unless the speed
of the LITTORIO was reduced by air attack.
The destroyers were, therefore, ordered to re-
form a battlefleet screen, the Captain (D),
Second Destroyer Flotilla and two destroyers
being sent to the assistance of FORMIDABLE
who was now a long way astern and seen to
be engaging two Torpedo-Bomber aircraft.
Speed was reduced at 1306 to 22 knots and at
1325 to 2r knots to allow FORMIDABLE and
BARHAM to keep up. Force B was now in
position 230 degs. 6 miles from the battlefleet.

The Chase.

18. At 1350 course was altered to 310 degs.
as it was thought probable that Forces ‘‘ Y’”’
and ‘‘Z"’ were trying to make contact with
each other. An air search was also ordered to
the north-westward since no further reports had
been received of Forces “XX” and ““Y’’.
Doubts whether Duty ‘‘ V "’ might in reality be
reporting Force ‘‘ ¥ ’’ were cleared up when
his position was checked by a landfall and at
1342 the Commander-in-Chief signalled the
positions of the three forces to the fleet. zor
Group were instructed to concentrate all flying
boats in the area south and west of Crete to
maintain touch with the enemy. JUNO and
Force D were ordered to patrol the Kithera
Straits.

1g. During the forenoon a strong breeze from
the north-east had made flying operations delay
the fleet, but in the afternoon the wind dropped
altogether and the heavy cloud dispersed. This
change in the wind probably also affected the
accuracy of the reported positions of the shore
based aircraft.
