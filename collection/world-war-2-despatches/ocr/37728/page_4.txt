reserve of 30 days for a force of three divisions,
together with a generous complement of non-
divisional troops and labour.

Much other work had to be done to improve
the communications in Assam. A new railhead
and advanced base was made at Ledo; an
additional river port was made at Doinaigon on
the Brahmaputra north of Jorhat, and the rail-
way was extended to meet it; many additional
crossing places were made on the railway and
the control system improved; the ferry capacity
over the Brahmaputra at Gauhati ferry was
greatly increased; and other improvements to
the railway, road and telegraph system
carried out.

12. The transportation problem would have
been an extremely difficult one in any event.
It was further complicated in 1942 by the

following events. There was an exceptionally

heavy monsoon which caused extensive flood-
ing and interruption of railway communica-
tions north of the Brahmaputra and elsewhere;
and also resulted in continual Jandslides on
the road to Imphal, which was the sole line of
communications to a large part of the force.
This was followed by the worst malaria
epidemic which India had known for many
years; there was a particularly high incidence
amongst lorry drivers and transportation per-
sonnel, which had a cumulative effect in
worsening the situation. Finally, from August
onward, the rebellion organised by Congress
after the breakdown of the Cripps negotiations
in April was directed especially against our
communications to N.E. India.

The Japanese raid into the Bay of Bengal
(see paragraph 5) in April caused for some
time the practical closing of the Bay of Bengal
and the eastern ports to shipping and threw
extra strain on the railways. The port of
Chittagong was closed altogether and much of
the port equipment was removed in May, when
a Japanese attack on Chittagong seemed
probable.

13. The transportation and other difficulties
enumerated above naturally had a considerable
effect on the efficiency of the troops. Those
in Manipur, who were dependent on the
Imphal road for supply, had to subsist on less
than full rations for a considerable portion of
the summer, and the resultant malnutrition
increased their susceptibility to malaria and
other disease. It was impossible also, owing
to the breaking of the road, to provide satis-
factory medical accommodation and equipment
or to evacuate the sick to better conditions.
This again increased the sick rate. Many of
the troops had been through the exhausting
Burma campaign and should have been
relieved and rested had the reliefs or transport
facilities been available. In October, Novem-
ber and December, when conditions began to
improve, some 20,000 sick had to be evacuated
from Eastern Army area. This was in addition
to some 15,000 who had been evacuated before
the rains, when the army retumed from
Burma.

The disturbances caused by Congress in
August threw a fresh strain on the army, which
had to be used for internal security instead of
its legitimate work of training and equipping
for the weather season. The equivalent of
58 battalions had to be employed; of these
24 belonged to the Field Army and the equiva-
lent of 7 were formed from Reinforcement

Camps and Training Centres; the remainder
were battalions already allotted to internal
security duties. The employment of units
from Reinforcement and Training
Centres resulted in delay to the flow of rein-
forcements to formations on the Eastern
Frontier which were already seriously below
strength owing to the high incidence of
malaria.

I should like to pay a tribute to the admir-
able spirit and discipline shown by the troops
engaged on the unpleasant task of restoring
order during these troubles. The civil services,
armed and unarmed, worked in close co-
operation with the military forces in dealing
with disorders. The work of the police, who
were often isolated, was generally admirable,
and their steadfastness greatly lightened the
burden thrown on the troops.

REFUGEE PROBLEM.

14. Besides the troops evacuated from
Burma, India had to deal with some 400,000
civilian refugees from Burma in varying states
of distress. Some came by sea from Akyab,
before it fell into Japanese hands; large num-
bers came through Imphal; and others by the
Hukawng valley route to Ledo. The arrange-
ments {to feed and transport these numbers
presented a very serious problem, whilé from
the security aspect it was necessary ‘to set up
some organisation to try and prevent the infil-
tration of enemy agents. The arrangements
for the reception of refugees were placed by
the Indian Government under Major-General
E. Wood, who received invaluable assistance
from the organisation controlled by the Indian
Tea Association. The Imphal route, by which
the majority of the 180,000 refugees entered
Assam, was comparatively easy; but the route
up to the Hukawng valley from Myitkyina by
Maingkwan and Shingbwiyang to Ledo was
from Shingbwiyang onwards only a difficult
mountain track with several rivers to oross.
After the rains began, mud and swollen rivers
made this route practically impassable from
end of May onwards, and a number of the
refugees were marooned at Shingbwiyang for
the monsoon period, having to be fed by air;
while some perished in the attempt to get
through. Other parties who attempted to reach
Ledo from Fort Hertz via the Chaukan pass
were only rescued with considerable difficulty.

CunesE Forces In INDIA.

15. When the Japanese broke through to
Lashio in April part of the Chinese forces in
Burma were cut off from return to China.
Part of these sought to reach India. One
Division, 38th, which had been operating with
the British forces, reached Imphal in good
order about 6,000 strong. Part of the re-
mainder of the Chinese Fifth Army eventually
got through to India by the Ledo route;
others made their way north-east into the
Kachin country north-east of Myitkyina and
teturned to China by mountain tracks, though
only after considerable losses from starvation
and disease.

General Stilwell himself, the American Chief
of Staff to the. Generalissimo, had been cut off
in Burma and had to make his way on foot
to Assam.

16. I decided to place all Chinese troops that
had reached India in a camp at Ramgarh that
