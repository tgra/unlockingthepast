were, at the best, indifferent and were beyond
the reach of adequate single seater fighter cover
based on Sicily. The first of these disadvan-
tages might have been overcome, the second
was insurmountable, Therefore, despite the
fact that on 27th July information was received
that H.M.S. UNICORN, acting in the capacity
of a light Fleet Carrier, and four Escort Car-
riers could be made available from outside my
Command, it was decided that the landings
must take place in the Gulf of Salerno. Here
the beaches were superior to those of the Gulf
of Gaeta but the area immediately inland
could be covered by artillery fire from the
adjacent hills, Further, the roads to Naples
led through narrow defiles, which could be
easily defended. These disadvantages had,
however, to be accepted.

6. Once again, as in Operation “ Husky ”*
the choice of D-Day was largely governed by
the period of moon required for the: employ-
ment of paratroops. The date finally selected
for this operation was thus not entirely favour-
able from the Naval point of view, and the
assault forces had to accept a disadvantageous
light for the approach. In the event, airborne
troops were not employed for the assault.-

Preparation, Training and Mounting.

7. Due to the short time available between
the final conquest of Sicily and mounting of
Operation “‘ Avalanche”, there was little time
available for rehearsal. In fact, as is stressed
by the Naval Commander Western Task Force,
it was necessary to overhaul the landing craft
at first priority. Every possible repair facility
in North was pressed into service and
the fact that more craft than had at first
seemed likely were overhauled in time to take
part in the operation enabled. a faster paikup
to be achieved than had been expected, and
teflects + great cr it on the repair staffs con-
cerned.

8. In this connection, however, I cannot
concur entirely with the remarks of the Naval
Commander Western Task Force in Part IV,
Section I, paragraph 18 of his report, in which
he states that “ Naval Planning for Operation
‘ Avalanche’ was affected by the late receipt
of orders from higher authority and changes in
the composition of the Naval Task Forces
brought about by unforeseen releases of Land-
ing Craft from Operations ‘Husky’ and
‘Baytown ’t.” The increases in the numbers
of Landing Craft assigned were largely due to
the great efforts of the maintenance personnel.
Further changes in the numbers and types of
Landing Craft available were caused by the

omission of the Naval Commander Western.

Task Force to provide six L.S.T.s, as required
by my Operation Orders, to lift Air Force
stores from Milazzo in Northern Sicily to the
assault area. To take the place of these
L.S.T.s a number of L.C.T.s were diverted
from the Messina/Reggio ferry service at con-
siderable expense to the Eighth Army build-up.
This is referred to more fully | in paragraph 21
of this report.

9. During the loading stages an unfortunate
incident took place at Tripoli, due to the

loading without proper authority of ‘some
smoke containers into an L.C.T. already con-
taining ammunition. Spontaneous combustion
of the smoke led to the explosion of the
ammunition which put out of action four
L.C.T.s which could ill be spared. This
incident serves to stress the necessity for
careful supervision of the loading of assault
convoys.

Italian Armistice.

10. The fact that an Armistice had been
signed between the Allies and the Italians was
broadcast by the B.B.C. on the evening of
D-1. It had been fully realised that this
announcement might well engender an
unjustified sense of security in the minds of
those taking part in the assault. Accordingly,
the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean and
the Task Force Commanders sent signals
warning all ships taking part in the operation
that strong opposition from German forces
must still be expected. There can, nevertheless,
be no doubt that many took no heed of these
warnings and viewed the proceedings with a
sense of complacency which was not sub-
Stantiated in the event.

Intelligence.

11. In general, the intelligence proved
reliable and it is satisfactory to note that both
beach intelligence and intelligence on fixed
Coastal Defence installations were found to be
accurate; the only additional defences
encountered over and above those estimated
being of the mobile type. That the security of
the operation was not all to be desired was
due to a variety of reasons, the chief of which
were: —

(a) The logical selection of the beaches
(from the enemy’s point of view) for the
reasons given in paragraph 5

(b) The Armistice.

It is interesting to note, however, that
although the assaulting forces were sighted by
air reconnaissance on the 7th September, it was
not until 0230 on 9th September that Alarm
Number 3 (“Landing imminent or in pro-
gress ”) was instituted by the Germans.

Assault.

12. The assaults, with a few minor excep-
tions, went according to plan. The forces
arrived at the correct lowering points at the
times laid down in the orders. The distances of
these lowering points for the deep draught
L.S.L@)s—9 and 10 miles from the shore—
was forced upon the Task Force Commanders
by an expected minefield along the 100 fathom
line. This expectation was fulfilled.

13. One Brigade of 56 Infantry Division was
landed to the South of its allotted beach and
became mixed with the other Brigade which
had spread North of its sector, thereby causing
considerable confusion for some hours.

The Scout Boat marking UNcteE GREEN
beach was too far to the South, thus causing a
gap in the 46th Division landing, which left an
enemy strongpoint unneutralised. This strong-
point subsequently caused considerable ae
to the Division.
