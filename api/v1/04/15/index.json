            "description": "15. Early in the new year, I visited Cairo in order to discuss the question of reinforcement which was then under revision. Operations in the Western Desert were being brought to a successful conclusion and it was hoped that, by the time the weather conditions had improved in Greece so as to allow occupation of more aerodromes, it would be hg to spare additional squadrons from the Middle East Command. The reinforcement plan envisaged a total force in Greece of fourteen squadrons and I intimated that I would be prepared to start accepting the additional squadrons by r5th January. «It was hoped that the whole programme would be complete by 15th April. In planning the reinforcement programme, I again endeavoured to get permission to use the aerodromes in the Salonika area, some of which had remained generally serviceable throughout the winter and could be occupied forthwith. The Germans, however, had commenced their infiltration into Roumania, and the Greek Government were particularly anxious to avoid giving them any idea that we had any hostile intentions in Macedonia which could be directed only against German interests.",

Although the channel was partially blocked, it could be used by light-draught vessels and on 15th April, 1,300 tons were discharged at this port. Oceangoing ships were loaded in the Delta for Sfax and sailed for Tripoli where they were lightened to meet the draught restriction of Sfax and were then called forward, together with such local tonnage as was available. Although limited by a shortage of powered harbour-craft (which was a limiting factor at Tripoli also), , this system enabled a total of over 40,000 tons ~ to be discharged at Sfax by the end of the campaign, an average of over 1,300 tons a day. This, together with the discharge at Tripoli, gave a daily average discharge of stores and supplies from Middle East of over 5,000 tons including bulk petrol.",

The flying boat and the destroyer ‘‘Somali’’ lying in the Namsen Fiord were repeatedly attacked by German aircraft with bombs and machinegun fire, and Generai Carton de Wiart’s staff officer was wounded. Meanwhile 146th Infantry Brigade had been ordered, while at sea, to go to Namsos instead of Narvik, but it was evident that the landing of these troops direct from transports was not a feasible operation at Namsos, and that they would have to be transferred to destroyers at Lillesjone and then taken to Namsos on two successive days.",

The Combined Chiefs of Staff subsequently directed that an attempt should be made to advance this date to the corresponding period in June.

            "description": "48. The needs of our forces in the Manipur area were many and pressing. No. 50 Parachute Brigade was flown from the Punjab to reinforce the garrison at Imphal, and a little later No. 5 Indian Division was moved by air complete from the Arakan in 758 sorties. Between 10th/15th April, an infantry brigade was flown from Amarda Road, south-west of Calcutta to Jorhat in Assam. 99 Commando (C.46) and 189 Dakota (C.47) sorties lifted 3,056 all ranks, 937,000 pounds of stores and the following equipment: 50 motor-cycles, 40 jeeps, 31 jeep trailers, 16 25-pounders and eight 3.7 howitzers. An Army Air Support Control unit was taken by air from Poona to Jorhat for service with 33 Corps. The movement by air of the servicing echelons of tactical squadrons became a matter of routine. In regard to the maintenance of our troops, the most varied articles were delivered to the forces momentarily engulfed within the flood of Japanese infiltration. At Kohima, for instance, owing to the enemy seizure of the wells, it was necessary to drop drinking water as well as routine supplies and medical necessities. Three hundred and seventy tons of bitumenised hessian were delivered by air at Tulihal to make the airfield there all-weather. On the return journeys all transport aircraft brought out with them casualties or troops not needed for active combat.",

            "description": "150. The formation of South-East Asia Command resulted in extensive developments in organisation, and a whole hierarchy of Headquarters has been called into being. Headquarters, Supreme Allied Commander, South-East Asia, moved from Delhi to Kandy in March, 1944. It was not possible to move my Headquarters to Kandy at this time, as the expansion and development of my Command necessitated maintaining the closest contact with G.H.Q. India, and so it was necessary to form an Advanced Headquarters, A.C.S.E.A., consisting of a Planning and Liaison Staff, to accompany H.Q. S.A.C.S.E.A. in its move to Kandy. Air Headquarters, India, was set up as an autonomous unit to control operations on the North-West Frontier and assume responsibility for the LAF., directly responsible under its own A.O.C. to C.-in-C. India. Eastern Air Command was established to co-ordinate air operations on the Burmese frontier. Its Headquarters moved on 15th April to Calcutta in order to maintain closer touch with its subordinate units—the Strategic Air Force, Third Tactical Air Force, Troop Carrier Command and Photographic Reconnaissance Force. Thus administrative control of American units also gravitated to Calcutta, since this remained the responsibility of Major-General G. E. Stratemeyer in his other capacity, that of Commanding-General of the U.S.A.A-F, in the India-Burma Sector of the China-Burma-India Theatre.",
