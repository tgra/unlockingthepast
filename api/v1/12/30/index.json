            "description": "‘the 22nd Armoured Brigade was heavily engaged by the remnants of the enemy’s armoured divisions which had been lying to the south-east. The long march across the desert from Gazala had ‘been too much for many of the tanks with which the brigade had been fitted out: out of a hundred and thirty tanks, sixty had fallen by the way, and in the battle eight more were lost out of a total of fourteen as a result of mechanical breakdown. Although the brigade failed in its object of getting round behind the main position and was forced to retire to El Haseiat, it inflicted considerable damage on the enemy, destroying twenty of his tanks and damaging twenty more. A further action on the 30th December, in which the 22nd Armoured Brigade again Jost a number of tanks, drove General Godwin-Austen to the conclusion that the brigade was not fit for further operations. Accordingly he gave instructions for the 7th Support Group to relieve it, and had to content himself with harassing the enemy until fresh troops arrived.",

            "description": "Beyond Nofilia an advance in force was for the moment impossible for administrative reasons: Nofilia itself is two hundred and sixty miles from Benghazi, the advanced base, and Sirte eighty miles further still, An advance was essential, however, for the sake of the Rofal Air Force, since there were very few landing grounds in the area in which we were operating and it was vital to secure those at Sirte, in order to give clgse support to the attack on the Buerat line. An armoured car regiment was therefore sent to work round to the south of the village. Fearful for the loss of half of his remaming tanks the enemy at once withdrew and shortly after noon on Christmas Day the village was entered without opposition. As the enemy had proved so sensitive to an outflanking movement the manoeuvre was continued until finally, by 30th December, he had fallen back before our armoured car patrols to the main position.",

            "description": "The Commander-in-Chief made a force known as “Force Emily”’ available for operations in the Sudan. This force was moved partly by sea and partly by the Nile Valley route, The first flight consisted of the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade Group plus 68 Medium Regiment, less one battery, and certain other units which arrived at Port Sudan on 30th December. This brigade was moved to the Port Sudan-Gebeit area. The remaining parts of the force were due to arrive by sea on 7th, 14th and 21st January. The part moved by Nile Valley route, consisting of the 5th Indian Infantry Brigade Group and the Divisional Cavalry Regiment, plus otner nits, was due to arrive at Wadi Halfa over a period of five weeks from about 3oth December. For its success the attack needed a waning moon and gth February was provisionally fixed. It will therefore be ‘seen that there was very little time between the arrival of the last units of Force Emily and the attack. This was compensated for by the fact that the units of Force Emily were all seasoned troops and had had active service experience,",
