G. Robinson, U.S.N.), made a preliminary reconnaissance on the 27th April. He found that there was no apparent damage to docks, quays and other harbour installations but that warehouses were totally destroyed and prisoners-of-war stated that many mines had been sown in the enclosed basins and the adjacent river. The capacity of the port  was restricted to some extent by sunken ships and in fact no war or merchant ships were found afloat."

Accordingly next morning, 27th April, I wrote an appreciation of the situation which convinced me that evacuation was necessary and that there were two main ways of doing it. In the first case, as w  had few stores and little heavy equipment ashore we might, by means of a rapid evacuation of personnel only, cut our losses to the lowest level. In the second, by continuing to send anti-aircraft guns and artillery, and possibly subsequently further infantry, we might be able to hold the position for some time longer. This however would undoubtedly involve the loss of large quantities of valuable material and certainly heavy casualties in personnel. The period could not be sufficient to allow of any direct attack on Trondheim being planned and mounted. In my opinion the correct solution was a rapid withdrawal with the object of reducing our losses to the lowest possible figure. :"

At Nauplion on the night of 26th-27th April, some 1,700 personnel had to be left behind owing to one of the ships, which had been set on fire by enemy bombing, having blocked the channel, so that the destroyers could not get alongside the quay. Another merchant ship which conveyed troops from this place was bombed and set on fire soon after leaving Greece and two destroyers which picked up the survivors from the ship were both sunk by bombs within a few minutes of each other. Some 700 troops are believed to have lost their lives.  These were practically the only casualties during the voyage from Greece."

It was not till 27th April that the last of her turrets could be accepted from the contractors and that practice drills with the whole main armament could be started. Captain Leach had been able to report on x7th May, shortly before the Fleet sailed for this operation, that he considered his ship fit to operate; but neither he nor I interpreted that report as implying that she was fully worked up. Her turrets, of a new and untried model, were known to be liable to teething troubles and could already be seen to be suffering them. The effects of all this on her gunnery had been, witnessed by the Rear-Admiral Commanding, First Cruiser Squadron, and he knew, in addition, that her bridge was seriously damaged, that she had taken in 400 tons of water aft and could not exceed 27 knots. The BISMARCK 'and PRINZ EUGEN, on the other hand, after working up for many months under ideal conditions in the Baltic, had given evidence of a v ry high degree of efficiency: the BISMARCK had been hit, but the RearAdmiral Commanding, First Cruiser Squadron,"

Kimura had apparently no hope of retaking Toungoo itself, but ihe directed 15 Japanese Division to accelerate its move west from Mawchi and block the Toungoo Mawchi road at the point where it enters the hills. The object was twofold. First, this threat.to 4 Corps might delay fits advance and cause it to divert troops; secondly, this position would protect the flank of those elements of 33 Japanese Army still north of Mawchi, who were retreating south. The Japanese Commander's next step was to concentrate every available man for the defence of Pegu. 24 Independent Mixed Brigade was rushed north from Moulmein to the Pegu  Mokopalin area. He also formed two new Mixed Brigades rom the Rangoon garrison, which were largely composed of administrative and naval personnel. The Rangoon Anti-Aircraft Command, the largest in Burma, provided the guns for this scratch force, all its batteries being utilised for this punpose. These two brigades were moved up to Pegu on 27th April with orders  To destroy the enemy north of Payagyi and 'Waw  , which lie 10 and 15 miles north and north-west of Pegu respectively.
