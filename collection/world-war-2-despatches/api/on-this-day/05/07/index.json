To effect this, and Battalion 4th Ghurkha Rifles were moved from Basra to Habbbaniya by air and a column was despatched from Shaiba towards Baghdad by the Euphrates route. This column, which consisted of 20th Indian Infantry Brigade Group, advanced from Shaiba on 27th May along the line of the railway, brushing aside slight opposition encountered near Ur. The advance from Fallujah was slow owing to extensive inundations, and the Brigade was unable to reach Samawa until roth June and Baghdad on 12th June.

The threat of enemy air attack on river craft reduced the capacity of the steamer service between Shwegyin and Kalewa during the hours of daylight. The crews were nervous and guards were placed on all ships to prevent any attempt at voluntary evacuation. Fortunately, however,- the steamer service was singularly free from air attack. Except for bombing raids on the boom on the 5th May, and at Shwegyin on the evening of 7th May, no air attacks of anyimportance took place",
