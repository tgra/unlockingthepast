SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON

Mogadiscio) were replaced by 2nd Nigeria
Regiment from Addis Abeba. 1 N.M.R. and
1 F.F. Battalion were directly under command
of the division.

The Commander xr1th (A) Division therefore
decided to form a defensive flank in the Dalle
area with the two South African battalions, and’
to use the 22nd E.A. Brigade to carry out the
attack on Soddu. The enemy were known to
be organising a defensive position west of the
River Billate, which was crossed by the Soddu
road at Colito. . :

34. On r9th May Colito was captured by the
and Nigeria Regiment and a bridgehead estab-
lished by 1/6 K.A.R. The bridge was not
completed until 2tst May but the attack on the
main position was carried out by 1/6 K.A.R.
on 19th May. This action was distinguished
by the way in which an enemy counter-attack,
which was supported by M.II medium and light
tanks and armoured cars, was broken up befbre
it properly materialised. In spite of having no
anti-tank guns and only anti-tank rifles on a
very reduced scale, the native troops destroyed
the counter-attack with great loss to the enemy,
and as a result of a most dashing charge, cap-
tured a number of prisoners and tanks. One
medium tank was captured single-handed by a
British N.C.O. who climbed on to the back of
the tank, opened the top of the turret and killed
all the crew with his revolver. The other
tanks then turned tail, presumably because, as
it was afterwards discovered, their commander
was killed in the captured tank.

35. As a result of this action the defence of
Soddu crumbled and with only slight opposi-
tion the town was occupied on 22nd May. The
delay in occupation was due to the time taken
in repairing the demolitions left behind by the
enemy.

Between the capture of Soddu and the start
of the Battle of the Omo, by the actions of
Ficche and Sciasciamanna, 12,852 prisoners, 42
guns, 23 A.F.Vs, including 5 Medium Tanks,
were captured, including the Divisional Com-
manders and the greater part of arst, 25th and
ro1st Divisions. General Pralormo, with the
remnants of 24th Division, took to the bush,
having abandoned most of his equipment.

36. It was now necessary for me to make a
= for further operations towards Gimma, and

ordered the Commanders of 11th and rath (A)
Divisions to meet me at Alatu on 24th May.
Here Commander 12th (A) Division reported
to me the very great difficulties he was encoun-
tering due to the rain and the roads. It was
quite apparent that I would be unable to use
either of his formations to attack towards
Gimma from the south as I had hoped to do.
I found at the most that the 24th G. C. Brigade
of the rath (A) Division could concentrate in
the Dalle-Soddu area soon and could relieve
rrth (A) Division of all ison duties, and
protect its rear, This would release the two
South African battalions to proceed to Berbera
for embarkation, and would free the whole of
gand E.A. Brigade for the further advance.
In order to enable an advance also to be made
on the Addis Abeba-Gimma road, where the
enemy were holding a position at Abalti south-
west of the Omo, I arranged to transfer the
Nigerian Brigade to this front. To do this
I relieved the 1st Nigeria Regiment in Addis
Abeba by garrison troops and moved up 1/1
K.A.R. which had in the meantime been simi-
larly relieved. As time was all important so

that the enemy could not strengthen his de-
fences on the unexpected line of attack from
the south, I was unable to sort out the batta-
lions and return and Nigerian Regiment which
was with 22nd E.A. Brigade, back to the
Nigerian Brigade. I therefore sent 1/1 K.A.R.
ya ie Nigerian Brigade who were to attack

37. It should be noted here that administra-
tive limitations in connection with transport and
the port of Berbera, precluded the use of more
than two brigades for operations beyond Addis
Abeba. The L. of C. from Kenya through
Tavello and Neghelli was in a most precarious
condition due to rain, and I could not hope
for any easing of the administrative problem
from this direction.

38. I im on General Wetherall the
necessity for speed and that the time factor
must take precedence of all other considera-
tions. The period of heavy rains was getting
nearer and I was most anxious to liquidate the
bd in the Galla Sidamo before they took

lace.

The new line of advance towards Gimma
opened by the capture of Soddu crossed the
River Omo near Sciola. This river was a
considerable obstacle, 450 feet wide, and
required special bridging equipment. Pro-
vision had been made for this equipment for
the crossing at Abalti on the Addis Abeba-
Gimma. road but there was insufficient avail-
able forward of Berbera for the second cross-
ing at Sciola. It should be remembered that
due to the long road link on the L. of C. from
Berbera to Diredaua, priorities for stores and
material had to be worked out very carefully
so that the most efficient use could be made
of the limited transport available. Two cross-
= a ae Omo had not been ieee and

erefore the transport to move more bridging
forward had not been made available. ge
fact unfortunately caused some delay in
attacking the enemy position on the Omo
south of Gimma, The number of bridges
which had been constructed up to this time
was 70 and captured or locally made material
was beginning to run short.

39. My intention now was for whichever of
the two brigades could get across the Omo first
to advance and attack the enemy facing the
other brigade in the rear. E.g. af 2and E.A.
Brigade succeeded in reaching the Gimma-
Addis Abeba road first they were to turn right
towards Addis Abeba and not left on Gimma.

At this time, most unfortunately, the Omo
came down in flood. Although it was a wide
river, in normal times it could be waded in
many places, but with the floods it was 6 feet
deep with a 6 knot current. This again
delayed matters considerably.

So both the Nigerian Brigade at Abalti in
the north, and the 22nd Brigade south of
Gimma. were faced with a considerable problem.
In the south the enemy were holding, on both
banks, the foot-bridge which crossed the river
where the road met it. A gallant attempt was
made to rush this foot bridge but was repulsed
with some loss of life. The Brigadier therefore
decided on crossing ‘with the few assault boats
available, some three miles south of the foot-
bridge. On 2nd June three platoons of sth
K.A.R. were able to get across, and to estab-
lish a precarious bridgehead. In spite of heavy
‘Shelling and the fact that no means existed for
