5900 SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1941

4, On landing the fighting troops were passed
rapidly through transit camps and their vehicles
were cleared at once to Vehicle Marshalling
Parks, whence they were despatched in convoys,
while troops left by rail on the same day as
they landed.

Since the troops and their vehicles were
landed at different ports they had to be collected
in an assembly area which had been chosen
in the vicinity of Le Mans and Laval. The
assembling of troops by rail and vehicles by
road took about six days. The resource of
individual drivers was tested by changes of
programme, inevitable in an operation of this
kind, by the damage which some vehicles had
sustained during the sea passage and by
mechanical failures. Drivers and vehicles were
on the road for long periods, but their duty was
lightened by the hospitality of the French
inhabitants, which all ranks will recall with
gratitude.

5. On 13th September I moved my head-
quarters from the War Office to Camberley,
where General Headquarters was forming. On
the following day, accompanied by Lieutenant-
General (now General) Sir John Dill, Commander
of ist Corps, and by my personal staff, I
embarked in H.M.S. “Skate,” and, landing at
Cherbourg, left by motor car for the Chateau de
la Blanchardiére, Le Mans, which the French
Government had kindly placed at my disposal.

6. On 21st September the concentration of
the General Headquarters Staff and of the
essential Lines of Communication units was
complete. The next day the advanced elements
of rst Corps and of General Headquarters Troops
arrived, the former moving to an area around
Laval and the latter to an area around Le
Mans. Units were given a minimum of one
week in which to assemble and reorganise and
although some of the units of rst Corps were still
incomplete, the limited accommodation available
in the assembly area made it essential to begin
the move forward before 26th September when
the leading units of znd Corps were due to arrive.

7. During these early weeks the maintenance
of the Force presented a problem which called
for the greatest resource and initiative on the
part of my Quarter-Master-General, Lieutenant-
General W. G. Lindsell, his Staff and Services.

In the units of the Royal Army Service Corps
were many officers and men fresh from civil

life who were constantly called upon to surmount .

unforeseen difficulties. By their unflagging
energy and the assistance of the French authori-
ties the Force was maintained without any
failure of supplies. It should be added that with
the exception of eleven regular officers, the
personnel of the Movement Control organisation
was built up from Supplementary Reserve
officers and men.

The administrative staff were obliged to deal
with the day-to-day work of landing troops,
their vehicles and current supplies, and to
undertake the equally important task of building
up reserves of ammunition, supplies, and
ordnance stores. Covered accommodation was
difficult to obtain and temporary dumps of non-
perishable stores had to be established wherever
the necessary space could be found in the vicinity
of the ports of entry.

8. In these early days the Staff met for the
first time the problem arising from the wide

dispersion imposed by the necessity to guard

The towns of Le Mans and: Laval were
fifty miles apart, and the base ports were on an
average one hundred and fifty miles from the
assembly area. Helpful though the French
authorities were, the unfamiliar conditions made
telephone communication difficult, apart from
the danger of breach of security which it entailed.
Since many despatch riders spoke no French it
was often found that control could only be
properly maintained by personal visits; Com-
manders and their staffs were therefore forced °
to spend many hours on the road.

The dispersion dictated by the possibility of
aerial bombardment greatly increases demands
upon signal communications and transport and
thus lengthens the time which must elapse
between the issue of orders and their execution.

The Move to the Belgian Frontier.

g. On zznd September, I left Le Mans for
Amiens, Arriving at Mantes-sur-Seine, I was
handed a telegram from General s, Com-
mander of the French Front of the North-East,
which read as follows :—

“ Pour Général Commandant, B.E.F.

“ Limite envisagée prévoit front de B.E.F.
droite 4 MAULDE gauche 4 MENIN ou
gauche a AUTRYCHE -SUR-ESCAUT.
Général GEORGES désirerait avoir accord
22 Septembre.”

In the meantime, however, General Gamelin
had proceeded to London to discuss with His
Majesty’s Government the frontage which was to
be held by the British Expeditionary Force.

After I had made a reconnaissance on 24th
and 25th September of the sector which it was
proposed to allot to the British Expeditionary
Force I visited General Georges at Grand
Quartier General on 26th September, in the
company of my Chief of the General Staff,
Lieutenant-General H. R. Pownall, I then
agreed to accept the sector offered by General
Georges to the British Expeditionary Force.
This sector was from Maulde exclusive to
Halluin inclusive, and thence a defensive flank
along river Lys/Armentiéres. General Georges
placed 5zst French Division (Général de
Brigade Gillard) under my command, and I
decided to employ it in my left sector, covering
the towns of Roubaix and Tourcoing.

ro. It had been originally imtended that
formations, as soon as they had completed their
reorganisation in the assembly area, should
move to a concentration area in the North of
France, and remain there in readiness to occupy
the line not earlier than 5th October. General
Georges decided, however, that it was inadvisable
to await the arrival of the whole British Expe-
ditionary Force in ‘the concentration area and
expressed a wish that 1st Corps should move
without delay into the sector north of Maulde.
I accordingly informed General Georges that
Ist Corps would take over its sector on 3rd October
and that 2nd Corps would be able to%o into the
line about 12th October,

1st Corps began the two hundred and fifty-mile
move from the assembly area on 26th September.
Tanks, tracked vehicles, and slow moving
artillery proceeded by train and the remainder
of the force advanced on three parallel routes.
Three days were allotted for the move of each
formation. Two staging areas were arranged on
each road, south of the rivers Seine and
Somme respectively, and anti-aircraft defence
