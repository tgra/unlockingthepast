SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON.GAZETTE, 20 FEBRUARY, 1948

whole, however, it had been possible by careful
organization to evacuate a good proportion of
our reserves. The general policy which I had
approved was to create new dumps in South
Johore for issue to troops in the Johore area.
A large dump a few miles south of Segamat,
which had been established in the pre-war
period to serve both the East and the West
Coast areas, was built up. There was also
a dump of Royal Engineer material, estab-
lished for the same purpose, at Batu Anam.
The advantages of this policy were threefold
(2) It avoided further congestion on Singapore
Island; (i) it avoided traffic congestion on the
Causeway between Singapore Island and the
mainland; (1i1) it would reduce the length of
the forward carry. Accordingly dumps were
formed at Johore Bahru and near the water-
ways in South-West Johore.

317. Food,—The general food situation
remained on the whole satisfactory in spite of
the large increase in the population of Singapore
caused by the influx of refugees from the main-
Jand, and in spite of the decrease of military
reserves occasioned by the arrival of reinforc-
ing units which usually only brought a limited
quantity of foodstuffs with them.

318. Water —The water situation also up
to this time had given no serious cause for
anxiety in spite of a most unusually dry season.
After the start of hostilities new wells had been
dug round Singapore Town but about the
middle of January the digging of them had been
stopped at the instigation of the Civil Health
Authorities. Measures for strict water
economy had also been introduced. The neces-
sity for such economy was constantly kept
before the public by publicity in the Press, by
posters and by police action.

319 Ammunition.—There had been heavy
expenditure of field and light anti-aircraft
ammunition in the series of battles on the main-
land. Our stocks in these categories had never
been very satisfactory and now began to give
rise to some anxiety. Apart from this the
situation was satisfactory.

320. Petrol and Onl —As regards petrol and
lubricating oils we still had the large dumps on
Singapore Island and some smaller ones in
Johore. The civil supplies, however, were
getting low owing to the loss of their large
depots on the mainland

321 Transport.—A considerable amount of
civil transport had been requisitioned, especially
in the Northern area, to supplement military
resources. Vehicles now also became available
owing to the enforced closing of business enter-
prises. In consequence the- transport problem
at this stage presented no great difficulty.

322. Medtcal.The need for increased hos-
pital accommodation in the Johore and Singa-
pore areas now began to make itself felt. All
the hospitals in North and Central Malaya and
the large Australian Base Hospital at Malacca
had had to be cleared. The Alexandra Mili-
tary Hospital was full and some overflow
branch hospitals for the less serious cases had
been established in private houses under the
pre-war scheme. New buildings had to be
taken over. Included among these was a
wing of the large new civil hospital at Johore

323. Sick and wounded, not likely to be fit
for duty within two months, were earmarked
for evacuation ‘These, except acute cases, and
those requiring special or constant nursing,
were evacuated to the United Kingdom and
India by ordinary passenger ship. Both the
War Office and Australia had been approached
with a view to provision of hospital ship
accommodation, but owing to the needs of other
theatres of war, no final arrangements could be
made and no ship could be promised. With
the help of the Naval authorities, however, the
“Wu Sueh,’’ a Yangtze river boat of 3,400
tons and 5 feet draught, had some time pre-
viously been bought and re-designed as a hos-
pital ship She was not considered capable of
making an ocean voyage (though later she did
so) but it was the best that could be done and
it would at any rate provide transport to the
Dutch East Indies.

324. Accommodation —Accommodaton on
Singapore Island was becoming very congested.
It was clearly impracticable to prohibit the
entry of European civilians from the mainland.
It was equally impossible to prohibit the entry
of influential Asiatics whose lives would be at
stake if they fell into Japanese hands. In
consequence, though measures were taken to
prevent the mass influx of refugees from
Johore, the population of Singapore Island
increased very greatly during January.

325. Railway.—As a result of the rapid with-
drawal, great congestion had occurred on the
railway. In particular there were insufficient
sidings in the southern section of the railway
to accommodate the rolling stock. An effort
was made to solve this difficulty by building
new sidings in South Johore and on Singapore
Island where rolling stock not actually in use
could be parked. Unfortunately they were not
ready for use in time. Consequently, when the
withdrawal through Central Johore took place,
thirteen fully laden trains had to be abandoned
on the Malacca branch. Efforts to destroy
them by air attack were only partially suc-
cessful. Included in the loads of these trains
was a large consignment of maps of Singapore
Island which had been printed to a special
order by the Malayan Survey at Kuala
Lumpur: The lack of these maps was to prove
a great handicap at a later date. It is not
known what, if any, use the Japanese made
of them.

356. Docks.—The Japanese Air Force had
not yet started bombing the Docks at Singapore
and work there was proceeding normally up
to the middle of January.

327. Labour.—(See Section XXX),—There
had been little improvement in the situation
as regards civil labour. The workers still
disappeared as soon as any bombs fell near
them and usually remained absent for some
days. This applied particularly to the aero-
dromes upon which the Japanese Air Force
was now making daily attacks.

328. Man-Power.—A number of European
civilians, both official and unofficial, had now
become available for duty. Their names were
registered with the Controller of Man-Power
to whom applications were made both by the
Services and by the Civil Departments. Those
who had technical knowledge, of whom there
were many, were employed as far as possible
where their knowledge could be utilized. Some
