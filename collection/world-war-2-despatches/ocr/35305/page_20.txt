5918 -" SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, i941

Carvin, and on the following day 139th Infantry
Brigade of the same division joined the force.
On 21st May 127th Infantry. Brigade rejoined the
42nd Division and the sector from Millonfosse
to St. Amand was handed over to the Frerich.

‘Already on 2oth May, I had ordered Major-
General Curtis, Commanding 46th Division, to
take command of the sector of the canals between
Aire and Carvin. General Curtis’ force was
known as Polforce, and was to.consist of four
battalions -of 46th Division, 25th Infantry
Brigade of 50th Division {in line between La
Bassée and Carvin) and one field battery,
together with a number of engineer and other
units of G.H.Q. troops which had been moving
northwards and -:were collected on the Canal.
It had originally been intended that part of this
force should hold St. Pol, Frévent and Divion,
but the railway trains in which were the remain-
ing three battalions of 46th Division failed to
reach that town in time and remained south of
the Somme. The defence of these localities south
of the Canal had therefore to be abandoned.

Further to the north-west the defence of the
canal line was being organised by Brigadier
C. M. Usher, Commander of X Lines of Communi-
cation Sub-area, On 22nd May hereported that
the enemy had already reached the left bank of
the river Aa between Gravelines and St. Omer.
23rd Division had been ordered to move to this
area and its leading battalion (6th Green Howards)
arrived at Gravelines. Brigadier Usher therefore
held the right bank of the river from St. Omer to
Gravelines with this battalion and five batteries
of heavy artillery used as infantry, in conjuncticn
with certain French troops of the Secteur
Fortifié des Flandres. ~

The front of Macforce was covered by the
French, 3rd, 4th and 5th Corps, who were still
in their quadrilateral on the line of the Escaut
and the Sensée. Here, however, information
was frequently lacking and could only be obtained
by reconnaissance.

Thus, by 22nd May, the canal line was occupied
in the sense that the whole of the length of 85
miles from the sea at Gravelines to Millonfosse
(West of St. Amand) was divided into sectors
for each of which a British commander was
responsible. The total strength of the troops
on the Canal line did not on this day exceed
Io,000 men, and the number of anti-tank
weapons was barely adequate to cover all the
crossing places: certainly there could be no
question of being able to keep an effective
watch against small parties of infantry crossing
the canal between the bridges. The barges,
however, had almost all been moved away or
at any rate to the bank furthest from the enemy,
and bridges were fast being prepared for
demolition.

21st May—The Situation on the Belgian Front.
35. On 2ist May at 4.45 p.m. I met the three
Corps Commanders. I told them what had
happened on the southern flank and how, in
order to take the initiative and encourage the
French 1st Army to do likewise, I had gone to
the length of committing practically the whole
of my reserve. ~
* From the Corps Commanders I learned that
the line was thinly held and that attacks had
taken place at several points. At Petegem on
the front of 44th Division the enemy had secured
a bridgehead 1,000 yards deep on a front of
3,000 yards, and at the junction with the French

near Maulde on the front of rst Division a
number of enemy had crossed the river dis-
guised as refugees, but had heen detected and
driven out with the bayonet. The Corps Com-
manders all felt that they could not now hold
on for more’ than twenty-four hours. We
discussed a withdrawal to our old frontier
defences, where advantage could be taken of the
existing blockhouses and trenches, and of the
anti-tank ditch. This move would have little
effect on the French on our right since it would
pivot on the junction point, where the Escaut
crossed the frontier, but would seriously affect
the Belgians, who now held the line of the
Escaut from Audenarde to Ghent and of the
canal from Ghent to the sea at Terneuzen.

I had also to consider the pressing need to
stiffen the defence of the canal line westwards to
Gravelines and to form a new reserve to replace
the divisions now committed to counter-attacks
southward from Arras.

A provisional decision was therefore reached
to withdraw to the frontier defences on the night
of 22nd/23rd May, details being left until I had
reached agreement with the French and the
Belgians.

General Weygand had visited General Billotte
during the day and the latter indicated that an
attack was being planned for the following day
(zand May), northwards from the direction of
Roye, with the object of closing the gap. At
8 p.m. on 21st May I went to Ypres where in
the Burgomaster’s office I met H.M. the King
of the Belgians and General Billotte. There
were also present General Van Overstraeten,
General Champon, the head of the French
Mission with Belgian G.Q.G., General Pownall
and others,

T explained the situation which was developing
on the Escaut about Audenarde, and the diffi-
culty of maintaining positions there since the
water in the river was so low as no longer to
form an obstacle. It was then agreed that on
the night of 22nd/23rd May the Escaut should be
abandoned and that the Allied armies should
occupy a line from Maulde northwards to
palm, thence along the Lys to Courtrai and

ent.

I discussed the possibility of reserves. It
appeared that the available divisions of the

rench ist Army were all too tired to take part
in offensive operations in the immediate future.
It was therefore agreed that the French should
take over a further sector of the defensive
Positions northwards from Maulde, so that the
and and 48th Divisions could be withdrawn into
reserve on leaving the line of the Escaut. The .
French took up these positions on 22nd May.
On the north, 44th Division on withdrawal
from the Escaut were to hold the sector Halluin—.
Courtrai, but it was hoped that a Belgian
formation would relieve them on the night of
23rd/z4th May.

When these moves were complete the Allied
line would run slightly west of north to Halluin,
and then almost at right angles, north-eastwards
along the Lys. It was evident that sooner or
later the Belgian army would have to swing
back to a line in rear, pivoting on their right
of Halluin. Accordingly at the end of, the
conference General Billotte asked the King of
the Belgians whether if he were forced to with-
draw he would fall back on to the line of the
Yser. His Majesty agreed, though evidently
with some regret, that no alternative line existed.
