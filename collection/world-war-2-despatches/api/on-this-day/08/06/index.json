            "description": "On the 6th August I flew to Cairo from my advanced headquarters with the Eighth Army and met the Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Sir Alan Brooke, who had just arrived by air from England, and discussed the situation with them. Later the Prime Minister held a conference, at which Field Marshal Smuts, the Minister of State, General Sir Archibald Wavell and the three Commanders in Chief were among those present. The next day I accompanied the Prime Minister on a visit to the Eighth Army. After a short tour of the 30th Corps area the Prime Minister came to my advanced headquarters, where I explained to him the tactical situation in detail and my future plans, after which he met General Gott and other officers of the 13th Corps and then went back to Cairo. General Gott was killed the next day when the aircraft in which he was flying to Cairo on a few days leave was shot down. His death at an early age was a great loss to the Army, as he was an officer of much promise, whom I had already marked down as a possible Army Commander."

            "description": "Operations were continuous and continuously successful from 3rd August onwards until the final reduction of the island. On that day Centuripe fell, 13 Corps began to advance on Catania and Seventh Army began the bloody attack on Troina. 5 Division, supported by the 50th on its right, began to attack on the might 3rd/4th August and by the 5th Catama, Misterbianco, and Paterno were in our hands. Adrano still resisted but it fell to 78 Division on the mght of the 6th, together with Biancavilla in 51 Division's sector All this tume some of the fiercest and costliest fighting of the campaign was raging in and around Troina. 15 Panzer Division offered a desperate resistance lasting four days, though by the end of that period their position was becoming rather precarious, and 29 Panzer Grenadier Dhrvision offered an almost equally stubborn resistance on the coastal sector at Santa Agata and San Fratello. Troina was finally cleared on 6th August. General Patton now mounted a small amphibious operation on the north coast behind the enemy lines which was brilliantly successful and led to the capture on the 8th of Santa Agata which had been holding out against us for six days. On the southern road g Division passed through the Ist and captured Cesaro on the 8th. The next vital point north of Etna was Randazzo, the capture of which would leave the enemy with only one more lateral road across the peninsula Both g and 78 Divisions were now converging on this point, though the latter had had some hard fighting for Bronte, which it captured on 8th August. Randazzo eventually fell on the 13th and 78 Division passed into reserve. On the coast road a further German line of resistance at Capo d Orlando was turned by another seaborne hook behind it on the mght roth/1rth August These two small amphibious operations were prepared at, very short notice and were most ably executed. They were of the utmost assistance in accelerating the advance on the coastal road which was delayed by extensive demoli-"
