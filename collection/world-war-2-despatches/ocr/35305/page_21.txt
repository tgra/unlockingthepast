SUPPLEMENT vo ti LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1941

On return from the meeting, orders were issued
to implement these decisions, and that evening
I moved my command post to the Chateau de
pene midway between Armentiéres and

: ment of Boulogne.

. 36. During the 21st May the enemy penetra-
tion into the rearward areas increased and com-
munication across the Somme was finally
severed. Since the 17th May the Commander
of the Lines of Communication Area (Major-
General P. de Fonblanque) had been taking
energetic steps for its defence, in so far as it was
possible with the few and scattered troops
available.

These consisted, apart from Armoured
Division and 51st Division now returning
from the Saar, of those portions of rzth and
46th Divisions (some nine battalions in all)
which could not be despatched forward, three
unbrigaded infantry battalions and the contents
of the reinforcement depéts, together with
troops of the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps
and of the administrative services.

On 23rd May, however, the War Office
appointed Lieutenant-General: Sir Henry
‘Karslake to command the defences on the Lines
of Communication and I was not concerned in
the operations which ensued. Neévertheless,
I did not immediately abandon hope of the
Armoured Division breaking through, and I

urged the War Office to use their best endeavours.

to this end and to prevent its being used piece-
meal in local operations at the request of the
French Command.

At about 3.30 p.m. on the 21st May, I received
information that an enemy column of all arms
was approaching Boulogne. The rear element
of G.H.Q., consisting largely of the Adjutant-
General’s Branch and of headquarters of
Services, which had been serit to that town on
ryth and 18th May, had been moved to Wimereux
on zoth May as a result of enemy bombing.

* All possible steps had been taken to put
Boulogne in a state of defence with the troops
available, consisting of labour units and the
personnel of rest camps. On roth May, an
endeavour was made to bring up troops from
beyond the Somme, to hold the line of the Canche;
but the time for this was past and the troops
could not get beyond Abbeville. The hospitals
in the Etaples area were now evacuated, and on
2ist May a party of Engineers, supervised by
my Director of Works, Brigadier W. Cave-
Browne, demolished most of the bridges over
the Canche.

As soon as the news of this new threat was
received, the War Office was asked for bomber
. support, which was at once forthcoming. Enemy
tanks were located and bombed at Hesdin and
Fruges, but no good targets were obtained on
the-coast road. The War Office was also asked
to send a detachment of Royal Marines for the
defence of Boulogne but had already done

-so. Early on the 22nd May, 2oth Guards
Brigade (Brigadier W. A. F. L. Fox-Pitt) of
two battalions with an anti-tank battery
landed, thus establishing the defence of the
town and enabling those troops who were not
required for the defence to be evacuated in
good order.

By the evening of zand May, the enemy
armoured forces were within nine miles of Calais,

evacuation was carried out under the orders of
the War Office, being conapleted on the night
of 23/24th May.

The Administrative Situation,

37. During the whole of this period I had
been kept in the closest touch with the adminis-

‘trative situation by the Quarter-Master-General

(Lieutenant-General W. G. Lindsell). Up to
r6th May the administrative arrangements
whjch formed part of Plan D had worked well,
and although enemy air action steadily intensified
during the period, there was no serious inter-
ference with the maintenance of the force.

On r7th May, however, the Quarter-Master-
General decided, in view of the situation south
of Arras, to discontinue the use of the railway
from the regulating station at Abancourt via
Amiens and Arras, and to switch all traffic via
Eu and Abbeville to Béthune. He also ordered
forward every available trainload of ammunition
to the Hazebrouck area.

On roth May, directly after the C.G.S. had
spoken to the War Office as-to the possibility
of enforced withdrawal, the Q.M.G. telephoned
to the War Office to discuss the opening of new
bases. On the same day, one of his staff officers

left for London to arrange an emergency ship-

ment programme for supplies and stores to
the ports of Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk. It
was to prove’ none too soon, for the railway
at Abbeville was cut on 21st May. A new plan
had to be put into operation at once for the
maintenance of the fdrce north of the Somme,
estimated at 250,000 men and requiring a daily

lift of ammunition, supplies and petrol, of some
2,000 tons.

The petrol situation, fortunately, gave no cause
for concern since, although the dumps forward
of the Somme had been destroyed on evacuation,
together with a large civil storage plant near
Douai, there still remained a large army bulk
filling station near Lille.

The supply situation was however, bad, and
on 21st May, Corps had only three days
R.A.S.C. supplies in the forward area. Matters
tmhight, at any time, have become serious had it
not been for the success of the measures taken
between 23rd and 26th May, to organise the
supplies in Lille belonging to the Expeditionary
Force Institutes and to civilian firms.

The decision to maintain the force through
the northern ports was finally taken on 21st
May and the headquarters of a Base Sub-Area
established at Dunkirk, together with a section
of Q.M.G’s staff, in close touch with the British
and French Naval authorities.

Rail communication in the area was by now
precarious, and plans were worked out on the
basis of establishing dumps, one in each Corps
area, which could be wholly maintained by
road. The position was, by this time, greatly
complicated by the numbers of - improvised
forces which the quickly changing situation
had made necessary: most of these, like the
three divisions for pioneer duties, had no proper
administrative echelons. Some were within
reach of Corps, but others were not and these
had to be dependent on fortuitous sources of
supply, or else live for a time on the couniry.

The situation had“ grown even worse by
22nd May, when the ports at both Boulogne
and Calais were out of action, and the greater
part of the Railhead Mechanical Transport
Companies had been captured. Furthermore

9 reconnaissance of Ostend had shewn that the
