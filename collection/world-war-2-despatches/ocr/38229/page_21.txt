SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948

231. Norgroup was then using the depth to
India, and with its base organisation being
hurriedly prepared in the Calcutta area and
up the Valley of the Brahmaputra, was able
with what resources were available, to continue
a harassing scale of bombing attack in Burma
with some fighter action in the North. By the
nature of the campaign and the shortage of
warning, of aircraft, of equipment, and of
maintenance, we were unable to maintain our
2 mixed Wings in Upper Burma and Akyab.

232. In the Burma campaign the main brunt
of the fighting was borne by the P.4o Squadrons
of the A.V.G. They were the first in the field
with pilots well trained and with good fighting
equipment. Their gallantry in action won the
admiration of both services. ~

233. Accprding to the records available in
the Intelligence staff of Norgroup, 233 enemy
fighters and bombers were claimed destroyed
in the air in this campaign, of which the A.V.G.
claimed 179 and the R.A.F. 54. Fifty-eight
were claimed destroyed on the ground, 38 by
the A.V.G. and 20 by the R.A.F. Seventy-six
were claimed probably destroyed, 43 by the
A.V.G. and 33 by the R.AF. One hundredand
sixteen were claimed damaged, 87 by the
A.V G., and 29 by the R.AF.

234. From January Ist the cost in losses was
38 fighters shot down by the enemy in air
combat. Of these 16 were P.4o’s and 22
Buffaloes and Hurricanes, but the majority of
pilots were fortunately saved. I regret to
report that there were 2 substantiated incidents
when Japanese figher pilots attacked and killed
our fighter pilots while descending by
parachute.

235. As regards bombers, 8 failed to return
from operations.

1733

236. Our losses on the ground due to enemy
action were 51 aircraft, 17 fighters, 23 Blen-
heims, 4 Hudsons. The remainder were trans-
port and communication aircraft.

237. Comparable with the total of 233 enemy
fighters and bombers claimed to have been shot
down in air combat by the A.V.G. and the
R.A.F., the Allies’ losses were 46. Thus an
average of slightly more than 5 enemy aircraft
were claimed shot down for each of our air-
craft lost. é

238. ‘We destroyed more of the enemy’s air-
craft on the ground than the enemy destroyed
of ours, | We made no claim moreover in
respect of enemy aircraft destroyed on the
ground by bombing attack, the number of
which must have been considerable.

239. The bomber action in close support of
the Army has been described. Slight as the
effort was, valuable results were achieved.
‘Counter offensive bombing action to reduce the
scale of attack made an effective contribution
towards the maintenance of air superiority over
Rangoon.

240. The evacuation of R.A.F. personnel
from Burma by air and sea, with small parties
by land, was completed without loss.

241. As regards stores, much valuable equip-
ment was back loaded at the last moment from
Rangoon. The majority of stores remaining in
‘Burma were moved to the Lashio area, whence
on the sudden and unexpected Japanese thrust
in that region as much as possible was moved
into China. The remainder was destroyed
except for some large bombs which were
rendered useless.

242. The task of supporting General
Alexander’s Army terminated on May 2oth
when it was withdrawn to India. Air opera-
tions based in Eastern India continue against
the Japanese in Burma.
