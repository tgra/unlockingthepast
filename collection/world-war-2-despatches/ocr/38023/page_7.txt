SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON

against an enemy in the open sea it has been
demonstrated before, and repeated in no un-
certain fashion by this success that the ability
to strike unexpectedly is conferred by the Fleet
Air Arm.

It is often felt that this arm which has had
a long struggle with adverse opinions and its
unspectacular aircraft is underestimated in its
power. It is hoped that this victory will be
considered a suitable reward to those whose
work and faith in the Fleet Air Arm has made
it possible.
