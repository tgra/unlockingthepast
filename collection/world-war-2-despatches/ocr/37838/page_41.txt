mand, but R.A.F. Bomber Command con-
tinued to implement its extensive sea mining
programme (which now embraced ‘‘ Overlord ”’
requirements) and made heavy attacks, referred
to below, on shipping in harbours. Aircraft
of A.E.A.F. also made attacks on coastal ship-
ping and on E and R boats. After D-Day,
Second British Tactical Air Force took over
the commitment previously shouldered by
A.D.G.B. to proyide ‘‘ Channel Stop”
squadrons. The function of these squadrons
was to attack enemy surface vessels atte pting
to enter the Channel from either end. A.E.A.F.
fighters also provided escort for the strike air-
craft of R.A.F. Coastal Command. Apart from
the sea mining of R.A.F. Bomber Command,
all these operations were co-ordinated through
my headquarters.

388. Anti-U-Boat Operations.—In anticipa-
tion of an enemy attempt to move U-boats into
the invasion waters, R.A.F. Coastal Command
flew anti-submarine patrols from the Scillies to
Ushant and from St. Albans Head to Cap de
la Hague. Through these barriers the enemy
had to try to infiltrate. The first U-boats
sighted were approaching from the western en-
trance to the assault area on the night of
D-Day. Six of these U-boats were attacked.
During the next day and night, a further ten
sightings were made and seven were attacked.
Some of these attacks resulted in kills.

389. Because of these continuous patrols,
U-boat commanders were forced to remain sub-
merged for very long periods; these tactics
restricted their freedom of manoeuvre and from
P.O.W. statements, it is obvious they had a
most distressing physical effect on the crews.
During June, 80 U-boat sightings were made
in the approaches to the assault area; 46 were
attacked, 3 of these jointly with the Navy,
and 18 of the attacks appeared promising.
During July, the enemy was forced to con-
tinue maximum diving tactics. This made
detection and attacks by aircraft more difficult,
but at least two U-boats on or near the surface
were destroyed. A further 20 conning tower
or periscope sightings were made and 13 attacks
delivered. .

390. With the Allied advance in August, the
enemy began to move his U-boats away from
the ports of North-Western France to the
southern portion of the Bay of Biscay This
movement gave the aircraft of R.A.F, Coastal
Command a splendid chance to strike. 24
sightings were made in the Bay during August,
and 14 attacks resulted; six U-boats were
probably sunk, three of these shared with Naval
forces, and two more damaged. From D-Day
to 30th September, R.A.F. Coastal Command
sunk or probably sunk 12 U-boats in the
Channel or the Bay of Biscay, shared the
destruction of five more with surface forces
and damaged a further 12.

391. Anti-Shipping Operations. Attacks
against enemy surface vessels, including naval
vessels, were made by aircraft of A.E.A-F. and
by R.A.F. Coastal Command. The first of
these actions took place on the 6th June, when
the enemy endeavoured to bring into action
three heavy destroyers from the west coast of
France. These ships were attacked, west of
Brest’ by R.A.F. Coastal Command. Some

damage was caused, one was set on fire and
the ships were delayed. On 8th June, they
again attempted to move into the invasion
waters, but were met by Allied destroyers.
One was sunk, one driven ashore and the third
forced back to Brest.

392. Other attacks were made against smaller
enemy naval vessels and merchant shipping
and some of these attacks were very successful;
details of two are given below. However, not
only these missions which saw and attacked
enemy vessels should be reckoned as successful.
Continuous patrols by fighters of A.E.A.F. and
R.A.F. Coastal Command in the Western
Approaches and down into the area of the
Channel Islands ensured that no enemy surface
vessels were able to support the garrisons hold-
ing out in coastal areas. These offensive fighter
patrols were co-ordinated with the sorties of the
reconnaissance aircraft of R.A.F. Coastal
Command.

393. On the night of 7th June, Beaufighters
and Albacores attacked a formation of E-boats
in the Channel; two E-boats were sunk and a
further three damaged. In the early morning
of x5th June, a force of -42 Beaufighters,
escorted by 10 Mustangs of A.D.G.B. attacked
a north-bound convoy consisting of a merchant
vessel of 8,000 tons, a naval auxiliary of 4,000
tons and seventeén escort ships off the Frisian
Islands. The large. merchant vessel and the
auxiliary were torpedoed and sank, one mine-
sweeper blew up and sank, another was hit
by a torpedo and probably sank, while five
more minesweepers were seen on fire and four
other escorts were damaged by cannon fire.

394*. A brief summary of the work of R.A.F.
Coastal Command shows that over 200 sorties
were flown in attacks on surface craft during
the month of June in the invasion area and its
approaches. In July more than 500 aircraft
made anti-shipping attacks in the Channel area,
off the Dutch and Belgian Coasts, in the Bay of
Biscay and off the Coast of Norway. In July,
six merchant ships, 10 escort vessels and five
E/R boats were sunk, one merchant ship, IZ
escort vessels and two E/R boats were seriously
damaged, and a further seven merchant ships,
nineteen escort vessels and 6 E/R boats were
damaged. August saw an even higher scale
of shipping effort. Nightly attacks on E/R
boats operating in the Channel, five large scale
attacks off the Dutch and Norwegian coasts
and numerous attacks on the enemy in the Bay
of Biscay produced excellent results. Nine
merchant ships plus one shared, seventeen escort
vessels, 2 destroyers, and 1 E/R boat were
sunk. Eleven escort vessels and 1 E/R boat
seriously damaged and a further four merchant
ships, I destroyer, 4 E/R boats and twenty-
eight escort vessels were damaged.

395. These air operations directed against
enemy surface forces, including the protective
mine-laying by R.A.F. Bomber Command, not
only assisted the safe-guarding of the Allied
merchant fleets from surface attacks, but also
prevented any German attempt to evacuate by
sea his beleaguered coastal garrisons.

396. Attacks on Shipping in Ports.—The
majority of the E and R boats operating against
the Allied cross-channe] shipping in the early
