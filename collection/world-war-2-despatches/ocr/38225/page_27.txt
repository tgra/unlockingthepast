SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 4 MARCH, 10948

Assault by H.M.S, Anthony and R.M. Detach-
ment from H.M.S. Ramuillies.

30. Rear Admiral Syfret had agreed to the
direct assault by a destroyer with 50 Royal
Marines from the Ramiullies.

Orders reached this detachment at about
1430 hrs. and three-quarters of an hour later
they embarked in H.M.S. Anthony which then
proceeded at high speed around the Cap
D’Embre to reach the entrance to the harbour
in time for Zero. Sometime about 2000 hrs.
H.M.S Anthony came under fire from the bat-
teries guarding the entrance of the harbour
which she returned with all weapons. By Zero
she was alongside the quay and the Royai
Marines disembarked under fire from the town,
and dockyard. Good luck also attended this
venture. Expecting to meet the Commandos,
she mistook a blue flashing ght for their recog-
nition signal, but saw the error just in time and
went alongside stern first. A French 75 mm.
manned by a Capitaine Clavel failed to register
a hit, a fact that this officer still disbelieves.
The dockyard was still burning and it was diffi-
cult to do much more to create a diversion
there. The detachment therefore’ advanced
into the town, occupied the Artillery HQ and
started some fires in the area. Leaving a guard
at Artillery HQ, it continued to advance and
arrived at the Naval barracks where it was fired
upon. After some grenades had been thrown,
a large number of prisoners headed by the Com-
mandant of the barracks surrendered and
British prisoners found in these barracks were
released. The detachment was now fully occu-
pied dealing with the very numerous prisoners
antil contact was made with the British troops,
2 Royal Welsh Fusiliers, who had entered the
town from the South.

This attack added greatly to the ease with
which the final occupation was carried out and
assisted in the avoidance of street fighting, in
which casualties might have piled up and the
town been severely damaged.

COMPLETION OF THE OPERATION—7TH May—D3

31. I entered Antsirane shortly after daylight
and took over from Brigadier Festing. All
resistance had ceased in the town, but the two
forts were still holding out and firing at traffic
on the roads between them. My next urgent
problem was to capture the Orangea or Anko-
tika Peninsula, which was still preventing the
Navy from entering the harbour, I had orgin-
ally itended that 29 Independent Brigade
should continue with this task when 17 Infantry
Brigade had captured the town, As, however,
29 Independent Brigade were fully occupied in
the town, I decided that the 17 Infantry
Brigade Group should do it. I therefore sent
orders to Brigade HQ., which was now just
South of the native village, to commence the
advance to Orangea as soon as possible, and
placed the remaining tanks under its command.
Brigadier Tarleton reported that the head of
his column could pass Bellevue fort at 1200
hours. I therefore arranged for a preliminary
Naval and Air bombardment of enemy positions
on the peninsula to take. place between 1000
and 1200 hours; and for Naval supporting fire
to be controlled by Forward Observation

Officers for the advance of the brigade into the ‘

peninsula. This advance was also to be assisted
by all available air support. ~

Meanwhile Lieutenant-Colonel H. C. Stock-
well commanding 2 Royal Welsh Fusihers, and
Lieutenant-Colonel B. H. Hanaut, had made
contact with French officers, who conducted
them to the garrison commanders in_ the
Orangea pemnsula, with a view to negotiating a
surrender. As soon as I heard of this, I asked
for the bombardment to be countermanded, but
a few rounds were fired before the message got
through. It was a tense moment. The Royal
Navy and the Fleet Air Arm were straining at
the leash to give all they had got to Orangea
peninsula, and with the opening of the bom-
bardment by the Ramilhes I fully expected
everybody on both sides to join in.

Fortunately the cease fire signal got through
quickly and negotiations continued. At the same
time negotiations for the surrender of Caimays
fort were opened by the French with the troops
in contact with it.

From marked maps which were now in my
hands, I was able to see that the French had
prepared positions facing South and protecting
the Orangea peninsula from land attack. Before
reaching these, 17 Infantry Brigade Group, -had
first to capture Fort Bellevue, and then to
overcome an enemy post at Anbatolamba, where
the road around French Bay passes through a
very narrow bottleneck, The total distance to
be marched to Orangea Pomt was about 12
miles by a very bad road. I was most anxious
to arrange a surrender of the garrison of this
peninsula, as I foresaw that an operation to
capture it might last for several days (and
probably entail at least 300 casualties) especially
in view of the limited support which was avail-
able and the difficulties of supply with hmited
transpoit from the now distant Blue beach.

In order to avoid recurrence of fighting while
negotiations were in progress, I ordered 17
Intantry Bmgade not to advance past fort
Bellevue. 13 Infantry Bngade however was
moved up from Blue beach, sending a detach-
ment to take ovei the airport, and the remain-
der of the bmgade concentrating East of
Anamakia. By about 1400 hours the surrender
of Bellevue and Ambatolambo had been
arranged; 17 .Infantry Brigade therefore
advanced to a position about 2 miles South of
the enemy defences in the Orangea Peninsula.
It paid honours of war to’ the garrison of
Bellevue and Ambatolambo as they passed.
By the evening, I had been able to make
arrangements for the final advance to Orangea
to take place at o7oo hours the next day,
May 8th. H.M.S. Ramilhes entered harbour
just before dark and I went on board to dis-
cuss arrangements for final surrender. Arrange-
ments were made for a meeting with the three
senior French officers, Colonel Claerebout
(Officer Commanding Defences, Diego Suarez),
Capitaine de Vaisseau Maerten (Naval Officer
in Charge, Madagascar), Capitaine de Vaisseau
Simon (ex Commanding Officer of French
sloop D’Entrecasteaux) all now prisoners of war,
on board the flagship at ogr5 hours 8th May.
This was to be followed by a conference on
shore about 1015 hours with certain other
French officials.

It was not easy. Claerebout and Maerten
had only surrendered in person, and the Garri-
son Commander with whom the armistice was
arranged was Colonel Rouves. Therefore the
terms that I had arranged with Colonel Rouves
affected only the troops that were still fighting
and not those who had already surrendered.
