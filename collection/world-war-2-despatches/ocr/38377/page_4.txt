German markings

A very heavy, determined and skilful dive
bombing attack developed on the fleet, mamly
directed on ILLUSTRIOUS, and lasting for
some ten minutes.

ILLUSTRIOUS was hit by six heavy bombs,
and hauled out of line heavily on fire and with
her steering gear out of action, but with her
armament still in hvely action.

WARSPITE sustained slight damage to her
starboard bower anchor and hawsepipe. -

At least two enemy aircraft were seen to bi
shot down by gunfire.

30. ILLUSTRIOUS reported that she was
“badly hit’? and making for Malta; but it
was not until 1530 that she was got under
control and steering steadily for Malta at 17
knots. In the meantime she was turning circles
while the battlefleet was manceuvred to main-
tain supporting distance from her. HASIY
and JAGUAR were detached to screen her.

31. ILLUSTRIOUS’s aircraft in the air (8
Swordfish and 5 Fulmars) had in the meantime
been ordered to Malta and all arrived with the
exception of one Swordfish and one Fulmar, the
crew of the Swordfish and pilot of the Fulmar
being picked up. The air gunner of the
Fulmar was killed.

32. Between 1600 and 1700, a second attack
developed on ILLUSTRIOUS and the battle-
fleet by about 20 aircraft. ILLUSTRIOUS’s
Fulmars, who had been refuelled at Malta, were
able to intervene and shot down 6 or 7 JU.87s,
‘damaging others. The attack on the battleflect
‘was mostly concentrated on VALIANT who had
one killed and two wounded from splinters.

33. ILLUSTRIOUS passed Filfla at 1730,
making good 17 knots, though the fire was still
burning at this time. .

34. ILLUSTRIOUS was met in the swept
channel by a tug from Malta and arrived safely
at 2145.

35. In the meantime, GALLANT and escort-
ing forces were making good 6} knots, thar
Position at 1600 being 36° 11’ N., 12° 56’ E.
The convoy movements proceeded according to

Convoy M.E.6 was at ths time making good
94 knots.

36. The Commander-in-Chief with Force A
then proceeded to the eastward without further
incident, passing through position 3%? 40’ N.,
14° 10’ E. at 1800, and 35° 18’ N., 13° 35’ E.

39. At 1500, C.S 3,* who had left GALLANT
off Malta at 0500, reported that SOUTHAMP-

AMPTON was making good a course of 105°
at 22 knots. .

At 1605, C.S.3 reported that SOUTHAMP-
TON was stopped in position 34° 54’ N., 18°

40. Course was therefore altered to 210° at
1630 to close C.S.3, and at 1645 ORION,
PERTH, JERVIS and JANUS were detached
to his assistance. Owing to lack of fuel, JUNO
and NUBIAN were detached tojoin the convoy
and (HERO joined the fleet screen. MOHAWK

-and GRIFFIN, who had seen GALLANT safely

into Malta, were sailed by Vice-Admiral, Malta,
at 1700, to close C.S 3 at high speed

SOUTHAMPTON saw little prospect of getting

the fires over the engine room and ‘X’
magazine under control, and at 1906 that he
was forced to abandon ship and would sink
her. The Commander-in-Chief approved this
action and at 2100, when in position 35° 12’
N., 19° 44’ E., course was altered to 100° to
reach rendezvous for all forces at sea in posi-
tion 34° 40’ N., 23° 10’ E. at 0800/12.

N., 20° 50’ E., Convoy M.E.54 parted from
Convoy “Excess ’’ to pass south of Crete,
‘* Excess ’’ proceeding through the Elaphonisos
Channel.

43. CS 3 later reported that the first attack
was carried out by 12 or more dive bombers
and was a complete surprise from the sun
in the clear blue sky. The speed of advance
of the squadron at the time was 24 knots.
The attack was well pressed home in spite
of gunfire from both ships. High Jevel bomb-
ing attacks continued intermittently until
about 1630 and the squadron was shadowed
until sunset.

GLOUCESTER’s forward 6-inch director
was damaged by an unexploded bomb through
the roof of the director tower. One aircraft
was unserviceable from machine-gun bullets;
the other was in the air at_ the
time and force-landed near DIAMOND
