Having repulsed further attacks on Zafraan during the day, they withdrew during the night with the survivors of the st Army Tank Brigade, the partner of their successes, and reached the frontier in the early hours of the 2nd December, exhausted but in good heart. At the same time the rst South African Infantry Brigade was ordered to abandon the attempt to recapture Point 175. During the night they retired southwards to Taieb el Essem, leaving a rearguard to mask Point 175 until the New Zealanders had passed in safety."

Tiddim itself fell on 18th October, and the way was now open for a double thrust towards Kalemyo from the west and north. Japanese resistance in the Kennedy Peak area, albeit grim, proved no match for the experienced Allied troops and the accompanying air bombardment, and Kalemyo fell on 15th November.
