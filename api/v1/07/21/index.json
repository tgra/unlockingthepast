            "description": "Just before dusk on the 21st July the -16zst Indian Infantry Brigade and the 5th and 6th New Zealand Infantry Brigades advanced along the Ruweisat Ridge and to the south of it with the object of opening a way for our armoured forces to break through. The attack was pre- ceded and supported by very heavy artillery fire and aerial bombardment. At the same time supporting and diversionary attacks were made on either flank. In the north the oth Australian Division attacked north-westwards from, Tel el Eisa and southwards towards Tel el Makh- Khad with the object of improving their posi- tions and of exploiting to the south, while the ist South African Division was directed on Miteiriya. At the same time the 69th Infantry Brigade, temporarily attached to the 7th Armoured Division, attacked enemy positions on the Taga plateau in the south."

A request from Allied Force Headquarters for assistance was met by the despatch of 2,970 vehicles by road from Egypt in the six weeks after 21st July."

            "description": "264. At the beginning of February the Yugoslav Army in the Middle East consisted of a headquarters, one battalion and a depot. The ibattalion came under command of the roth Indian Division (25th Indian Infantry Brigade) on 21st July 1943, and moved to Ar Rama; it has remained under command ever since. By October the battalion, fully equipped and up to strength, had reached a high stan- dard of training and was included in the Order of Battle for operations in the Aegean."

            "description": "18. Both the L.S.T. (2)|| and the L.C.I. (L) proved invaluable in their respective roles, and it is considered that the speed with which both vehicles and personnel were landed was one of the principal factors of the operation from the naval point of view. Although at times the. rate at which stores were unloaded appeared to be disappointing, the totals unloaded for the beaches were, in fact, greater than the planned figures. On 21st July 4,400 tons of stores were discharged at Bark SouTH. This was of course an exceptionally good beach, and by that time the organisation there had been perfected and three beach groups were assisting, but the previous estimates for beach maintenance would seem to need revision. It appears that neither Bark SoutH nor BarK East were worked to capacity during \u201cHusky\u201d. The salient feature of this period was the success of the L.S.T. (2), L.C.I. (L) and the D.U.K.W.\u00a2 of which the latter were making their first appearance in European waters: they fulfilled our highest expectations."

            "description": "104. Still, it was encouraging that the per- formance of the guns had improved at all during a week which had begun witha major upheaval and afforded little time for the gunners to get used to their new positions, As. for the decline in the performance of \u2018the fighters, this was no more than I had expected. I was not disheartened. Thanks to the energy and skill of the operational and adminisirative staffs of all Services concerned, the change from the old system to the new had been made with- out any serious setback. The machine had been brought safely to its new position. It was in running order, as witness, for example, the bringing down of sixty bombs between sun- set on the 2oth and sunset on the 21st July.* Already the gunners were showing that they knew how to make good use of their opportu- nities. I felt that one of my main tasks must now be to ensure that the forces directly under my command were made thoroughly familiar with their part in the new plan."

This decision entailed the sur- render of our forward landing grounds in the Sidi Barrani area, which would mean that our ability to provide fighter protection to our shipping engaged in maintaining Tobruk would be greatly impaired. As our armoured forces were relatively weak, this risk had to be accepted. \u2018"
