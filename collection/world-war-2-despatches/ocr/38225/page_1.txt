THURSDAY,

THE CAPTURE OF DIEGO SUAREZ

The following Despatch was submitted to the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on
the 16th June, 1942, by Rear-Admiral E, N.
Syfret, C.B., Flag Officer Commanding, Force
Office of Flag Officer Commanding,

Force “ F,”

16th June, 1942.

Be pleased to lay before the Board the
accompanying report on the capture of Diego
Suarez, which covers the period when the first
convoy left Durban until the entry of the Fleet
into Diego Suarez on 8th and 9th May, 1942.

2. In view of the detailed nature of the
operation orders and observing that the opera-
tions were carried out almost exactly as laid
down therein, I have purposely phrased my
report in broad terms, sufficient to give a
connected and general story, and stressing cer-
tain salient factors and incidents.

3. I have not made any mention of the
operations of the Army, as these will be
reported by Major-General R. G. Sturges, C.B.,
Royal Marines, who was in command of Force
12x under me, but I wish here to place on
record the excellent relations that existed
throughout the operation between the Royal
Navy, the Army and the South African Air
Force.

Co-operation at all times between the Services
was most cordial, and to this must be attributed
a great measure of the success of the enterprise.

4. I also wish to record the excellent manner
in which H.M. Ships, Royal Fleet Auxiliaries,
and Ships of the Merchant Navy, carried out
their tasks. The enthusiasm and efficiency
shown by Captains, Officers and Ships’ Com-
panies were most gratifying.

Few refetences will be found in this report to
the work performed by the Corvettes since the

4 MARCH, 1948

nature of their duties was not so spectacular
as that of other umts. But throughout, and
subsequent to, the operation, whether provid-
ing A/S* protection or ferrying troops and
stores, they carmed out their duties in fine
spirit, and most efficiently.

(Signed) E. N. SYFRET,
Rear-Admiral.

SECTION I

Duran To DISPERSAL FOR FinaL APPROACH
TO COURRIER Bay.

The slow convoy comprising eight Motor
Transport ships, tankers and the tank landing
ship sailed from Durban in accordance’ with
programme on 25th April, escorted by DEVON-
SHIRE (Captain R. D. Oliver), two low endur-
anee destroyers, 14th M/Sf{ Flotilla and 3rd
Escort Group. ANTHONY, delayed by
defects, sailed later to overtake the convoy,
as did CITY. OF HONG KONG, who had not
arrived in time to sail with the convoy. She
sailed the following day escorted by two cor-
vettes.

2. The passage of the convoy proceeded
according to plan, but time had to be
“‘ wasted ’’ owing to considerable favourable
currents being ,experienced.

3. On 28th April, the fast convoy comprising
the five assault ships, and three transports carry-
ing personnel, and escorted by RAMILLIES
(wearing my Flag), ILLUSTRIOUS, HER-
MIONE, and six destroyers, sailed from
Durban.

4. The General Officer Commanding, Major-
General Sturges, Royal Marines, and three of
his Staff, together with Colonel Melville, South
African Air Force, and two Staff Officers, em-
barked in my Flagship.
