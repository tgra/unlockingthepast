            "description": "To supply the large quantities of water now required, I ordered a pipeline to be laid between Alexandria and the forward area. I also gave instructions for the water sources at Fuka and Buq Bug to be developed. The orders for the construction of the pipeline and the development of the water source at Fuka were given on the 6th September, and on the 11th November the new water-point was opened sixty-five miles west of Matruh. A strict water ration of three-quarters of a gallon a day per man and vehicle had to be imposed in order to leave enough water to fill the new pipelines and storage tanks. In the space of two months, in spite of many difficulties, one hundred and forty-five miles of pipe had been laid and filled, and ten large reservoirs and seven new pumping stations had- been built. Adequate supplies of water were then available without in any way interfering with the transport of supplies.",

Godwin-Austen had taken command in place of Lieutenant-General BeresfordPeirse, became the headquarters of the 13th Corps.",

            "description": "My infantry strength was the greatest we had yet put in the field, but a high proportion had had no previous battle experience and would require a great deal of training. I could not make a start on this programme until 6th September but thereafter all formations, whether they were withdrawn into rear areas or kept in the line, underwent intensive training im which the features of terrain and the conditions of fighting they were likely to encounter were as far as possible reproduced. Groups of all arms who were to fight together were trained together. Special attention was given to physical fitness, the maintenance of direction by night, the contro! of movement, minehftiag and the use of wireless. We had also been strongly reinforced in artillery, on which I intended to rely heavily for the positional battle which lay ahead. Apart from seven extra field regiments which constituted the divisional artillery of 8 Armoured and 44 and 51 Infantry Divisions, two medium regiments and six additional field regiments also arrived from the United Kingdom and were placed under command of the Eighth Army during September and early October. I also received replacements for losses which enabled me to bring existing units up to strength.",

I ordered the resumption of the Second Army advance from the Antwerp Brussels area for 6th September, and by 11th September a bridgehead was established over the Meuse Escaut Canal. It was already noticeable that the enemy was beginning to recover his balance, so that the urgency of launching the thrust to the Rhine was underlined.",

In the period immediately following the surrender, the Germans were in no position to undertake seaborne operations, owing ito the lack of shipping, escort vessels and landing craft, which they had to obtain from the Italians or transfer from other areas. By the middle of September, however, they had collected enough craft to despatch raiding forces to the Cyclades to evacuate the Italian garrisons and such food",

With the arrival of large enemy air reinforcements from France and the Russian front and the proved inefficiency of the A.A. defences of Leros, as shewn by the sinking of H.M.S. INTREPID (Commander C. A. de W. Kitcat, R.N.) and H.H.M.S. QUEEN OLGA in Leros harbour on 26th September, operations of our surface forces in the Aegean were restricted to sweeps during the dark hours with forces who retired to the south-eastward to obtain fighter cover from Cyprus during the day. On 1st October all available Fleet destroyers were sailed to Malta as escort to H.M. Ships HOWE and KING GEORGE V, leaving us with the Hunts whose speed and endurance made it difficult for them to operate far into the Aegean and still be clear by daylight. As a result, H.M.S. ALDENHAM (Lieutenant-Commander J. I. Jones, D.S.O., D.S.C., R.N.R.), H.H.M.S. MIAOULIS (Commander C. Nikitiades) and H.H.M.S. THEMISTOCLES (Lieutenant-Commander N.  Sarris, R.H.N.) who were patrolling off Kaso Strait on the night of the 2nd/3rd October, were short of fuel and in no position to take action on an aircraft report of an enemy convoy sighted off Naxos and believed on all available intelligence to be bound for Rhodes. They were ordered to withdraw to Alexandria for fuel. This convoy, in fact, carried an invasion force which was landed on Kos at 0500 on October 3rd and captured the island in spite of stubborn resistance from the British battalion, who received small assistance from the Italian garrison.",

The attacks on Brest between 24th August and 6th September were shared by the United States Eighth and Ninth Air Forces and R.A.F. Bomber Command. More than 6,000 tons of bombs were dropped on the garrisons of this city. The attacks on Le Havre, Boulogne and Calais were R.A.F. Bomber Command operations, and provided excellent examples of reduction of a town by air bombing. This was especially so in the case of Le Havre. The Allied casualties in the against a strongly fortified garrison of 11,000 defenders totalled only 400. Between 1st and r2th September, 2,042 sorties were flown against Le Havre alone and 11,000 tons of bombs were dropped, 5,000 tons of this total being aimed in one massive daylight attack on an extremely small area.",

An estimate prepared for me on 6th September showed that by the end of the month we should have available in the Mediterranean one armoured and eleven infantry divisions and an airborne brigade; this figure did not include the divisions due to return to the United Kingdom but included one division earmarked for operations against the Dodecanese.* By 1st January this figure should have risen to twenty infantry divisions, five armoured divisions and possibly one airborne division. I must emphasise, however, that this was the total for the whole theatre and out of it must be deducted the four divisions required for the garrison of the Middle East and North Africa and the forces intended and promised for the support of Turkey if that country should enter the war.t Our position is therefore clearer if we contrast these forces not merely with the nineteen German divisions already in Itaiy but with the fifty-odd in the Mediterranean theatre from South France to the Balkans.",
