SUPPLEMENT’ f0 tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

I now foresaw that, if the Japanese advanced
into Perak, their communications would become
very vulnerable to raids from the sea coast. I
therefore arranged for a small force of about 50
picked Australians to be organized for sea-
borne raids on the enemy’s communications,
using Port Swettenham as a base.

SecTION XXIII.—Tue STRATEGICAL SITUATION,
I7TH-23RD DECEMBER, IQ4I.

195. Naval.—Following the loss of the ‘‘Prince
of Wales ’’ and “ Repulse ’’ the seagoing naval
forces based on Singapore consisted only of a
few light cruisers and half a dozen destroyers
and sloops. Most of these were employed on
escort work, leaving only three destroyers and
a number of auxiliary vessels and small craft
for local defence. ‘

On the 17th December the Perak Flotilla,
which consisted of H.M.S. ‘‘ Scout ’’ and some
light craft, was formed to deny to all enemy
craft the approaches to the West Coast be-
tween the River Krian and the River Bernam
(south of Telok Anson).

The submarines of the Royal Dutch Navy,
which during the first few days had operated
successfully in the waters east of Malaya, had
had losses and only a very few now remained.

The Japanese Navy had so far confined its
activities to protection of its convoys. Although
it held undisputed control of the waters east
of Malaya it had as yet made no attempt to
interfere with our communications south or
west of Malaya either by naval or air action.

196. Airy.—The main concern of the Japanese
Air Force was obviously to confirm and extend
the superiority which it had already established.
Apart therefore from the heavy attacks on
Penang and a few attacks on targets in the
battle area, its activities continued to be
directed against our aerodromes.

The strength of our Air Force, including the
Dutch reinforcements, was now a little over 100
—probably about one quarter of the Japanese
strength. .

In accordance with the agreed policy, the
bulk of the fighters were retained on the Singa-

pore aerodromes for defence of the Singapore -

Base and for convoy protection work. The
balance were under command of Norgroup for
operations in the 3 Corps area.

The Dutch bombers were, for reasons already
given, being used principally for reconnaissance
work. The torpedo-bombers, with their limited
radius of action, were retained for attack on
any naval force which might approach Singa-
pore or the east coast of Johore. As regards
the possibility of reinforcements, the Japanese
had cut the established air route between Singa-
pore and India. It now became necessary to
use the Dutch aerodrome at Sabang, an island
off the northern tip of Sumatra, as a link in
the air route, but this could only be used by
the longer range type of aircraft. Fighters
could only be brought by sea.

In order to provide accommodation for the
large number of aircraft which it was hoped
would shortly concentrate in the Singapore area,
the construction of new aerodrome strips was
put in hand, both in South Johore and on
Singapore Island.

T felt that the recovery of air superiority
was so vital that I agreed to give priority to
the Air Force so far as labour was concerned
for the construction of these new air strips and
for the maintenance of the existing aerodromes.

There was no way of regaining air superiority
unless and until a sufficient number of modern
fighters, superior to the Japanese fighters,
could be brought to Malaya and until their
pilots could have time to develop full fighting
efficiency in conditions that would be strange
to them, The first of these fighter aircraft
could not be expected to reach Malaya in.
much under four weeks.

197. Army.—Our troops who had been in
contact with the enemy had suffered severe
losses both in men and material. Our strength
on the west coast, apart from the Volunteer
umits, was now barely one division, including
the 12 Indian Brigade Group and ist Line
Reinforcements. Against’ this the Japanese
probably had in the front line one division
moving on the axis of the main road and one
division on the Grik road, Behind these we
estimated that they had in reserve and already
landed further forces at least equal to those
in the front line,

On the east coast the enemy had landed
one division in the Kelantan area.

In Indo-China he undoubtedly held reserves,
which he could either use to reinforce those
formations which had already landed or for
fresh enterprises.

The striking power of his field force was
greatly mcreased by the inclusion of a compo-
nent of modern tanks of which we had none.

198. On our side we knew that every en-
deavour would be made to send reinforcements
to Malaya, but we also knew that no rein-
forcements could arrive before some time in the
first half of January. The comparison of forces
as above showed clearly that we must make
every endeavour to ensure the safe arrival of
these reinforcements, for it was only with their
assistance that we could hope to turn the scales
on land. One of the chief dangers to which
convoys bringing reinforcements would be ex-
posed was from attack by Japanese aircraft
as they were approaching Singapore... If the
Japanese could establish their fighters on the
aerodromes in Central Malaya they would be
able to give their bombers much more effec-
tive support and thus render their attacks more
dangerous. It was clear therefore that we
should make every endeavour to deny these
aerodromes to them for ‘as long as possible.

rg9. On the west coast the terrain in the
State of Perak was, generally speaking, more
suitable for delaying action than was that in
the States of Selangor and Negri Sembilan
further south. In the latter States were many
more roads to facilitate the enemy’s move-
ments, while the vast rubber estates rendered
movement off the roads easy for infantry and
at the same time provided good cover for the
attacker The States of Perak and Selangor
also were the centre of the tin-mining industry
which was at that time of such vital importance
to the Allied war effort. There were also vast
tubber estates in this area.

The weakness of the Perak area from the de-
fence point of view Jay in the fact that the long
road and rail communications lay roughly
parallel to the River Perak. Consequently if
enemy detachments could get a footing on the
left bank of that river they would be able to
harass and temporarily to interrupt our com-
munications,
