SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 MAY, 1948

g. Two ships (of about 2,000 tons each) under
way, were attacked by, it is thought five air-
craft. Both ships were on fire when last seen.
nothing was seen of the attacks made by the
last three aircraft. Five out of the eight air-
craft of this squadron were lost.

10. ‘It is hoped that further damage was done
by the aircraft which did not return, but ob-
servation was most difficult for all aircraft on
account of the fighter interference.

General remarks.
11. The enemy reconnaisance aircraft sighted

-Porce ‘“P’’ at the most unfortunate moment, -

s it was too late.to call off the attack and yet
Save the enemy plenty of time to prepare for
the arrival of the striking force. With all
chance of surprise gone, and with a cloudless
sky, heavy casualties were inevitable, yet the
attack was pressed home with great determina-
tion and gallantry and I consider that the con-
duct of all who took part is deserving of the
highest praise. :

12, From a military point of view the attack
was a failure as we lost eleven Albacores and
two Fulmars and had eight Albacores damaged,
while we shot down two M.E.110s, one M.E.
Iog, one JU.87, probably one M.E.110 and one
M.E.109 and damaged one JU.87. 'We also
obtained hits with two torpedoes on BREMSE
and at least one each on two Merchant Ships
and probably one each on two more Merchant
Ships. It is a pity that there were not more
torpedo targets. “#

13. The fact that the Fighter Squadron
climbed to 1,000 feet before reaching the

3177

Ribachi peninsula might have led to their being
detected by the enemy’s R.D.F. and so giving
away surprise. In the event, due to Force
““P” having already been sighted, I do not
ook it mattered. It was none the less a mis- -
take,

14. It is interesting to note that the Germans
used all types of aircraft to engage our attack-
ing force. it is reported by our aircraft crews
that the JU.87s were armed with extra machine
guns and possibly with cannon as well. It is .
much to the credit of the crews of our Fulmars
that they shot down three enemy aircraft of
superior types for the loss of only two Fulmars.

15. Should it be found necessary on a future
occasion to carry out a similar attack, ie. one -
where complete surprise is unlikely and where
lack of reconnaisance leaves both the strength
of the defence and the number of targets in
doubt, it is suggested that,there would be better
chances of success by using a smaller force of ‘
T.S.R.s and a large force of fighters.

16. It was arranged to refuel the Hurricanes
in VICTORIOUS while the striking force was
away. Two of them would mot start after
refuelling and had to be kept on deck. The
resulting congestion caused a delay in the land-
ing-on programme just at the time when (but
for lack of initiative) the German bombing
attack should have developed. Thus this delay
might have had serious consequences.
