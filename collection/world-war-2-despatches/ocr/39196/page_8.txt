31. However, by the end of the month, the
enemy was in retreat, and food and munitions
were available to speed his withdrawal. The
threat to India and to the China life-line had
been removed, and a grim defence, sustained
solely by air supply, was becoming a vigorous
offensive, whose progress was also fed from
the air. From July until November, 33 Corps
fought its way eastwards to the Chindwin,
southwards along the Kabaw valley and down
the Tiddim Road, provided entirely with
munitions and food by our transport squadrons.
Until the end of the monsoon, supply was
carried out under conditions of unbelievable
difficulty. In July the commander of 33 Corps
sent the following signal to No. 194 Squadron:
“Your unflagging efforts and determination
to complete your task in spite of appalling
flying conditions are worthy of the highest
praise.” In August, another squadron sum-
marised its efforts as follows:—“It has taken
on occasion six to seven days of battling
through torrential rain, strong winds and
10/10ths cloud down to 200 feet to achieve
one mission, but it has been done.”

52. In August and September it was becom-
ing clear that the planning and day-to-day
control of air supply operations required an
organisation separate from Third Tactical Air
Force, whose responsibility air supply opera-
tions had been since the dissolution of Troop
Carrier Command. This was rendered all the
more necessary by the large part that it was
proposed airborne operations should play in
the coming dry season. Thus, in October,
Combat Cargo Task Force (C.C.T.F.), an inte-
grated U.S.A./British Headquarters, was
formed and became responsible for the day-to-
day control and the planning of air transport
operations in support of Fourteenth Army and
15 Corps.

53. One of the first measures undertaken by
H.Q.C.C.T.F. was the reorganisation of the
allocation of tasks, whose importance when
demand is always outrunning supply cannot be
stressed too strongly. The original procedure
had been that, prior to the beginning of each
month, Fourteenth Army submitted to Third

Tactical Air Force its planned air supply re- ©

quirements, which were based on the assump-
tion that the Army’s advance in the various
sectors would invariably be strongly opposed.
Consequently, demands were always high and
supplies were occasionally fifty per cent. below
the planned figure but withal more than suffi-
cient for current requirements. The Rear Air-
field Maintenance Organisation (R.A.M.O.)
received its day’s tasks direct from the head-
quarters of the Corps which it was supplying,
and at the same time asked the Air Forces for
the requisite number of aircraft. If, as often
happened, the Army’s daily requirements ex-
ceeded the air resources available, considerable
confusion resulted, since no proper system of
allocating priorities had been evolved.

54, This problem was solved by forming, along-
side C.C.T.F., the Combined Army-Air Trans-
port Organisation (C.A.A.T.O.) which received
and collated daily requests, assessed their urgency
and, having a full knowledge of aircraft states,
allotted the tasks accordingly. The organisa-
tion was thus more in line with current Euro-
pean practice, with two notable exceptions, the
lack of signals and telephone communications

was such as to clog any air supply machinery
no matter how well-planned, and second,
there were crippling deficiencies of el in
such ancillary bodies as Staging Posts and
Casualty Air Evacuation Units.

55. On December 20th, the first strip for
landing-on of supplies was opened at Indaing-
gale. Others followed in quick succession,
Taukkyan near Kalemyo, Kawlin and Indaw
trans-Chindwin as soon as the river had been
crossed, and Kan in the Myittha Valley where
4 Corps had returned to the line, replacing
the Lushai Brigade and representing another
and growing commitment to our transport
forces.

56. Thus, by January, the increasing de-
mands of mobile warfare, which did not accord
with the plans on which resources had been
allotted and organisation developed, and the
engagement of larger forces, witnessed a
gradual and sustained rise in the demands of
Fourteenth Army for air supply. Many un-
foreseen difficulties were now coming to light,
and when the Supreme Commander visited the
forward areas he was informed that the Air
Forces were not carrying enough supplies.
C.-in-C. A.L.F.S.E.A. circulated a memoran-
dum calling for more resources in transport
aircraft, without which, he stated, not only
would the advance to Mandalay and beyond
be arrested, but due to the impossibility of
supplying forces in front of the roadhead he
might be forced to withdraw beyond the Chind-
win for the monsoon. This view of the situa-
tion (which in my opinion was unduly
pessimistic) caused an urgent request to the
Chiefs of Staff for additional transport squad-
rons, and as a result Nos. 238 and 267 Squad-
rons atrived in March. Actually a better organi-
sation of existing ground transport resources
would have met every commitment, and for
this reason Air Marshal Garrod undertook a
tour to investigate the working of the system.

57. It is as well here to outline, for the sake
of comparison, the working of air supply in the
N.C.AC. area, to which but little reference has
so far been made.

58. The most striking feature of this organi-
sation was the high standard of co-operation
achieved by all agencies con¢erned—N.C.A.C.,
Service of Supply, Tenth Air Force, Air Ser-
vice Command and ail ancillary formations.
Collective responsibility for the task of aid
supply was rated higher than service allegiance ;
each body trusted the ability of the others to
carry out their part of the work and did not
attempt to dictate on matters outside its own
sphere. The second great advantage was the
abundance of good signal communications ;
every link in the chain, organisational, supply,
squadrons, co-ordinators, being linked by a

- teletype and telephone network which allowed

of a quick dissemination of the next day’s tasks
and priorities as allotted by the collating agency
in N.C.AC., and of speedy re-adjustment if
necessary.. A last-minute change in location
of a Dropping Zone could be signalled back
by a Division and retransmitted to an aircraft
already airborne for another objective. More-
over, the packing and loading processes were
organised on a moving-belt principle whose
