During the next two days these troops managed to break through the enemy and reachel El Alamein, though they lost heavily in the process and had to be withdrawn to the Delta to reorganise and refit. Meanwhile, the r3th Corps on the southern flank fought desperately and with some success to stem the enemy’s advance. The enemy lost no time in following up our ‘withdrawal from Matruh, and on the 1st July Jaunched an attack against the 1st South",

            "description": "At about this time the 4th Indian Division relieved the 5th Indian Division in the island, and Major-General Tuker finally reorganised its defences. The basic principle of the defence was that the air forces on the island should be kept in full operation. It was not considered possible to prevent the enemy getting a foothold at some point on the coastline, and the main effort of the defence was therefore to be concentrated on protecting the landing grounds in the central plain. For the same reason all important depots and installations were sited inland wherever feasible. As large a proportion of the garrison as possible was to be made mobile so that it might operate against enemy landings. Instructions laying down these principles were issued on the 1st July.*",

            "description": "The battles for the Trasimene line may be considered as having lasted from aoth to 30th June. They were most severe in the centre where the Germans opposed xo and 13 Corps; on the west coast, although the ‘American advance was considerably slowed down, as compared with the first two weeks after the fall of Rome, the Germans were unable to prevent a steady gain of ground. IV Corps on the left, with 36 and xr Armoured Divisions leading, captured Follonica on 24th June and Piombino on the 25th. Then stiffer resistance was met, particularly inland where 1 Armoured Division, opposed by a skilful enemy and difficult country, lost seventy-one tanks in the course of these ten days. The stiffest resistance was at Cecina, at the mouth of the river of the same name; the battle for the town lasted from 2gth June to 1st July and cost 34 Division, which had relieved the 36th, fairly heavy casualties. 16 S.S. Division had been brought in here to strengthen the German defence and fought with skill and fanaticism. The French, directed on Siena, were held up from the 22nd to the 26th June on the River Orcia and were able only to make an advance of some two miles. On the night of the 27th, however, the Germans began to withdraw and only delaying actions were fought south of Siena, which was entered on 3rd July. By the 7th, with the capture of Colle di Val d’Elsa, the whole of Route 68, from its junction with Route 2 to the sea, had been secured.",
