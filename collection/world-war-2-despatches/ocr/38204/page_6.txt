tows but with X.7 still in tow with her opera-
tional crew on board, was closing the land to
make her landfall. SEANYMPH, having sunk
X 8, was on patrol some 60 miles to the west-
ward of Alten Fiord.

63. At 0300Z, SYRTIS sighted a submarine
on the surface bearing 030° and five minutes
later this was identified as a U-boat: position
71° 00’ N. 22° 10’ E., course 235°, proceeding
at about 9 knots at a range from SYRTIS of
about 3,500 yards. In order not to compromise
the operation in any way submarines had been
forbidden to attack anything below capital ships
while on passage out to or in their patrol areas
off Alten, and the Commanding {Officer of
H.M.S SYRTIS had no option but to let this
tempting target pass by, at 1,500 yards range
and a sitting shot, The U-boat, which had
originally appeared to be making for the
entrance to Soroy Sound, altered to 105° at
0315Z and disappeared in the direction of
Tarhalsen Point, presumably entering the Leads
round the eastern end of Soroy Island and
possibly being bound for Hammerfest

This may have been the same U-boat pre-
viously sighted by SYRTIS on the evening of
the previous day. It reflects credit on the look-
out kept by our submarines that, with six of
them in the vicinity and four of them with
X-craft in tow, none were sighted. A single
sighting might have compromised the opera-
tion, or at least led to A/S activity in the area.

64. At or05Z STUBBORN was in position
70° 45’N 21° 03’ E. when she sighted a float-
ing mine. The mune itself passed clear of
STUBBORN but the mooring wire caught in
-the tow astern and slid down the tow until it
became impaled on the bows of X.7. This
brought the Corgmanding Officer of X.7
(Lieutenant B. C. G. Place, DS.C., R.N.) on
to the casing, where by deft foot-work he was
able to clear this unpleasant obstruction, re-
marking as he did so that this was the first time
he had kicked a mine away by its horns.

After this interlude STUBBORN proceeded
co make her landfall off Soroy and set course
for her shipping position.

65. The weather had by now improved con-
siderably, the wind had dropped to a south-
easterly breeze, the sea had gone right down
and visibility was good, enabling all sub-
marines to fix their positions accurately. All
was now staged to slip for the attack, and be-
tween 1830 and 2000Z the four X-craft—X.5,
X.6, X.7 and X ro—were slipped from
THRASHER, TRUCULENT, STUBBORN
and SCEPTRE respectively from their slipping
positions and proceeded independently into
Soroy Sound. The submarines then withdrew
to seaward within their patrol sectors

66. That four out of the six X-craft which
set forth from Port HHZ should have made
these passages, varying between 1,000 and 1,500
miles, in tow of submarines, without major in-
cident, to be slipped from their exact positions
at the time ordered ten days later, was more
than I had ever anticipated.

-67. The Commanding Officer, H.M.S
STUBBORN (Lieutenant A. A. Duff, R.N.),
deserves special mention for his determination
in the way he battled against the difficulties
of parted tows,and brought his X-craft to the
right position at the right time in spite of
everything. .

68. The passage crews of the X-craft deserve
great credit for the way they stuck the long
and weary passage and for the efficient state of
the craft when they were turned over to the
operational crews. The passage crews played
a big part in the subsequent success of the
operation. , .

69. I consider this passage a fine example
of seamanship and determination by all
concerned.

The Attack

70. The crews of all four X-craft were re-
ported to be in great spirits and full of con-
fidence when they parted company with their
towing submarines. The Commanding Officers
all reported that their craft were in an efficient
state when they took over from their passage
crews except that X.10 had a defect in her peri-
scope hoist motor and in the motor of her ‘“ wet
and dry ’’ pump, and a slight gland leak; how-
ever, these defects were accepted by the opera-
tional crew, who were confident that they could
remedy them.

71. As X.5, X.6 and X.7 have not returned
from the operation, it is mmpossible to trace
their movements in their approach to and sub-
sequent attacks. The target was TIRPITZ in
each case. The intentions of the Commanding
Officers were, after passing across the declared
mined area to the westward of Soroy on the
surface during the night 2oth/2zst September,
to proceed dived up Stjernsund during daylight
on the 21st September in order to reach Alten
Fiord by dusk: then to proceed southward to
charge batteries in the vicinity of the Brattholm
group of islands, about four miles from the
entrance to Kaafiord All three had intended
to be at the entrance to Kaafiord shorily after
daylight on 22nd September. To give all
X-craft ample time to reach their objective,
and to guard against loss of surprise through
one X-craft attacking before the remainder,
X-craft were forbidden by their orders to attack
before or00Z, 22nd September, but were free
to do so at any time after that, setting their
charges in accordance with the firing rules table
given in the operation orders. As all X-craft
Commanding Officers had agreed between
themselves not to set their charges to fire in
the 0400-0500 firing period, it was expected that
they would carry out their attacks somewhere
between 0500 and o800Z, laying their charges
set to fire about 0830Z on 22nd September, by
which time it was hoped that they would have
been able to withdraw from the area.

72. That these three very gallant Com-
manding Officers succeeded in carrying out
their intentions and pressing home their attacks
to the full, I have no doubt; but what diffi-
culties and hazards they were called on to ne-
gotiate in the execution of the attack are not
known; nor is it known how some of them (if
the German wireless broadcast is to be be-
lieved) came to be taken prisoner. It is certain

-that outstanding devotion to duty and courage

of the highest order were displayed The full
story of this gallant attack must remain untold
for the time being.*
