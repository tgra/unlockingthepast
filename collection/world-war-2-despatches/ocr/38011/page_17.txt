(6) In the Mo-Bodo area dispositions
were :—

i. 1st Battalion Scots Guards less one
company and one Independent Com-
pany at Mo and in contact with enemy
forces which had landed on the
Hemnes Peninsula 20 miles south of
Mo. This force was under the com-
mand of Lieutenant-Colonel Trappes-
Lomax, Scots Guards, and included
also one troop 203rd Field Battery
(four 24-pdr. guns) and one troop
55th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment
(four Boho guns).

ii. In the Bodo area, one company

Scots Guards: and three “‘ inde-
pendent ’”’ companies.

iii. En route to Bodo in MV.
Chrobry the ist Battalion Irish

Guards, H.Q. 24th Guards Brigade
and detachments of the 230th Field
R.E,, and 137th Field

iv. Brigadier Fraser proceeded ahead of
Chrobry in H.M.S. Somali to Mo,
visiting Bodo on the way. At Mo, news
of the bombing of M.V. Chrobry
was received, and H.M.S. Somali at
once left to render assistance. On the
way, however, Somali was bombed
and had to return to Scapa. Later
Brigadier Fraser succeeded in trans-
ferring to H.M.S. Curlew and arrived
back at Harstad. It was evident that
he had not recovered from a wound
received at Ankenes, and it was there-
fore necessary to convene a medical
board. The Board found that he was
unfit and he had unfortunately to re-
turn to U.K.

16. The force was maintained through the
Base Area which had been established from
the outset at Harstad, the forward delivery to
Units and Formations in contact being made by
locally procured water transport to Fjord Head,
where approximately 10 days’ reserve supplies,
etc., were held. .

Inland Water Transport was thus the main
agency for forward maintenance. Yet, although
a study of the map would have shown that
this was so, no provision had been made to
send with the Force at the outset the necessary
personnel to organize and operate Inland Water
Transport in the way that railway units are
sent to operate railways in a theatre where the
railway is the main transport agency.

17. The policy of the War Office and the
French Co-ordinating Staff in London by which
the French maintenance system was to be
welded into the British system and controlled
by Force H.Q. had not been fully realised.

This was necessary as the items of supply
common to both and all reserves of ammunition
and fighting equipment were to be held in a
common Base Area, whilst Force Headquarters
were to be responsible also for forward mainten-
ance.

In actual fact the French had been permitted
to commence the establishment of a separate
Base Area at Ballangen, and provided with
water transport under their own control. As
the French Administrative Staff was very small,
and had at its disposal only a few issuers and
checkers, and no personnel for handling stores,
there was a great delay in dealing with their
store ships; in fact 5 had remained near their
Base Area only partially unloaded for 16 days
or more.

18. The reserve of supplies, ammunition and
general stores was low for the whole force, this
situation being aggravated by the fact that the
French had not arrived with 60 days’ supplies
as had been arranged. Motor Transport repair
facilities and spares were almost non-existent.

rg. At Harstad itself, the number of quays
available for unloading ships was sufficient for
the amount of stores going through the Base
Port at that time, but the facilities for clearing
and holding the stores up to the scale of re-
serves to be held, was quite inadequate. The
port had not sufficient accommodation for the
number of personnel required to be accommo-
dated in the Base Area, nor were there storage
facilities available in sufficient quantity or in
dispersed areas.

The Medical plan for the evacuation of Allied
casualties through British Medical Units back
to the Base was working efficiently, but the
number of beds available in the General
Hospital at Harstad was inadequate, as only
approximately 500 beds were available in three
ibuildings.

General survey of events during the period.

20. The principal military activities during
the period under review were the attempt to
stabilise the position on our Southern front in
the region of Mo and Bodo, the establishment
in the theatre of war of land-based aircraft,
the organisation of a base and its protection
against attack from the Air.

These activities are dealt with separately in
subsequent paragraphs, Other events of in-
terest are described briefly in the following
paragraphs.

a. Throughout the period the enemy was
active in the air and carried out numerous
attacks of varying intensity and duration against
H.M. Ships and other vessels in the area.
Attacks on ships and other craft in the Ofot
Fjord and off Narvik were of daily occurence,
and several attacks were made on Harstad itself
and on shipping in the harbour. On May 2oth
enemy bombers succeeded in setting light to
an oil tank at Harstad and two oil tankers
moored in the vicinity were also set on fire
and burned ont. On the whole, ‘however,
except for the damage to shipping which was
considerable, little arm was caused to Harstad
by these attacks and casualties were few. The
