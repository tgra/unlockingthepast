SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951

Standard Organizations for:—
A Corps Headquarters.
An Infantry Division.
Armoured Formations (re-organization of
Tank Brigades).
Organization for the movement and main-
tenance of Air Transported Formations.
Assumption of full contol by 11 Army
Group of Fourteenth Army and Land Forces,
Ceylon.
The principal changes involved, together with
my reasons for ‘effecting them, are summarized
in the succeeding paragraphs :—

139. 11 (East African) Division. At a con-
ference held in Ceylon in January, at which
the G.O.C.-in-C., East African Command was
present, I decided to increase the artillery of
this formation up to the scale of that in an
Animal and Motor Transport (A. and M.T.)
Division on the Indian Establishment.

I also decided to reduce the scale of both
unit and 2nd line motor transport, and to pro-
vide an element within the infantry battalions
for carrying fighting equipment under con-
ditions when M.T. could not operate.

140. 81 and 82 (West African) Divisions. In
May, at a conference attended by the G.O.C.-
in-C., West Africa, I considered the advis-
ability of amalgamating these two divisions ;
for 81 Division, which had given up one of
its brigades to Special Force, consisted only
of two brigades. Owing, however, to the short-
age of formations with which to carry out
reliefs, I decided to retain both divisions, but
to effect certain changes in their organization.
These included :—

(a) The divisional artillery to consist of
one light regiment (three batteries of
3.7-inch howitzers and one. battery of 3-inch
mortars) and one anti-tank regiment (three
batteries, each of twelve six-pounder guns).
Field regiments could not be formed, but
would be attached when required.

{b) A reconnaissance battalion to be in-
cluded in each division.

@) A proportion (25 per cent.) of the un-
armed soldiers, who act as porters, to be
armed.

West African resources did not, unfortun-
ately, admit of certain other desirable increases,
such as the inclusion of a Divisional Head-
quarters battalion.

T also decided that 3 (West African) Brigade
of 81 (West African) Division should continue
to be employed with Special Force.

I intended to bring these two West African
divisions and the East African division, into
line with the standard divisional organization
(vide paragraph 142) in due course.

141. Corps Headquarters and Corps Troops.
In order to secure uniformity, a standardised
War Establishment for a Corps Headquarters
and, also, a standard Order of Battle for Corps
Troops, is to be adopted.

142. Standard Organization for Infantry Divi-
sions. I have already briefly referred to the
desirability of having one standard organiza-
tion for all infantry divisions operating in this
theatre of war, and for some time past I had
been examining the possibility of this. Ex-
perience had shown that, with our limited
