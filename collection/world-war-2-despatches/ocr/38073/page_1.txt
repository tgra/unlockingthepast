THE BATTLE OF SIRTE OF 22np MARCH, |

1942.

The following Despatch was submitted to the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on the
and June, 1942, by Admiral Sir Henry H.
Harwood, K.C.B., O.B.E., Commandersn-
Chief, Mediterranean Station. .

Mediterranean,
and June, 1942.

Be pleased to lay before Their Lordships the

attached reports of proceedings during Opera-

tion M.G. One between 19th March and 28th

. March, 1942.* This operation was carried out

with the object of passing a convoy (M.W.r10)

of four ships to Malta, where it was most

urgently required. In the course of the opera-

tion a greatly superior Italian surface force

which attempted to intercept the convoy was
driven off.

Plan.

2. When running the previous Malta convoy
(M.'W.g) in February, 1942, an attempt was
made to escape detection during the first and
second days out from Alexandria by splitting
the convoy and simulating two normal Tobruk
convoys. In the event this proved a failure.
Further, an attempt to keep clear of JU.87s
from Cyrenaica during the passage of the
central basin by keeping well to the northward
had little effect owing to the weight of attack
from aerodromes in Greece and Crete.

3. It was therefore decided to keep convoy
M.W.1o0 together throughout, and to use ali

this operation was carried out.

available forces to fight the convoy through,
and to reinforce this escort at dawn D.3 by
Force K* from Malta. The route was chosen
with a view to:—

(a) arriving at Malta at dawn,

(b) being as far to the westward by dark-
ness on D.2 as was possible consistent with
remaining within range of long-range fighter
protection during daylight,

(c) taking advantage of a suspeoted weak-
ness in the enemy’s air reconnaissance of the
area between Crete and Cyrenaica, and at the
same time avoiding suspected U-boat areas,

(d) keeping well south during the passage
of the central basin to increase the distance
to be covered by surface forces attempting to
intercept.

4. To reduce the scale of air attack on the
convoy, the Eighth Army were to carry out a
feint advance (Operation ‘‘ Fullsize ’’) on D.z.
It was hoped that this would focus the atten-
tion of the enemy air forces on the land, and
so draw off some of the attack from the convoy.
In the event this feint achieved its object very
successfully.

5. Simultaneously the Royal Air Force were
to undertake as heavy attacks as possible on
enemy aerodromes in Cyrenaica and Crete.
Anti-ship striking forces were to be held in
readiness on D.3, when interception by surface
forces was a possibility.

“6. Covering submarine patrols were estab-
lished by two submarines in the southern
approaches to Messina and four in the Gulf of
Taranto.
