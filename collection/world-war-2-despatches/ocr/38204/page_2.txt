exercises and attacks against capital ships weré
carried out. This period was also devotéd to
perfecting the towing of X-craft by submarines,

I should like to place on récord the great
assistance given by the Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet, in providing capital ships of his
Fleet to act as target ships at Port HHZ during
this period, and also to mention the part played
by the Boom Defence organisation in surround-
ing these ships with nets and providing net
defences and equipment for the necessary
trials.

Planning. .

Io. In the meantime detailed plans for carry-
ing out the operation were prepared by my
Staff and operation orders were drawn up. The
officer mainly responsible for this work was

Commander G. P. S. Davies, R.N., of my
Staff.

rz. It was decided that the attack should
take place at the earliest date the hours of dark-
ness allowed, so as to complete the operation
before the weather conditions deteriorated. It
was also desirable to have a certain amount of
moon, to assist the X-craft in their passage by
night up the fiords. The period 2oth-25th
September, 1943, with the moon in the last
quarter, was therefore selected, and Day D,
the day on which the X-craft™were if possible
to be slipped from their towing submarines to
proceed for the attack, was provisionally fixed
for the 2oth Seplember, 1943.

12. To allow for the attack to be carried out
at any of the protected anchorages used by
German main units on the Norwegian coast it
was necessary to provide operation orders for
attacks on Alten Fiord, the Narvik area and
on Trondheim, and Operation ‘‘ Source’ was
divided into three operations, as follows:

Oberation

Operations north of 7o° N. ‘‘ Funnel ’’
Operations between 67° and

69° N. i ‘ «. ‘ Empire ’’
Operations between 63° and

65° N. ss . : - ‘ Forced ’’.

It was thus possible to direct operations
against the enemy m whichever of these three
areas he might be detected.

Photographic Reconnaissance.

13. Prehminary photographic reconnais-
sance of the anchorages, with special refeience
to net defences, was considered most necessary
for the success of the operation, and last minute
Teconnaissances, to give the disposition of
targets, essential.

14, This presented difficulties for the Alten
area, which was outside the range of home-
based P.R. aircraft. In May, 1943, I discussed
this question with the Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet, who was fully in agreement with
me on the importance of establishing reliable
P.R. cover for the area. On 12th May, 1943,
he addressed a signal to Admiralty and repeated
to Admiral (Submarines) and Headquarters,
Coastal Command, in which he proposed that
the necessary British air crews and photo-
graphic. personnel should bgsesent to North
Russia for this most important duty.

15 Agreement was reached with the Air
Ministry by 30th July, and Admiral Fisher (in
Moscow) was asked for his views after con-
sultation with the Russian authorities.

SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 11 FEBRUARY, 1948

16. As a result, and after agreement with the
Russians, it was agreed to send a British photo-
graphic unit to Murmansk by destroyer, to run
a shuttle service between the United Kingdom
and North Russia by Mosquito aircraft for the
preliminary reconnaissances, and to base Spit-
firés at Vaenga for the last-minute sorties. In
addition, Catalina aircraft would be available
to ruin a shuttle service to and from North
Russia with photographs.

17. All preliminary arrangements for putting
this into operation had been made by the x8th
August and negotiations concluded with the
Russians on the question of visas. On the 27th
August, HM. Ships MUSKETEER and
MAHRATTA sailed from Faroes with R.A.F.
photographic personnel and stores and arrived
in Kola Inlet on the 31st Atgust.

18. The weather was still to be reckoned
with, however, and although the Mosquito air-
craft for the preliminary reconnaissances had
been ready to leave the United Kingdom from
the 2rst August, weather conditions were never
satisfactory for this aircraft to carry out her
part of the plan.

19. The three Spitfires, however, arrived at
Vaenga on the 3rd September, exactly eight
days before Operation ‘‘ Source’ was due to
sail from Port HHZ, and the first sortie was
flown on the 7th September.

20. The subsequent reconnaissances flown by
this unit were invaluable to the operation. Full
details of the dispositions of the enemy units
and net defences were signalled from Russia
and given to all the personnel taking part be-
fore they left harbour. No actual photographs
of the preliminary reconnaissances were avail-
able for the final briefing as, in spite of every
effort to obtain them in time, the first photo-
graphs taken by this unit did not arrive until
a few hours after the X-craft had sailed, but
this did not in fact matter as the relevant in-
formation was complete, in the signalled report.

Preliminary Movements.

ax. For security reasons it was decided that
the operation should sail from Port HHZ (Loch
Cairnbawn), where the X-craft taking part had
been working up from H.M.S. BONAVEN-
TURE since the 4th July, 1943.

22 H.MS. TITANIA was sailed for and
arrived at Port HHZ on the 30th August to
act as depot ship to the submarines taking part,
and HM, Submarines THRASHER, TRUCU-
LENT, STUBBORN, SYRTIS, SCEPTRE
and SEANYMPH arrived between the 31st
August and 1st September. These submarines
had al} been fitted with special towing equip-
ment. -

23. In addition, H.M. Submarines SATYR
‘and SEADOG, also specially fitted for towing,
were held at 24 hours’ notice at Scapa as
reserves.

24. Towing trials, and trials of changing over
passage and operational crews between X-craft
and submarines at sea, were carried out
between the rst and 3th September; then,
after final swinging for compasses, all X-craft
were hoisted inboard of H.M.S. BONAVEN-
TURE for the fitting of side charges, storing,
final preparations and the full briefing of crews
