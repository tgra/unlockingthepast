            "description": "After talking the matter over, General Ritchie and I agreed that Rommel had almost certainly intended in the first place to make only a limited advance and was now skilfully exploiting an entirely unexpected success. There was time even now to arrest his advance and repel him. General Ritchie then took the 4th Indian Division under his direct command and countermanded the orders of the 13th Corps for a general withdrawal in the early hours of 26th January. After ways and means of taking the offensive had  been considered, it was decided that the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade from the west and the rst Armoured Division with the rith Indian Infantry Brigade from the north should converge on Msus where the main body of the enemy lay. It was reported that the and Armoured Brigade would not be ready to undertake the operation until late on the 28th or early on the 2gth. Until then the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade was to delay the enemy advance with mobile columns."

At 0745 hours on the 26th January our air reconnaissances reported two transports and some smaller craft escorted by two cruisers and twelve destroyers closing the shore at Endau. This convoy was twice attacked during the day by Hudson, Albacores and Vickers Vildebeeste aircraft escorted by Hurricanes and Buffalos. Each time a large force of Japanese Navy Zero fighters operating from Kuantan was met and there was much air fighting. A minimum of 13 enemy fighters were destroyed while we lost 1 Vickers Vildebeeste, 2 Hurricanes and 1 Buffalo. Both enemy transports were hit, but the landing was not prevented. Our Air Striking Force in Malaya, even such as it was, had now vanished. On the night 26th/27th January H.M. Australian destroyer   Vampire   and H.M.S.   Thanet   were sent to sweep up the coast and attack the Japanese transports. Off Endau they fell in with and engaged three destroyers and a eruiser. The  Thanet ? was sunk and a Japanese destroyer severely damaged."

            "description": "Having made the outflanking force as strong as possible it was now essential to give the maximum strength to the frontal attack, which must have sufficient momentum to carry it well up the Liri valley. I therefore decided to withdraw the New Zealand Division from Eighth Army, to be concentrated in the Naples area by 26th January, D plus 4 for SHINGLE. This division, of good fighting quality, well motorised and with an armoured component, was the  most suitable readily available for such exploitation. It gave me an Army Group reserve under my hand, for the first time, with which to influence the battle; as the events of the following May were to show, operations in the Liri valley and from Anzio must be treated as an Army Group battle. It was the third division taken from Eighth Army to increase our concentration at the vital point; I intended to put it at the disposal of Fifth Army when a suitable opportunity for its employment in an exploiting r le could be foreseen."

They pressed home their attacks on their obsolete Vildebeeste torpedo-bombers regardless of casualties, amongst whom I regret to report were lost the Commanding Officers of both squadrons, the late Squadror  Leaders R. F. C. Markham and I. T. B. Rowland. After being reorganised into a composit : squadron in Java, and after having patched up their old aircraft, they again pressed home attacks against the enemy convoys which were invading that island, this time at night, again suffering casualties and the loss of  their squadron commander, the late Squadron Leader J. T. Wilkins. Such gallant conduct speaks for itself."

Directly it became apparent that our crossings of the Irrawaddy had succeeded over a wide front, I issued, on the 27th February, an Operation Instruction to General Slim, General Sultan and General Christison in order to co-ordinate operations in the immediate future. Jt will be remembered that on the 26th January, the Chiefs of Staff had promised to increase our transport aircraft to meet our essential requirements by the 1st March.  With this in mind, I instructed Fourteenth Army to destroy the Japanese forces in the Mandalay area and to capture Rangoon before the monsoon. Northern Combat Area Command were directed to seize the general area Kyaukme Lashio and then to turn south-west and co-operate in the Mandalay area battle. After this they were to exploit out towards Loilem. 15 Indian Corps, whose tasks I had already a month before extended to include developing the air bases on Akyab and Ramree Islands for the supply of Fourteenth Army, and to operations as far south as Taungup, were now directed, in general, to contain the maximum number of enemy forces, particularly by operating up the An and Taungup  Prome routes. (These operations by 15 Indian Corps will be discussed in detail in a later part of this Despatch.) Since this Operation Instruction contains my brief appreciation of the situation at the time, I have attached a copy at Appendix A."

This had the desired effect, as on the 26th January, the Supreme Allied Commander received a signal saying that the transport aircraft would not only be made up but increased. Besides the two Combat Cargo squadrons which it had already been agreed would be returned from China by the Ist February, two R.A.F, Dakota squadrons would be made available, one being on loan, from ist March. In addition, it was proposed to raise the aircraft establishment of ali R.A.F. transport squadrons in the theatre.

It had not been expected that the Marines would be able to clear the whole island and they were to be relieved after landing by 36 Brigade (26 Indian Division) ; but this actually proved to be unnecessary. The other tasks allotted to 36 Brigade were to capture the small island of Sagu Kyun, south of Ramree, which it accomplished on 30th January under cover of the fire of NORMAN and RAIDER, who silenced enemy guns, and then to assault the southern end of Ramree itself, and exploit northwards."
