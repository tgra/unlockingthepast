January, to follow the enemy’s example and
reinforce the vital points at the cost of weaken-
ing the Adriatic sector.

The first attack north of Cassino, between
24th and 31st January, had had limited success.
34 United States Division, in hard fighting,
secured a bridgehead over the Rapido about two
miles north of the town and, pressing up into
the hills beyond the river, captured two out-
lying spurs and the village of Cairo. To their
north the French, supported by an American
Regimental Combat Team, captured Colle
Belvedere and pushed further into the moun-
tains towards Terelle. II Corps was now in a
position to swing the direction of its attack
from west to south. 36 Division, still weak from
its losses in the Rapido crossing, was brought
in to guard the western flank by holding Monte
Castelione, captured by 34 Division on 1st
February, and the 34th began attacking on the
2nd along the ridge from Colle Majola on to the
rear of Monastery Hill. Hopes were high and
General Clark signalled me on that day:
“‘ Present indications are that the Cassino
heights will be captured very soon’’. He asked
for a directive on the employment of the New
Zealand Division.

T had already decided that the development
of the situation at Anzio and the stubborn
enemy resistance on the main front made neces-
sary a reinforcement of General Freyberg’s*
forces if they were to be able to carry out the
task assigned. I had therefore ordered General
Leese on 30th January to despatch 4 Indian
Division, which had newly arrived in the
country, to come under command of General
Freyberg in an ad hoc New Zealand Corps. 4
Indian Division had had the longest experience
in actual operations of any Allied formation
and had recently been doing some training in
mountain operations.t I told General Leese:
“* I fully realise that this will put out of court
any possibility of offensive operations by you ’’.
On 3rd peutuary I put the New Zealand Corps
under command of Fifth Army, from Army
Group reserve. I still felt the need for a forma-
tion under my hand to influence the battle and
therefore signalled Eighth Army on the 4th
to be prepared to release 78 Division within
seven to ten days. General Leese was naturally
very perturbed at this proposal to take away
a fifth division; not only would it render any
offensive action quite impracticable and upset
the system for reliefs of tired formations but
he feared that it might even lead to a loss of
security on his front. This, however, was a
tisk which I was prepared to take; the Adriatic
sector was now unimportant to either side; both
were gathering their maximum strength for the
decisive battle under the snows of Monte Cairo
and among the canals of the Pontine Marshes.

The attack by 34 United States Division con-
tinued to make progress but the enemy was
now steadily reinforcing. Leaving 5 Mountain

t One of our most serious handicaps in Italy was
‘the lack of formations trained and organized for
mmountain fighting. I had 4 Moroccan Mountain
Division for just over three months and eventually
got the American to Mountain Division, in February
1945, for the last three months. I had frequently
asked for the only British Mountain Division, the 52nd.
‘This division was held in reserve in the United King-

. dom, presumably for projected operations elsewhere.
In fact it was never employed in mountain warfare

‘but was retrained and eventually deployed in Holland
in the autumn of 1944.

Division to oppose the French he decided to
strengthen the mixed group of 44 and 71 Divi-
sions which was defending Cassino itself and
the Monastery with 90 Panzer Grenadiers,
brought down from the Anzio front. Against
these excellent troops II Corps was unable to
make progress. It had got into the outskirts of
the town and was within striking distance of
the Monastery hill; indeed it was only a mile
from Route 6 down below, but it was a mile
packed with defences held by fanatical troops
and broken up by mountain ridges and gullies.
Thea first battle of Cassino was a German
success; its retention now was a matter of
German prestige.

T had refused to commit the New Zealand
Corps, my Corps de Chasse, until it was certain
that II Corps could not take the position. The
New Zealanders had relieved the Americans
south of Route 6 on 6th February to allow
the latter to concentrate for the attack; but
it was now clear that they would be obliged,
not merely to debouch through a gateway
flung open for them, but to capture the gate
themselves. II Corps went over to the defen-
sive on 12th February. My plan now was
for 4 Indian Division to capture Monastery Hill
while the New Zealanders would seize a bridge-
head over the Rapido. The Corps would then
exploit up the Liri valley, but this was not to
start until weather conditions were favourable
enough to allow the movement of armoured
forces off the roads. At the same time I
ordered Fifth Army to make plans for resuming
the offensive with VI Cotps.

Time was urgently pressing, for it was known
that a great enemy counter-attack against the
Anzio bridgehead was being prepared. In the
event the two attacks went in on the same day,
16th February. A preliminary to the New
Zealand Corps attack was the destruction of
the Monastery of Monte Cassino by air bom-
bardment and artillery fire. This famous
building had hitherto been deliberately spared,
to our great disadvantage, but it was an in-
tegral part of the German defensive system,
mainly from the superb observation it afforded.
It is doubtful, however, whether the ruins
after the destruction were not more valuable
to the enemy than the intact buildings; as we
were to find in the town of Cassino below,
heavy bombardment often produced better
defensive positions than it destroyed. The
attack which went in on the r6th made no pro-
gtess. 4 Indian Division ruefully decided that
the Cassino position was almost as strong as
Keren, still their invariable standard of com-

ison. The only gain below the mountain
was a small bridgehead over the Rapido oppo-
site the railway station. 78 Division, which ©
had been put under command of New Zealand
Corps on the 8th, arrived in the area on the
r7th, having been held up by deep snow on
the way from Eighth Army front. On the 24th
it took over from the New Zealanders south
of the railway, the latter relieved 34 United
States Division in the north end of Cassino
and the remaining elements of II Corps, on
Monte Castellone, were relieved by the French
Expeditionary Corps on the 26th.
