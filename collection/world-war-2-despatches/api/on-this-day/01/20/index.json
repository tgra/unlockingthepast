Gazelle had its first brush with the enemy near Wachai, where a rearguard of approximately one battalion was unable to impose any great delay on our advance. It was here that our troops had their first serious air attack, but luckily few casualties were inflicted and the troops were unshaken.",

The full position was asked before agreement to allocate from the total pool was possible since the need in the Southern Malayan theatre was more immediate than that in Burma.",

Owing, however, to the limited capacity of the port, maintenance had to be arranged direct from depots in India, and despatched from Calcutta. This resulted in loss of flexibility, so that when Akyab was captured by a river-crossing operation on the 3rd January, it was found that the shipping from Calcutta could not be made to arrive before the 20th January; even then it was loaded with stores, etc., planned for the original February assault. The landing on the Myebon Peninsula, which took place only nine days after the capture of Akyab, was mounted and maintained from that port. The export commitment inevitably delayed the stores build-up in the island, and, for a time, our resources",
