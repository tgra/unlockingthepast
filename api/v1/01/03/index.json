A further landing on Ramree Island on the 2ist met with only slight opposi- tion. The core of Japanese resistance was, however, met along the coastal road from Myohaung to Taungup, and a number of amphibious landings which were effected in January and February at various points along the coast provoked fierce fighting (whose issue was beyond doubt due to the heavy and accurate air support that was given), and gradually the enemy was driven towards the two routes leading eastwards from An and Taungup towards the Irrawaddy valley. With the capture of Taungup in the middle of April the coastal campaign was virtually over."

The Akyab garrison was known to have been further weakened, although to what extent was still uncertain. 25 Indian Division had .reached Foul Point, Rathedaung and Kudaung Island well ahead of schedule. 81 (West African) Division was successfully containing the enemy by its pressure in the Kaladan. It was, there- fore, imperative to block the Japanese Minbya\u2014 Myebon escape route as early as possible. The immediate possession of Akyab thus became essential to our further progress, and the quickest emergency plan for its capture was put into action. 3 Commando Brigade, mounted in the Naf River as previously planned, was to carry out an assault landing on the north- western beaches of the island, supported by such naval and air bombardment as could be prepared at short notice. Simultaneously 53 Brigade was to cross the two mile wide mouth of the Kywede River in country craft, from Kudaung Island. 74 Brigade would be ferried across the four mile wide Mayu estuary from Foul Point and follow up 3 Commando Brigade. D-Day was fixed for the 3rd January."

On the 9th December, 81 (West African) Division crossed the Kaladan River. On the 15th December, Buthidaung fell to 82 (West African) Division.
