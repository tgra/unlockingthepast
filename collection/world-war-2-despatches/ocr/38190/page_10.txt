Royal Artillery. Heavy casualties on the
enemy were observed. The 5/7 Rajput‘ Regt.
was subjected to dive bombing and heavy mor-
tar fire throughout the day. In view of the
weight of the Japanese attack, the rapid de-
velopment of their heavy mortar fire, the con-
tricted passage across the Lyemun Strait, the
shortage of launch crews, and as we now had no
footing on the mainland except at Devils Peak
Peninsula, I gave orders to Commander Main-
Jand Infantry Brigade that the Ma Lau Tong
line should-be evacuated during the night.

The first task was to be the evacuation of
HQ and two companies of 2/14 Punjab Regt.
which had been previously arranged. This
was to be followed by the withdrawal of the
3.7-in. Howitzer troop R.A. The second and
the shorter of the Devils Peak Lines (Hai
Wan) was to be held by HQ 5/7 Rajput Regt.
and two companies, the remainder of that
battalion being evacuated last. The first with-
drawal was timed for 1930 hours.

34. Shell fire died down at dusk (12th
December) but the water transport difficulties
were serious. Chinese crews deserted in the
darkness from the W.D. fleet, though covered
by rifles, engineers were deficient, and some
launches were found to be in a sinking con-
dition Administrative officers had been sent
out from my HQ to accelerate matters and
took personal charge and operated what boats
they could, but serous delays occurred. It
was not until or30 hours that the 2/a4 Punjab
Regt., some 300 men, were all across.

At 0400 hours the bulk of the first troop R.A.
(less mules) and one company of 5/7 Rajput
Regt. were across, but the Mule Corps was still
to come. It was clear that the situation was
critical if daylight crossings were to be avoided
and I called on the Royal Navy to assist. Their
response was prompt. Three motor torpedo
boats were despatched from Aberdeen and one
more was recalled from patrol in Junk Bay
where it had been covering the right flank
of the 5/7 Rajput Regt. from possible enemy
attack im sampans from Hang Hau area (an
operation which had been attempted by night
during peace training and found feasible).

The destroyer H MS ‘‘ Thracian ’’ was also
ordered round from’ Aberdeen but could not
be expected to arrive before o600 hours, 13th
December. .

T ordered Brigadier Wallis to give full priority
to personnel, and that there was to be no ques-
tion of evacuating the 120 mules and further
risking the operation. In any case the mule
lighter crew had deserted, and the handling of
this craft in the dark by personnel unaccus-
tomed to it was a dubious proposition, and
moreover she was badly holed by enemy fire
and had to be abandoned in a sinking condi-
tion ,, Meanwhile the W.D.V. ‘‘ Victoria ’’ had
been slowly and steadily evacuating personnel
and equipment under,Major A. J. Dewar and
Captain C. G. Turner. When the torpedo boats
arrived at the ‘small pier on the Devils Peak
Peninsula it was found that the state of the
tide idid not permit them to ‘‘lie close to ’’—
a risk that had been foreseen and accepted.
This meant more delay and ferrying by sam-
pans. Ferry trips were, however, made by ithe
torpedo boats directly H.M.S. ‘‘ Thracian ”’
arrived, the tide having risen slightly.

35. At about 0400 hours 13th December I
discussed with Bngadier Wallis the advisability
of also including in the withdrawal the two
companies of 5/7 'Rajput Regt. holding the rear
position. The enemy were in constant though
light contact throughout, and after their severe
handling would be temporarily disinclined to
follow up. The water transport situation had
already become more than precarious, it was
extremely doubtful if any WD. vessel, except
perhaps the ‘‘ Victoria ’’ would be available
next night, and I thus foresaw the greatest
difficulties and even the impossibility of main-
taining the 5/7 Rajput ‘Regt. with ammunition
and supplies in their isolated position. I de-
cided that the risk was too great, and I also
urgently required them to relieve and man the
North East sector then held by 2 Royal Scots.
This latter battalion was not in good shape,
as they had lost many of their best officers killed
or wounded, and I judged it to be necessary
to withdraw them into reserve so that they
could obtain a short respite in which to rest
and re-equip. In addition they were unfamiliar
with the ground, their previous sector having
been the South West. One company of 5/7
Rajput Regt. was therefore ordered to cover
the withdrawal of the remainder and then
themselves embark in the last flights. Daylight
had arrived by then, but they accomplished the
evacuation without casualties, covered by
artillery fire from various island positions.

36. It was not until 0920 hours that the last
contingent of 5/7 Rajput Regt. from the main-
land reached Aberdeen. The whole battalion
was collected in the Tytam Gap area by noon
and given twenty-four hours to rest and re-
equip before taking over the North East sector
from 2 Royal Scots The 2/14 Punjab Regt.
took over the North West sector. During the
night (12/13th December), at the urgent re-
quest of the civil authorities, arrangements
were made with the Harbour Master to pass
g tons of dynamite from Green Island to the
Star Ferry for collection and distribution.

‘On its return, loaded, it left Green Island
two hhours ahead of schedule, with the result
that it reached the Vehicular Ferry (not Star
Ferry) unexpectedly, and the N.C.O. com-
manding the pill box there gave the order to
fire, as no lights or distinguishing marks were
visible. The launch blew up and all on board
thus unfortunately lost their lives. ‘

37. At ogoo hours 13th December a launch’
bearing a flag of truce was seen to put off from
Kowloon. It arrived at Victoria Pier with a
Staff Officer of the General commanding the
Japanese Forces (‘Lt.-General Sakai) bearing a
letter addressed to H.E. The Governor. The
letter demanded the surrender of the Colony
and threatened severe artillery fire and aerial
bombardment in the event of refusal. The
demand was tantamount to unconditional sur-
render and was rejected categorically!

38. During the morning the Japanese were
observed to be collecting launches in Kowloon
Bay and concentrating them mainly at Bailey’s
Shipyard near the cement-works, The situation
as [ saw it was that the enemy, if he attacked
from the mainland, might direct his attack
on to:—

(a) Lyemun-Quarry Point area

(b) Northpoint Bowrington area eons
(c) Victoria Peninsula.

(4) Kennedy Town
