_ ir. The position of our naval forces at sea -at daylight on the 2oth May, was: 

(a) Force Ax about roo miles to the west of Crete and sey to be joined by the force with R.A.D

_ (0) The force with C.S. 15 had reached the Kaso Strait during the previous night and was now withdrawing to the southward. .

12. At 0800 on 2oth May, 1941, only three weeks after the British withdrawal from Greece, the Germans began their attack on Crete. This took the form of intense bombing of the vicinity of Maleme  aerodrome closely followed by the landing of troops by parachute, glider and troop-carrying aircraft. The enemy's main objective appeared. -to be Maleme. but later in the day similar attacks  developed at - . Heraklion and Retimo.

"73. As regards our Air Force, the isctalana  scale of enemy air attacks on aerodromes since the 13th May had imposed a very heavy strain on the fighter force in  Crete. This force by the roth May had been reduced to only Seven

fighter aircraft  fit for operations. No reinforcements ,were available in Egypt. It had, therefore, been decided to fly  all serviceable aircraft back to Egypt on the 19th May, until { the scal  of enemy attack lessened or reinforcements became available. From the roth May to the 26th  May naval forces operating in the, vicinity of Crete were without fighter prot tion. :

14. On learning that the attack on,Crete had started,  the | Commander-in-Chief, Medi ranean, at once ordered forces at sea to mpye  up towards Crete, but failing further developments they were to keep out of sight of. land. During the forenoon of the zoth May, | the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean signalled  his intentions as follows : 

(a) Force D consisting of R.A.D. in DIDO -with ORION, AJAX, ISIS, KIMBERLEY,  IMPERIAL and JANUS, was to pass the Anti Kithera Channel by 2200/20th May, sweep Capes Malea Hydra Phalconera and be off Canea at 0700/2ist.

(6) Force C consisting of C.S.15 in NAIAD_ with PERTH, KANDAHAR, - NUBIAN, KINGSTON and JUNO, was to   pass Kaso Strait at 2200/2othi, sweep  round Stampalia and be off Heraklion at 0700/2zst.

(c) Force B consisting of GLOUCESTER and, FIJI was to pass close off Cape Matapan

. at o400/2Ist and then join Force  AI about

50. miles west of Crete (position 35  20 .N., - 22  25E.) at o7oo/2ist. . -

CALCUTTA was to pass through the

Kaso Strait after Force C which she was to

join off Heraklion at 0700/2zst. | .

(e) A new Force E (D.14 in JERVIS with

NIZAM and ILEX) was to bombard Scar- . panto aerodrome during the night 2oth/2zst

May, Witidrawing to the southward before daylight.

(f) CARLISLE who was at Alexandria would. sail as soo as ready so.as to join Force E 50 miles south east of Crete (position 34  30  N., 27  00  E.) at.0700/21st May. ~

15. As a result of air reconnaissance reports of caiques sighted in the Aegean, Forces C and  D were ordered at 1800 to move to the north of. Crete, at once. It was then thought that if our  forces carried out the sweeps that had already been arranged there was a danger of their missing southbound enemy convoys in  the darkness. . The night sweeps for Forces C and D were accordingly cancelled. Instead Forces C and D were ordered to establish patrols north of Crete to the west and: east of longitude 25  E. respectively. Force C was to cover the vicinity of Heraklion, whilst Force D was to guard the Maleme Canea Kissamo Bay area. The Retimo area was to be looked after by local craft from Suda Bay.

16, At nightfall on the 2oth May, the situa-  tion at Malem  and Canea was reported to be in hand, though about 1,200 of the 3,000 enemy vwho had landed by air were unaccounted for. In the Heraklion and Retimo area it was known that parachutists had landed, but details were lacking: Boats carrying troops had heen
