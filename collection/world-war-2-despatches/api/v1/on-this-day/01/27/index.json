When the decision was taken on 27th January that it would be necessary for the army to withdraw to Singapore Island, it became evident at once that one aerodrome only, Kallang, would shortly ibe available for use. The other three on the Island, Tengah, Sembawang and Seletar, were sited on its northern coastline and would soon be exposed to observed artillery fire from Johore at ranges as close aS 1,500-2,000 yards: it would not be practicable to operate aircraft from them for long Unfortunately Kallang itself was rapidly becoming of limited use. Its surface, a crust of mari laid on a salt marsh, was pock-marked with bomb craters which were most difficult to fill. Extension was impracticable, huddled as it was between the sea and the built-up area of Singapore Town, Consequently, further transfer of squadrons to the N.E.I. now became inevitable."

            "description": "357. The first major development during the period under report was the switch of an air supply base from Agartala to Chittagong on the 27th January, 1945, when No. 3 R.A.M.O. was moved across and reopened as No. 7. This was the first step in bringing the air bases forward to keep up with the advance of Fourteenth Army. Chittagong airfield had originally been designed for the operation of  light bombers, and considerable engineering effort was required to adapt the installation to take continuous traffic imposing much heavier loads. Nevertheless C. 46 aircraft started to operate on this route on the 2nd February. No. 7 R.A.M.O., incidentally had no Air Despatch Company allotted to it but, using pioneer labour only, achieved the very fine average of over 700 tons per day in April."

While work on the road was in progress, 89 Brigade, operating in two columns, executed a skilful flanking movement through the hills, which forced the enemy to vacate their strong positions covering Pauk on the 27th January. By the 3ist January, 7 Indian Division was seven miles east of Pyinchaung, after forcing the double crossing of the Yaw Chaung against unexpectedly light opposition. 28 (East African) Brigade was operating to the south, covering the right flank of the Corps. 75. On the 8th February, the joint Fourteenth Army/221 Group R.A.F. Headquarters opened at Monywa. This now included the Rear Headquarters, 221 Group, which had been left behind at Imphal when Army Headquarters moved forward, only a small operations staff then accompanying the Army Headquarters. 221 Group Headquarters, under Air Vice-Marshal  . F. Vincent, and Headquarters Fourteenth Army maintained a joint Headquarters for the remainder of the campaign."
