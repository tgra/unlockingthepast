1 Middlesex Regt. came directly under com-
mand of Fortress as ‘‘ Corps. Troops’’ for
defence purposes. This eased the situation for
Brigadier Wallis, who had the larger half of the
island to command, and for Brigadier Lawson
who was unfamiliar with the ground.

During the night 14/15th December the 5/7
Rajput Regt. releved the 2 Royal Scots in the
North East sector. The latter moved later to
the area Wanchai Gap-Filter Beds to refit and
re-organise, but one company took over a
narrow front just West of the naval hospital.

47. During the early hours 15th December
a broadcast from Kowloon could be heard of
European songs and music; the talks, however,
were not clear. They were probably from
loud speakers on vans in the streets, as the
radio transmitting station in Kowloon had been
destroyed before evacuation. Several traitors,
with lamps of primitive design operated from a
dry battery, with a small but adequate mirror,
were reported signalling from the island to the
mainland. When these operators were inter-
cepted they were shot.

48. (a) There was a systematic shelling of
pill boxes along the North shore during the
morning 15th December: three were knocked
out and one badly damaged. One had forty
holes drilled right through by a high velocity
gun of small calibre located on Kowloon
Peninsula, firing from a concealed position in-
side a water front ‘‘ Godown.”’ The provision
of alternative emplacements for the pill boxes
of the North shore defences had already been
taken up and some ten to twelve were com-
pleted. They should of course have been com-
pleted in peace time but it would have meant
requisitioning valuable ‘‘ Godown ’”’ and office
properties, and requisitioning had not been
sanctioned by Government until the proposed
“ Precautionary Period,’’

(6) By nightfall all military and civil tele-
phone routes in the North East sector, including
those to pill boxes Nos, 4o to 53 were severely
interrupted. Night repair work was at once
put in hand.

(c) Aberdeen Island and the A.A. positions
at Lyemun (Saiwan Hill) were heavily shelled,
one gun being-put out of action temporarily.

(d@) At noon 15th December the enemy was
observed preparing sandbagged positions on
the water front by the Kowloon Godowns,
probably for mortars. Later, mortar fire fell in
the vicinity of the R.N. Dockyard, Command
H.Q., and Lower Peak Tramway Terminus.

(e) By now a ‘Command Observation
Post ’’ with direct lines to Fortress H.Q. was
operating well from the Peak, manned by
HKYVDC, and also two special observation posts
(pill box 69 and Kennedy Rd.) manned by
2/14 Punjab Regt.*

Af.Enemy.,.was, observed collecting small
craft“in Kowloon Bay——possibly for a raid;
Special arrangements were made to counter this
viz.: a,concentration was fired by 6-in. Howit-
zers and two craft were set alight. Orders were
also issued from Fortress HQ to the A.A, search-
lights at Saiwan and Braemar to cease their
normal role at any time if they heard con-

* The Peak Observation Post was forced to move
three times, for each location quickly came under
heavy and accurate artillery fire in spite of every
precaution for concealment. Treachery was certain
but the source could not be ascertained.

tinuous machine gun fire on the North shore
and to turn their lights down to illuminate
the harbour.

49. At 2100 hours, 15th December, an
attempted landing was reported by the Pak
Sha Wan Battery (HKVDC). It was ascer-
tained later from several sources that a very
bold attempt was made by the enemy who,
with small rubber boats and petrol tin rafts
for equipment, swam across in fair strength—
estimates varied from one to three Companies.
All were shot in the water, the depleted battery
(see para. 43 (b)) contributing stout defence.

50. (a) For four hours on 15th December
Pinewood A.A. Battery was shelled by calibres
up to g-n. One gun was smashed irreparably
and the other so badly damaged that it was
out of action for the remainder of the battle.
All instruments were rendered useless. Casual-
ties to personnel were not numerous and men
not hit were employed on salvage, and in an
infantry role with 2/14 Punjab Regiment. We
alin two hits on enemy aircraft during the

lay. 2

(b) The general impression of Japanese
artillery fire was that their gunners were ex-
tremely accurate on targets which were
obviously well known from our peace time dis-
positions and under direct observation, ‘but
inaccurate in picking up new targets needing
predicted fire, in spite of abundant air recon-
naissance. About 30 per cent. of the ammuni-
tion burst defectively and of the heavier natures
at times 50 per cent. failed to explode.

51. During this day (15th December) the
last of the ‘‘ Priority A ”’ anti-personnel mine-
fields was completed by Fortress R.E.

The morale of the civilian population_ re-
mained shaky, chiefly due to rice distribution
difficulties. The Chungking Government repre-
sentatives had been most helpful in assisting
in the maintenance of order.

52. News was received from the Chinese
General Staff of the advance of Chinese forces
towards Hong Kong. This fitted in with the
plans which I hed previously received via
Chungking of the proposed attack of General
Yu Han Mou’s 7th Armiy. However, the in-
formation now was modified by the statement
that effective assistance could not ‘be available
until early January. Information of intended
help from Chinese forces from the North was
circulated to formations and units.

53. At daybreak 16th December observation
revealed no enemy movements along the main-
land waterfront between Kai Tak and the
Kowloon Star Ferry, but launch activity in
Kowloon Bay continued.

54. Bombing and shelling by the enemy
were now showing a higher standard of accuracy
and increasing in intensity, being confined
mainly to militafy objectives The first air
raid occurred at ogoo hours and lasted thirty-
five minutes.

In the afternoon, 16th December, seventeen
enemy planes bombed Mount Davis, which was
also heavily and accurately shelled: an unex-
ploded 9-in. shell entered the Fortress Plotting
Room and damaged the instruments. A bomb
dropped in Shaukiwan caused 150 civilian
casualties. Shek O, Lyemun and Aberdeen
were also bombed; some casualties to Royal
