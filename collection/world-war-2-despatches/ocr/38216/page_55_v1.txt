fight on the 6th March to reconnoitre. The remainder of A.H.Q. and other Army and R.A.F. personne] in the area of Bandoeng, except the ground party at Andir, were moved to Tasik Malaja the same day.

580. The distribution of Air Force personnel on the 6th March (p.m.) was: 

(a) Tasik Malaja, preparing for

defence, with Army Units also ordered there sss 900 (b) Contingent with   Blackforce   450

(c) Andir area, aerodrome Sai and units ase wes .. 850

(d) Poerwokerto area awaiting

evacuation, under Air Commodore Silly's orders . . 2,500

(e) Detached from units, stragglers,

escape parties, etc., in south central Java os see 400 Total - 5,100

581. The orders issued to the various contingents on the 6th March were: 

(a) The Andir contingent was to surrender  because Bandoeng was being declared an  open   town, and on that day there was no transport to move them.

(6) The Poerwokerto contingent was to place itself under the orders of the local Dutch Commander, stand fast and surrender. There

was no alternative as the men were unarmed .

and had very slender rations and other resources. They would have been an embarrassment to a final stand in the hills, yet would have had to share its hardships and any retmbution which might be meted out. They were therefore less likely to come to harm if they were not associated with further resistance.

(c) The Tasik Malaja contingent was to defend to the last the aerodrome area, where the G.O.C. and A.O.C. would rejoin them if a-better place for continuing the fight was not found.

582. Reconnaissance of the Santosa area on 6th March drew a blank. Not only was the terrain unsuited for defence by a small force, but the local Dutch had no defence plan, obviously did not want fighting to occur there, and were only too ready to assist the British to the coast.

583. As the result of a suggestion from

General Schilling, who was most helpful to the Bnitish in their wish to continue resistance, the area south of Tjikadjang was reconnoitred on 7th March.  It was found more suitable for protracted defence. It was therefore decided to concentrate all army units and all armed R.A.F. personnel in the defence of that area.

584. In conformity with this decision orders were issued to the following to move to the area on 8th March: 

(a) The Andir contingent, for whom trans-   port was now available; and

(6) the Tasik Malaja contingent.

Both of these contingents were armed. In addition,   Blackforce   and all other British Army Units in Java were also ordered to the area. The total combined force was about 8,000 strong.

585. At the same time it was confirmed that the remainder of the personnel, who were unarmed, were to stand fast and surrender. The Dutch G.O.C. of the Poerwokerto area, under whose direction Air Commodore Silly had placed the Poerwokerto contingent in accordance with his instructions, ordered them to move further west because unarmed forces would be an embarrassment in a locality where he intended to resist the Japanese advance. This was done under his arrangements and the contingent arrived at Tasik Malaja on 8th March (p.m.). It had suffered severe casualties owing to its rail convoy having been ambushed en route.

586. On 7th March (p.m.) AH K declared Bandoeng, Tasik Malaja and Garoet   open   towns. This action had been anticipated for Bandoeng but in respect of the other two it came as a complete surprise, and it did not assist the concentration of the British Forces in the hills, which was by now in progress.

587. Early on 8th March moves to the concentration area in the hills began. A combined Army/Air HQ. was established at: Tyikadjang with W/T station alongside to communicate with the Air Ministry, etc.

Order to Surrender received from Dutch H.Q. 588. At about ogoo hours 8th March, a rough

- translation of a broadcast by the Dutch C.-in-C.

was received at British H.Q. at Tyikadjang. It had been promulgated in the name of all the Allied Forces in Java as well as in that of the Dutch. At about 1030 hours it was telephoned through in English by, it is believed, Colonel Gulik the Dutch Air Staff Officer at A.H.K., who had come for the purpose to Garoet at the foot of the hills. It was to the effect that   all organised resistance   in Java had ceased and that troops were to offer no further resistance to the Japanese. Colonel Gulik said that the Dutch C -in-C. had cancelled his instructions about disregarding surrender orders and that he intended this order to be obeyed. The last was quite unexpected.

589. The A.O C. received this message and, in the absence of the G.O.C., who was reconnoitring the area and allocating defence positions, he first sent a despatch rider to inform the G.O.C., and then, feeling that further clarification was desirable, went himself to Garoet to make further enquiries.

590. At Garoet the Dutch Resident, Heer Koffman (the District Civil Administrator) who had on.the previous day, 7th March, strongly emphasised the difficulties of local supplies and accommodation, and had been apprehensive about the prospects of a  * massacre of whites   if guerilla warfare was attempted particularly amongst the difficult natives of the Garoet district, now on 8th March re-emphasised his belief in the dangers of a native rising if fighting in the hills was attempted. He called in other authorities to support his opinion amongst them the District Regent (Native District Administrator).

591. The A.O.C. rang up A.H.K. and spoke (it is believed) to Colonel Gulik who confirmed that the Dutch C.-in-C. had cancelled his order, and that he intended his latest instruction, namely for fighting to stop, to be obeyed.  He said that all Dutch troops were complying. The A.O.C. then telephoned to several other Dutch centres and found this to be so in each instance.
