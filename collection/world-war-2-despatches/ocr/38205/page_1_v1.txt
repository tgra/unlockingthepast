less surrounded with great difficulties. The preTequisite that the whole of the North African coastline should be cleared of the enemy meant that the battle in Tunisia took first priority and, until that was concluded, it would be impossible to know what resources would be available for the invasion of Sicily. The question of the date to be aimed at was also affected. It was calculated at Casablanca that the Tunisian campaign would be completed by Ist May and the target date for Sicily was provisionally fixed at the favourable moon period in July. The Combined Chiefs of Staff subsequently directed that an attempt should be made to advance this date to the corresponding period in June. This proved impossible, owing to the need for adequate training for the assaulting divisions and the preparation of the necessary administrative basis for the operation, and on 15th April the Combined Chiefs of Staff agreed that roth July should be the target date.

Elements of the Problem.

The problems to which the main attention could be directed in the early stages of planning were those presented by geography and logistics and the probable scale of enemy resistance. The island of Sicily has been compared to  a jagged arrowhead with the broken point to the west.  The total area is about ten thousand square miles, the greatest measurement from east to west is one hundred and fifty miles and the length of the coastline is about six hundred miles In the north-eastern corner Cape Peloro is separated from the peninsula of Calabria by the Straits of Messina, only two miles at their narrowest. Cape Passero, the south-eastern corner, scene of a British naval victory in 1718, is about fifty-five miles due north of the island of Malta and about four hundred mules from Benghazi. At the western end of the island Cape Boeo (also known as Cape Lilibeo) is about ninety miles to the northeast of Cape Bon in Tunisia. In the straits between Tunisia and Sicily lies Pantelleria
