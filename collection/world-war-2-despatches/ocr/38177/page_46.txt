towards Tobruk and El] Adem. There was a
third possibility that he might try to break
through the northern sector of our position with
the object of opening the coast road at once
and easing his supply problem, but it was
thought most unlikely that he would adopt' this
course.

The Enemy Plan of Attack.

Documents captured by our troops at an early
stage of the ensuing battle disclosed the complete
enemy plan of attack,

The Afrika Korps and goth Light Division
Battle Group were to concentrate north of
Segnali on the evening of 26th May. On the
27th May, after a night advance, the Ariete
Armoured Division was to capture Bir Hacheim,
while the Trieste Motorised Division was to make
a gap in the minefield south of the Sidi Muftah’
strongpoint, where it was crossed by the Trigh
el Abd. Simultaneously the Afrika Korps was
to form up south of Bir Hacheim with 21st
Panzer Division (less one battalion of tanks) on
the left, 15th Panzer Division in the centre and
the goth Light Division Battle Group on the
right, These formations were then to advance
northwards and, after destroying our armoured
forces, were to reach Acroma and El] Adem
before nightfall. Motorised columns were to
seize Sidi Rezegh and Ed Buda. -On 28th
May, the three armoured divisions were to attack
our positions between Gazala and Alem Hamza
from the east, while four Italian infantry divi-
sions, stiffened by two regiments of the goth
Light Division and one tank battalion of the
zist Panzer Division, were to attack’the same
positions from the west.

Tobruk was to be captured during the two
subsequent days.

Our Dispositions to Meet Attack.

the enemy’s attack were as follows: —

13th Corps. Lieutenant-General W. H. E.

The rst South African Division was holding
the front from the coast west of the Gazala inlet
to Alem Hamza, astride the Via Balbia and the
approaches to Tobruk south of the coastal
escarpment. The r51st and 69th Infantry
Brigades of the 50th Division were prolonging
the line eastwards from the Alem Hamza salient
to the point where it again turned southwards.
The rs5oth Infantry Brigade was holding the
detached strongpoint of Sidi Muftah. The st
Army Tank Brigade (heavy tanks) was divided
between these two infantry divisions in a sup-
porting task.

The and South African Division occupied the
western part of the Tobruk defences and small
strongpoints below the escarpment towards
Gazala. The 9th Indian Infantry Brigade held
the eastern half of the Tobruk perimeter.

The Free French Brigade Group was holding
the detached strongpoint at Bir Hacheim. The
3rd Indian Motor Brigade arrived just before
the 26th May and was set to prepare a defen-
sive locality a few miles east of Bir Hacheim.
The 29th Indian Infantry Brigade of the 5th
Indian Division had moved to a defensive area
at Bir el Gubi a few days before the battle
began. The ist Armoured Division was disposed
round Knightsbridge and the 7th Armoured
Division lay to the south of it with the 7th
Motor Brigade holding a defensive locality be-
tween the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade and Bir
el Gubi.

Advanced headquarters of the Eighth Army
with the headquarters of the Air Officer Com-
manding Western Desert, Air Vice Marshal
Coningham, were near Gambut, guarded by the
Zoth Infantry Brigade of the 5th Indian Divi-
sion (Major-General H. R. Briggs).

Two brigades of the 5th Indian Division, the
roth and agth, had been occupying the frontier
positions at the beginning of May, but General
Ritchie did not like having to immobilise this
division which formed his principal reserve of
infantry. Therefore, as soon as I received infor-
mation that an attack was imminent, I arranged
for fresh infantry formations to join him. I
gave orders for the r1th Indian Infantry Brigade
from Cyprus and the 2nd Free French Brigade
to take over on the frontier, so as to release
the roth and 29th Indian Infantry Brigades to
go to Gambut and Bir el Gubi respectively. On
the arrival of the roth Indian Division (Major-
General T. W. Rees), which I had already
ordered to move from Iraq, the 11th Indian In-
fantry Brigade was to be withdrawn and the
and Free French Brigade freed for other em-
ployment. But very soon after the battle
started, I placed these two brigades also at
General Ritchie’s entire disposal, so that he
should be free to concentrate the 5th Indian
Division. I also arranged to bring over from
Syria the Guides Cavalry, who were equipped
with carriers and armoured cars.

I was satisfied that the Eighth Army had
enough infantry to deal with any situation likely
to arise-more would probably have been an
encumbrance. But I wished it could have had
more field artillery as there was no reserve of ©
guns at the disposal of the two Corps Com-
manders, or of General Ritchie himself, with.

Group.
