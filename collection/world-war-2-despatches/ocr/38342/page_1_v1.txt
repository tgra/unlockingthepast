The following Despatch was submitted to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on the ath January, 1942, by Admiral Sir JOHN C. TOVEY, K.C.B., D.S.O., Commander-mChief, Home Fleet.

Home Fleet. 7th January, 1942.

Be pleased to lay before Their Lordships the attached report on Operation   Archery. 

2. The operation was well conceived, planned and rehearsed with skill and thoroughness, and executed with great efficiency, precision and boldness. Though a minor operation, it affords a fine example of smooth and effective cooperation between the three Services and reflects great credit on Rear-Admiral H. M. Burrough, C.B., Brigadier J. C. Haydon, D.S.O., O.B.E., and all officers, ratmgs and ranks taking part.

3. The co-operation of the aircraft of Coastal and Bomber Commands was most effective. The operation could not have proceeded without it.

(Signed) Jack C. Tovey, Admyal, Commander-in-C hief.

' From: THE NAVAL AND MILITARY COMMANDERS, OPERATION   ARCHERY. 

Date: 2nd January, 1942.

To: THe ComMMANDER-IN-CHlEF, HOME FLEET. The following report, by the Naval and

Military Commanders, on. Operation

 * Archery   which was carried out on Saturday,

27th December, 1941, is forwarded.

2. The intention of Operation   Archery   was to carry out a raid on military and

economic objectives in the vicinity of Vaagso Island with the object of harassing the coastal defences of S.W. Norway and diverting the attention of the enemy Naval and Air Forces from Operation   Anklet. *

Planning.

3. The Naval and Military Commanders were appointed on 6th December, 1941, which gave three weeks to plan and rehearse the operation. This is considered to be the absolute minimum time required. At least two full rehearsals. should take place to allow timing and communications to be perfected. Weather conditions frequently make rehearsals impossible for days on end and this must be allowed for in the programme.

4. After the preliminary meeting between the Force Commanders and the Air Adviser to the Chief of Combined Operations, the plan was drawn up in London. It is strongly recommended that this procedure be followed in future as the facilities for obtaining the latest intelhgence and information of all kinds are so much better than those elsewhere. ~
