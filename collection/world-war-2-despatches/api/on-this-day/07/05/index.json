The assault troops of the 51st Division were moved in Janding craft from Sousse and Sfax, and Main Army Headquarters and the 30th Corps Headquarters with air formations, also in landing craft, from Tripoli to Malta. The ferrying of these troops with their vehicles, equipment and maintenance stores, involved the most careful planning in conjunction with the Royal Navy for the use of the landing craft available. Before the attack was launched the Tripoli-Malta ferry had convoyed 7,000 personnel and 1,400 vehicles. In all some 32,000 personnel and 6,000 vehicles, as well as guns and tanks, were embarked at Tripoli for Sicily. Other headquarters and units with equipment, stores and vehicles were moved from Egypt to Malta in personnel and M.T./Stores ships. From 3rd to roth June, 7,000 personnel and 600 vehicles were despatched from  Alexandria to Malta.",

In the centre, the sector of 30 Corps, we had made steady progress, but the nature of the country and the exiguous road-net meant that that progress had been slow. Vizzini was captured on the r4th, after strong resistance, by 51 Division assisted by 45 (United States). The Canadians then went into the lead capturing Grammichele and Caltagirone on the 15th and Piazza Armerina on the 16th.f Their next objective was Enna, the centre of the island and meeting point of a network of main roads against which the bomber effort of the air forces had been focussed during the first five days of the invasion. Seventh Army was now reorganising in order to meet the needs of its changed directive. On 5th July General Patton created a Provisional Corps Headquarters to command the left flank of the Army, consisting of 3 Infantry Division, with under command 4 Tabor of Goums,{ old friends from Tunisian days, and 82 Airborne Division. II Corps continued to command the right flank with z and 45 Divisions, while 2 Armoured Division was under Army command. II Corps had made good progress northwards and 45 Division  on its right had co-operated with 30 Corps in the capture of Vizzini and Caltagirone; on the 16th, however, the Division reached the new inter-Army boundary and started to transfer to the left wing of the Corps, behind 1 Division. 3 Division in the Provisional Corps made ground westwards along the coast and inland beyond Canicatti, which it had captured on the 12th.

The only incidents which occurred to mar the precision of this remarkable concentration were the loss by submarine attack of four ships in convoy, the CITY OF VENICE and ST.

The passage of the convoys was covered most effectively by the operations of the North-West African Coastal Air Force, of No. 201 (Naval Co-operation) Group, of squadrons operating under Air Headquarters Air Defence, Eastern Mediteranean, and, on D-1 day, ofthe North-West African Tactical Air Force Squadrons based on Malta. Their problem was one of a complexity equal to our own. It was solved with conspicuous success, since no bomb was dropped on any convoy the majority were not sighted by enemy aircraft and all reports showed that the fighter cover was excellent.",

            "description": "It will be noted that no decision had been taken, at the time this directive was issued, whether ANVIL should be mounted or not; on the other hand the forces to be provided for it from Italy had now risen to seven divisions. This uncertainty was a very great handicap to our planning, and its psychological effect on the troops expecting to be withdrawn, especially on the French, was undoubtedly serious. It is hard to expect troops to give of their best when they are continuously  ' looking over their shoulder   to a new objective, particularly when it is so attractive an objective as the liberation of their own country. This situation lasted throughout June. On the 14th I was instructed that VI Corps Headquarters was to be withdrawn at once, 3 Division on 17th June and the 36th on 27th June. On the 24th a French division was to be withdrawn to the Naples area, followed by a second in the first week of July. On the same day  the Combined Chiefs of Staff signalled   the destruction of the German armed forces in Italy, south of the Pisa-Rimini line, must be completed. There should be no withdrawal from the battle of any Allied forces that are necessary for this purpose  . Nevertheless I was informed on the 16th that, in order to preserve the possibility of mounting ANVIL, it was necessary to proceed with the programme of withdrawal of forces already laid down. We could still hope that we might get these troops back again later but this became more unlikely after it was known that General Eisenhower had strongly recommended the operation in a signal of 23rd June. The final decision in its favour was communicated to me on 5th July. ANVIL* was eventually launched on 15th August.",

The enemy was in no mood to accelerate his withdrawal, now that he was back   on balance   again; after being driven off the Trasimene line on 2gth June he Went back fairly steadily until 5th July but on that day he began once more to call a halt.

The broad and fertile Val di Chiana leads up to it from the west side of Lake Trasimene but some three miles short of it the plain ceases and the road turns north-eastwards to enter the town through a comparative defile. The advance on Arezzo from the Trasimene line was relatively rapid both by 13 Corps and ro Corps, though the latter was employing only one infantry division and an armoured brigade. 13 Corps first met stiff resistance lafe on 5th July.  The full strength of the German position was not immediately appreciated, for the exposed approaches and heavy shelling made reconnaissance difficult, and for the next three days the leading brigades continued to probe forward in the expectation that the Germans would turn once more to withdrawal under continued pressure without our having to mount a full-scale attack. 6 Armoured Division in the valley, having relieved 78 Division, attempted to press on by the direct route to Arezzo and succeeded in gaining a tenuous foothold on Monte Lignano, due south of the town on the right hand side of the-defile. On the Corps  left 4 British Infantry and 6 South African Armoured Divisions tried to break through the enemy defences on the hills running parallel to the Arezzo-Siena road and thus break into the Arno valley west of Arezzo but though 4 Division succeeded in seizing one of the hills, Poggio all Olmo, the main line held firm.",
