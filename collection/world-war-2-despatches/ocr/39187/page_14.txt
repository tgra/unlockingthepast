115. 4 Corps. The leading division (19
Indian) of 4 Corps entered the forward zone
early in November, and concentrated in the
area of the Tamu — Sittaung track..

268 Indian Lorried Infantry Brigade was
transferred from 33 to 4 Corps. The order not-to
operate east of the Chindwin was cancelled
and part of the Brigade was disposed on the
east bank of the river.

Summary of Operations,

November,

116. Arakan—15 Indian Corps. There was
no fighting on an important scale. 81 (West
African) Division reached the outskirts of
Paletwa in its advance down the Kaladan.
The leading brigade of 82 (West African)
Division had arrived in Arakan.

117, Chin Hills and Chindwin—33 Corps.
On the 4th November, a brigade of 5 Indian
Division had captured Kennedy Peak, much
equipment falling into our hands. Troops
of this Division had then encircled Fort White,
and forced the enemy to evacuate his positions
on the 8th November. No. 2 and 3 Stockades
yore taken without opposition on 11th Novem-

r.

118. Troops of 11 (East African) Division,
which had been advancing down the Kabaw
Valley, linked up with those of 5 Indian Divi-
sion on the 13th November and Kalemyo fell
on the 15th.

119. North Burma. After consolidating
their positions at Mawlu, 36 British Division
had almost reached Pinwe, six miles north
of the important junction of Naba, by the
12th November. Meanwhile, 38 Chinese
Division had occupied Myothit, sixteen miles
north-east of Bhamo, meeting only slight
opposition.

120. On the 3rd November, Lungling fell to
troops of the Chinese Expeditionary Force,
having changed hands at least four times during
prolonged fighting over many months. It is im-
portant to note that, when the Bhamo area was
finally cleared, we should have a potential fair-
weather route from Burma to China, through
Myothit, Tengchung and Lungling, although an
all-weather road would not be open to us until
Namhkam was taken. Thus we were already
within measurable distance of achieving one of
our objects—the re-opening of land communi-
cations with China.

Naval and Air Co-operation.

121. @) Light coastal forces, comprising for
the most part heavy draught motor launches,
Tesumed operations off the Arakan coast in
October, in support of 15 Indian Corps. The
main operational base was Chittagong, but an
advanced base was also established in the Naf
River, 115 miles south of Chittagong. There
were several successful guerilla operations, and
several enemy aircraft which attempted to
intervene were destroyed.

These small craft harassed the Japanese
lines of communication and made successful
attacks on the enemy’s supply ships.

Flotillas of landing craft, whose crews had
been trained by the Royal Indian Navy, were
employed off the Arakan coast early in
November in landing small raiding parties.

(b) As air operations have been described
in detail in the Despatches of the Air Com-
mander-in-Chief, I have said little of what was

Ist to the 12th

SUPPLEMENT To THs LONDON GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 1951

done by the Air Forces during the period
covered by this Despatch. This Despatch
would, however, be incomplete without some
special remarks on the co-operation between
the Army and the R.AF.

The outstanding feature of the operations
has been the closeness of the co-operation

‘between the Army and the R.A.F., and the

battle may well be described as a true com-
bined operation in which neither Service could
have succeeded without the other.

These combined operations may be con-

sidered under the following headings: —
(@ Strategical.
(6) Tactical.
(c) Administrative.

Strategically the sustained and very
successful attacks on the enemy’s air forces,
aerodromes and communications combined to
destroy his air forces and to restrict the power
of his ground forces. These successes gave
our own forces freedom of manoeuvré and
hampered those of the Japanese so severely
that he was short of ammunition, stores and
equipment during the battle. The long flights
in bad weather over difficult country were
splendid achievements by all ranks of the
RAF.

Tactically, co-operation grew ever closer as:
the battle continued and the R.A.F. assumed
the réle of mobile heavy artillery which could
not be got forward over the roads of Burma.
There is no doubt that the low-level attacks with
bombs and machine guns on the hostile de-
fences were decisive in enabling the infantry
to close with the Japanese. As time went on
communication between the forces on the
ground and the supporting aircraft improved
until it was possible for commanders on the
ground to direct them on to small targets
entirely concealed by the jungle from the air.

Finally, the Army did not feel happy in
attacking Japanese defensive positions unless
they had the co-operation of the fighter-
bomber. :

Close as was the co-operation in the actual
fighting, success could not have been achieved
without the transport of troops, the continued
supply from the air and the evacuation of
casualties.

Apart from the fly-in of Special Force there
were many noteworthy movements of troops,
especially those of 5 and 7 Indian Divisions
and 2 British Division, large parts of which
were flown to Imphal and Dimapur.

These large-scale movements by air defeated
the Japanese plan which counted on contain-
ing our troops in Arakan when they began
their offensive across the Chindwin.

I have written in my earlier Despatch of the
magnificent work done in supplying 4 Corps by
air. The pursuit of the Japanese by 11 (East
African) Division down the Kabaw Valley was
likewise made possible by air supply. There
were numerous other smaller supply operations.

The greatly increased evacuation of
casualties by air gave a great fillip to the morale
of the troops. The figures of 56,800 sick and
wounded casualties flown back during the year
November 1943-November 1944 speak for
themselves.

The Army, as can be seen, has great cause
to be grateful to the R.A-F., and once again
I want on behalf of 11 Army Group to thank
