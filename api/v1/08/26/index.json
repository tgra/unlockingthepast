It is unlikely that they will produce any major effort until their crops are harvested. Major Ringrose, his bodyguard, and one company of 3 Ethiopian Battalion attacked the enemy positions at Cianch between Wolchefit and Bosa on 26th August capturing 108 Italians, 8 natives and some mortars and machine-guns, The patriot forces under, Major Douglas have moved closer to Gondar and, supported by the S.A.A.F., are increasing their pressure on Gondar from this direction. Communications at the moment are , bad, and news is only coming through by runner, taking in some cases five or six days to reach Asmara. '",
