these should not be controlled from India. Since
the great majority of troops in Iraq would in all
probability be Indian and the line of com-
munications through the Persian Gulf to Basra
must be under Indian direction, 1 agreed that
there would be considerable advantage in India
assuming command, at all events of the Basra
base and of operations in lower Iraq. Accord-
ingly, on the landing of this force at Basra,
responsibility for Iraq was handed over to the
Commander-in-Chief in India.

77. The first effects of the landings of troops
were favourable. But when Rashid Ali was
informed that a second brigade would shortly
be landed, he sought to refuse permission until
the original brigade had moved out of Iraq.
While the question was still under discussion
Rashid Ali and the pro-Axis elements in
Baghdad decided to take action against the
Royal Air Force station at Habbaniyah, to
which place the British women and children in
Baghdad had been transferred on 29th April,
in view of the obviously threatening attitude
of certain elements in Baghdad.

78. The Air Force station at Habbaniyah lies
on low ground near the River Euphrates, and
is completely overlooked and commanded by
high ground to the west between the station
and Lake Habbaniyah. This ground is 150 ft.
high and only some 1,000 yards from ‘the
station. The small force of levies at Habbaniyah
was quite insufficient to occupy this high
ground, on which the Iraqi mechanized force of
approximately a brigade, with several batteries
and a number of tanks and armoured cars, in-
stalled itself on 30th April. While the Ambas-
sador at Baghdad was trying to secure the
withdrawal of this Iraqi force by diplomatic
means, its numbers were increased, till by the
evening of Ist May, the total was about 11
battalions with some 50 guns, over 9,000 men
in all. Their attitude became so threatening
that the Air Officer Commanding Iraq, Air
Vice-Marshal Smart, decided that it was essen-
tial to attack these troops without further warn-
ing. Accordingly, in the early morning of and
May, an improvised air force, made up mainly
from the machines in the training school
attacked the Iraqi forces. It was hoped that
the effect of air bombing might shake the
morale of the Iraqi troops and cause them to
withdraw. The attacks did not, however, have
the desired effect, the Iraqis finding good con-
cealment in broken ground and maintaining
their positions, although the ultimate result of
this bombing must have contributed to their
subsequent defeat and further air attacks on
reserves prevented effective reinforcement.

79. The situation of the Royal Air Force in
Habbaniyah was now critical. The defenders
comprised only some 350 British infantry
(flown up from Basra), R.A.F. Armoured Car
Company of 18 cars, about 1,000 Royal Air
Force personnel, and six companies of levies.
They had no artillery and had to defend a peri-
meter of 7 miles, including the river frontage.
The Iraqis on the high ground could command
at close range with artillery and even with
machine-guns the aerodrome from which
machines had to take off and land and had they
made a determined assault, it would hardly
have been possible to withstand them. As it
was they contented themselves with artillery
fire, which did little damage. The Iraqi Air
Force also began bombing attacks on
Habbaniyah.

SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 3 JULY, 1946

Reinforcement or relief of the garrison pre-
sented considerable difficulty; it was tiood
season in Iraq, which made movement from
Basra by rail, road or river towards Baghdad
difficult, and Iraqi forces had occupied points
on the Tigris and on the railway to prevent
movement northwards from Basra. A British
battalion (1st King’s Own Royal Regiment)
was sent by air from Basra to Habbaniyah to |
reinforce the garrison and such aeroplanes as
could be spared from Middle East were sent
to Habbaniyah. These put the Iraqi Air Force
out of action by 7th May, but meanwhile Ger-
man air forces were being transported to Iraq,
using landing grounds in Syria on the way,
without interference and without protest from
the Vichy French.

80. On 5th May, the War Cabinet transferred
the responsibility for Iraq back from India to
Middle East, and I was instructed to send a
force across the desert to relieve Habbaniyah
and occupy Baghdad. The only mobile force
I could make available from Palestine was one
cavalry brigade group. If this force was
despatched to Iraq, there would be no possi-
bility of providing a force for Syria should the
needarise. The Chiefs of Staff accepted this con-
clusion and took the responsibility of ordering
this force to be sent to Iraq. Accordingly,
I made up a motorised column consisting of the
4th Cavalry Brigade, under Brigadier Kingstone
(Household Cavalry Regiment, Wiltshire
Yeomanry, Warwickshire Yeomanry), 60th
Field Regiment, R.A., from Egypt and ist
Essex Regiment. The whole force was placed
under the command of Major-General J. G. W.
Clark, the Commander of the rst Cavalry Divi-
sion. The Arab Legion, a military police force
enlisted in Transjordan from Bedouin Arabs,
also accompanied the force and gave invaluable
assistance.

There was extreme difficulty in raising suffi-
cient transport for even this small force, and it
was not until roth May that it was possible for
the force to advance across the Iraq frontier.
Meanwhile, Iraqi forces had occupied the fort
at Rutbah. The distance from Haifa to the
Transjordan frontier is 284 miles, thence to
‘Habbaniyah, 285 miles.

81. On 7th May, the garrison at Habbaniyah
made a successful sortie and drove the Iraqi
troops from the high ground overlooking the
station, capturing some 400 prisoners, six
and much equipment. The Iraqi forces retreated
to Fallujah on the Euphrates.

On x8th May, Habforce, as Major-General
Clark’s column was termed, after recapturing
Rutbah, where the Arab Legion greatly dis-
tinguished itself, reached Habbaniyah. It
then began an advance on Baghdad by Fal- |
lujah, where, however, it was delayed for some
days owing to the floods making the approaches
to the river impassable for mechanical vehicles.
After the road had been repaired with some
difficulty, Fallujah was captured on roth May.
On 22nd May, an Iraqi force made a deter-
mined attack on Fallujah and succeeded tem-
porarily in reoccupying the town. It was,
however, driven out by a counter attack with
considerable losses,

82. On 23rd May I flew to Basra to meet the
Commander-in-Chief in India, General Sir
Claude Auchinleck, to discuss further reinforce-
ments and operations in Iraq. I instructed
General Quinan, commanding the Indian forces,
now that the situation at Basra was in hand, to
