475. The extent to which efficient signals
communications enter into the successful
launching and controlling of an air operation
is never fully realised until by some chance
these facilities fail, That the channels of sig-
nals communications satisfied the bulk of our
complex needs during the course of the opera-
tion was due to the careful preliminary plan-
ning, as well as to the training of operating and
maintenance personnel, Few difficulties arose
until the break-out from the beach-head and
theerapid moves forward of the air forces.

476. The planning of the W/T and R/T
organisation for point-to-point communications
was nécessarily undertaken many months in
advance of the actual assault, and was on a
carefully co-ordinated United States and British
inter-service basis.

477. The communications required
divided broadly into two categories: —

(a) tactical communications, and
(6) strategical communications.

were

478. The tactical communications were essen-"

tially operational channels required for use
mainly during the assault phase, to be operated
from the Combined Control Centre and Execu-
tive Control Centre to the Assault forces, the
Headquarters ships and the Fighter Direction
Tenders. The strategical communications were
those to be used between Air Force Head-
quarters on the Continent and in the United
Kingdom. These communications included a
number of administrative channels,

479. It was decided to plan and to provide
sufficient W/T communications to enable all
traffic to be handled irrespective of such land-
line or cable circuits as might be provided. In
order to handle rapidly large volumes of sig-
nals traffic, a number of high speed auto W/T
mobile signals units were formed for operation
on jhe main operational and administrative
links between the Continent and the United
Kingdom. 7

480. The British Second Tactical Air Force
and the United States Ninth Air Force planned
their own communications forward of their
Headquarters, The communications rearward
from these Air Forces were planned by
A.E.A.F, and were the main operational and
administrative links to the United Kingdom.
As a result of a survey of traffic passed over
the main W/T links in the North African
theatre, it was decided that operational signals
traffic should be handled separately from
administrative traffic.

481. The implementation of the signal plan
necessitated the building of a number of new
W/T stations in the United Kingdom and the
development of others, No less than two trans-
mitting and four receiving stations were con:
structed, while a further five mobile transmit-
ting stations were introduced. In addition,
three ‘transmitting and three receiving stations
were enlarged and developed.

482. For W/T_ communications, five static
and two mobile R/T transmitting and receiv-
ing sites were set up and put into operation

at points along the South Coast. On the Con-
tinent, the R/T channels were provided by
Mobile Signals Units, which worked on both
Simplex and Duplex circuits; also Radio /Tele-
printer facilities were provided for operation in
addition to, and simultaneously with R/T.

483. During the assault, all the forward units,
in Headquarters Ships and Fighter Direction
Tenders, as well as terminal units on the far
shore such as G.C.I. stations and even smaller
units, including Beach Squadrons, successfully
opened communications as planned. There was
some slight interference experienced on some
channels early in the operation, but this was
quickly overcome and a remarkably high stan-
dard of operation was maintained.

484. In addition to the limited Radar cover
given by the Fighter Direction Tenders, a plan
to provide complete Radar cover over the
beach-head was set in motion on D-Day. Two
complete G.C.I. stations were among the first
equipment to follow the original assault forces
ashore.

485. One of these G.C.I. stations was landed
at mid-day on D-Day and proceeded to a pre-
arranged site. By nightfall, two of its pieces
of equipment were working, together with its
V.H.F., R/T, Air to Ground and D/F chan-
nels, and from 2230 hours on D-Day, night
fighters were controlled from this station.

486. The second G.C.I. station suffered
severe losses, due to being landed on a beach
not cleared of the enemy. There were about
40 casualties, some of which were fatal and
most of the unit’s communication and Radar
equipment was lost. Despite these setbacks,
the one Radar equipment salvaged was set up
and moved to its correct site, where it com-
menced ppenating with borrowed R/T equip-
ment on D + 4. The aircraft controlled during
this first night made a number of contacts,
most of them friendly, but one enemy aircraft
was destroyed and one damaged,

487. By 2oth June (D° + 14), no less than
four G.C.I. type stations, one C.O.L. station,
five F.D.P’s and five Light Warning sets were
in operation in the beach-head area, The Radars
had all been set up at pre-selected sites that
had been chosen by the Operational Research
Section from maps and photographic cover.
That these stations were sited so well is not only
a tribute to the research workers, but also to
the air reconnaissance that supplied the detailed
material for their work.

488. One unsatisfactory feature of signals
communications arose in relation to the major
operational and administrative headquarters
after operational units began to move forward
behind our advancing troops. On a number
of occasions, both Headquarters, Second Tac-
tical Air Force and United States Ninth Air
Force lost touch temporarily with some of
their units as also did Advanced Headquarters,
A.E.A.F., with Stanmore. Moreover, after the
move of my main headquarters to Julouville in
September, where it set up alongside your
Advanced Headquarters, I did not have
adequate telephone or signals communications
with my Advanced Headquarters or the Head-
quarters of the two Tactical Air Forces. I was
much in the dark about what was going on and
the co-ordination of the air effort became ex-
tremely difficult. The position did not
