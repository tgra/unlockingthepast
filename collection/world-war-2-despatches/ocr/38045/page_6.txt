effort. Accordingly the following signal was
made: —

“Tf no ifurther evacuation possible with-

draw.”’

Actually the signal as reported to Commander
McClintock omitted the word ‘‘ if ’’ and from
that time onwards H.M.S. CALPE was unable
to get into touch with him. I supposed at the
time that his M.L. must have been sunk, but
actually he was able to order the withdrawal
of all landing craft, to a pre-arranged position,
4 miles 330° from Dieppe. Consequently
A.L.Cs. 185 and 188, with H.M.S. CALPE
were soon the only craft left close inshore, but
owing to the low visibility, I was not aware
of this at the time.

32. Throughout the whole operation, Com-
mander H. V. P. McClintock, R.N., was of the
greatest service in his capacity of ‘‘ Boat Pool
Officer.” He was ably seconded by Lieut.-
Commander J. H. Dathan, R.N., and Lient.-
Commander C. W. McMullen, R.N. The fact
that over a thousand troops were evacuated
under conditions which can seldom have been
equalled, must be attributed largely to the work
of these officers.

33. At about 1250 I decided to close the
beach wa for a final personal view and keep-
ing A.L.C.s. 185 and 188 on either bow,
H.M.S. CALPE steered for the eastern end of
Red Beach at the same time opening fire from
the foremost guns on the breakwaters, on
which machine gun posts were reported to be
preventing the troops on Red Beach from
reaching the water. When about 9 cables
from the beach, H.M.S. CALPE came under
heavy fire, and no sign of troops or landing
craft other than derelicts could be seen on
the beach. Accordingly, H.M.S. CALPE
manoeuvred to gain the cover of smoke, and I
felt convinced'that any further attempt to‘take
off troops would be unlikely to succeed. Before
finally giving up, however, I proceeded to sea-
ward to close H.M.S. LOCUST and ascertain
Commander Ryder’s views, as it seemed pos-
sible that with H.M.S. LOCUST’S shallow
draught, he might be more aware of the situa-
tion on the beaches. Whilst this interchange
of signals was in progress, however, the General
informed me that the larger body of the troops
on the beach had surrendered. At almost
exactly the same time H.M.S. BERKELEY
(Lieut. J. J. S. Yorke, R.N.) received a direct
hit with a heavy bomb. The ship’s back was
broken, her forecastle awash, and the engine
and boiler rooms were flooding. Fortunately
the loss of life was small, partly owing to the
promptitude with which S.G.B.8 proceeded
alongside to take off her crew and partly
owing to the presence of A.L.C.s. 185 and 188,
who were able to pick up survivors in the
water, I instructed H.M.S. ALBRIGHTON
to sink her, which she did by torpedo fire,

At much the same time a fighter attack was
made on H.M.S. CALPE’S bridge, causing
several casualties, including Air Commodore
A. Cole, C.B.E., M.C., D.F.C., R.A.A.F., who
was severely wounded. ‘The destroyers in the
vicinity of H.M.S. BERKELEY then proceeded
to seaward to join the main convoy of landing
craft and coastal craft who had formed up in
accordance with instructions, approximately 4
miles to seaward of Dieppe and were now head-
ing slowly north.

34. H.M.S. FERNIE was instructed to take
Guide, and shortly afterwards I unwisely in-
structed H.M.S. CALPE to proceed to the east-
ward to pick up a British pilot who was
reported in the water. This resulted in 2
bombing attacks, by dive bombers, on H.M.S.
CALPE, both of which secured near misses
causing damage and casualties.

35. Subsequently H.M.S. CALPE rejoined
the convoy which proceeded without incident,
other than some ineffectual air attacks, through
the Western swept channel, and to a position
approximately.20 miles from Newhaven. At
this point I was joined by Captain (D) 16 with
H.M.S. MACKAY and H.M.S, BLENCATHRA
and I requested him to escort the small craft
into Newhaven, thus releasing H.M.S. CALPE
and the other destroyers and H.M.S. LOCUST
to proceed direct to Portsmouth with their
wounded. who totalled over 500. The coastal
craft and landing craft reached Newhaven
without further incident, and the destroyers
and H.M.S. LOCUST berthed alongside at
Portsmouth shortly after midnight.

36. Before closing this narrative, a word of
praise is due to the medical officers with the
force. An exceptional strain was thrown upon
them, partly by the very large proportion of
casualties among the troops and partly because
the organisation carefully prepared by Sur;
Commander W. B. D. Miller, D.S.C., M.B.,
Ch.B., R.N.V.R., was upset by the turning
back of Group 12. This group, comprising
four spare L.C.Ts., carried an important pro-
portion of the available medical parties. It
was a mistake on my part not to bring them
on, despite the fact that they were no longer
required for an evacuation as originally planned.

37. A detailed account of the work of the
medical parties is reported separately, but the
services performed by Surgeon Lieut. M. P.
Martin, M.R.CS., L.R.C.P., R.N.V.R.,
deserve special mention. This officer was em-
barked in L.C.F.(L) 2, and took charge of her
when her other officers became casualties. Sub-
sequently he was rescued from the water, after
L.C.F.(L) 2 had sunk, and transferred to
H.M.S. CALPE. Although himself injured, he
was untiring in helping -H.M.S. CALPE’S
doctor, who had to compete with casualties to
over a quarier of the crew plus 278 wounded
soldiers.
