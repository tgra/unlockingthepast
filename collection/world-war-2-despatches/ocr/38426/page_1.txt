GENERAL REPORT ON AEGEAN
OPERATIONS.

Events Leapinc up To Our ENTRY INTO THE
E AEGEAN.

The possibility of capturing the island of
‘Rhodes and subsequently opening up the
Aegean (Operation ‘‘ Accolade’) had been
under active consideration since January, 1943.
Outline plans were drawn up but the require-
ments of the advance in North Africa and later
the invasion of Sicily (‘‘ Husky ’’), prohibited
the allocation of forces necessary to mount such
an operation.

2. In April, Force Commanders and their
staffs were assembled in Cairo to plan for
“* Accolade ’* to take place shortly after the
landing in Sicily, when an Italian surrender
was considered possible. By the middle of
June, however, it became apparent that assault
shipping, craft and air forces would not be
available and the Naval Force Commander and
staff were sent to Algiers to plan “‘ post-Husky”
operations in the Central Mediterranean.

3. Following our successful Jandings in Sicily
with unexpectedly small losses of assault ship-
ping and craft, an attempt was made to plan
and mount ‘‘ Accolade” using such forces as
were available in the Middle East or were
earmarked for India. Once again, it became
necessary to call on General Eisenhower to
make up deficiencies, particularly in long range
fighters, and, as a result, ‘‘ Accolade ’’ was
cancelled by decision of the Combined Chiefs of
Staff, at the Quadrant Conference.* The Com-
manders-in-Chief, Middle East informed the
Chiefs of Staff on 31st August that the only
operations which could be mounted from Middle
East were:—

(a) Small Scale Raids.
(b) Sabotage and Guerilla operations by

Resistance Groups.

(c) Unopposed ‘walk-in’? to areas
evacuated by the enemy.

Surrender of Italy to the opening of the German
Air Offensive.

8th to 26th September, 1943.

4. When it was known that Italy had sur-
rendered, it was decided to take advantage of
this situation by encouraging the Italian gar-
risons to hold such Aegean islands as they
could against the Germans, and to stiffen their
resistance by sending in small parties of British
troops. Between 8th and 16th September,
Casteloriso, Kos, Leros, Samos, Kalymnos,
Symi and Stampalia were all occupied by small
detachments of Raiding Force troops accom-
panied by Civil Affairs Officers, Fairmile motor
