SUPPLEMENT to tas LONDON GAZETTE, I9 SEPTEMBER, 1946

Our troops occupied Massawa on 8th April.
The capture of this Port, combined with the
destruction of the enemy naval forces, greatly
reduced the potential threat to our Red Sea
communications. ee

The successful progress of the campaign,
coupled with the almost complete destruction
of the enemy air force on all fronts of Italian
East Africa, now enabled the greater part of
the Squadrons previously contained in the
Sudan to be released to other theatres. Thus,
during the early part of April the remaining
forces operating there were reduced to No. 47
(B) Squadron (Wellesleys), No. 237 (B) Squad-
ron (Hardys, Lysanders and Gladiators) and
the Free French Flight (Blenheims). Other
units, consisting of No. x Squadron, S.A.A.F.,
No. 14 Squadron, No. 223 Squadron, ‘““K”
Flight and No, 1430 Flight were moved with
what aircraft remained to them to Egypt where
they arrived about the middle of April. Nos.
14 and 223 Squadrons took part ih the action
against enemy naval forces described below
before their departure.

54. In the subsequent advance from Asmara
towards Dessie the greater part of the offen-
sive effort against objectives in the Dessie area
was made by aircraft from.Aden and East
Africa. These operations are referred to later.
Wellesleys of No. 47 Squadron and Gladiators,
Lysanders and Hardys of No. 237 Squadron

- nevertheless made attacks on a light scale on
objectives in the vicinity of Amba Alagi where
our advance from the North was held up.

’ Bombing and machine-gun attacks were made
on enemy troops and M.T. at Mai Ceu, Alomata
and Amba Alagi and on the aerodromes at
Alomata, Cercer and Sifani. The scale of
attack in this area was considerably increased
after 27th April when our column from the
South captured Dessie, Nos. 47 and 237 Squad-
tons making over 80 bomber and fighter sorties
on enemy positions around Amba Alagi be-
tween 28th April and 3rd May to break down
the remaining resistance. The enemy was still
holding out, however, at the end of the period
under review, although the forces -there, uftder
the Duke D’Aosta, ‘subsequently capitulated
on 16th May.

Operations at Gondar and in the Lake Tana
area were continued throughout this period,
27 medium bomber sorties being made by Free
French Flight Blenheims and Wellesleys of
No. 47 Squadron, the former providing more
than half the total effort. The main weight
of this attack was against enemy positions and
M.T. at Gondar, while other attacks were made
on similar objectives at Bahr Dar South of Lake
Tana, at Chelga, Gorgora and on the Gondar-
Adowa Road.

It appeared likely at the end of this period

-that, with our troops held up in the Volchit
Pass, Gondar would be the last serious military
objective in Italian East Africa.

55. Great credit is due to the A.O.C., Air
Commodore L. H. Slatter, O.B.E., D,.S.C.,
D.F.C., for his most efficient handling of the
R.A.F. and for his excellent team-work with
the Army. No praise can be too high for the
pilots and aircrews for their accomplishments.
Many were flying in obsolescent single engine
aircraft. The country was difficult, and much
of the flying had to be done at low heights
over hostile positions. Great devotion to duty
and a high standard of skill were needed to
achieve success under these exacting conditions.

56. In Kenya, under the command of Air
Commodore W. Sowrey, D.F.C., A.F.C., the
Air Force consisted of six South African
Squadrons and one Flight of Glenn Martins,
No. 2 (F) Squadron—Furies and Gauntlets,
No. 3 (F) Squadron—Hurricanes, No. rz (B)
Squadron—Battles, No. 12 (B) Squadron—
J.U.86’s, Nos. 40 and 4z (A.C.) Squadron—
Hartebeestes; a total of 94 aircraft all told.

During January the establishment of ad-.
vanced landing grounds was completed as far

.forward as possible on the fronts facing

Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland. The ad-
vance of General Cunningham’s Force started
on roth February and met with some opposi-
tion from Italian aircraft operating from
Afmadu andGobwen, but the destruction of
7 C.A.133’s and 3 C.R.42’s in the first two
days went a long way towards establishing the
complete air *superiority eventually achieved,
and which, without doubt, affected the whole
course of future operations.

57. On the r1th February, Afmadu was cap-
tured and after a further rapid advance
Kismayu was occupied on 14th February.

After the fall of Kismayu our aircraft assisted
the turning operations which resulted in the
forcing of the River Pl and the dash on
Mogadiscio, Gobwen, adu, Jelib, Bardera
and Dolo were among the targets attacked, also
Ischia, Baidoa and Bur Agaba further North.

By the middle of March the forces thad
reached Gabredarre, having advanced 755
miles in 39 days.

During the remaining operations in March
against Harar and Diredawa intense air attacks
were made on these places, on military targets
in the Jijigga area and on the railway and
stations of the Addis Ababa-Djibuti line. Direct
hits by bombs were scored on several trains
as well as on M.T. on the roads, and traffic was
largely immobilised.

Hurricanes of No. 3 S.A.A.F. Squadron
‘* ground-strafed ’"’ Diredawa aerodrome on
15th March, damaging 2 S.79’s and § G.R.32’s.
Other enemy fighters were shot down in the air
over Diredawa.

At this time enemy bombers made a number
of attacks on our forward troops at Marda Pass
near Jijigga, but did no damage.

On 28th and 30th March enemy fighters
machine-gunned Jijigga aerodrome, damaging
four of our aircraft on each occasion, Two of
the raiders were shot down.

Glenn Martins of the S.A.A.F. did regular
long distance reconnaissances in ‘the Addis
Ababa direction. Further South in the Boran
Area the rains set in early in March, hampering
operations. Our bomber aircraft attacked
enemy positions at Yavello, Neghelli, Moyale
and Mega in support of the Army, and Neghelli
was occupied in March. Thus, by the end of
March, our forces were firmly established with-
in the Southern boundaries of Abyssinia and
further North were already threatening Addis
Ababa along the railway.

On this front alone did®the enemy:show any
activity in the air, but it was only spasmodic,
and in no way hindered the advance of the
Army.

58. After occupying Diredawa on agth

-March our forces resumed their advance and

after a brief check at Awah moved on to Addis
Ababa which surrendered on 6th April. From
