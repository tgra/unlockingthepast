            "description": "137. On the Singora road the advance of the enemy column was delayed by the engagement at Ban Sadao and by demolished bridges and it was not until 0430 hours roth December that contact was again made about the frontier a few miles north of Changlun. Our forward troops withdrew and the 1/14 Punjab Regt., with some artillery and engineers attached, took up a position behind a stream a little south of Changlun Cross Roads. The Commander 15 Brigade was told by the divisional commander that he must hold the enemy north of Asun at least until the mormng of 11th December. He asked for an additional battalion and was given the 2/1 Gurkha Rifles from the 28 Brigade. This battalion took over the Asun outpost position."

            "description": "139.  At about o800 hours 1th December the 1/14 Punjab Regt. was attacked in the Changlun position but succeeded in driving the enemy back, By midday, however, the enemy attacking from the right flank had penetrated into the middle of our position and the Commander of the Covering Force decided to withdraw behind the Asun outpost position, calculating that he would be able to reach there before the enemy tanks could negotiate the damaged bridges. At 1430 hours, however, he was ordered by the divisional commander to occupy a position 14 miles north of Asun with a view to imposing further delay on the enemy. At about 1630 hours, when the force was moving back, covered by a rearguard, occurred the first of many incidents which showed the influence of the tank on the modern battlefield, especially against inexperienced troops. Suddenly with little warning twelve Japanese medium tanks followed by infantry in lorries and other light tanks attacked the rear of the column. Few of the troops had ever seen a tank before. The tanks advanced through the column inflicting casualties and causing much confusion and approached the bridge in front of the Asun outpost position. The demolition exploder failed but the leading tank was knocked out by anti-tank rifle fire and blocked the road The blitz was temporarily stopped, but at considerable cost in men and material. Some 200 men of the.1/14 Punjab Regt. with the Brigadier, all of whom had been cut off, rejoined the following day, but the battalion was temporarily rendered ineffective."

The battalion casualties, however, after three days  and nights  fighting were past the 200 mark. The commander Krohcol estimated that he was opposed by four enemy battalions and reported accordingly to Headquarters 11 Indian Division. It was the night after the affair at Asun recorded above and in reply the Commander 11 Indian Division sent a personal  message to the effect that the object of Krohcol must now be to ensure the safety of the whole division by preventing the enemy from debouching on to the L. of C. about Sungei Patani. The Commander Krohcol was given full permission to withdraw as necessary to the Kroh position, where his stand must be final."

            "description": "135. No really long-range reconnaissance had been carried out by this time, since No. 684 Squadron had only recently received Mosquitoes, and there had not been time to explore the potentialities of this aircraft under tropical conditions. The radius of P.R. cover on the 1st December, excluding the Andaman Islands, was only 680 miles. On 15th December the first cover of Bangkok was obtained and provided much valuable information regarding Japanese dispositions and their use of lay-back airfields. Although Bangkok is now a routine target, the sortie was at that time an outstanding achievement, since the range of the Mosquito in this climate was still undetermined."

The assault was to be made by two Corps, 10 south and II north, supported by very heavy artillery fire and the greatest weight possible of air attack. The enemy was to be made to believe that our intention was to attack further south, acros  the lower Garigliano, by various measures, including naval bombardment between Minturno and Gaeta and feint attacks by 23 Armoured Brigade in the plain between Monte Massico and the river. The operations began with a subsidiary attack on the southern end of the mountains on the night of 1st December and on the next night, while the heaviest concentration of artillery yet fired in the Italian campaign pounded the enemy positions on the heights, 56 Division started for the second time up the steep slopes of Monte Camino. Simultaneously *1 Italian Motorised Group, in about brigade strength, which came under command on 31 October, was used once in an offensive role, but was subsequently employed on less active sectors for which its state of armament and training made it more suitable."

All ground which we had voluntarily vacated west of the Kalapanzin River prior to the monsoon was re-occupied, while, in the coastal sector, 25 Indian Division reached Udaung 13 miles south-east of Maungdaw. The first objective allotted to 25 Indian Division and 82 (West African) Division when the main offensive opened was the general line Indin  Htizwe, which was to be secured by the 31st December."
