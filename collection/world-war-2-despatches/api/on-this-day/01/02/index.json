Even after the fall of Leros and the evacuation of Samos, I thought it possible to drive the Germans out from the Aegean if air support could be provided from the airfields which, under Plan 437, were to be operated by the Royal Air Force on the Turkish mainland. __ Accordingly, in December, the 3rd Corps Headquarters began the preparation of Plan HERCULES, for the capture of the key island of Rhodes. On 2nd January, 1944, however, the landing-craft for this operation were diverted to the Anzio landing in Italy, and HERCULES was cancelled; nevertheless, in the-hope that Plan 437 would ensure Turkish co-operation, planning was continued and all the possibilities of such an operation were investigated."

In_ the meantime the Commander Kuantan Force had been ordered to hold the aerodrome till the 5th January (see Section XXXI) and this had been later extended to the roth January. On the 2nd January, however, events on the west coast and the serious threat to our communications there forced the Commander 3 Indian Corps to expedite the programme and early on the morning of the 31d January the Commander Kuantan Force received orders to withdraw his force to Jerantut forthwith. During the day the enemy closed in on the aerodrome and at about 1745 hours, as the withdrawal was taking place, a strong attack developed and very heavy fighting took place. It was during this action that Lt.-Col. Cummings, commanding the 2/12 Frontier Force Regt., won the Victoria Cross. During the withdrawal the rearguard was twice ambushed on the main road by a Japanese force, which had passed by bush tracks west of the aerodrome, and suffered heavy casualties."

            "description": "30. In November, the only R.A-F. transport squadron operating was No. 31, an experienced and pioneer unit, but the Ist and 2nd Troop Carrier Squadrons U.S.A.A.F. had begun to work over the northern sector of the front and there were other squadrons both British and American, either in training or on their way. Unified operational control of these forces was effected by the institution in December of Troop Carrier Command, Eastern Air Command, under Brigadier General W. D. Old, U.S.A.A.F., administrative control remaining in the usual British or American channels.. Headquarters was _ established at Comilla on 2nd January, 1944, in close proximity to the Headquarters of Fourteenth Army and of the Third Tactical Air Force, as well as to main Army supply bases. Subsequent operations illustrated the dependence of air transport operations upon the tactical air situation, and in order to combine final responsibility for the former with the exercise of our air superiority as well as to integrate air transport with army policy Troop Carrier Command was placed under the .control of the Air Commander, Third Tactical Air Force, from Ist May. Subsequently Troop Carrier Command was dissolved as from 4th June, by when its component squadrons numbered 8 4 R.A. and 4 U.S.A.A.F. Moreover, in February the Air Transport Command had loaned to'me twenty-two Commandos (C.46) to meet the emergency in the Arakan, and when it became necessary to return these in April, five US.A.A-F. Troop Carrier squadrons and the larger part of 216 Squadron R.A.F, were detached to work with my Command from M.A.A.F. Upon their return to the Mediterranean theatre in June, aircraft and crews from the Strategic Air Force were attached to the Third Tactical Air Force to fill the gap until the first of the U.S.A.A.F. Combat Cargo Groups became operational. During its short but eventful life of little over six months, Troop Carrier Command had thus increased more than four-fold in size, and even more in significance."
