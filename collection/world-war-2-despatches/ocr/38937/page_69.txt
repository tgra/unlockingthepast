SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

preparation almost as though it were not there.
Only two assets now remuined to Kesselring to
retrieve the situation: the excellence of his
Jateral communications and the fact that the
“* Gothic’’’ line had been built on the forward
slopes of the range. The importance of the
former factor in allowing a rapid reinforcement
I have aeady emphasized; the latter meant
that there was still one more ridge between the
Allies and the plains, known from the village
on its summit as the Coriano ridge. The
Canadians were already over the Conca, on
2nd September, and 5 Corps were about to pass
ir Armoured Division ‘through in a dash for
the flat country beyond. Just in time
Kesselring succeeded in manning the Coriano
ridge with’ 1 Parachute, 26 Panzer and 29
Panzer Grenadier Divisions; these three ex-
cellent divisions, aided by very heavy rain from
5th to 7th September, resisted all attacks
between the 4th and the 12th both on the ridge
itself and on its southern flank at Gemmano.
As Eighth Army’s offensive developed its
full extent the enemy was forced to economize
strength on the remainder of his front by
withdrawing into the ‘Gothic ’’ line. This
was essential if he were to be able to
make further reinforcements avajlable for
his left; it was also a natural measure
of. precaution in case a real _break-
through was achieved for, apart from LXXVI
Corps, now engaged with Eighth Army, the
rest of the German troops were still well south
of the watershed of the Apennines. The with-
drawal began on 30th August. LI Mountain
Corps, between Urbino and Pontassieve, moved
straight back into the line on a timed pro-
gramme, releasing one division for the central
sector, and 10 Corps, following up, made con-
tact with the line on 3rd September. At the
same time the enemy opposite Fifth Army
began to pull back. On the extreme right they
went back almost directly into the ‘‘ Gothic ”’
line. Opposite 13 Corps, however, the enemy
stabilized on 3rd September on the line of hills
north of Florence: Monte Morello, Monte
Senario, Monte Calvana and Monte Giovi. IV
Corps followed up across the Arno on 31st
August and II Corps on Ist September. Little
Tesistance was met and we were able to occupy

the northern part of Pisa on the 2nd, Lucca on ,

the 6th and Pistoia on the r2th.

This enemy withdrawal made it easier to
concentrate forward the Fifth Army troops
which were to launch the second punch of my
two-handed attack on the ‘‘ Gothic ’’ line.
Moreover, in the course of the withdrawal
Kesselring still further weakened his centre,
from which he had already removed 29 Panzer
Grenadier Division, by relieving 356 Infantry
Division and sending it over. to the Adriatic. I
decided, therefore, that the time was almost
come for the Fifth Army attack to go in. I
visited Eighth Army front on 8th September
and it was clear to me from what I saw there
that we could not continue our advance on to
Rimini until we had driven the enemy off the
Coriano ridge. This would need full prepara-
tion and would probably take two or three
days more. I explained the situation in a
signal next day, 9th September, and concluded
by saying that for these reasons I had decided
to unleash Fifth Army who would now go
ahead with their offensive in the centre. The
enemy’s forces there were as weak as we could

2947

ever expect them to be and he was obligingly
withdrawing from the high ground north of
Florence without serious resistance, which
saved us time and trouble. As soon as Fifth
Army had forced the enemy back to the
“* Gothic ’’ line they would launch a full-scale
attack to break through and by that time I
hoped Eighth Army would be just about ready
for their attack on the Rimini positions and
that we should be able to prevent Kesselring
from shifting reserves from one Army front to
another by keeping up a series of heavy blows
by our two Armies in turn. The weather had
improved and I hoped for a fine spell—another
reason for launching Fifth Army then.

All preparations for Fifth Army’s attack had
been made by 8th September. The main blow
was to be delivered by II Corps but, in order
to gain surprise, its concentration was to be
secret and it was to be launched into the attack
through 13 Corps. The plan was that 13
Corps should attack first with 8 Indian Divi-
sion to capture the line of hills from Monte
Morello to Monte Giovi, already mentioned,
then, in the second phase, II Corps would
pass through the left of 13 with its four
divisions (34th, 85th, 88th and gist) and ad-
vance up the axis Florence-Firenzuola. 13
Corps would shift its main thrust to the right
and continue to advance up the two roads
Dicomano to Forli and Borgo San Lorenzo
to Faenza. IV Corps was to exert the maxi-
mum pressure in its area with 6 South African
Armoured Division, a Negro Regimental Com-
bat Team and ‘‘ Task Force 45’ and release
x Armoured Division for Army reserve to be
used if a chance of exploitation arose.

This plan could not be carried out in its
original form, for on 8th September the enemy
withdrew voluntarily from the line of hills
which was to have been 13 Corps’ objective in
the first phase. This was gratifying in itself
and represented a further gain in that it gave
us the chance of launching an attack on an
enemy already engaged in withdrawing which,
as Eighth Army’s experience had shown, was
one of the surest means of obtaining surprise.
On roth September, therefore, 91 and 3¢
Divisions of II Corps passed through 1 British
Infantry Division on the left of 13 Corps,
astride Route 65, and began an advance
directed on the ‘‘ Gothic ’’ line north of the
River Sieve. Considerable gains were made on
the roth and xr1th as both Corps pressed on
across the Sieve in face of little resistance,
capturing Dicomano, Borgo San Lorenzo and
Scarperia. The Germans offered only delay-
ing resistance as they drew back into the

.* Gothic ’’ line but the weight of the Allied

attack surprised and disconcerted them and
pushed them back quicker than they had ex-
pected or were prepared for. It was not until
the strong position of Monte Calvi was cap-
tured on the r2th that it became clear that
this was not merely an attack to gain contact
with the line but to break through it.

Simultaneous Attacks by Fifth and Eighth

Armies.

On the night of rath September Eighth
Army reopened its attack on the Coriano ridge
and in the early morning of the 13th Fifth
Army began the assault of the main ‘‘ Gothic ’*
line positions in the cenfre «ite pues ta

fighting on both fronts that either Army had
