47. Owing to the troop carriers sailing for the Clyde a few hours after our return to Scapa it has not been possible for me to obtain details of the military operation with sufficient accuracy to make any but the most general reference to them in this report. It has, however, been arranged for copies of Brigadier Haydon's report to be forwarded to the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, as soon as it has been prepared.

48 I should lke to record with pleasure that throughout the planning and: execution of this operation Brigadier Haydon co-operated wholeheartedly and at no time did we have the slightest difficulty in reaching mutually satisfactory conclusions. His presence on board SOMALI, with his staff, was most welcome in every way.

Concentration of the force and preparatory work.

4. Operational Headquarters Special Service Brigade, Nos. 3 and 4 Commandos, the Royal Engineers detachment and the Norwegian troops embarked at Gourock in H.M.S. QUEEN EMMA and H.M.S. PRINCESS BEATRIX during the afternoon of Friday, 21st February, 1941, and left for Scapa Flow on the evening of that day. .

Scapa was reached at 1430 hours on the 2and February and the ships were anchored between HAMS. NELSON and H.M.S KING GEORGE

The troops remained at Scapa until the force sailed for the Lofoten Islands at ooor hours on Saturday, rst March, 1941 Thus, there intervened a period of almost a week during which all the final arrangements, plans and orders could be prepared, published and explained and during which those who were to operate together during the operation could meet and get to know one another.:

There can be no doubt whatsoever regarding the essential nature of this comparatively short time of preparation. .  

Though the nature of the raid precluded meticulous rehearsals of the tasks allotted to each troop or detachment, the week at Scapa was invaluable from the military point of view, in that 1t gave both officers and men time to accustom themselves to the ships from which they were to work; to get to know the officers and crews of the landing craft which were to take them inshore, and, in general, to make the personal contacts which are so essential a preliminary to an enterprise of this kind.

5. So far as the Naval and Military Commanders were concerned, the period at Scapa was filled by a series of conferences, at which all details and difficulties were examined and solutions reached. 1

Several points of major importance emerged during these meetings. The first concerned the problem of supporting fire from the destroyers.

Captain C. Caslon, R.N., the Senior Naval Officer, having studied the charts of the area of operations, reached the conclusion that, owing to navigational difficulties, the escorting destroyers would not be able to lie closer than approximately I mile from each port.

This distance, taking into account the somewhat tortuous nature of the approaches, and the half-hghts of early morning, made it unhkely that the destroyers would be in a position
