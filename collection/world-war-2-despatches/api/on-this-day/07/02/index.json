            "date": "2nd July",
            "description": "Except for the semi-permanent fortifications round El Alamein itself, our positions were still weak, disconnected and lacking in depth. Moreover, there was a serious shortage of troops to hold our extended front, and the defence of the all-important Ruweisat Ridge had had to be entrusted to battle groups, weak in infantry,  backed by what remained of our armoured troops. Consequently I decided not to attempt to hold the prepared positions round Bab el Qattara in the centre, and at Naqb Abu Dweis in the extreme south on the edge of the Qattara Depression. In the absence of sufficient armoured troops to support them, I was not prepared to risk their garrisons being isolated and eventually destroyed. I was still very anxious lest a sudden and concentrated attack should break through our defences and repeat what had occurred at Matruh. During the forenoon of 2nd July the enemy appeared to be massing for an attack on the rst South African Division holding the El Alamein fortress, and I considered it essential to deprive him of the power to deliver a concentrated blow in the north. The best way to do this was to attack him. ,",

            "date": "2nd July",
            "description": "It was my fixed intention to wrest the initiative from the enemy at the earliest possible moment; and in spite of our lack of men and equipment I was convinced that the best way to do this was to attack the enemy without delay and give him no rest. I accordingly ordered the 13th Corps, which formed my left wing, to swing forward round the enemy's right flank, which at that time did not extend far to the south, and attack northwards with all the strength it could muster. I had to hold what tanks I had in the centre, ready to counter-attack, should-the enemy try to break through and seize the vital Ruweisat Ridge, the key to our position. Consequently I could spare no more than light tanks and armoured cars to support the 13th Corps. Nevertheless their attack, which started on the 2nd July, went forward with vigour and dash and caused the enemy to form a defensive flank, extending some distance to the west, to save himself being cut off from El Daba. He also had to reinforce his Italian troops in the south by German units from the north, which relieved the pressure on our centre and right. Owing to the relative weakness of our armour, I was unable to maintain the momentum of the attack and carry it to a decisive conclusion. On the other hand the operation achieved considerable results. We had at last recovered the tactical initiative ane",

            "date": "2nd July",
            "description": "Just south of the railway we had extended our front in July beyond the original line by a westward thrust which had captured the two small ridges of Tell el Eisa and Tell el Makhkhad. From this salient the line bent back south-easterly to the perimeter of the Alamein position. Twelve miles south of the shore line rise the slopes of the Ruweisat ridge, a long, narrow elevation about two hundred feet above sea level; at its western end it runs almost due east and west but as it extends eastwards it increases in height and alters its course slightly to north-east, pointing towards El Imayid station, fifteen miles east of E) Alamein. It offers an avenue of reasonably firm going, outflanking the Alamein position, and it was here that the decisive battle of 2nd July had been fought; as a memento of that battle the enemy still held the western end. From here to the south our line trended roughly south by west over ground mainly flat but interrupted here and there by steep-sided depressions of which the Deir el Munassib was the most important. In rear of this part of the front, south-east of the Ruweisat ridge, was a second and higher ridge trending in a north-easterly direction called, from the cairn on its highest point (four hundred and thirty feet), the Alam el Halfa ridge. A strong position for a brigade had been built on the ridge in July defended by wire and minefields. From this position we could command the country to the south, if the enemy, however, succeeded in occupying it, it offered him another corridor of good going by which he could outflank all our positions to the north and  drive direct on Alexandria.",

It had always been foreseen that there would be a large amount for my staff to do on arrival at Malta in the few days available previous to the operation, e.g., the allocation of landing craft by numbers to flotillas and task groups, and the briefing of the large number of landing craft and smaller warships based there. The forethought given to these matters by Vice-Admiral Malta enabled the work to be undertaken expeditiously and with his full understanding. I cannot speak too highly of the assistance given by Vice-Admiral A. J. Power, C.B., C.V.O., and his staff throughout the period that I was in Malta. His organisation enabled the heavy and intricate programme of loading, sailing and refuelling, etc., to proceed without a hitch, and all my requirements were readily and efficiently met.",

Brigade, which was advancing from the north to attack Ukhrul and block the enemy's escape to the east. The third brigade of 7 Indian Division moved back to Kohima, which was to be its rest area.",

At this meeting terms of surrender were discussed and settled. Our troops entered Debra Tabor on 3rd July and took over all important installations. The enemy garrison marched out on 6th July, and, after receiving the honours of war, laid down their arms. Patriots occupied the forts and native quarters. Prisoners captured were 2,400 Halians, 2,000 natives and a miscellaneous collection of M.T., sufficient to lift x,200 men. Six guns and a quantity of ammunition were also taken. The surrender of Debra Tabor was strange, considering the Italian Commander at Gondar intended to relieve this garrison on 15th July.",

A solitary aircraft scored a torpedo hit on the morning of 4th July, the merchant ship later being sunk by our own forces ; and there was an unsuccessful attack by six bombers in the evening.
