SUPPLEMENT‘ to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

same day the C.-in-C. received news of a land-
ing at Kuantan (in para. 205). These two
evenis must have decided the C.-in-C. to aban-
don the Singora operation and to close Kuantan
on the roth December.

217. Had the C.-in-C, notified his change of
plan, it is conceivable that A.H.Q. might have
moved No. 453 (F) Squadron to Kuantan where
it could have stood by at call: R/T inter-com-
munication between the two ships and the
squadron aircraft had already been arranged.
Some effective support might then have been
given. Actually no call for assistance was sent
until the Japanese attack had been pressed
home, by which time intervention from Singa-
pore was impossible.

2x8. It also transpired later that the ships
had been attacked by a force of high level
bombers backed by a large number of torpedo-
bombers, that both ships had suffered a num-
ber of hits by torpedoes and had thus been
sunk. The sinking of these two ships was a
serious shock to the morale of everybody in
the Far East. Their loss, combined with the
American losses at Pearl Harbour, gave the
Japanese an undisputed command of the sea
in Malayan waters. The reactions of this state
of affairs upon the subsequent dispositions of
air units, with particular reference to the share
they were able to take in the land battle, will
become clear later in the narrative.

Arrival of Dutch Reinforcements.

219. Dunng the morning of oth December
the three Dutch Bomber (22 Glenn Martins)
and one Fighter (9 Buffaloes) Squadrons arrived
at Sembawang and Kallang respectively in ac-
cordance with the mutual reinforcement plan.
It was found that the Dutch bomber crews were
not trained in night flying, and so one squad-
ron (9 aircraft) was sent back to the N.E.I.

- to train; the intention being, on its return, to
send back the other squadrons in succession for
the same purpose. As A.H.Q. had already
decided not to use British bomber squadrons
in their bombing role by day until fighter escort
or cover could be provided (see para. 198), it
was obviously essential to apply the decision
to the Dutch bomber squadrons, particularly as
their Glenn Martins were slower and no better
protected than the British Blenheims.

Air Forces driven out of Aerodromes in N.W.

Malaya.

220. Meanwhile in Northern Malaya it was
evident that the main line of advance by the
* Japanese Army was from Singora across Malaya
to the Alor Star area. The advanced troops of
the xrrth (Indian) Division were still holding a

_ position near the frontier but the vital Ledge
position on the Kroh-Patani road had not yet
been secured.

221. Bombing of our aerodromes in N.W.
Malaya continued during the roth December
and A.H.Q. decided that the area must be
evacuated. From Butterworth No. 62 (B)
. Squadron (reduced to 2 aircraft) was evacuated

.to Taiping: No. 2z (F) Squadron R.A.A.F.
(6srepairable aircraft) to Ipoh, where 8 Bofors
ns had by now been installed, leaving No.
27 (NF) Squadron (nil serviceability) still at
Butterworth. All the unserviceable aircraft of
Nos. 27, 34 (B) and 62 (B) Squadrons which
were capable of flying were flown to Singapore
for repair.

222. The withdrawal of the «ground parties
was carried out under difficult circumstances.

Units had been subjected to severe and con-
stant bombing and machine gun attacks on
scantily defended aerodromes where they saw
no effective means of hittmg back, and air-
craft were remorselessly destroyed on the
ground without replacement. The apparent
opportuneness of the enemy’s attacks (see para.
183) and pernicious rumours of disaster m the
land fighting added their influence. There was
no senior officer at Butterworth with sufficient
weight to take control, and some of the per-
sonnel of No. 21 (F) Squadron R.A.A.F. and
No. 27 (NF) Squadron R.A.F., both of which
had already been driven out of Sungei Patani,
did not behave at all steadily. Other units,
however, maintained their order.

223. The difficulties of all units was intensi-
fied by the wholesale, but understandable, dis-
appearance of unenlisted native followers—
cooks, M.T. drivers, sanitary personnel etc.—
and only improvised arrangements were pos-
sible for replacing them ,by European person-
nel at the dislocation of the latter’s normal
work, ,

The defection of labour read to the rail-
way area.

224. Withdrawals were nevertheless effected
successfully and, in the case of units other
than those mentioned above, in good order. It
was due to the untiring energy of a small party
headed by Flight Lieutenant R. D. I. Scott,
who himself drove a locomotive, that much
R.A.F. equipment was removed south.

225. In an endeavour to improve repair and
maintenance facilities in N.W. Malaya, an
R. & SU. was formed at this time from No.
151 M.U. at Seletar and was ordered to Taip-
ing; on arrival it detached a Mobile Salvage
Section to Butterworth to assist in the work
of salving material.

226. Meanwhile, during the commencement
of the denial schemes at Alor Star on Ioth
December, the sight of large fires and the
sounds of explosions in their rear had caused
some concern amongst our forward troops,
Orders were therefore issued to the Commander,
Norgroup, that no fires were to be started and
no demolitions by explosives carried out.
Buildings were to be damaged only, petrol and
oil run to waste, and the demolition of aero-
dromes with the help of explosives was to be
left to Corps Royal Engineers to co-ordinate
with the operations of our troops.

Scale of Enemy Aw Effort.

227. It was computed that on the 8th, 9th
and roth December the Japanese had used a
daily average of over 120 aircraft in N. Malaya,
mostly against R.A.F, aerodromes. _ Fighters
and some bombers were based on S.E. Siam,
the majority of bombers on Indo-China. It
was estimated that over roo aircraft were based
in the Singora—Patani area and at least 280
in Indo-China. Types identified were:—

. Righters—Navy “O”

Twin-Engine Bombers—Navy 96 and
‘Army 97.

Dive Bombers—Junkers 87N (Japanese
version).
