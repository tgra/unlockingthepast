Before they could get clear of Matruh and Bagush, the enemy had cut the road about twenty miles east of Matruh. The 50th Division and the roth Indian Division had therefore to fight their way out. This they succeeded in doing during the night of the 28th June, though much ammunition and equipment had to be left behind; and when they reached the El Alamein position, these troops had to be withdrawn to the Delta to reorganise and refit.",

In consultation with General Pile, therefore, I arranged for the gun defences to be substantially reinforced. By mid-day on the 28th June 363 heavy and 522 light A.A. guns were in action. Further weapons, including light guns manned by the Royal Air Force Regiment, anti-aircraft tanks of the Royal Armoured Corps, and rocket projectors, were either in position or on the way. I also arranged for the strength of the balloon barrage to be doubled.",
