SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

(ii) Immediate counter-attacks should be
exploited. These should, whenever possi-
ble, be planned beforehand and, owing to
the necessity for speed, should usually be
carried out by small bodies of a company on
the initiative of local commanders.

(ii) It was suggested that the defences
should consist of a holding group dug in
astride the main communications, with
striking forces forward on the flanks which
should attack as soon as the enemy made
contact with the holding groups.

(iv) The spreadmg of rumours must be
suppressed.

_(v) The enemy could not be defeated by

sitting in prepared positions and letting him
walk round us. We must play him at his
own game and attack on every occasion.
The efficiency, cunning and alertness of the
individual were of primary importance.

Arrangements were made for the evacuation
of as much as possible of the reserve stores
from the Ipoh area. There was not, however,
sufficient M.T. available to move the petrol,
which was stored in 60-gallon drums. Arrange-
ments were made for these to be destroyed by
puncturing the drums.

I returned to Singapore on the morning of
the zoth December,

206. The importance of the lateral road
Jerantut-Kuala Lipis-Rawb-Kuala Kubu, which
was the main communication between East and
West Malaya, now became apparent. If our
forces on the west coast were driven back
beyond Kuala Kubu, the enemy would be able
to cut the only road communication of our
forces On the east coast.

I discussed this situation with the C.-in-C.
Far East and the A.O.C. It was agreed as
a general policy that we should withdraw the
Kuantan garrison at a time to be decided later
in accordance with the development of the
situation.

IT also thought it desirable to take preliminary
steps for the defence of North Johore and of
Singapore Island itself against attack from the
North.

On the 23rd December I caused to be issued
Malaya Command Order No. 28, an extract
from which is attached to this Despatch as
Appendix ““C”’.

207. The Commander A.I.F. delegated re-
sponsibility for the defence of North Johore
to the 27 Australian Brigade Group in A.LF.
Malaya Operation Instruction No. rz dated
24th December 1941 from which the following
is an extract :—

“The 27 Brigade Group is made respon-
sible for holding delaying, positions towards
the Johore-Malacca boundary. Requisition for
local labour is to be submitted to the
C.R.E.”

** The Bde. Gp. is to be disposed as under : —

(i) Gemas-Segamat, one Bn. Gp. plus one
Coy. . ‘

ai) Muar, one Bn. (less two Coys.) with
attached troops.

(iii) Reserve (in Kluang-Ayer-Hitam area)

Section XXIV.—WeEsT CoasT OPERATIONS,
I8TH-30TH DECEMBER, IQ4T.

208 The Grik Road.—On the 19th Decem-

ber our troops, who had now been reinforced,

128r

moved forward to recapture Sumpitan, led by:
the Independent Company, An encounter
battle took place in the village, where our
troops fought gallantly and were only with-
drawn in face of a strong counter-attack. That
night they fell back to Lenggong. On the 2oth
the Argylls were heavily engaged all day and
had to drive off by counter-attack an enemy
force which had moved down the river on rafts
and reached Kota Tampan in their rear. On
the 21st the Argylls held the Kota Tampan area
against renewed enemy attacks, while the 5/2
Punjab Regt. occupied positions west of Chen-
deroh Lake. Some enemy rafts were sunk on
the lake. At about 1800 hrs. the Argylls dis-
engaged and withdrew through the 5/2 Punjab
Regt. and the enemy following up were stopped
at the Causeway.

The river approach through the Chenderoh
Lake now gave the Japanese the opportunity of
by-passing Kuala Kangsar and of threatening
the main road and railway bridges over the
River Perak and the communications east of
them. To meet this threat the 4/19 Hyderabad
Regt., which had now arrived from Kelantan,
was concentrated east of the River Perak.

The enemy were now only some 12 miles
from Lawin, where the Grik road joins the
trunk road, and the situation demanded the
speedy withdrawal of the 28 Brigade Group
before it could be cut off in its positions north
of Taiping.

209. The Krian River Front.—On the zoth
and zoth December there was some activity om
the mght of the Krian River position and, to
avoid being outflanked on the right, the 28
Brigade Group fell back to Ulu Sapetang and’
Bagan Serai. The bridges over the River
Krian were demolished.

210. The Tactical Situation —On the even-
ing of 21st December all troops west of the
River Perak, including those on the Grik road,
were placed directly under the Commander 11
Indian Division. He decided that, in view of
the situation on the Grik road, an immediate
withdrawal behind the River Perak was neces-
sary. He realised the importance of covering
the Blanja Pontoon Bridge over the River
Perak which gave direct access to the Ipoh
area and the communications south of it.

The withdrawal of the 28 Brigade Group
commenced at 2000 hrs. 21st December, the
units being disposed as far as possible to meet
all possible threats.

On the 22nd December there was further
fighting on the Grik Road and that night the
12 Brigade Group withdrew across the Perak
River covered by troops of the 28 Brigade
Group. By the morning of the 23rd December
all troops, except for a bridgehead at Blanja,
were east of the river. The Blanja bridgehead
was withdrawn on the night 23rd-24th
December.

A gap was successfully blown in the Iskander
Bridge, the fine main road bridge over the
River Perak. A portion of the pontoon bridge
at Blanja was swung to the eastern shore and
the pontoons sunk,

On withdrawal the 12 Brigade Group
bivouacked in the Salak North area and the
28 Brigade Group concentrated in the Siputeh
area with a detachment watching the River
Perak at Blanja. .
