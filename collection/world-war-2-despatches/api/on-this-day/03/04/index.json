            "description": "In wiew of our great poverty in numbers, a new technique had to be thought out for these attacks, which were strikingly successful in inflicting casualties upon the enemy and in lowering his morale.  the country was well covered, and our forces were thus able to lie up in the day-time, only a few miles from the enemy's positions without detection by his air or his native cavalry. Action was taken only at night, when approach marches reconnoitred during the day were carried out by parties which rarely exceeded a hundred men for a single operation, and usually numbered forty to fifty. The alternative methods used were to Jay light machine-guns from close range on the enemy's camp fires when they were still burning, or (more commonly, for the enemy soon adjusted himself to this ruse) to approach, armed simply with bomb, rifle and bayonet, bomb his positions from ten yards range, carry them with the bayonet, beat off counterattack, and withdraw before dawn. The hour chosen for these attacks was usually when the enemy was sleepiest, and his customary reaction was to continue firing with machine-guns and artillery until dawn, thus waging a war of nerves nm himself. Naturally the most absolute discipline of silence, fire-control and sense of direction was demanded of the troops who took part in these attacks, and it was here that the natural fighting qualities of the Sudanese and the training of the Frontier Battalion and its officers were demonstrated. Between 19th March and 3rd April, when the Ethiopian flag was raised by  Ras Hailu over the citadel of Debra Markos and the last Italian troops had abandoned the town, attacks of this kind were made with success on Abima Fort, Addis Fort, and all the Gulit positions. The most impressive of these took place on Gulit on the night of 24th March, when four of the main positions were entered by our men. The effect of these guerilla methods could be judged by the stream of desertions coming at the rate of over a",

He no doubt calculated that he had time enough before our threat to the   Gustav '  line became serious and experience had given him a justified confidence in the strength of his defences there. His renewed attack could not be made in the same force as the first; there were large gaps in his divisions and morale had suffered the inevitable depression that follows the failure of an offensive of which much had been hoped. Mackensen therefore planned an attack on a smaller scale, using LXXVI Corps only; it was designed to narrow down the bridgehead by driving a wedge into the eastern flank to cut off the troops defending the Mussolini canal. If this were successful a further process of attrition might reduce the bridgehead to dimensions too small for safety, Four divisions, including two panzer divisions, were to make the assault, with a mobile division in reserve: it was to be com~- bined with diversionary attacks on both flanks, VI Corps was prepared for the attack on 2oth February and it was a complete failure: artillery fire and the firm defence of 3 Division broke up most of the attacks, a small penetration was made but was soon ironed out and by the afternoon of ist March the enemy had acknowledged defeat.t He never again resumed the offensive and I now could consider the Anzio bridgehead secure, especially after we had captured Fourteenth Army's order of 4th March directing the assumption of the",
