In Southern Italy eleven Allied divisions were opposing nine German in a position eminently suitable for the defence, while in the north there were some fourteen more, a known total of twenty- three divisions.* Eleven against nine was no great numerical superiority and with their great resources in the north, where the internal security commitment was now quite unim- portant, the Germans could easily convert it into a positive inferiority; at the least they could carry out constant reliefs of their formations in the battle area and oppose our attacks with constantly fresh troops.

The attack was first planned to take place on the night of 21st October, but owing to a fire in ILLUSTRIOUS\u2019 hangar a few days be- fore, which destroyed and damaged a number of aircraft, the operation had to be deferred. It was considered again for the night of 30th/ 31st October, when the fleet was operating off the West coast of Greece, but it was decided not to attempt it as there was then no moon and the attack would have had to be carried out with flares, in the use of which the aircraft crews had had little practice."
