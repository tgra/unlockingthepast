SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 1951.

the 7th September, the enemy, in greater
Strength than before, were met in the area of
Milestone 114. This~ position was captured
on the 8th, after air and artillery bombard-
ment.

62. The Manipur River, which was in full
flood, was reached on the 15th September.
This was expected to be a serious obstacle
to our advance. The Divisional Commander
had, however, anticipated an opposed crossing,
and had sent a brigade back to Imphal to move
round the enemy’s flank via the Shuganu track
and tum his defences. The operation was
brilliantly successful and the enemy were forced
to abandon their strongly prepared positions
covering the river. A combination of clever
tactics, air supply and hard “foot slogging ”
had deprived the Japanese of their oppor-
tunity to check our advance.

63. Tuitum was occupied on the 17th
September. Heavy rainfull, with consequent
deterioration of the roads, delayed the arrival
of bridging equipment, but ferrying began on
the 18th. The enemy’s opposition was reduced
to the shelling of the main crossings.

64. By the 20th September, we were attack-
ing strong enemy positions about Tonzang, the
first town of any size after leaving the Imphal
Plain. By the 22nd, a double advance from
the north and south made the Japanese
evacuate this place without opposition, but
severe punishment was inflicted on their re-
treating columns. Tonzang was full of enemy
dead and much equipment was captured.

65. By the end of the month, the leading
brigade of 5 Indian Division was south of Mile-
stone 147, after overcoming hostile rearguards.

66. 33 Corps : (b) 11 (East African) Division
(Kabaw Valley). During the first three weeks of
September, this Division (less one brigade)
advanced down the Kabaw Valley, in very bad
weather.

67. One brigade, capturing successive enemy
positions, fought its way down the Tamu —Sit-
taung track, and reached Sittaung on the 4th
September. Bases from which extensive patrol-
ling was carried out were established across the
flooded Chindwin River. At the end of the
month, this brigade was relieved by units of
268 Indian Lorried Infantry Brigade and con-
centrated in readiness for future operations.

68. By the end of September, 11 (East
African) Division (less one brigade) had suc-
cessfully attacked and captured strongly con-
structed and well stocked enemy positions three
miles north of Yazagyo and was engaged in
clearing the area.

The progress made during the month was
remarkable in view of the destruction of com-
munications by the continuous rain which
strained our administration to the utmost. It
was found necessary to employ the infantry
and other combatant troops on roadmaking
and similar works.

69. The situation at the end of September
was:—

One brigade had captured an enemy posi-
tion one mile north of Yazagyo, and was
engaged in clearing the area.

One brigade, some 25 miles to the north-
east, was pushing forward against opposi-
tion three miles west-north-west of Mawlaik
on the Chindwin side of the Mawku Range

1719

which separates the Kabaw and Chindwin
Valleys.

One brigade, concentrated in the Sittaung
area.

70. Lushai Brigade. Throughout the month,
the Brigade continued its successful raids and
ambushes on the Japanese line of communica-
tion, and in one week one battalion killed 111
Japanese, wounded 56, destroyed 29 vehicles
and damaged 20 others; during the same
period, a detachment of Levies destroyed
50,000 gallons of petrol.

71. On the 17th September, Japanese posi-
tions west of Haka were attacked, but there
was strong opposition and the arrival of enemy
reinforcements forced us to withdraw; not,
however, before an enemy supply column had
been successfully ambushed and a bridge over
the Manipur River, near Falam, destroyed.

72. 268 Indian Lorried Infantry Brigade.
This Independent Brigade, consisting of four
—later five—battalions, was reorganized early
in September to provide a screen west of the
Chindwin to protect divisions which were rest-
ing in the Imphal area. Its réle also included
the protection of the rear and flank of our
formations operating south and south-east of
Imphal. :

It operated under command of 33 Corps in
the general area Tamanthi — Sittaung - Ukhrul,
but confined its operations across the Chind-
win to patrolling. A battalion of this force
relieved 25 (East African) Brigade in the Sit-
taung area at the end of September.

73. Tarcol. This small composite force, to
which I have already referred, was withdrawn
during the month. The Homalin -Thaungdut
area had been cleared of the enemy and 4
battalion left in Thaungdut. A conservative
estimate of the Japanese/J.IF. (Japanese-
inspired Indian Fifth Column) dead found in
the area in which “Tarcol” had been operat-
ing was over 1,000—mainly from starvation.
Many abandoned lorries also were discovered
near Humine.

Summary of Operations in September.

74. Arakan. Certain moves were carried
out directly the monsoon slackened to secure
areas of tactical importance, and small but
determined enemy counter-attacks were
repulsed.

Part of 55 Japanese Division, formerly op-
posed to our forces in the Maungdaw area,
was withdrawn during the month. :

75. Chin Hills and Chindwin. The advance
of our troops down the Imphal -Tiddim road
and, further east, down the Kabaw Valley con-
tinued. 5 Indian Division after crossing the
Manipur River was entirely, and 11 (East
African) Division in the Kabaw Valley was
partly, dependent on air supply. _

On the Tiddim road, the village of Tuitum
was occupied on the 17th September, and by
the end of the month our leading troops were
only seven miles from Tiddim. Thus a dis-
tance of 62 miles had been covered in one
month against determined opposition and
under severe weather conditions. The Japanese
suffered heavy casualties during their retreat,
and the withdrawal of the Headquarters of
33 Japanese Division across the Chindwin in-
dicated that they were not likely to put up a
very serious resistance, though it was expected
