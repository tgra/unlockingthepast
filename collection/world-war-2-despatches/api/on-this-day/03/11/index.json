            "date": "11th March",
            "description": "107. The operations of Special Force began on the night of the 5th-6th March, and between then and the night of the 10th-11th March nearly six hundred Dakota and one hundred glider sorties carried 77 and 111 L.R-P. Brigades, totalling 9,500 troops and 1,100 animals, into the heart of Japanese-occupied Burma. The initial r le of these glider-borne forces was to secure sites for and to prepare landing strips west of the Irrawaddy. Last minute air reconnaissance disclosed that one of the two potential strips selected, thirty-five miles north-east of Katha (called   Piccadilly  ) had been deliberately obstructed. General Sim, who was present at the starting point when this news was received, was faced with the difficult decision whether to launch the operation, since it appeared that the enemy had got wind of it, or to postpone it until fresh plans could be made. He decided to let the operation go forward and on the first night the landings were confined to one strip only, called   Broadway  , which was some twenty-seven milessoutheast of Hopin on the Myitkyina Mandalay railway."

            "date": "11th March",
            "description": "At the same time I was informed by the Chiefs of Staff that it had been decided to place the military garrison of Malta under my command, just as the Naval and Royal Air Force garrisons were under command of the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean and the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief respectively. The change took place on the 11th March. In actual fact it made little practical difference except that henceforward the three Commanders-inChief and the Middle East Defence Committee had a unified responsibility for Malta as an integral part of the Middle East theatre. The position of General Dobbie as Commander-inChief of Malta was not affected."

            "date": "11th March",
            "description": "35. The long range penetration brigade which was making its way across the Chindwin overland towards Katha received its first airborne suppiies on 10th February, and its maintenance thereafter became a continuous commitment. The remaining two brigades were landed on two strips improvised in the jungle during the nights of S5th/6th and 10th/11th March, and a fourth and fifth brigade were flown into another landing ground during the nights of 24th/25th March and 5th/6th April. The successful accomplishment of the air side of this operation was shared directly by the First Air Commando Unit and by the British and American Transport squadrons which  participated, although the whole operation was only made possible by the high degree of air superiority gained by the tactical air forces in the preceding months."
