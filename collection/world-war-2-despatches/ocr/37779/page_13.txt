SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 6 NOVEMBER, 1946

The very big movement of United States
2 Corps from Gafsa area to the north, right
across the lines of supply of First Army, the
provision of all the necessary American types
of ammunition, supplies and rations, and the
dumping of huge quantities of ammunition for
the guns of 2, 5 and 9 Corps within such a
short period were great feats which the Staffs
concerned have every right to be proud.

Meanwhile, on 30th April, Genera] Alexander
told me that in view of the difficult country
opposite Eighth Army he had decided to trans-
fer formations across to strengthen First Army
for the final blow.

My first task was still to capture Tunis; there-
after to exploit eastwards to prevent the enemy
establishing himself in the Cap Bon area.
Eighth Army to co-operate in this phase as
best it could. 7 Armoured Division, 4 Indian
Division, 201 Guards Brigade, with the
necessary divisional and administrative troops,
were to be transferred at once to my com-
mand, with Lieutenant-General B. G. Horrocks,
M.C., from ro Corps (to succeed Lieutenant-
General J. T. Crocker, C.B.E., D.S.O., M.C.,
9 Corps, who had been wounded).

This, of course, was a big reinforcement to
the forces I already had in hand for my break~
through.

The transfer and regrouping of formations
began immediately, as did also the dumping
of 450 rounds a gun for over 400 guns. Again
an enormous task was accomplished by my
Staff without a hitch, and by nightfall of 5th
May all was completed and.the Army regrouped
‘ready for the assault. Thescomposition of the
various Corps is given in Appendix ‘‘ B.”’

My orders in outline were as under: —

5 Corps to hold a firm base on their present
line and, as a preliminary operation, to capture
the dominating Djebel Bou Aoukaz on after-
noon 5th May, so as to cover the left flank
of 9 Corps in its subsequent attack.

9 Corps during night 5th-6th May to break
into the enemy’s position on a very narrow
front with 4 British and 4 Indian Divisions.
This to be followed up immediately by break-
ing out through the breach with 6 and 7
Armoured Divisions, with the object of seiz-
ing and holding tthe high ground 6 miles due
west of Tunis and so breaching the inner de-
fences of Tunis, before the enemy had time to
man these defences.

5 Corps thereafter to keep open the corri-
dor and to be ready to use one or more infantry
divisions to sustain the attack of 9 Corps.

I emphasised that speed was vital.

United States 2 Corps to continue their attacks
on Chouigui (and then to exploit towards
Djedeida) and Bizerta.

French 19 Corps to attack on 4th May to cap-
ture the Djebel Zaghouan—a most formidable
mountain massif.

xr British Armoured Division to be in Army
Reserve in area Sebkret el Kourzia.

In the hope of confusing the enemy, from
whom I could scarcely hope to conceal the
colossal traffic movement (reminiscent of Derby
Day) and the dust around Medjez, I arranged
-for a large dummy concentration of tanks and
transport (with the usual movement) to be
installed near Bou Arada. While making no
attempt to conceal x Armoured Division near
the Sebkret I hoped to make the enemy think
I had moved 6 Armoured Division to the Bou

"546

Arada area, and to conceal altogether the arrival
of 7 Armoured Division west of Medjez.

Subsequent events proved that this stratagem
had a considerable measure of success, as the
enemy did not suspect the heavy concentra-
tion of armour at Medjez and kept his ar
Panzer Division near Zaghouan to cover the
imagined threat to Pont du Fahs. Captured
staff officers from .German General Head-
quarters later stated that although they had, in
fact, seen tanks in Iaager south-west of Medjez
yet they thought they were only a portion of
r Armoured Division, and they placed 6
Armoured Division at Bou Arada. Thus,
thinking that I had split my armour, they were
under no particular apprehension of an
immediate attack, I rather stress this point,
as it emphasises first, the ease with which one
can deceive the air reconnaissance: second,
perhaps it explains in some way the Jater com-
Plete surprise which otherwise is almost incom-
prehensible. But, of course, the primary
reason for the enemy’s failure to detect our con-
centration was our overwhelming air superioritv
which practically kept the enemy out of the air
except for a few isolated sorties. In the same
connection, it is interesting to recall that I had
usually failed to find warning signs of German
attacks against me throughout the campaign,
despite most active air reconnaissance.

Of the final assault there is little to narrate.

5 Corps’ attack on the Bou was successful and
it was held against counter-attack.

The attack by 4 British and 4 Indian
Divisions in the dark at 0330 hours on 6th May
on a front of 3,000 yards went smoothly.
Scorpions and four battalions of Churchill tanks
came up at dawn on 6th May. The final objec-
tives, to a depth: of 5,000 yards, were all taken
by 1x00 hours with very small losses, under a
terrific artillery concentration—deepened by an
unprecedentedly intense air bombardment. In
the later stages German infantrymen broke and
ran, throwing away their rifles. The prolonged
and heavy fighting from 22nd April had well
prepared the way for this hammer blow.

The two armoured divisions passed through
the gap at once and after 6 Armoured Division
had ‘engaged enemy tanks (including
“ Tigers ’’) south of the Tunis road, Furna was
cleared and by nightfall Massicault was in our
hands, pockets of resistance being by-passed.

On 7th May, at 1540 hours, the Derbyshire
Yeomanry and 1x Hussars entered Tunis. On
8th May 7 Armoured Division moved north-
wards of Tunis and cleared the country towards
Protville, while 6 Armoured Division moved
south-east towards Hammam Lif—where it
met fierce resistance in the strong and narrow
pass. On roth May 6 Armoured Division had
broken through, captured Soliman and that
night reached Hammamet and at once pushed
south towards Bou Ficha.

Meanwhile I had moved up 4 British Division
and placed it once more under orders of 9
Corps. This Division was moved rapidly up
to Soliman and, in a lightning sweep, cleared

-the Cap Bon peninsula.

At the same time I also placed 1 British
Armoured Division from Army Reserve under
g Corps, ordering it to move northwards via
Ain el Asker and Mohammedia. On gth and
roth May it advanced via Creteville on
Grombalia. :
