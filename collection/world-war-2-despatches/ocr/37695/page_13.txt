SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 21 AUGUST, 1946

Most items of medical stores are now being
delivered in satisfactory quantities,; [he per-
centage of hospital beds fell in arrears, owing
to the exclusion from convoys of even the
minimum number required. The number of
field hygiene sections was, and still is, inade-
quate to the needs of the force.

In previous campaigns the need for mobile
casualty clearing stations had been experienced.
Three units were given sufficient transport to
move the complete light section together with
half the heavy section in one shift.

It has also been found necessary to form
mobile surgical teams provided with their own
transport, so that major surgery can be per-
formed as far forward as the main dressing
stations. :

Royal Army Ordnance Corps.

58. The excellent example of ceaseless hard
work set by my Director of Ordnance Services,
Brigadier W. O, Richards, has been emulated
by the whole Corps. Several measures have
been taken to ensure even greater efficiency.

The Royal Army Ordnance Corps lacked a
number of essential units, of which only a few:
arrived between the end of June and the end
of October. On the other hand, deficiencies
in equipment and vehicles except for reserves
have been largely made up, although there is
still a serious shortage of machine tools.

Reorganisation of the Corps in accordance
with the latest’ system designed by the War
Office is now in progress, but it is not yet
sufficiently far advanced to enable me to see
whether the system will need to be modified
to suit the conditions in the Middle East. Some
five thousand additional personnel will be
required to complete the reorganisation and
it is therefore unlikely to be completed before
next August.

The swift movement and lengthy communi-
cations characteristic of mechanised warfare
made two innovations necessary.

Strict limits have been set to the scale of
repairs to be undertaken by second line repair
workshops, recourse being had as far as pos-
sible to the system of assembly exchanges.

It has also been found necessary to organise
a system for the delivery of urgent spare parts
and fighting stores. A special unit has been
formed to deliver such stores by road and a
further scheme has been prepared in conjunc-
tion with the Royal Air Force for the delivery
of stores by air. :

59. It was no easy task to re-equip and re-
organise practically the whole of the Middle
East Forces within the space of four months.
Units had to be restored to their brigades,
and brigades to their divisions. Equipment
had to be distributed in such a way as to
meet operational needs and to permit a maxi-
mum of training to be carried out. At the
same time C s had to be reinforced, and
Tobruk relieved, units withdrawn from Syria
and East Africa and the concentration for the
offensive begun. The coordination of all these
activities placed a great strain on the Staff
Duties Branch of the General Staff and of all
subordinate Headquarters. The smooth effici-
ency with which it was all accomplished is
largely due to the untiring efforts of my Deputy
Director of Staff Duties, Brigadier B. Temple.

‘TRAINING.

60. Under the guidance of my Deputy Chief
of General Staff, Major General N. M. Ritchie,

4227

every aspect of training in theory and practice
hap received thesclagest. attention, jir “* ap

THe lull in operations made it possible to
give almost every fighting unit apd formation
the opportunity of carrying out further train-
ing, although the scope of training was neces-
sarily limited by deficiencies in equipment.
Incoming units and formations put in a spell of
training in desert warfare before being sent to
the operational zone, and particular attention
has been paid to desert movement of mechan-
ised columns by day and night. :

The Combined Training Centre at Kabrit was
employed to capacity throughout. One Brigade
of the 5th Indian Division and two brigade
groups of the New Zealand Division underwent
a complete course at the Centre.

Air Support,

6r. An Inter-Service Committee, consisting
of representatives of the Army and the Royal
Air Force, was formed late in July to study
the question of. air support for the Amny.
Experiments were carried out during August,
and a system was finally evolved.

The first two air support controls in the
Middle East were fforméd at Mena jon 8th
October, the Army component of the first
being formed by the Australian Imperial Force,
and of the second from British and. New
Zealand personnel. The air component of
both was provided by the Royal Air Force.
Parachute Detachment.

62. A small parachute detachment known
as ‘L’’ Detachment, Special Air Service
Brigade, was formed at Kabrit during July. It
was composed of about 7o volunteers, recruited
mainly from the survivors of the Commando
Force.

Preliminary training was carried out during
August and September, and the first live drops
were successfully made on the 4th October.

Captain A. D. Stirling, who commanded the
detachment directed all training without expert
assistance. Great credit is due to him and
to his officers and non-commissioned officers for
their initiative in improvising equipment and
inventing an entirely new type of training.
Schools.

63. ‘The Middle East Officers Cadet Training
Unit has been reorganised and expanded. The
specialist wings have been abolished; and all
cadets now follow the same eight weeks’ basic
course, specialists passing on to officers’ wings
at the training school of the arm concerned.
The annual capacity of the Training unit has
been thereby increased from thirteen hundred
to two thousand and forty cadets.

Special stress has been laid on anti-aircraft
action at the Weapon Training School, moving -
targets being employed. Experiments have
been made with kites and drogues towed by a
truck to produce a satisfactory target.

The School of Anti-Aircraft and Coast
Defence moved to Haifa and reopened on the
14th September, as air raids had interfered
with instruction at Port Said.

A Royal Army Ordnance Corps School of
Instruction, having general engineering and
ammunition wings, has been opened.

A-school has been opened at the Infantry
Base Depot for training regimental specialists.

Six Indian Wings have recently been opened
at existing schools. :
