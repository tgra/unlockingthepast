            "description": "ordered by the  War Cabinet to visit Greece and to make an offer to the Greeks of armoured troops, field artillery, anti-tank artillery and anti-aircraft guns to assist their forces in the defence of Salonika and Macedonia against possible German aggression. I was in Athens from 13th to 17th January and had a series of conferences with the Greek Premier, General Metaxas, and the Greek Commander-in-Chief, General Papagos. As a result, the offer of the British Government was declined, mainly on the grounds that the landing of further British forces in Greece was likely to provoke German aggression without being strong enough to check it. Had this offer been accepted, it is improbable that it would have been possible to continue the operations in Cyrenaica beyond Tobruk. After the refusal of assistance by the Greeks, an offer was made by the Prime Minister of assistance, especially by air forces, to Turkey, which was also declined on similar grounds,",

            "description": "On the evening of 12th January, an order was sent to 4th and 5th Indian Divisions ordering r1th Indian Infantry Brigade Group to concentrate forthwith in the Aroma area and warning them that the brigade might be required to seize the Jebel Mokram and Jebel  Kawatab, large jebels on the north-east side of Kassala and approximately three miles from it, not earlier than the night 16/17th January. 5th Indian Division was warned that it might be required to seize the Jebel Ibrahim Tau not earlier than the same night. 5th Indian Division was given permission to move forward agth Indian Infantry Brigade, 68 Medium Regiment, less a battery, and 28 Field Regiment. (These had been held back in Gedaref area for reasons of secrecy and deception.) Gazelle was ordered to be prepared to operate east of Sabdarat. Reliable information revealed that the enemy now intended to evacuate the Walkait (Tsegede) garrison. There were only mule-tracks from this area to Gondar and the L. of C. was to Tessenei. From this it was reasonable to suppose that these forces would retire on Barentu covered for the first part of their move by Umm Hagar garrison. This was confirmed next day by the Manager of the Italian Cotton Scheme south of Tessenei who gave himself up at the Butana Bridge and stated that the enemy intended to retire to the hills   on account of the superiority of our tanks.  The date of the attack on Kassala was fixed for 19th January.",

I discussed the situation with the Commander Westforce and the Commander 11 Indian Division at Rear Headquarters Westforce at 1200 hrs. 17th January. We were loth to order an immediate withdrawal from Segamat which we thought would be damaging to morale and decided to strengthen the Yong Peng-Muar front by every means at our disposal. I arranged to make available 1mmediately the 2/z9 Australian Battalion from Jemaluang, relieving it temporarily by the reserve battalion of the 53 Brigade.",

The presence of the TIRPITZ at Trondheim, where she artived on 17th January and, still more, her, reinforcement on 23rd February by the SCHEER and PRINZ EUGEN, constituted another and more serious threat to these convoys. It seemed probable that the heavy ships, if they attacked, would do so between Jan Mayen and Bear Islands, leaving the eastern section of the route to their U-boats and aircraft. It was therefore necessary to provide heavy cover on this part of the route, even though this could not be done without uncovering to some extent the Northern Passages. .",

The terrain on both banks is flat and covered by scrub, except for open cultivation round the village itself. The leading troops of 62 Brigade actually reached the river on the 12th January, but enemy rear parties between Onbauk and Kyaukmyaung had to be cleared, and engineer equipment brought forward. The first crossing was made on the night 16th-17th January.
