(a) On the highest level there is the Middle
East War Council with the Mini&ter of State
in the chair. This body is mainly concerned
with political matters affecting the Services
and other problems of the Middle East.

(8) Then there is the Middle East Defence
Committee which met for the first time on
the 25th August. It consists of the Minister
of State, who presides, and the three
Commanders-in-Chief. It deals with major
operations and plans.

(c) Next comes the Commanders-in-Chiefs’
Committee which is also attended by senior
Staff Officers and deals with all important
operational and administrative questions.
The above normally meet once a week.

(@) Daily liaison is maintained in General
Headquarters by an Inter-Service Intelligence
Staff Conference and an Inter-Service Opera-
tional Staff Conference and by individual
officers of all three Services.

(e) The Inter-Service Air Defence Com-
mittee makes recommendations for the dis-
posal of available anti-aircraft units and
equipment, and has been of great value.

(f) Moreover I myself am in constant per-
sonal touch with the Commander-in-Chief
Mediterranean and the Air Officer Command-
ing-in-Chief.

It will thus be seen that a firm foundation
exists to ensure that the efforts of the Navy,
Army and Royal Air Force are co-ordinated.

4. I readily subscribed to my predecessor’s
policy of concentrating on re-organisation and
training, as an essential part of the prepara-
tions for driving the enemy out of Libya and
for meeting his eventual thrust in Asia. These
were my chief preoccupations during the
period under review. The paragraphs which
follow are, therefore, chiefly concerned with
local aspects of these preparations as they
arose in the various areas of the Middle East.

SYRIA AND PALESTINE.

5. The Syrian Campaign was drawing to a
close when I assumed command. In the north-
east the roth Indian Division, which formed

art of the forces under Lieutenant-General

. P. Quinan in Iraq and which the Com-
mander-in-Chief, India, had placed at General
Wavell’s disposal, had advanced along the
River Euphrates as far as Deir ez Zor and
along the railway from Tel Kotchek towards
Kameschle. . Tin tthe (West the enemy were
resisting stwbbornly along the line of the River
Damour, on the southern slopes of the Lebanon
and-on the southern and western slopes of the
Anti-Lebanon.

(n the Euphrates Province the roth Indian
Division made steady progress in the face of
heavy air attacks, and by the 8th July, with
the capture of Raqga and Kameschle, they were
in control of the key points of the Province.
On the line Hama—Homs—Anti-Lebanon the
Vichy French were thinning out, until on the
roth July Homs was threatened by the 4th
Cavalry Brigade who had cut the railway to
the South and now stood before the town. The
crossing of the River Damour by the r7th
Australian Infantry Brigade on the 7th July,
and the capture of the town itself by the 21st
Australian Infantry Brigade on the 9th July
removed the chief obstacle to our advance on
Beirut from the South. The town was also
threatened from the direction of Damascus by
the 16th Infantry Brigade (6th Division), which

on the roth July attacked the enemy holding
positions astride the road near Dimas.

Having lost control of the Northern Desert
and the Euphrates Province, and being
threatened with the imminent loss of Beirut
General Dentz decided to ask for an anmistice.

6. On the evening of the rzth July, I re-
ceived a wireless message from General Dentz,
proposing the suspension of hostilities six hours
later, at midnight, General Dentz declared
himself ready to engage in talks on the basis
of a memorandum presented to him that morn-
ing by the United States Consul at Beirut on
behalf of the British Government. But he
made the reservation that he was empowered
by the French Government to treat only with
the British representatives to the exclusion of
those of the Free French.

General Dentz’s proposals were considered at
once by the Middle East War Council, which
also took into account the opinion of the
American Consul at Beirut, that Dentz was
entirely insincere and might be playing for
time in the hope of a last minute rescue by the
Germans. Accordingly his conditions were re-
jected and he was called on to send his
plenipotentaries to the British outpost on the
Beirut—Haifa Road at or before ogoo hrs. on
the rath July, under threat of resuming
hostilities at that hour.

The Vichy French Representatives duly
appeared and were conducted to Acre, where
discussions began at once. We were repre-
sented by General Sir Henry Wilson, Air Com-
modore L. O. Brown and Captain J. A. V.
Morse, Royal Navy, the Free French by
General Catroux, and the Vichy French by
General de Verdillac, At 2200 hrs. on the rath
July the Convention was initialled and was
finally signed by General Wilson and General
de Verdillac at Acre on the 14th July x94r.

7. The Commission of Control, set up in
accordance with Article 2z to supervise the
execution of the terms of the Convention,
assembled formally for the first time on the
16th July at Ain Sofar in the Lebanon under
the presidency of Major-General J. I. Chrystall.”

The question of repatriation was difficult, as
our desire to clear the country of Vichy French
troops and civilians at the earliest possible
moment conflicted with the Free French wish
to retain them as long as possible, in the hope
that after a prolonged period of propaganda a
larger number of recruits would be obtained.
Events proved the anticipations of the Free
French to be over-optimistic, for of 37,736 per-
sonnel of the Troupes Francais du Levant, who
were offered the choice, only 5,668 declared in
favour of Free France.

In all eight convoys, three hospital ships and
one “‘ gleaner ’’ ship sailed for France between
the 7th August and the 27th September 1941.
The total number of persons repatriated, both
civilian and military was 37,563. It speaks
well for the work of the Embarkation Board
that these convoys were cleared without any
unfortunate incident. After the departure of
these ships, nearly all personnel of the Troupes
Frangais du Levant had been repatriated.

The return of British Prisoners of War who
had been evacuated from Syria and the
Lebanon placed the Troupes Francais du
Levant in an unfortunate position, particularly
when it was established that a number of these
prisoners had been sent out of Syria after the
