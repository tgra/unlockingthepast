The only ways in which the date could be advanced were iby interrupting enemy shipping to Libya or by increasing the output of our own tank workshops. Even then training was a limiting factor, The Middle East Defence Committee thought it well to stress the point made by General Nye that 15th May was only a tentative date dependent upon the rate at which the enemy could build up his tank strength. They added that any favourable opportunity before or after this date would be taken."

During the earlier fighting he was responsible for the defence of the fortress and of the coastal area between Tobruk and the rear of the Gazala position. It was well realised, however, that the task was a difficult one, but it was hoped that the experience of the commanders of the 4th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Brigade, the 32nd Army Tank Brigade and of the 83rd Sub-Area, all of whom, with their formations, had been in Tobruk during the siege would help to lighten it."

The Belhamed trailhead was opened eleven days later, but was only used for delivering tanks. By the 15th May it was evident that the enemy would in all probability anticipate our offensive and arrangements to cope with a possible withdrawal to the frontier were put in hand as a precautionary measure.

Concerning the preparation and use of Bardufoss, comsiderable tact was necessary in dealing with the Norwegians, as they firmly wished to keep it under their control. The acceptance of Norwegian pilots and other air personnel for training in England did much to bring a convenient working arrangement into force."
