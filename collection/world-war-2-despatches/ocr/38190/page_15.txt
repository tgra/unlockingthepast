SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 29 JANUARY, 1948

were in possession of the ridge overlooking
and dominating the Power station and the
approach along King’s Road from the West.
It was from this direction that the reinforcing
platoon of x Middlesex Regt. carne, as it was
judged that the road nearer the water front was
impassable owing to the flames from the Anglo-
Persian Company’s installations. The platoon
ran straight into the same anti-tank and
machine gun fire, the Platoon Sergeant-Major
and others were killed and the remainder got
into action in the vicinity of the Power
Station where they fought excellently.
When the bulk of the Hughesiliers withdrew,
three 1 Middlesex N.C,O.s rallied and collected
a mixed party of Reg ilars and Volunteers, nine
strong, and fought till 1400 hours in the main
office building of the Power Station.

(k) At about 2200 hours 18th December the
Royal Artillery at Lyemun Gap reported that
propaganda from a loud speaker from Saiwan
Redoubt was being broadcast—‘‘ We Japanese
have captured Saiwan Hill,”’ ‘‘ It is useless to
resist,’’ etc The area was promptly put under
small arms fire

At about or00 hours it was reported that a
counter attack by one platoon of Canadians
had been carried out on Saiwan Redoubt,
organised and led by an Artillery officer. The
counter-attack did not succeed, as was dis-
covered subsequently. This officer then took
a Tommy gun and carried out active local
defence on his own, round the 6-in. Howitzer
position at Lyemun Gap, in a most gallant
manner.

(2) At or45 hours the Hughesiliers (see sub-
para. (#) above) reported the Power Station
surrounded, but were ordered to hold on at all
costs as other posts were holding out near them
and it was hoped that B Company 5/7 Rajput
Regt. (Captain R. G. Course) would at any
moment make its presence felt.

(m) At 0200 hours 19th December Officer
Commanding 1 Middlesex Regt. reported that
B Company 5/7 Rajput Regt. was back in his
vicinity South of Leighton Hill—the reason
given being that the Company had gone forward
into the Braemar reservoir area but had been
unable to locate D Company 5/7 Rajput Regt.
holding that sector. I Middlesex Regt. was still
holding pill boxes 53 and 54 (Causeway Bay)
and had sent officer reconnaissance patrols for-
ward to North Point where the Hughesiliers had
again reported that they were hard pressed.

(n) At 0300 hours R.A. (East) reported two
Canadian platoons had tried to capture the
Saiwan position about midnight under an
accurate barrage on the hill top but that this
counter attack was a failure.

The fighting here in the dark was very con-
fused. Later Major Fielden, R.A., reported the
road junction at Shaukiwan held by armoured
cars and that he was trying to work round West
of Saiwan observation post (on the top of the
redoubt); he had thirty men covering the 6-in.
Howitzer position in Lyemun Gap and he said
that pill box 4o was still firing

(0) Between o400 and o600 hours 9th
December reinforcing platoons of the Royal
Rifles of Canada were sent forward on to the
Mount Parker high ground.

(p) To give increased defence in Victoria
against possible landing on that water front
which, supplemented by fifth columnists, would
constitute a grave danger from the West and

perhaps overrun Government House area, a
company of 2/14 Punjab Regt. had been de-
ployed on a line running from pill box 63 south-
wards past and including the Central Police
Station. The situation now developing on the
East of Victoria was judged to be serious
enough, however, to warrant taking’ risks in the
Victoria area, and so this company (about 0400
hours) was called in from its positions to be in
hand at HQ of 2/14 Punjab Regt. at Garden
Road. ‘‘A’’ Company Winnipeg Grenadiers
was already in hand at Wong Nei Chong Gap.
for emergency use.

(q) Captain R. S. Cole, 5/7 Rajput Regt.,
during the early hours was waiting for troops of
his battalion on the track from Braemar to
Mount Butler when a party of Japanese, headed
by three Chinese with rifles approached. They
were dressed in uniform and obviously acted as
guides. He challenged, shot the Chmese, and
dispersed the party. This incident corroborates
others, accounting for the speed with which the
Japanese troops covered country, supposedly
unfamiliar, in the dark.

(r) At 0400 hours roth December I arranged
with the Chief Engineer for the despatch
of an R.E. party for an infantry fighting role,
viz.: to reinforce the Wong Nei Chong Gap area
and to come under orders of Commander West
Infantry Brigade on arrival there. Seventy
British and Chinese was the eventual composi-
tion of this party.

(s) Shortly after 0400 hours the Officer Com-
manding 1 Middlesex Regt. reported the enemy
working round the hills by Tai Hang village and
going East, that D Company 5/7 Rajput Regt.
was still near the Reservoir, that Causeway Bay
area was securely held, and that there was no
signs of enemy action down the road from
Taikoo. At this time I ordered 2/14 Punjab
Regt. to send a company forward to help fill the
gap between the Winnipeg Grenadiers and
I Middlesex Regt.

(¢) At 0430 hours Major E. de V. Hunt, R.A.,
reported the situation to be well in hand at
Lyemun Gap.

(w) At 0500 hours a small party of enemy was
encountered at the Filter Beds. This showed
with what vigour the enemy was pressing the
attack.

(v) At 0600 hours personnel of Fortress R.E.
(see stib-para. (7) above) left, and (so it
transpired later) arrived in the vicinity of Wong
Nei Chong Gap only to find West Infantry
Brigade HQ under heavy enemy machine gun
and mortar fire. Three mortar positions were
located in folds of the ground but the Royal
Engineers had no suitable weapons with which
to reach such dead ground. Access to Brigade
HOQ shelters was out of the question and the
Royal Engineers took up a position nearby.

(w) 0650 hours 19th December. I had pre-
viously consulted with the Commodore R.N.
with a view to active participation by the Réyal
Navy in the land fighting. He now informed
me that arrangements had been completed for
the Royal Navy to take over infantry posts in
the area Aberdeen-Little Hong’Kong. This
teleased A Company Winnipeg Grenadiers* from
the Little Hong Kong Sub Sector, and it moved

*No evidence has been obtained as to what
happened to this company It is believed to have
reached Wong Nei Chong Gap at first hght and to
have been ambushed by superior Japanese forces, all
remaining personnel being captured.
