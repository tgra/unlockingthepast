remained in company as far as Cape Wrath, which was reached on 26th September without further loss.

54, They had been escorting the two convoys in succession in conditions of almost continual action for a period of 18 days. untiring vigilance is mainly due the fact that the losses were no heavier. These losses summarised were: 

P.Q.18. Ten merchant ships by air attack, three by U-boat. Arrived twentyseven. Four fighters lost (three pilots safe).

OP.14. SOMALI, LEDA, GREY RANGER and three merchant ships by U-boat. Arrived sixteen.

German. At least three U-boats sunk and several more damaged. At least forty aircraft shot down and many . more damaged. About two hundred and fifty minal  orpaiont were expended.

Battlefleet

55. Vice Admiral Second in Command, Home Fleet, with the battlefleet, put to sea from Akureyri on 11th September, with the hope of inducing the enemy to believe that heavy cover as far as the Bear Island area was being provided as usual. In this he was probably successful, for he was sighted on 12th Septem-

, ber, on a north-easterly course, and was not again located, though he returned to Akureyri two days later. A similar movement was made from 19th to 22nd September, but was not detected by the enemy.

Submarine Operations

56. All available submarines were employed providing cover and escort for these convoys. After the passage of P.O.18 and Q.P.14, the TIGRIS and TRIBUNE were diverted to

patrol off the Lofotens for the German heavy .

ships returning to Narvik: from Alltenfiord ; but nothing was seen of them. The RUBIS at the same time laid mines on their expected toute. Shortly after parting company with Q.P.14, one of the escorting submarines, P.614, torpedoed and sank a U-boat.

Return of Hampden Crews

1, After the passages of P.Q.18 and Q.P.14, the two squadrons of Hampden torpedo aircraft which had flown to Russia for this operation were presented to the Russians. The ARGONAUT, INTREPID and OBDURATE sailed on 13th October to bring home the crews of these aircraft.   On the outward passage these ships carried the medical unit, which the Soviet Government had now .consented to allow ashore, and food for the British forces in North The Norwegian expedition in Spitzbergen had also discovered some fresh needs for the winter ; and the ships called at Barentsburg on the way.

2. The passage was made without incident, save for one sighting by enemy aircraft: the force reached Kola Inlet on 21st October, sailed the next day and arrived at Scapa on 28th October.

Independent Sailings

3. After considerable discussion with the Admiralty, it was decided at the end of October to sail about ten ships independently each way between Iceland and North Russia, taking ad-   vantage of the long nights and the passage north of*Bear Island. The original plan was to sail the ships at 100-mile intervals in order of speed ; but for political reasons it was necessary to sail British and American ships alternately, which led occasionally to one ship overtaking another on-passage. Trawlers were spaced along the route for life-saving ; and the

~ Admiralty ordered two submarines as well to

be used for this purpose.
