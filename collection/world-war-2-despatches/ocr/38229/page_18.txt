1730 SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948

xgi. Ihe enemy followed this up with fur-
ther raids at 14.20 and 14.30. In all the
scale ot attack was 59 bombers and 24 fighters
that day.

192. On the 22nd March, plots of movements
were received from the R.D.F. set at 08.04
and o8 11 hours, Immediately afterwards there
was a temporary breakdown of the W/T. hnk
which, combined with interference, prevented
the reception of plots in the operations room
until the enemy attack had developed at 08.45

hours. Two Hurricanes had been sent off to

intercept a high flying enemy reconnaissance
aircratt heard over the airfield at 08.30. They
had not yet made contact when at 03.47 hours
27 bombers with an escort of ten plus fighters
appeared over the aerodrome, followed a
quarter of an hour later by a second wave of
27 bombers also with fighter escort. As no
warning of these raids had been received, no
further fighters were sent off to engage. The
two Hurricanes already in the air engaged the
Japanese formation and damaged two.

193. Considerable damage was sustained.
The runways were rendered unserviceable,
communications were broken down and a num-
ber pf aircraft, both bombers and fighters,
were destroyed on the ground.

194. Immediately afterwards, the Com-
mander of the Second Pursuit Squadron,
A.V.G., reported to Group Captain Seton
Broughall that in view of the absence of warn-
ing and the scale of attack he was compelled
by the terms of his mstructions from General
Chennault to withdraw his remaming flyable
aircraft to refit. At this stage of the action
only three P.4os and three Hurricanes remained
flyable, the Hurricanes alone being operation-
ally serviceable. The A.V.G.’s P.qos withdrew
to Loiwing that afternoon followed by their
ground party. ‘

195. At 13.30 hours reconnaissance aurcraf:
were again reported approaching and two of
the three remaining Hurricanes were sent up
but failed to intercept. While they were re-
turning to land at 14.30 the enemy again com-
menced his attacks with two waves of 27 and
26 bombers respectively, each accompanied by

fighter escort. This terminated the enemy’s
attacks. <

196. Great damage had been done and 9
Blenheims and at least 3 P.40’s were destroyed
on the ground, 5, Blenheims were unserviceable,
while 3 Hurricanes had been destroyed in air,
combat. The remaining 20 aircrait (6 Blen-
heims, 3 P.40’s and 1x Hurricanes) were
flyable but unserviceable due to normal un-
serviceability or damage from enemy action.
These aircraft, except the P.40’s, were flown
out to Akyab.

197. This grave reverse to Burwing—the
R.A.F. detachment in Upper Burma—was the
result of our weakness in fighters, the weakness
of the warning system at Magwe and the com-
plete absence of aircraft pens and bad dispersal
arrangements at this airfield so hurriedly occu-
pied. There has been a good deal of criticism
of the subsequent hasty move of Burwing {rom
Magwe, while it had an adverse effect on the
morale of both the Army and the civil popula-
tion.

198. The convoy left Magwe for Lashio and

Loiwing early on the morning of the 23rd.
Salvage and refuelling parties were left behind.

199. On the nights of the 2and and 23rd
respectively, I met General Alexander and
Group Captain Seion broughall at Maymyo. lt
was connrmed that Burwing would be with-
drawn to Lashio and Loiwing—the only remain-
ing aerodrome where fair warning existed—tor
reatting.

200. In the meantime it was proposed to
try and make good the warning at Magwe, to
put it into a proper state ot detence and fit for
Burwing to 1e.urn there tor operations. As
the convoy thad already left Magwe I issued
instructions tor the R.D.F set to be turned
round and sent back to Magwe and for the
salvage and working parties at Magwe to be
strengthened.

201. Loiwing was the only airfield leit with
reasonable warning and therefore the proposal
to leave Magwe and to refit at Loiwing was
not unsound despite the great distance of the
latter airfield from the area in which the Army
was operating. By use of the advanced landing
grounds, hmited support could be given to the
Army until the detence at Magwe was satis-
factorily completed and the aerodrome re-
eccupied. At Lashio warning was weak.

202. As events turned out it would not have
been possible to reoccupy Magwe since the air-
field tell into enemy hands 3 weeks later and
the organisation oi the waining system and
the provision of works—for which only hmited
labour then existed—could not have been done
in time. Additionally, the observer corps belt
in the Sittang Valley anc the Valley of the
Irrawaddy was gradually being rolled up and
with it any warning from this source.

Enemy Action—Akyab

203. The enemy had also found our small
force at Akyab. A similar action took place
which commenced on the 23rd, was repeated
on the 24th and on the 27th. Our fighters inter-
cepted on 2 occasions inflicting a loss of 4
enemy aircra.t destroyed and 3 probably de-
troyed for a cost of 6 Hurricanes.

204. Although warning was received on the
27th, low flying enemy fighters caught our
small force unprepared on the ground on this
occasion. 2 Hurnmcanes got into the air and
engaged, r being shot down. 7 Hurricanes
were destroyed on the ground and a Valencia.
Instructions had already been issued by Air
Headquarters, India, to withdraw Akwing
from Akyab to Chittagong as warning was so
weak, Akyab would continue to be an ad-
vanced landing ground for refuelling aircrait
and to enable our Hudson reconnaissance to
reach the Andaman Islands. A small R.D.F.
set with a limited range of 20 miles, had been
flown in and was operating, but the observer
corps warning for Akyab was poor. The posts
were few, only the outlines of communication
existing owing to the difficult nature of the
country.

205. These two actions—at Magwe and at
Akyab—in effect terminated the R.A.F. activi-
ties based in Burma. The supply of aircraft
now became the critical factor. The necessity
to build up our defence in North Eastern India
and Ceylon brought about a decision by the
Commander-in-Chief, India, not to re-equip
Burwing. The maintenance of a small force
in Burma was uneconomical in view of the lack
of warning and increasing weight of attack.
