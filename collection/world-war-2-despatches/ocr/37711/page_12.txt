Falaise, and had thus had ample opportunity
for the development of strong, well sited
defences.

Strenuous efforts continued to close the cor-
ridor between Falaise and Argentan. British
and American forces pressed in from all sides
of the pocket to annihilate the enemy which it
contained. XV United States Corps was well
established in the Argentan area on 13th
August.

VIII United States Corps advanced north
from Mayenne to positions on the western flank
of XV United States Corps. Meanwhile V and
XIX United States Corps pressed on in the
extreme western and north-western sectors of
the pocket.

The main Canadian thrust on Falaise from
the north was resumed on 14th August, and
the town fell to the Canadians on 16th August.

The battle of the pocket continued, but by
16 August the enemy lost almost all cohesion:
divisions were hopelessly jumbled up and com-
manders were able to control no more than
their own battle groups. The Allied Air Forces
were presented with targets probably un-
paralleled in this war: aircraft formations were
engaging endless columns of enemy transport,
packed bumper to bumper and rendered im-
mobile by the appalling congestion.

On 19 August the neck of the pocket was
finally closed when American troops from the
south linked up at Chambois with the Polish

‘Armoured Division fighting with First
Canadian Army.

The next day the enemy made his last co-
ordinated attempt at forcing our cordon. After
this attack, which was unsuccessful, the battle
of the Mortain-Falaise pocket was virtually at
an end, though the process of mopping up took
some time.

Speedy regrouping on the Twelfth U.S. Army
Group front, combined with outstanding
administrative improvisation, enabled the ad-
vance eastwards of the Third U.S. Army to
continue while the battle of the Falaise pocket
was still in progress. By 20 August, troops

of General Patton’s army reached and: crossed

the Seine in the area of Mantes and be; to
work westwards along the river towards Elbeuf.

The other armies of 21 Army Group then
began the race to the Seine. The Allied Air
Forces throughout the drive to the river had
carried out relentless attacks against the ferries
which provided the only means of escape to
the enemy.

Second Army crossed the River Seine in the
vicinity of Vernon, and the leading troops were
across the river on 25 August. On First
Canadian Army front, 2 adian Corps
secured crossings about Port de ]’Arche and
Elbeuf, astride a sharp bend in the river about
eight miles south of Rouen on 26 August. The
crossings were made in most cases without
serious opposition.

In the Twelfth United States Army Group
sector, Third United States Army swept for-
ward to Troyes, Chalons-sur-Marne
Rheims. First United States Army began
crossing the Seine on 26 August between Melun
and Mantes Gassicourt.

The break out was now complete and the
drive across the Pas de Calais was about to
commence.

The outstanding point about the Battle of
Normandy is that it was fought exactly as
planned before the invasion. The measure of
our success was, in the event, far greater than
could ever have ‘been foreseen, because of the
faulty strategy of the enemy.

The only sound mili course open to the
Germans at the end of July, would have in-
volved staging a withdrawal to the Seine barrier
and with it the sacrifice of north-western
France. Instead he decided to fight it out
between the Seine and the Loire.

In planning to break out from the bridge-
head on the western flank, a prerequisite was
the retention of the main enemy strength on
the eastern flank. The extent to which this
was achieved is well illustrated in the following
table, which shows the estimated enemy
strength opposing us in the eastern and western
areas of our front during June and July.

This result was achieved by the retention
of the initiative and by very hard fighting,
which enabled us to expand our territorial
gains in the West and to engage and wear down
the enemy strength along the whole of the
Allied front.

The mounting of the break-out operation
suffered considerable delays. One of the main
reasons was the weather, which not only up-

set the schedule of our beach working, caus-
ing delay in the arrival of troops and stores,
but also hampered the action of the air forces.

The development of the bridgehead to the
South-East of Caen was a slow and difficult
matter. The success of the plan involved pull-
ing the enemy’s reserves against our Eastern
flank, and this was achieved to such a degree
that in spite of all our efforts it was impossible
