            "description": "108. The landings at Broadway, and subse- quently on another strip (* Chowringhee \u201d) some twenty miles south-south-east of Katha, achieved complete surprise and until the 12th March no ground opposition was met. Air attacks did not begin until the 10th and were directed against the Chowringhee strip which, by that time, had fulfilled its purpose and had been abandoned. The Broadway strip was not attacked until the 13th March, when our fighters were present and A.A. defences had been established. The Japanese lost about 50 per cent. of their attacking aircraft."

            "description": "38. The element of surprise which had accompanied the entry of these forces and which had been aided by diversionary bomb- ing around Bhamo and Indaw was maintained throughout. Even when the enemy divined our intentions, our air superiority was instru- mental in rendering his attacks ineffectual. It was not until 11th March and 13th March that the enemy attacked the two landing grounds which had been first extemporised\u2014 by which time one had already been evacuated and a detachment of Spitfires of No. 81 Squad- ron had been installed on the other. Other landing strips were contrived as the occasion arose, though for the most part the thirty columns of the division were supplied by drop- ping. Much of the effectiveness of this air supply depended upon the standard of training of the Dakota crews, The dropping zones were continually being changed as the columns moved from place to place. Delivery normally took place by night and there was often no ather guide than navigational skill supple- mented by pre-arranged light signals which be- came visible only when the aircraft arrived in the vicinity of the dropping zone. Danger from ground fire whilst dropping was a frequent and accepted risk. This was no less true of occa- sions on which Dakotas were able to utilise a landing ground, for enemy detachments were often in the neighbourhood. The strip opened in the later stages of the operation at Hopin was evacuated because of small arms fire through which our aircraft had unavoidably to pass before landing."

            "description": "The retreat was followed up and skilfully harassed in camp at night with light machine- gun fire from two companies of the Frontier Battalion, who inflicted losses on the enemy later reported as four lorry-loads of wounded. The enemy was thus pushed through Jigga fort, and, on 6th March fell into an ambush laid by the 2 Ethiopian Battalion (some 400 men) in a river-bed west of Dambacha. Here some 1,000 casualties, including 180 killed, were inflicted on the enemy column and two of his armoured cars were captured before he had been able to smother 2 Ethiopian Battalion by sheer weight of numbers. The losses of this Ethiopian Battalion were surprisingly light\u2014 one British Officer, 90 men and the whole of the battalion camel transport\u2014but the dis- organisation that they suffered in this gallant action was such as to render them practically valueless for the rest of the campaign: Attacked at the same time from the rear by companies: of the Frontier Battalion and on the flank by patriot bands, which were always more active when he was on the move, the enemy was thoroughly scared. On 8th March he .evacuated Dambacha, and, on the roth, burned down and abandoned Fort Emanuel east of the river Tamcha, thus giving up his original plan of defence of Eastern Gojjam. The commander of Gideon Force and the Frontier Battalion pressed hard on his heels, and on 13th March were in contact with him on the Gulit Hill position just west of Debra Markos. He had concentrated here all the remaining forces of Gojjam except for the garrison of Bahrdar Giyorgis, and a battalion at Mota. Ras Hailu was also called in with his Banda to help in the defence of the town."

Cooper, R.N., transported 4 Brigade of 26 Indian Division from Kyaukpyu and landed it unopposed due east of the village of Letpan, 36 miles south of Ru-Ywa. The landing was supported by naval gunfire from the ROEBUCK, ESKIMO, CAUVERY and JUMNA. This final landing on the Arakan coast was effected in order to cut the main road behind the enemy\u2019s forward troops. It brought us nearer Taungup and the western entrance to the last pass across the Yomas into the Irrawaddy Valley. The advance of 4 Brigade down the road axis to- wards -Taungup was rapid, despite considerable opposition, until it was held up, on the 25th March, by hill positions three miles south of"
