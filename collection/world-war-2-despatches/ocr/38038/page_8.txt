second salvo of four torpedoes at a range of
2,500 yards and claimed a further unobserved
hit. VIRAGO followed OPPORTUNE in and
at 1934 fired seven torpedoes at a range of
2,800 yards and observed two hits. The Sub-
Division then retired to the westward,
VIRAGO opening fire on the enemy while still
visible.

75. The hits scored by the 36th Division are
again difficult to assess as some were not
observed and as the cruisers were attacking
at about the same time; five hits in all is con-
sidered the most probable assessment. Little
information is available from prisoners, most
of whom were engaged in abandoning ship, but
SCHARNHORST seems to have taken a list
to starboard and they therefore consider that
most of the hits were on her starboard side.
One prisoner has confirmed three hits from
the same destroyer, possibly MUSKETEER or
SAVAGE,

SINKING OF THE SCHARNHORST.

76. Three cruisers and eight destroyers were
now in the target area and DUKE OF YORK
steered to the northward to avoid the melée.
All that could be seen of the SCHARNHORST
was a dull glow through a dense cloud of
smoke, which the starshell and searchlights of
the surrounding ships could not penetrate. No
ship therefore saw the enemy sink but it seems
fairly certain that she sank after a heavy under-
water explosion which was heard and felt in
several ships at about 1945. JAMAICA,
MATCHLESS and VIRAGO were the last ships
to sight her at about 1938; at 1948 when BEL-
FAST closed to deliver a second torpedo
attack she had definitely sunk in approxi-
mate position 72° 16’ N. 28° 41’ E.

77. JAMAICA rejoined DUKE OF YORK
to the northward whilst BELFAST, NOR-
FOLK and most of the destroyers searched the
area until 2040, during which time SCORPION
picked up 30 survivors and MATCHLESS six.
SCORPION reported subsequeniiy that the
Captain and the Commander of SCHARN-
HORST were seen in the water seriously
wounded; the Captain was dead before he
could be reached, the Commander grasped a
life-line [but succumbed (before he could be
hauled in. Soon after 2too SHEFFIELD re-
joined Force 1 and I ordered all forces in the
area to proceed independently to Kola Inlet
where they arrived without incident throughout
27th December,

78. The 36 prisoners picked up by ‘the
destroyers were transferred to DUKE OF
YORK at Kola Inlet and were provisionally
interrogated on board during the ship’s return
to Scapa. No officers survived, the most senior
of the prisoners being of the equivalent rating
of Acting Petty Officer.

SUPPLEMENT to tae LONDON GAZETTE, 7 AUGUST, - 1947

Conpuct oF OFFICERS AND MEN.

79. The conduct of all officers and men
throughout the action was in accordance with
the highest traditions of the Service.

80. Earlier in the day, the resolute attack
by Force 1 to drive off the enemy undoubtedly
saved the convoy and their subsequent shadow-
ing was invaluable to me in my approach.

8r. DUKE OF YORK fought hard and well
having drawn, for over an hour and a half,
the whole of the enemy’s fire. She was

‘frequently straddled with mear misses, ahead,

astern and on the beam. Both masts were shot
through by 11 inch shell which fortunately
did not explode.

82. That she was not hit was probably due
to masterly handling aided by accurate advice

from the plot. There is no doubt that the
DUKE OF YORK was the principal factor in
the battle. She fought the SC! HORST

at night and she won.

83. This in no way detracts from the achieve-
ments of the ‘‘S’’ class destroyers who with
great gallantry and dash pressed in unsup-
ported, to the closest ranges, to deliver their
attacks, being subjected the while to the. whole
fire power of the enemy, Their resolution and
skill shortened the battle and ensured the
sinking of the ship.

84. In general the speed of wireless com-
munication and the exceptional performance of
radar reflects the greatest credit on the per-
sonnel concerned and in this night battle con-
tributed in great measure to its success,

85. Plotting arrangements in the Fleet Flag-
ship worked well and were of great assistance
both to me and to the ship. I myself alternated
between the plot and the Admiral’s bridge, the
Chief of Staff remaining in the plot. I feel
very strongly that the officers in the plot must
always be in the closest contact with the
Admiral who should obviously be on the
bridge.

86. Although failings in material and per-
sonnel were few during this action it should
of course be remembered that the enemy in-
flicted very little damage on our ships and
they were not therefore extensively tested under
adverse conditions,

87. I should also like to record that the
accurate and concise information supplied by

‘the Admiralty in the early stages of this opera-

tion was of great assistance.

88. I have forwarded separately my recom-
mendations for honours and awards as a result
of this action.
