Neither Bomber Command nor No. 2 Group
attacked any rocket targets during the week.
Indeed, the latter were not asked to attack
any, for up to this time none suitable for the
method of precise bombing in which No. 2
Group specialised had been discovered.

183. All this time aircraft of No. 100 Group,
Bomber Command, were flying special patrols
with a view to intercepting and jamming any
radio transmissions which might appear to be
used to control the rocket. Aircraft of my
Command provided fighter escort for these
missions both at this stage and subsequently.
In addition, thousands ‘of reconnaissance
photographs were being taken and interpreted.
This procedure was in accordance with the
scheme which the Air Staff had prepared before
the attacks began.* One of the provisions of
that scheme was that every area indicated by
the radar, sound-ranging, and flash-spotting
complex as a suspected firing-point should be
photographed as soon as possible. My staff
pointed out, however, that since many of the
estimates based on these data were manifestly
incorrect,t and since experience had quickly
shown that the firing-points could not be seen
on reconnaissance photographs,} the procedure
served no useful purpose. At our suggestion
the Air Ministry agreed to a modification which
saved much effort on the part of skilled pilots
and interpreters: henceforward only areas in
which we expected reconnaissance to reveal
something of interest were photographed. We
also took advantage of the lull to perfect
arrangements for the rapid provision of the
‘* target material ’’ which was used in briefing
bomber crews, and to discuss our problems with
Bomber Command.

September to 12th October, 1944).

184. On the evening of the 25th September
the lull came to an end. At 1910 hours a rocket
fell near Diss, in Suffolk. Neither the flash-
spotting nor the sound-ranging troops coud
give us any useful data about its origin, and
at first the radar stations were equally reticent.
Even the objective which the Germans had
meant to hit remained unknown. Hence the
rocket might have come from any area in Ger-
man hands which was within 230 miles of the
point of impact—for this, as we had reason to
believe, was the maximum range of the A-4.
Thus we were reduced to this hypothesis: that
if the rocket had been aimed at London, then
it must have come from the Hague or some-
where near it; but if at some other target, then
it could have come from another part of Hol-
land, from the Frisians, or even from a part
of Germany near Cleves.

185. On the following afternoon another
rocket landed in East Anglia—this time about
eight miles from Norwich, which subsequently
proved to be the target. Once again the tech-
nical devices were silent; but five minutes
before the rocket fell, chance observers flying
‘over a point about fourteen miles west

of Armhem saw a trail rise, as they
supposed, from a wood some twenty
miles away, rales the Speulder Bosch
and adjoining village of Garderen.
Immediately =f erwards the wood appeared to
catch fire over an area of perhaps two acres
and remain alight for about five minutes. The
trail, or one like it, was also seen by chance
observers who were flying well north of the
Frisians, and thought it came from Ameland
or Schiermonnikoog.

186. Now, Garderen lies between Amers-
foort and Apeldoorn, in the direction which the
firing troops were said to have taken when
they left the Hague. Moreover, a secret infor-
mant had mentioned Apeldoorn as the ap-
parent destination of a trainload of rockets
and fuel which he claimed to have seen a week
before. That the rocket which had fallen near
Norwich originated from the Speulder Bosch
was thus a plausible hypothesis, especially as
a trail ascending from that area might well
look to observers over the North Sea as if it
came from the Frisians.

187. Meanwhile the films which should have
recorded any data obtained by the radar sta-
tions about the rocket that fell near Diss had
been scrutinized without success. They were
scrutinized again; and this time faint traces
were found on them. These traces showed that
the missile had come from a point more remote
oon the stations than had the rockets observed

the earlier phase of the attacks. Armed
sith this evidence, the specialist whose task it
was to calculate the location of firing points
from such data went to work. After some delay
he gave an ‘‘ estimated position ’’ which co-
incided with the village of Garderen.

188. Superficially the case for Garderen as
the new firing area now looked stronger than,
perhaps, it really was. The specialist, who was
frankly giving an estimate and not the result
of a purely objective calculation, may have
been influenced by the knowledge that the next
rocket was supposed to have come from the
Speulder Bosch. If so, the whole case really
rested on a’single item of positive evidence—
the trail seen from a distance of twenty miles.

Yet one thing was certain from the impartial -

testimony of the radar traces: the Suffolk
rocket had not come from the Hague or
Wassenaar but from some more distant spot.
Accordingly I authorised the removal of the
suspected storage sites at Terhorst, Eikenhorst,
and Raaphorst from the list of ‘‘ Crossbow ”
targets which we had furnished to Bomber
Command.

i89. On the 27th September No. 12 Group
sent four Tempest pilots to make an armed
reconnaissance of the area between Amersfoort
and Apeldoorn. They saw signs of military
activity at two points in and adjoining the
Speulder Bosch and a third point just south of
the neighbouring railway; but there was no
proof that this activity had anything to do with
rockets. However, on the same day and the
two following days six more rockets fell near
Norwich and one off the Norfolk coast. In
four of these seven cases the information fur-
nished by radar suggested or was consistent
with firing from the area between Amersfoort
and Apeldoorn. Whether our suspicions of the
Speulder Bosch were justified or not evidently
