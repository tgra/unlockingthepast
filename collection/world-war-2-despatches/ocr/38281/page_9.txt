SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON. GAZETTE, 5 MAY, 1948

68. I considered this most carefully but
decided against such a detachment for the
following reasons : —

(i) It would involve my main forces re-
maining in a position to support these cruisers
and prevent them from being cut off by

- enemy forces. ,

(ii) Action as in (i) would cause an un-
acceptable delay in rejoining the convoy.

(iii) Isolated ships in such close proximity
to the enemy coast would be singled out for
air attack. BERWICK was most vulnerable
to this form of attack and her disablement
would have involved all my force to effect
her extrication.

(iv) There was no evidence to indicate that
the damaged ship would remain stopped and
she might well effect an escape before she
could be overtaken.

A subsequent air search failed to locate this
cruiser, so it appears that the stoppage was,
in fact, only temporary.

69. I therefore ordered Vice Admiral Com-
manding, 18th Cruiser Squadron, to join the
convoy with MANCHESTER and SOUTH-
AMPTON and instructed ARK ROYAL to
attack the damaged cruiser if he considered it
feasible.

zo. At 1410 ARK ROYAL flew off the second
T/B Striking Force. This Force consisted
of the T.S.R.s who had carried out the morn-
ing reconnaissance. The Squadron Leader was
given the enemy battlefleet as his objective
but with full liberty to change the objective if
a successful attack was impracticable and if
by so doing he considered he had more chance
of achieving successful results,

71. The second T/B Striking Force located
three cruisers screened by four destroyers 12
miles off the S.E. coast of Sardinia and steering
to the Eastward at high speed. Some 8 miles
ahead of the cruisers the two battleships were
also seen now heavily screened by ten de-
stroyers.

72, In view of the total absence of cloud
cover it was considered essential to attack out of
the sun if any surprise was to be achieved. An
attempt to reach such a position on the battle-
ships would inevitably have led to the cruisers
sighting “and reporting the position of the
Striking Force. It was therefore decided to
attack the cruisers.

73. As the first aircraft reached the dropping
position the cruisers turned together to Star-
board. This caused several of the following
flights, who were already committed to their
drop, to miss their targets, but one hit was
observed on the rear cruiser and another
possible hit on the leading cruiser.

74. The attack was unobserved until very
late, only two salvos being fired before the first
torpedo was dropped. After this the gunfire
was intense but appeared to be quite regard-
less of direction or danger to their own ships.
One large projectile was seen to hit the water
close to the rear cruiser and shells from closé
range weapons were seen to burst close along-
side all ships. oa

75. Two of our aircraft were hit by shrapnel
but neither was unserviceable and all returned
safely to ARK ROYAL. a

2807

76. A striking force of 7 Skuas which flew
off from ARK ROYAL at 1500 failed to locate
the damaged cruiser but attacked 3 cruisers of
the Condottieri class steering North off the
South West corner. of Sardinia. An unobserved
attack was carried out en the rear cruiser and
two near misses may have caused some damage.
On the way back to the carrier an Italian
R.0.43 was shot down.

Enemy Air Attacks.

77. At 1407 whilst our surface forces were
proceeding at 19 knots to rejoin the convoy
R.D/F gave indications of enemy bomber for-
mations in the vicinity. The line was staggered.

78. The first visual indication of the attack
was bomb splash on the horizon.' This was the
result of an attack by the Fulmar Fighter Patrol
which caused several of the enemy formation to
jettison their bombs.

79. As soon as the enemy aircraft, which
consisted of 10 S.79 in V formation, were sighted
a Blue Turn* was executed to bring all guns
to bear. The enemy maintained a steady course
and dropped their bombs well clear of the heavy
ships, their bombs falling close to the screening
destroyers.

80. Two further attacks were made, each by
squadrons of 5 aircraft. In both cases ARK
ROYAL who had been engaged in flying opera-
tions and was not actually in the line, was the
objective. In‘these attacks, apart from a few
bombs which were jettisoned as a result of inter-
ception by our fighters, most accurate bombing
was carried out. ARK ROYAL was completely
obscured by bomb splashes two at least of which
fell within 10 yards of the ship. No hits were
however obtained and no damage resulted.

81. The complete failure of either fighter
attack or gunfire to break up the formation
flying of the Italian squadrons was most note-
worthy.

82. No further bombing attacks took place,
and the convoy was sighted at 1700.

Remarks on the Movements of Enemy Forces
after the Action. :

83. The movements of enemy units from the
time when surface action ceased at 1312 until
he was finally lost to sight by air reconnaissance
at 1655 are not fully established. From analysis
of various reports the following appear most
probable: —

(a) Immeditely after surface action ceased
the enemy battlefleet, which consisted of x Lit-
torio and 1 Cavour class screened by 7
destroyers, steered for Cagliari at about 25

- knots. At about 1500 they turned to the

Eastward and at about 1520 to the North

Eastward round Cape Carbonira. When last

seen at 1655 they were steering North up the

East coast of Sardinia. At some time between

the attacks of the first and second T/B Strik-

ing Forces they are reported to have increased
their destroyer screen from 7 to 10 destroyers.

There is no indication that their speed was

ever materially reduced below 25 knots.

ordered by the signal.
