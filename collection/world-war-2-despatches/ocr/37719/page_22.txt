(iv) Hispano 20-mm. Equipment.

A few of these weapons only were deployed
and, owing to shortage of ammunition and
lack of tracer, were not found very effective.

5. Part Played by Searchlights.
(a) Day.

Owing to the close spacing of Searchlight
sites they formed a valuable source of intelli-
gence and rapid reports were able to be made
upwards of casualties to friendly and enemy
aircraft, pilots descending by parachute and
other incidents of importance. In addition,
they have been able to provide valuable reports
of isolated enemy aircraft, trace of which had
been Jost by the Observer Corps.

The value of the A.A.L.M.G. with which
each site was equipped cannot be too highly
stressed, and during the 4 months under re-
view no less than 23 enemy aircraft were
destroyed, confirmed, by A‘A.L.M.G. at
Searchlight sites (this includes a few in which
A.A.L.M.G. at H.A.A. sites also shared).
Prisoner of War reports showed that it was not
generally known by the German Air Force
pilots that Searchlight sites were equipped with
A.A. defence.

(b) Night.
Tactical employment of Searchlights at night
was by either—
(i) 3-beam rule, in which 3 sites only
engaged the target; or
(ii) by the Master-beam system, in which
one Master beam per three sites exposed
and was followed by the remaining two
beams acting under the orders of the Master

2

The decision to engage was the responsibility
of the Detachment Commander, and no direct
tactical control was exercised from Battery
Headquarters.

In the early stages of the Battle of Britain
night activity was on a small scale and Search-
lights had few raids to engage. Some illumina-
tions were effected, but throughout it was diffi-
cult, by ground observations, to assess the
actual numbers. Frequently illuminations were
reported by sites not engaging the targets. The
difficulty of illumination was increased as the
number of night raids increased, owing to the
difficulty of sites selecting the same target.

There is evidence to show that Searchlight
activity, whilst being difficult to measure, forced
enemy aircraft to fly at a greater height than
they would otherwise have done. Bombs were
frequent); dropped when enemy aircraft were
illuminated, which were possibly intended to
discourage Searchlights from exposing.
Evasive tactics by the enemy consisted of
changing height and speed continuously to
avoid being illuminated rather than a violent
evasive action upon illumiriation.

6. G.L, Equipment.

At the beginning of August experiments had
just been completed to determine whether G.L.
eiaipnent could satisfactorily be used as a
Ships detector. Apart from the results of this
experiment three other facts emerged:—

(a) The G.L. principle was of considerable
value when used in conjunction with Search-
lights.

‘SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 SEPTEMBER, 1946

(b) That G.L. sets sited in an anti-ship réle,

f.e., on the top of a cliff, were of consider-

able value in detecting low-flying aircraft.

(c) It showed the value of small R.D.F.
detectors within the main R.A.F. chain, in
plotting enemy aircraft direct to sectors.

At the beginning of the Battle of Britain,
ax G.L. sets were in use by 6th A.A. Division,
and by October this number had been increased
by another 14.

(i) G.L. at Gun Stations.

The main function of these equipments was
to provide data for Unseen target engagements
as described above. One other function of these
sets is worth special mention.

Two sets were specially sited on the cliffs
at Dover to pick up targets at low level. These
sets were able to register aircraft taking off
from the aerodromes immediately behind
Calais, thereby obtaining information consider-
ably earlier than could be provided by the
main R‘D.F. station on the coast. This in-
formation was reported back to Uxbridge
Operations Room by a priority code message
which indicated the approximate number of
aircraft which had taken off and their position.
This report was received some 5/6 minutes be-
fore it could be received through the usual
R.D.F. channels, and therefore enabled the
Controller to order his Fighters off the ground
correspondingly earlier than would otherwise
have been the case.

This system, which was also adopted some-
what further along the coast in the neighbour-
hood of Beachy Head, was of all the more
value as the enemy were heavily bombing the
R.D.F. stations, which were consequently
sometimes out of action. :

(ii) G.L. Stations with Searchlights.

During the latter stages of the offensive,
when the night raids on London commenced,
it was realised that the G.L. would be of con-
siderable assistance to Night Fighters. An
“ elevation ’’ attachment to the equipment was
produced and this enabled height to be ob-
tained, which in conjunction with a plotting
scheme at S.O.R., enabled Searchlight beams
to be directed more accurately on a target to
assist night fighters. The results obtained from
this were not completely satisfactory, but they

‘showed the way to the development of the

present system.

(iii) Mine-Laying Aircraft.

It was found that the experiments conducted
in the ship-detector réle could be very satis-
factorily applied to detecting mine-laying air-
craft which flew in at a height too low to be
picked up. by the C.H. Stations. It enabled
accurate tracks of these aircraft to be kept
which were afterwards passed to the Naval
Authorities, who were then able to sweep up
ae mines which had been laid by these air-
craft.

4. Statistics,

tion expenditure and enemy aircraft shot down,
