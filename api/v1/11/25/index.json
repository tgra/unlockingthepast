            "description": "General Cunningham received my decision loyally and at once issued his orders to give effect toit. Iwas, however, somewhat disturbed by what seemed to be excessive anxiety on his part lest the enemy should break through in force to our rear areas, and dislocate our vul- nerable supply and repair organisation east of the frontier. His anxiety undoubtedly grew when the enemy swiftly followed up his recent success by a powerful counter-stroke with that very intention, thrusting eastwards on the 24th November with his armoured divisions to the frontier and beyond. I thought, however, that, after discussing the situation with me and hear- ing that I was determined to continue the offen- sive, he would feel himself capable of giving effect to my decision whole heartedly. I there- fore returned to Cairo on 25th November."

            "description": "The enemy tanks crossed the frontier wire at several points, and by the 25th November parties of the enemy were scattered all over the country east of it. Twice, enemy tanks attacked the 4th Indian Division at Sidi Omar; but thanks to the staunchness and restraint of the artillery and to the skilful dispositions of General Messervy, they were driven off with heavy loss. Nevertheless the enemy captured many prisoners and reached a point nineteen miles east of Sidi Omar and within fifty miles of our railhead. They also created a stir in the advanced headquarters of the Eighth Army near Maddalena by moving southwards along the frontier wire towards it. On the 26th November the enemy tanks turned north into Halfaya. Then, after an unsuccessful attack on Capuzzo and Musaid, they passed through a gap east of Sollum Barracks, which the New Zealanders had previously tried in vain to close, and entered Bardia, where they were joined by other columns from the south-east."

            "description": "But, although signed by the representatives of the United States, the report was objected to in Washington, mainly on the ground that cer- tain political matters had been introduced. An amended A.D.B. agreement, known as A.D.B. 2, was therefore drawn up in London in August 1941, leaving all the main features of A.D.B. practically unchanged, but putting the political matters into an appendix. This, however, did not entirely satisfy the United States authorities in Washington, and eventu- ally it was decided that a further conference should be held in the Far East to draw up a modified A.D.B. This information was con- veyed to me on the 25th November, 1941, but was received too late for any action to be taken before war started."

            "description": "In the meantime two mobile columns, con- sisting of rz Hussars and the Royals, with supporting arms, under command of 7 Armoured Division, were directed on Msus across the desert. By the evening of 16th November they had reported Mechili clear and were operating within forty miles of Msus. Rain now began to fall again and it took the two columns twenty-four hours to struggle through sixty miles of waterlogged ground to the escarpment which \u2018the enemy rearguard was holding to cover the evacuation of Benghazi. On 18th November they engaged the rearguard at Sceleidima and Antelat, the two main passes in the escarpment, but were unable to force their way past. During the night the enemy withdrew and the advance of the two columns was again delayed by bad going. On the zoth xr Hussars entered Benghazi* and found the town and neighbour- hood clear of enemy, and it was not until mid- day of the 21st that the Royals made touch with the enemy rearguard again at Agedabia. The admunistrative position was now becoming easier and the vanguard of 22 Armoured Brigade, having raced across two hundred and sixty miles of desert, at once began to turn the enemy\u2019s flank. Thus threatened he lost no time in abandoning Agedabia. The road southwards was heavily mined and the advance was much impeded; but by 25th November patrols were in contact with the next enemy position at Agheila. The whole of Cyrenaica was now in our hands."

The remainder of the British naval and military personnel from Samos and the escapees from Leros found their way south in a variety of craft, including two Italian F-lighters, \u201cone towing an L.C.M., two L.C.T.st, an Italian tug towing a M.M.S., various minesweepers and coastal craft, all of whom arrived in Levant ports by 2nd Decem- ber. One of these F-lighters which left Leros on 15th November under the command of Lieutenant Stowell, R.N.R., reached Haifa via Samos with 177 German prisoners from Leros still on board on 25th November."

            "description": "223. The German offensive came to an end at 1645 hours on the 27th March, when the one thousand, one hundred and fifteenth rocket to fall in this country or within sight of shore fell to earth at Orpington, in Kent. The campaign had lasted seven months. During that time the Germans had fired at least 1,300 rockets at London and some 40 or more at Norwich. Of these 518 had fallen within the London Civil Defence Region and none at all within the boundaries of the latter city. Altogether, 2,51x people had been killed and 5,869 seriously injured in London, and 213 killed and 598 seriously injured elsewhere. These figures would have been substantially smaller but for a number of unlu: incidents, in which rockets chanced to hit crowded buildings. Among the worst of these incidents were three which occurred at New Cross Road, Deptford, on the 25th November, 1944, and at Smithfield Market and Hughes Mansions, Stepney, on the 8th and 27th March respec- tively. Deplorable as these occurrences were, their rarity is a measire of the random quality of the long-range rocket in the stage to which the Germans had developed it."

This small convoy was to be escorted by four destroyers from the Home Fleet and any minesweepers and_ trawlers which could be made available. The Admiralty, however, insisted in their reply of 26th November that it was essential to provide a covering force strong enough to deal with the scale of attack which they expected, and considered that the only alternatives were either to sail thirty ships in company, or in three groups so close together that one force could cover all three. After.further discussion, including a visit to London by my Chief of Staff, I was directed to sail the convoy in two parts of sixteen ships each, escorted by seven destroyers and some smaller craft; and the Home Fleet\u2019 was reinforced by two 6-inch"
