            "description": "unfortunate in that their first major battle had been against such experienced troops and so dashing an enemy commander but, as General Eisenhower reported on 26th February, they were resolved to benefit immediately from the battle experience gained by the intensive training of all formations. Their improvement was indeed continuous and outstanding throughout the campaign. Another result of the battle had been that Allied formations of all three nationalities were very mixed up over the whole front and my first intention was to carry out a thorough reorganization. On the day I assumed command, in an order issued on 19th February, I laid down the following principles. Separate"

            "description": "25. The climax of the main battle in central Burma was meanwhile not long delayed. During December the Fourteenth Army struck eastwards, and with the occupation of Wuntho by 4 Corps on the 20th, secured its left flank by laying the basis for a continuous front with the Northern Combat Area Command. The railhead at Ye-U was occupied by 33 Corps on New Year's Day, and the Japanese stronghold  at Monywa was finally teduced on the 21st, by when 33 Corps had reached the general line of the Irrawaddy, on which it was evident that the enemy had resolved to make a stand. Bridgeheads had however been secured by 20 Division on the left bank of the river at Thabeikkyin and Singu, and in the great bend of the Irrawaddy the Japanese stoutly defended the approaches to Sagaing on the right bank. In these two sectors, where the contending forces were not separated by the river, bitter fighting continued throughout the second half of January and the first half of February. To the northeast, the Northern Combat Area Command forces were moving southwards across the Shweli valley and towards Lashio ; Hsenwi was a on 19th February, and Namtu on the"

            "description": "The month of February and the early days of March were the most critical periods in Tunisia, where I assumed command on 19th February, and it was impossible for me to give the plans for Sicily any detailed attention. I did, however, suggest certaim modifications to General Gairdner when he saw me at the end of February, for the consideration of his planning staff. These were directed to eliminate  certain unsatisfactory points in the onginal London plan; to ensure, for instance, that divisions were employed as such and not spht up unnecessarily, to provide a Force Reserve and to ensure a more concentrated use of our airborne forces to neutralise the beach defences by cancelling a proposed operation against communications in Calabria. I also considered at this time concentrating the efforts of both Task Forces against the south-eastern corner of the island This was a proposal to which I was later to return but on first consideration it was rejected on the ground that port facilities in this area would be insufficient to support our whole force, and it still seemed essential to ensure the early capture of Palermo. To overrun the island if defended by a garrison of eight enemy divisions, which was the current Intelligence estimate of the probable enemy strength, would require at least ten divisions and I was informed that only with the use of both Palermo and Catania could we be sure of maintaining that number."

Brigade, and the Merille chiefs, which at first appeared successful. But it was soon apparent that they would only come to heel when the enemy was evicted from the Omo delta and we occupied Kalam which, it was reported, was held only by Merille and some of the Donyiro tribe."

            "description": "201. On the 16th February, naval forces, commanded by Captain D. C. Hill, R.N., landed 53 Brigade at Ru-Ywa against slight opposition. Enemy gunfire from the Tamandu area was dealt with by the NARBADA and JUMNA. This initial success, and the subsequent build-up, were largely due to audacious minor operations carried out during the three nights preceding the landing. Detailed reconnaissance by 3 Commando Brigade of the mangrove swamps west of Ru-Ywa revealed an unoccupied island four miles from the proposed bridgehead. A battery of medium artillery was unobtrusively transported to it by naval landing craft, a light airstrip was constructed, and supplies dumped. The enemy never succeeded in locating this battery and its support proved invaluable. The Japanese made a determined attack on the bridgehead on the 19th February,"

            "description": "100. On the Northern Combat Area Command front 36 British Division (less 29 Brigade), advancing on Mongmit from the north, effected a strongly opposed crossing of the Shweli River during the first week of February. The first attempt failed, but the second one, made with increased air support, was successful near the bend of the river north of Myitson. Myitson fell on the 9th February and the advance continued against stiff resistance. On the 17th, the enemy counterattacked in strength, using flame-throwers and rouch artillery. They succeeded in penetrating our forward positions, but were ejected by a Spirited attack by an Indian battalion after bitter hand-to-hand fighting. Our further progress towards Mongmit continued to meet with determined resistance. 29 Brigade, advancing on Mongmit from the west, captured Nabu on the 18th February and, by the end of the month, had reached a point approximately half way between Nabu and Mongmit, Further east, 50 Chinese Division entered Namtu on the 23rd February, capturing eleven locomotives and a quantity of tolling stock. Further east again, 30 Chinese Division captured Hsenwi on the night 18th  19th February against light opposition. This village lies on the Burma Road about 30 miles north-east of Lashio. The enemy in this sector appeared to be falling back to positions immediately north of Lashio, with a view to defending that town."
