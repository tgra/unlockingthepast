            "description": "228. Early in April, 5 Brigade of 2 British Division and 268 Indian Brigade, advancing south-west from Myingyan Natogyi area and destroying many isolated enemy detachments en route, encountered stubborn resistance at Mount Popa. This is an extinct volcano, 5,000 feet in height, whose steep slopes afforded excellent defensive facilities. Here a force of about 600 Japanese, supported by field and medium artillery, held out until the 20th April, when they were finally eliminated, losing much equipment including vehicles and guns. While this action was in progress, the remainder of 2 British Division was being flown out to India. The fly-out began on the 1lith April from Myingyan and was completed by the 25th. For administrative reasons, it had become necessary to reduce the forces in Central Burma by one division, and 2 British Division was required as the follow-up division of the force for operation   Dracula,  the capture of Rangoon by a combined airborne and seaborne landing, which was discussed in the last section."
