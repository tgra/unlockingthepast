            "description": "40. Besides the two submarines which formed part of the close escort, four were dis- posed off the Northern Lofoten Islands in an attempt to intercept the German surface ships if they moved north, and three off the north coast in the usual covering positions. \u2018Che SCHEER, HIPPER and KOLN moved up froma Narvik to Altenfiord on 10th September. They were sighted by all four submarines on the coastal patrols, TIGRIS, TRIBUNE, UREDD and P.54 ; but the TIGRIS alone was close enough to fire torpedoes: her attack was spoilt by one of the screening destroyers, which almost rammed her just before she fired, .and the torpedoes missed astern. After this, the four inshore submarines were moved up to join the covering patrol off the north coast."

            "description": "41. The convoy was first sighted by an enemy aircraft late on 8th September, but was not shadowed until 12th September. This immunity was due to clouds and low visibility ; but it did not unduly disturb the enemy, for his U-boats were in contact and shadowing from 10th September onwards. It did, how- ever, prevent the early and comparatively small scale air attacks which had been directed against previous convoys; and thus had the unexpected and unfortunate result of depriving the guns and fighters of the practice and experi- ence which would have helped them to deal with the first massed attack."
