20. The General Situation and Future Plans,

It has been recorded in Part I that early
in the period covered by this Despatch it was
necessary to recast our long term administrative
plans, and that a directive giving data for pre-
paring fresh plans for the future was issued to
my Long Term Administrative Planning Com-
mittee on the 7th August; also that certain short
term improvements on the Assam L of C were
urgently considered. ,

With regard to long term planning, the Com-
mittee were able to furnish an administrative
review in September 1943 covering the ground
indicated to them in my above mentioned direc-
tive for plans for 1944-45.

Their general conclusions were disquieting.
They showed that limiting factors in India as
a whole were likely to exist under all the main
headings of movement and transportation, con-
struction of accommodation for stores and per-
sonnel, and provision of Indian manpower.
They also found that the number and capacity
of India’s ports (and the railways and roads
serving those ports) together with the need to
maintain the level of imports and exports so
as to meet the requirements of India’s produc-
tion of war material and to maimtain India as
a secure base for operations, restricted at the
present time India’s capacity to Jaunch
amphibious operations, °

They remarked that it would be essential for
three and probably four of the divisions, likely
to be needed for future operations, to by-pass
India. It would also be desirable for subse-
quent maintenance to be partly by direct ship-
ments from bases outside India.

Action to improve the transportation capa-
city of ports and roads leading thereto was a
matter of urgent and major importance, and
the following steps were suggested : —

(a) The provision of additional broad gauge
locomotives and wagons.

(0) Development of rail and road -ap-
proaches to the ports, and action to improve
capacity, rémove congestion and speed up
the turn-round at and in the vicinity of ports.

(c) Improvements designed to increase port
capacity—such as provision of additiorial
moorings, port craft and other facilities, these
measures to be put on a war time basis so as
to give early results, as opposed to long term
improvements of permanent post-war value.

(2) The development of small ports likely
to be suitable for smaller assault shipping,
etc. Also the use of the smaller ports for
coastal traffic in order to ease the load on
the railways. .

(e) An increased use of these smaller ports
for civil imports and exports.

Though this last named expedient might not
be very desirable from a civil point of view,
it would enable the larger ports to deal with a
greater flow of military stores and traffic. To
achieve results, however, diversion of civil
traffic would have to take place well before-
hand, as a permanent war-time measure.

a1. These conclusions were so far-reaching that .

base for the operations contemplated was neces-
sary. For this an operational background was
required with estimates of the forces. I there-
fore asked for this in a telegram to the Chiefs
of Staff on the 14th September and received
the required information on the 27th September. -
It conformed generally to my own estimates.

In the meantime examination of India’s
potential as a base for the operations of the
South East Asia Command was taken in hand
on broad lines by the War Projects Co-ordina-
tion and Administrative Committee of the Gov-~

-ernment of India. Here I should mention that

although this Committee comprised representa-
tives of all civil as well as military organisa-
tions having to do with transportation and
supply, it has been my constant concern to
keep civil officials of the Government of India,
including the Railways, informed and alive as
to how their various spheres might be affected
by developments, Accordingly, I held meet-
ings with high civil officials from time to time
with this end in view.

The War Projects Co-ordination and Adminis-
trative Committee, as a result of their examina-
tion, advised the Government that, in their
view, demands likely to be placed on India in
the normal course in order to carry out these
long-term plans were probably not only beyond
her capacity in the time available, but that
the continuance of the strain on India’s
economy even at the existing level, for another
two years, was likely to lead to most serious
consequences. They advised certain measures
to meet this dangerous situation, and classified
them under two headings, %

22. Firstly, there were measures designed to
counter the menace of inflation and restrict
or absorb surplus purchasing power in the
country, These were as follows: —

(a) Enough silver should be imported to
meet the pay and allowances of the addi-
tional United Nations Forces involved.

(b) The amount of pay which personnel
of the United States Forces could draw in
India, should be restricted as it is for
Dominion troops.

(¢) Enough canteen stores should be im-‘
ported to absorb at least 50 per cent. of the
purchasing power of the additional Allied,
troops required.

(dq) Importation of certain specifically
detailed consumer goods for the civil popu-
lation—these, as in North Africa, to be
demanded as essential on military grounds.

(e) Foodstuffs should be imported for the
civil population. * .

23. The second series of measures recom-
mended were designed to restrict to safety limits
further demands on India for services and sup-
plies for war purposes. They were as follows:—

(a) The volume of war production to
which India is already committed should not
be exceeded.

(b) New products for manufacture, or the
expansion of existing production for war pur-
poses, should only be undertaken if pro-
duction could be achieved by June, 1944.

(c) As regards 1945, His Majesty’s Govern-
ment should be pressed to accept a drastic
curtailment of demands on India for war
supplies.
