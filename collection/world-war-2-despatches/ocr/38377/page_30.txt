OPERATION ‘‘ Harpoon ”’

Report OF PROCEEDINGS OF PASSAGE OF
Force X AND Convoy TO MALTA ON I4TH
AND I5TH JUNE, 1942. Ld

Sunday, 14th June.

At 2115 Force X was detached from Force
T in position 37° 38’ N., 10° 13’ E. Merchant
ships in convoy formed single line, escort
took up screening positions and course was
set for Zembra thence to follow the coastal
route detailed in the Senior Officer, Force T’s
orders for Operation ‘‘ Harpoon ’’.

2. At 2205 a medium dive bombing attack
was carried out by about 8 JU.88s. The attack
developed during dusk coming from the dark
sector ahead of the convoy. One enemy
machine was destroyed ‘by gunfire, another was
seen to be going away on fire, and a third is
known to-have been destroyed by a Beaufighter
of the escort from Malta.

Monday, 15th June.
3. Dispositions for the coastal passage were

formed as detailed in my signal timed 1644 on -

Tith June.

4. During the night a number of parachute
flares were observed to be dropped to seaward
and it appeared that the enemy was attempting
to locate the convoy thinking it had passed to
the north of Zembra Island.

Alternatively, his object may have been to
indicate to surface forces the relative position
of the convoy,

5. While rounding Cape Bon, BLANKNEY
reports that he observed signals made from
the shore which may have been intended for
the enemy. These signals had the appearance
of tracer bullets fired into the sky.

6. At 0212, in the vicinity of 'Ras-el-Mirh,
about two miles north-east of Kelibia Road
Light (36° 50’ N., 11° 08’ E.), the rth Divi-
sion of destroyers (Fleets) engaged an object
to starboard close inshore. BEDOUIN
ordered ‘‘ Cease fire’ and it is thought that
the object may possibly have been the wreck
of H.M.S. HAVOCK which is understood to
be in this approximate position. MARNE,
however, reports having seen fall of shot ahead
of his ship at this time.

7. At 0620 an R/T report was received from
a Beaufighter that two Italian cruisers and four
Italian destroyers were in a position 15 miles
on the port beam of the convoy. Almost
immediately these ships were sighted by CAIRO
and destroyers on the port wing of the screen,
silhouetted against the eastern sky. The posi-
tion of the convoy then was 36° 25’ N.,
rr° 43’ E., course 130°, speed 12 knots. The
enemy bore 075°, distance 10 miles, approxi-
mate course 150°. CAIRO’s first sighting re-
port at 0631 described the enemy as consisting
of two cruisers and four destroyers but I am
now satisfied that there were two cruisers and
five destroyers. -The cruisers are believed to

have been of the Condottieri class,* ‘'C”’
type, but it 1s not certain whether they were
“C” or “B’’ type. The class of the des-
troyers is not known. The distance of the enemy
given in CAIRO’s first sighting report was
given as 6 miles and this was considerably in
error,

8. On sighting the enemy, BEDOUIN was
ordered to act independently with the fleet
destroyers, I had previously discussed with
the Commanding Officer, BEDOUIN, the
action to be taken in such an eventuality which
was for BEDOUIN’s division to attack while
CAIRO and the Hunt destroyers screened the
convoy with smoke. BEDOUIN led his division
towards the enemy while CAIRO turned to
port to cover the left flank of the convoy with
smoke, at the same time ordering BLANK-
NEY’s division to make smoke and close.

g. The enemy opened fire at 0640, his first
salvo falling short, and the second straddling
CAIRO. A number of salvos fell near the
convoy until smoke had been laid.

ro. CAIRO opened fire at 0650 and fired
intermittently throughout the subsequent action
but largely for moral effect as the enemy was
never within effective range of the four-inch

. guns,

rz. At 0645, anticipating that the enemy
would immediately press home his attack with
the full force at his command, my immediate
intention was to gain time and to fight a de-
laying action in the hope that an air striking
force could be sent from Malta. I therefore
ordered the Commodore to turn away and make
for territorial waters and later at 0650 ordered
him to steer 240°.

12. Meanwhile, having covered the port flank
of the convoy with smoke, CAIRO turned 16
points and then steered on an approximately
parallel course to the enemy, making smoke
to cover the convoy from the southward as
the enemy cruisers appeared to be working
round in that direction.

. 13. Meanwhile, BLANK'NEY’s division of
destroyers, on emerging from the smoke, ob-
served two enemy destroyers working round
to the northward; these were engaged and
driven off turning away under smoke.

14. By 0700 BEDOUIN’s division was hotly
engaged with the enemy cruisers and destroyers
and about this time BEDOUIN and PART-
RIDGE in the van were observed to have been
hit and to have had their speed reduced.
MARNE, MATCHLESS and ITHURIEL
pressed on the attack past these two disabled
destroyers engaging the enemy cruisers and
destroyers. The Commanding Officer, MARNE
reports that fire from MARNE and MATCH-
LESS was observed to take effect- on two
enemy destroyers who turned away under
smoke. ITHURIEL was at this time engaging
the near enemy cruiser. There is little doubt
that fire from the r1th Division of destroyers
was effective and caused the enemy to keep the
Tange open and continually alter course.

15. Shortly after 0700 the two Italian des-
troyers originally ‘engaged by BLANKNEY’s
