SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON

a number of flotillas under Commodore A. H.
Taylor and Captain the Hon. G. Frazer were
reorganised for the night’s effort.

69. General Alexander was informed at
0951 that on the likely assumption that com-
plete evacuation would be ordered that night,
the problem of transport made it essential to
use the beach adjacent to Dunkirk as well as
the harbour facilities and that the Vice Admiral
was planning evacuation to start at 2200.

70. At 1841r the following signal was re-
ceived from C.1.G.S. for the Senior Military
Commander: ‘‘ We do not order any fixed
moment for evacuation. You are to hold on
as long as possible in order that the maximum
number of French and British may be evacu-
ated. Impossible from here to judge local
situation. In close co-operation with Admiral
Abrial. You must act in this matter on your
own judgment.”

71. S.N.O. Dunkirk, was informed that
drifters and other small craft would be sent into
the inner harbour at Dunkirk to take troops
from the Felix Faure Quay, North Quay, in
the shipyard, and the quay in the new outer
harbour.

72. The plan for the night provided for all
minesweepers including paddlers, skoots and
all small craft, except certain special flotillas
especially organised, to go to the beach stretch-
ing eastward 1} miles from Dunkirk. Dunkirk
Harbour was to be served by up to seven per-
sonnel ships, eight destroyers, and the inner
harbour nine drifters and special power boats
organised from Ramsgate. The French vessels
were td serve the Quay in the new outer har-
bour and private small boats, the Quay Felix
Faure, and in addition about roo French small
beach fishing craft and drifters for the beach
immediately east of Dunkirk. It was estimated
that the British vessels could lift about 17,000
between 2200/1 and 0300/2, probably in the
proportion 50 per cent. British and 50 per cent.
French. The plan was set in motion without
incident until 2200, when it was reported that
a number of towing craft and small boats were
returning empty from the coast. All ships were
warned to look out for these and to send them
back to their duty on the coast.

Subsequent investigation gives reason to
believe that this defection was due to false in-
formation being passed between ships on the
coast and believed to originate from a non-
identified skoot.

73. Commander G. O. Maund proceeded to
the mouth of the harbour in a motor boat com-
manded by a Dutch Naval Officer with a Dutch
naval crew and led all ships into harbour to
their berths. The Rear Admiral, Dover, was
also afloat in a M.T.B. supervising traffic con-
trol.

‘By 2300 the night was very dark, sometimes
as many as 6 or 7 vessels were entering the
port of Dunkirk at once whilst yet others were
leaving, -All were without lights and displayed
the highest degree of seamanship in these diffi-
cult and fateful circumstances.

974, At 2315 the S.N.O. Dunkirk signalled
“* Withdrawal now proceeding according to
plan. Shall have certain reserves here tomorrow
to assist French. Intend to complete evacua-
tion tomorrow by midnight.’’

GAZETTE, 17 JULY, 1947

Remarks.

75. The outstanding feature of the day was
the series of events leading to the abandonment
of daylight evacuation. Increasing enemy air
attack, which the R.A.F. were unable to
smother with the means at their disposal, caused
serious loss of ships, and continual interruption
of embarkation on the beaches and in Dunkirk.
Further, the sole remaining cross channel route
‘was now under fairly heavy and accurate shore
artillery fire,

In these circumstances, it was apparent that
continuation of the operation by day must cause
losses of ships and personnel out of al! propor-
tion to the number of troops evacuated, and
if persisted in, the momentum of evacuation
would automatically and rapidly decrease.

Sunday, and June.

76. The arrangements to set in motiom the
night’s evacuation had proceeded smoothly as
far as could be ascertained at Dover. During
the early hours, reports of sailings from Dunkirk
ineieates that destroyers at least were doing
well,

At about 0200, however, a signal was
received from LYDD, who was off the Dunkirk
beach, as follows:

‘* Brigadier tells me that C.-in-C. says it
is essential that rearguard B.E.F. embarks
from the beaches east of Mole on account of
French congestion on Mole, _ Considerable
number British troops still on Mole. Military
are expecting further arrivals there. TRear-
guard expects to arrive at beach by 0230.”

The Vice Admiral accordingly ordered all
ships known to be outside Dunkirk Harbour
to endeavour to embark the rearguard from
the beach, remaining after 0300 if necessary.
Owing to the time in transit and coding it was
feared that this signal would reach few ships
still on the coast, unless they had- remained on
their own initiative after 0300, the previously
ordered time of withdrawal.

At 0200, authority was received from the
Admiralty to continue evacuation by destroyers
from Dunkirk Harbour until 0700, transports
to leave Dunkirk at 0300.

77. During the early hours there was con-
siderable haze and smoke off Dunkirk Harbour,
Dunkirk East Beach, Dunkirk Roads and the
entrance therefrom to X Route. For this reason
some of the smailer vessels, including mine-
sweepers, failed to make either Dunkirk
Harbour or Dunkirk East Beach, but on the
whole it appears that evacuation, both from
the beach and from the harbour had proceeded
satisfactorily with the resources available.

Between 0200 and 0900, 6 personnel vessels
reached United Kingdom from Dunkirk
Harbour with about 5,500 troops. Two others
had ‘been turned back before reaching Dunkirk
‘by two unknown destroyers, and one had been
in collision before reaching Dunkirk and had
to return.

78. Considerable doubt existed during the
forenoon as to the numbers remaining to be
evacuated in Dunkirk. It was thought that
2,000, plus the 4,000 rearguard British troops,
might well be found in Dunkirk. The number
of French troops remaining was increasing from
the 25,000 quoted the previous evening to
figures in the region of 50,000 to 60,000.
