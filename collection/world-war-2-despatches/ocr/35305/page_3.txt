SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1941 (590t

was provided at these river crossings. The
weather was fine throughout the whole period of
the move.

The first stage was one hundred and
twenty miles. An average of five hundred
vehicles moved daily over each stage of the route,
maintaining a distance of one hundred yards
between each vehicle as a precaution against
air attack. A halt of one day for maintenance
purposes was made after the first day’s move.

In the initial stages of the move, the Provost
service were responsible for the regulation of
traffic, but on entering the French Zone des
Armees, columns came under the direction of
the French road control (Regulatrice Routiere)
organisation, which gave valuable help in
marking detours and in directing traffic through
towns. A French-speaking British officer was
established in Amiens to ensure liaison between
my headquarters and the French authorities.

Breakdowns and accidents were few, which
reflects great credit on the drivers, who were
unaccustomed to long hours at the wheel and
to driving on the right-hand side of the road.
Among the many important lessons which were
learnt during the largest road movement ever
undertaken with motor transport by any British
. Army were the need for early reconnaissance of
staging areas, for control at the dispersal points,
and for allowance for unforeseen delays.

11. The move forward continued without
incident or interruption, and on the agreed date,
3rd October, rst Corps took over from the
French the sector Maulde-Gruson on the Belgian
frontier. This sector lay between that of the
ist French Army and of the 16th French Corps,
with 2nd Division (Major-General H. C. Loyd)
on the right and Ist Division (Major-General
Hon. H. R. L. G. Alexander) on the left.

General Headquarters opened in and around
Habarcq (8 miles west of Arras) on 2nd
October.

On 12th October, 3rd Division of 2nd Corps
(Major-General B. L. Montgomery) moved
into the line between Bouvines and Lannoy,
relieving the left brigade of rst Corps and the
right regiment of the French 51st Division.
4th Division of the same Corps (Major-General
D. G. Johnson, V.C.) was located in General
Headquarters reserve. °

The initial occupation of the line by the British
Expeditionary Force was thus completed and
the organisation of the position was undertaken
at once.

The Organisation of the British Positions.

rz. In allotting sectors the geographical fea-
tures of the pronounced salient occupied by the
British Expeditionary Force had to be con-
sidered. East of the Tournai-Orchies road
the country is flat, much wooded and inter-
sected by small streams. Further to the north
lies open and undulating agricultural land which
lends itself to artillery observation and to the
movement of armoured fighting vehicles.
Further north again the sector is for the most
part on the fringe of a highly industrial and
mining district.

When rst Corps arrived in the sector assigned
to the British Expeditionary Force in the first
week in October, an almost continuous anti-
tank obstacle already existed in the form of a
ditch covered by concrete blockhouses built to
mount anti-tank guns and machine guns. In
accordance with plans prepared in peace time

certain French technical troops continued to
work in the sector under the command of the
French Commander of the Defensive Sector
of Lille, Colonel (now Général de Brigade)
Bertschi.

While defences continued to develop on the
lines of the original plan, based on the close
defence of the frontier, it was also necessary to
organise the position.

The priority of work envisaged the eventual
construction of three positions in the forward
area, and a Corps reserve position was sited
across the base of the Lille salient formed by
the frontier. Further in rear, a second position
had been sited, following the line of the Haute
Deule, Sensée and La Bassée canals.

The whole scheme involved the immediate
construction of field defences and the duplica-
tion of the anti-tank obstacle in the forward
zone.

It was consequently necessary to construct
at an early stage reinforced concrete “ pill-
boxes” to afford protection to those weapons
which formed the backbone of the fire defence
throughout the whole depth of the position.
In order to save time standard designs were
prepared to accommodate both British and
French weapons.

13. Work on these “‘ pill-boxes ’’ was spoon by
the Royal Engineers, assisted by other arms.
Early in November a specially constituted force
composed of twelve field companies of the
Royal Engineers drawn from Territorial Army.
Divisions at home, and known as “ X Force,”
arrived in the British Expeditionary Force
area. This force had its own transport and
special plant for the construction of reinforced
concrete ‘‘pill-boxes” by mass production
methods. It was accompanied by companies of
the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps.

A special Excavator Company, equipped with
mechanical excavators of various types, arrived
at the same time as X Force. It has been
employed in digging anti-tank ditches, burying
signal cables, constructing breastworks,
other tasks.

A creation of such a defensive system

‘ demanded a quantity and variety of engineer

stores far exceeding pre-war anticipations.

Bad weather in October and November, and
a succession of frosts later, considerably delayed
the work, but by the end ‘of the period covered
by this despatch the position had been developed
in considerable depth. A large number of con-
crete ‘‘ pill-boxes ’’ had been completed and
many others were under construction ; new wire
had been erected and existing wire strengthened,
buildings had been reinforced, and many miles
of anti-tank ditch dug.

The Saar Detachment.

14. In November, 1939, I arranged with
General Georges that a British infantry brigade
should take its place in the line on the Saar
front, under the command of a French Division.

The brigade took over the sector from the
French 42nd Division on the 4th December
without enemy interference and during the

’ period under review conditions were quiet.

Since that date infantry brigades of the
British Expeditionary Force have successively
completed short tours of duty in this sector, and
junior leaders have thus had valuable training

in their day to day duties when in contact with

_ the enemy.
