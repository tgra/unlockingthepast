SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 24. MAY, 1948

.37. By this time Force C was nearly out Ps
H. A, ammunition and both forces were with-
drawing to the south westward. Course was
altered to the southward at 1830 and to the
eastward at 2100. At 1700 FIJI, who had
MAHAR and KINGSTON in company,
eported her position as 305° Cape Elaphonisi
miles, steering 175° at 27 knots. This posi-
ipn was 30 miles due east from Forces A and
Cy who were then steering 215°.

. At 1845 FIJI, who had survived some 20

bombing attacks by aircraft formations during.

the\past four hours, fell a victim to a single
M.E}109. This.machine flew out of the clouds
in a shallow dive and dropped its bomb very
close to the port side, amidships. The ship
took up a 25° list and soon came to a stop
with her engines crippled. Half an hour later
another single machine dropped thfee bombs
which landed over ‘ A ** boiler room. The
list soon increased to 30° and at 2015 the ship
rolled right over. KANDAHAR and KINGS-
TON lowered boats and rafts ‘and withdrew to
avoid almost certain damage from air attack.
They returned after dark to pick up more men
and finally succeeded in rescuing a total of
523. They had been subjected to no Jess than
22 air attacks between 1445 and 1920 and were
now. getting short of fuel. At 2245 they pro-
ceeded ‘at 15 knots to join C.S.15.

39. At 1928 C.S.7 learned from KANDAHAR
that FIJI was sinking. C.S.7 immediately
ordered D.10, who was to join him on the
following day, to proceed with VOYAGER and
VENDETTA to- FIJI’s position. At 2030, in
accordance with instructions received from the
Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, C.S.7 de-
tached DECOY and HERO to the south coast
of Crete to embark the King of Greece.

nak During the day the casualties to ships
d been, two cruisers and one destroyer sunk,
with two battleships and two eruisers damaged.
The only casualties to enemy aircraft which
could be claimed, with cértainty amounted to
two shot down, six probably shot down and five
damaged. It is probable that enemy Josses in
aircraft were greater than this. .

KELLY, KASH! , KIPLING,
KELVIN ad JACKAL ‘had left Malta at
2130/21st May and joined C.S.7 at 1600/22nd.
At 2030/22nd KELLY, KASHMIR ‘and KIP-
LING were detached to look for survivors from
FIJI and half an hour later, KELVIN and
JACKAL were sent to try and pick up any
of GLOUCESTER’s crew who could be found.
C.S.7 however, subsequently ordered the search
to be abandoned and sent the 5th D.F. to patrol
inside Kissamo. and Canea Bays. On arrival
at the Anti Kithera Channel, KIPLING de-
veloped a steering defect and D.5 ordered her
to join C.S.7. Continuing into Canea Bay,
KELLY and KASHMIR encountered a troop-
carrying caique, which they damaged badly by
gunfire. These two ships then carried out a
short bombardment of Maleme. © Whilst with-
drawing they encountered another caique which
they engaged and set on fire. KELVIN and
JACKAL were detached to investigate’ some
lights which the Naval Officer-in-Charge, Suda,
had reported being seen in Canéa‘ Bay. “These

42. Force FE (D.14 in JERVIS with ILEX,
NIZAM and HAVOCK) patrolled off Herak-
lion during the night 2and/23rd May without
incident and then withdrew to Alexandria,
During the afternoon the Commandet-in-Chief,
Mediterranean, gave orders for AJAX and
ORION, who were returning with R.A.D. to
Alexandria, to join D.14 about 80 miles south
west of Kaso. The intention was for this force
to cover Heraklion during the night 22nd/ a
May. R.A.D. detached these two ships. ai
1730/22and when about 150 miles‘from the Kase
Strait. In the meantime, the Commander-in-
Chief, Mediterranean had ordered D.14 to pass.
the Kaso Strait at 2100/z2nd (the Commander-
in-Chief, Mediterranean’s signal timed 1312 pf
zand May). AJAX, realising that she could not
possibly join 'D.14 ‘in time, decided to rejoin
R.A.D. and informed the Commander-in-Chief,
Mediterranean accordingly (AJAX’s -Signal
timed 1843 of 2and May).

43. At Alexandria, GLENROY —
goo men of the Queens Royal Regiment, the
Headquarters of the 16th Infantry Brigade and
18 vehicles. She sailed’ for Tymbaki p.m. 2and

after embarking ammunition urgently required
by the Army, left Alexandria to join Force Ar
and then proceed so as to arrive Suda during,
the night 23rd /2qth May.

44. Minefields were successfully laid by
ABDIEL between Cephalonia and Levkas and
by RORQUAL i in the Gulf of Salonika. :

45- Meanwhile, i in Crete, the enemy was con-
centrating on the Maleme area, where his troop
carriers continued to arrive and depart on 22nd
May at the rate of more than 20 per hour. A’
plan to counter attack Maleme had to be
abandoned and our troops commienced to with-
draw to a new line.

46. At 2230/22nd May a ‘’ Most Immediate ’’

message was received from C.S.7 reporting
the loss of GLOUCESTER and FIJI and giving
the ammunition situation in the battleships and.
destroyers. It appeared from this signal that
the battleships had run right out of pom pom
ammunition. The _Commander-in-Chief,
Mediterranean, accordingly decided to with-
draw all forces to Alexandria (the Com-
mander-in-Chief, Mediterranean’s signal med
0408 of 23rd May).
