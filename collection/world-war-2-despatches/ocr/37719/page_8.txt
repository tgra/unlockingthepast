which were, indeed, stronger at the end of the

battle” than at the beginning.’’ (The italics

107. This statement, even if intended only
for popular consumption, tends to lead to an
attitude of complacency which may be very
dangerous in the future. ‘Whatever the study
of paper returns may have shown, the fact
is that the situation was critical in the extreme.
Pilots had to be withdrawn from the Bomber
and Coastal Commands and from the Fleet
Air Arm and flung into the Battle after hasty
preparation. The majority of the squadrons
had been reduced to the status of training units,
and were fit only for operations against un-
escorted bombers. _The remainder were
battling daily against heavy odds.

108. The indomitablé courage of the Fighter
Pilots and the skill of their Leaders brought us
through the crises, and the morale of the
Germans eventually cracked because of the
stupendous losses which they sustained.

rog. Any attempt to describe the events of
the Battle day by day would make this Des-
pafch unduly tong and would prevent the
reader from obtaining a comprehensive picture
of the events. I have therefore decided to
show the main features of each day’s fighting
in an Appendix on which our own and the
Germans’ aircraft casualties will be shown
graphically. I shall then be able to deal with
the progress of the Battle by phases, thus
avoiding the tedious and confusing method of
day-to-day description. The information is
given in Appendix D.
_ Tro. As regards our casualties, we generally
issued statements to the effect that we lost ‘‘ x *”
aircraft from which ‘‘ y’’ pilots were saved.
This did not of course mean that “‘ y ” pilots
were ready immediately to continue the Battle.
Many of them were suffering from wounds,
burns or other injuries which precluded their
return to active flying temporarily or per-
manently,

t1x. It might also be assumed that all Ger-
man crews who were in aircraft brought down
during the Battle, were permanently lost to the
Luftwaffe because the fighting took place on
our side of the Channel. Such an assumption
would not be literally true, because the Ger-
mans succeeded in rescuing a proportion of their
crews from the sea by means of rescue boats,
floats and aircraft which will be later described.

112. The decisive features of the Battle were
the Ratio of Casualties incurred by ourselves
and the Germans, and the Ratio of Casualties
to the numbers actively employed on both sides.
Appendix D has been drawn up with these
points in mind.

113. I must disclaim any exact accuracy in
the estimates of Enemy losses. All that I can
say is that the utmost care was taken to arrive
at the closest possible approximation. Special
intelligence officers examined pilots individually
after their combats, and the figures claimed are
only those recorded as ‘‘ Certain.’”’ If we allow
for a percentage of over-statement, and the fact
that two or more Fighters were sometimes firing
at the same enemy aircraft without being aware
of the fact, this can fairly be balanced by the
certainty that a proportion of aircraft reported
as ‘‘ Probably Destroyed’ or ‘‘ Damaged ”
failed toreturn to their bases. The figures, then,

are put forward as an honest approximation.
Judging by results, they are perhaps not far
out. ©

114. The German claims were, of course,
ludicrous; they may have been deceived about
our casualties, but they know they were lying
about their own.

115. I remember being cross-examined in
August by the Secretary of State for Air about
the discrepancy. He was anxious about the
effect on the American people of the wide
divergence between the claims of the two sides.
I replied that the Americans would soon find
out the truth; if the Germans’ figures were
accurate they would be in London in a week,
otherwise they would not.

116. Our estimate of German casualties, then,
may be taken as reasonably accurate for prac-
tical purposes; but our estimates of the strength
in which attacks were made is based on much
less reliable evidence. The Radio-Location
system could give only a very approximate esti-
mate of numbers and was sometimes in error
by three or four hundred per cent. This is no
reflection on the System, which was not de-
signed or intended to be accurate in the estima-
tion of considerable numbers; moreover, several
stations were suffering from the effects of severe
bombing attacks. As the average height of
operations increased, the Observer Corps be-
came less and less able to make accurate esti-
mates of numbers, and, in fact, formations were
often quite invisible from the ground. :

117. Even the numerical estimates made by
pilots who encountered large formations in the
air are likely to be guesswork in many instances.
Opportunities for deliberate counting of enemy
aircraft were the exception rather than the rule.

118. Although Secret Intelligence sources
supplemented the information available, it is
possible that on days of heavy fighting com-
plete formations may have escaped recorded
observation altogether.

11g. This is unfortunate, because it is
obviously of the greatest importance to deter-
mine the relative strengths of the Attack and
the Defence, and to know the ratio of losses to
aircraft employed which may be expected to
bring an attack to a standstill in a given time.
History will doubtless elucidate the uncer-
tainty, but perhaps not in time for the informa--
tion to be of use in the present war.

120. My personal opinion is that, on days of
slight activity, our estimates are reasonably
accurate, but that they probably err on the low
side on days of heavy fighting when many and
large formations were employed.

tax. As has been explained above, few
squadrons were fresh and intact when the Battle
began. No sufficient respite has been granted
since the conclusion of the Dunkerque fighting
to rest the Squadrons which had not left the
Fighter Command, and to rebuild those which
had undergone the ordeal of fighting from aero-
dromes in Northern France. These last had
been driven from aerodrome to aerodrome, able
only to aim at self-preservation from almost
continuous attack by Bombers and Fighters;
they were desperately weary and had lost the
greater part of their equipment, since aircraft
which were unserviceable only from slight
defects had to be abandoned.
