could only operate over our own terntory thus
having no chance to meet large enemy au
forces. Prior to this the enemy had been able
to carry out reconnaissance fights with 1m-
Punity by flying at great heights and out-dis-
tancig the Hurricanes. The first three recon-
naissance aircraft the enemy sent over after
the Spitfires arrived were all destroyed, and
the enemy did not again attempt a reconnais-
sance or a raid in the area where the Spitfires
were located.

So important was the success of the Spitfires
that my Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief asked
the Chief of Air Staff urgently for the flow
to ibe increased as far as possible, and the great
successes later against large enemy formations
fully justified the request.

11. Expansion of Squadrons and their Distri-
bution on the 15th November, 1943.

Although a considerable inflow of aircraft

had occurred, our actual front hne air strength

had not increased very greatly by November.’

The target for the end of 1943 was 76
squadrons. In detailed planning, however,
targets agreed on from time to time with the
Air Ministry have been substituted. Forward
administrative planning and organisation was
finally based on the 146 squadron target, which
is what has been promised on conclusion of
the war with Germany.

12. The 10th U.S.A.A.F.

While dealing with the developing strength
of air power in this theatre, it is appropriate
to mention the ‘American Air Forces. My
R.A.F. Headquarters have been in constant
touch with the U.S. Air Force, and there has

SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 APRIL, 1048

been perfect co-ordination of air operations
between the two. In general, the roth
U.S.A.A.F. attacked distant objectives over
Burma by day; R.A.F. medium and heavy
bombers operated iby might; and R.A.F. fighters
and light ‘bombers attacked by day objectives
within 250 miles of the forward airfields. The
introduction of Mustangs (A.36’s and 51’s) to
augment our attacks on enemy communications
in torward areas was notable, and the Amencan
fighter strength was employed to protect their
airfields in Assam and sometimes to escort day
bombers and supply dropping aircraft.

The air ferry to Kunming carried an increas-
ing tonnage to China. In June the total was
3,100 tons, and in October 8,632 tons.

13. Enemy Aw Effort.

I have already remarked that the enemy
practically ceased operations in the air during
the monsoon period. A few intercept sorties
in Burma and some reconnaissance flights were
all that were undertaken. Presumably the bulk
of enemy squadrons were withdrawn for rest or
training.

There was, however, an increase in October
and November and raids were carned out on
Chittagong, Agartala, Fenny, Palel, Imphal,
Khumbhirgram, and Tiddim.

‘Reconnaissance aircraft appeared a few times
also over the Madras coast and Ceylon. Two
of these were shot down in October and
November by our Beaufighters. The enemy.
fighter defences and warning system in the
Andamans, Nicobars and over Northern
Sumatra were fairly efficient, and in each of
these areas we lost Liberators shot down while
engaged in photographic reconnaissances.

AIR OPERATIONS.

14. The Bengal Command.
In June, 1943, dispositions of squadrons
In forward airfields

At Cox’s Bazar
In Assam

In second line airfields (in Jessore
and round Calcutta) :

Training at Digr and Salbani

Until the weather improved at the, end of
September this distribution remained substan-
tially unchanged.

The policy regarding the employment of
these forces during the monsoon had been laid
down as follows:—

To maintain a forward fighter offensive
policy.

To ensure the continuance of local air
superiority,

To protect our costal shipping southwards
from Chittagong.

To attack enemy occupied

airfields
wherever possible. .

To attack enemy lines of communications
and shipping in the enemy forward areas.

were as follows :—

5 Hurricane Squadrons.

I Beaufighter Squadron .

1 Blenheim Squadron.

1 Bisley Squadron.

1 Hurncane Squadron (detachment).
1 Bisley Squadron.

1 Mohawk Squadron.

3, Bomber Squadrons.

5 Fighter Squadrons.

1 Photo Reconnaissance Squadron.
1 Transport Aircraft Squadron.

3, Vengeance Squadrons.

Actually, while the maintenance of air
superiority remained a primary task, medium
and héavy ‘bomber effort was concentrated on
attacking L. of C. targets.

15. Strategic Bombing.

In June/July» heavy and medium bomber
operations were much handicapped by bad
weather and shortage of spares. Nevertheless,
the high percentage of successful sorties under
difficult weather conditions during this period
reflects great Credit on the crews concerned.

Between June and August the roth
US.A.AF., operating by day inflicted con-
siderable damage on the Thilawa and Syriam
oil installations and took toll of-railway rolling
stock. “The Myitnge Bridge was cut and the
Gotteik Viaduct damaged. Enemy vessels off
