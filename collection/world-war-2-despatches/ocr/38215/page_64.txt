431. The climate of Singapore, thoigh not
unhealthy for most people once they become
acclimatized, is damp and enervating. Seasonal
changes are slight, though during the period of
the north-east monsoon (October-March) the
weather is slightly cooler than during the rest
of the year. The excessive moisture, however,
prevents high temperatures. Rainfail is normally
high and spread fairly evenly throughout the
year, mostly in the form of thunder-storms.
It seldoms rains at night. During the period
of the Malayan campaign, however, the weather
in Singapore was exceptionally dry,

SECTION XLV.—TuHE SINGAPORE ForTRESS.

432. Before explaining the plans for the de-
fence of Singapore Fortress an outline of the
organization for defence as it existed before the
withdrawal from the mainland must be given.

The Singapore Fortress area, as previously
explained, comprised the Island of Singapcre,
the adjoining islands and the Pengerang area
in South Johore. It was not a fortress in the
old sense of the term. It was rather a large
defended and inhabited area, with a maximum
length of about 35 miles and a maximum width
of about 15 miles, which included the large
town of Singapore.

The organization for defence can be divided
broadly into three categories: (a) The Fixed
Defences, which included both guns and seazch- ,
lights; (6) The Beach Defences, and (c) The
Anti-Aircraft Defences. The first two cate-
gories were under the command of the Com-
mander, Singapore Fortress (Major-General
Keith Simmons). The third, for reasons which
have already been explained in Section VI,
were directly under me through the Comman-
der, Anti-Aircraft Defences (Brigadier Wildey),
though their action during operations was co-
ordinated with that of the fighter aircraft by
Group Captain Rice, R.A.F. The Headquarters
of Singapore Fortress were at Fort Canning.

433. The Fixed Defences.—As stated in
Section VI, the Fixed Defences were divided
into two Fire Commands, i.e, the Changi Fire
Command which covered the approaches to the
Naval Base, and the Faber Fire Command
which covered the approaches to Keppel Har-
bour and to the western channel of the Johore
Straits. In each Fire Command was ‘tile 15 in.
and one 9.2 in. battery and a number of 6 in.
batteries; also  searchlights and smaller
equipments.

There was an elaborate system of buried
cable communications linking headquarters
with batteries and lights. Observation of fire
was either from Observation Posts which had
been constructed at points of vantage along
the coast or from aircraft. An Anti-Aircraft
Co-operation Flight was maintained by the
Royal Air Force for this purpose,

After the Japanese landed in Malaya
arrangements were made by which fire from the
fixed armament could be brought to bear
quickly on a limited number of localities
selected as likely landing places for an enemy
force attacking the sea-front of the Fortress
of Singapore. This involved little difficulty.

As the Japanese advanced southwards, it
became evident that the anti-ship guns must be
prepared to engage targets on the land front
of Singapore. Such a requirement was not
easy to meet. The chief difficulties were:—

(a) Only a limited number of guns were
available, the remainder being ruled out

either from lack of range or on account of
limited bearing.

(6) The guns most likely to be available
were the 15 in. guns (Forts Johore and
Buona Vista) and the g.2 in. guns on Blakang
Mati (Fort Connaught), but the 9.2 in. guns
only had about 30 rounds each of H.E.
ammunition while the 15 in. guns had none
at all.

(c) Observation of fire was likely to be
difficult as the topography was highly un-
favourable to ground observation, while air
observation would not be available in view
of the local superiority of the Japanese Air
Force.

Nevertheless, an improvised but workable
counter-bombardment organization was built
up and fields of fire were cleared. A demand
was made for more ammunition suitable for
engaging land targets, but it did not arrive in
time.

During January the Fixed Defences suffered
some casualties from ‘air bombing.

434. The Beach Defences._The Beach
Defences were designed to protect the Islands
of Singapore and Blakang Mati, Pulau Brani
and the Pengerang area in South Johore from
a sea-borne attack. On Singapore Island they
extended along the South Coast from Pasir Pan-
jang to Changi, a distance of 20 miles. Con-
crete pill-boxes for machine guns and light
automatics had been constructed at intervals of
about 600 yards along the beaches. There
were also a few 18-pounder field guns. The
defences were well equipped with beach lights.

The material defences comprised anti-boat,
anti-tank and anti-personnel defences. They
included ' timber-scaffolding, timber tank
obstacles, mines and barbed wire.

Two switch lines had been partially prepared
to protect the centre of the Island from enemy
landings in the east and west of the Island
respectively. The eastern line, known as the
Serangoon Line, was sited between the Civil
Airport at Kallang and Paya Lebar. The
western line filled the gap between the Rivers
Kranji and Jurong. In addition, the western
front of the Changi area had been wired.

435. Prior to the outbreak of hostilities with
Japan no defences had been constructed on
the northern or western shores of Singapore
Island. This has been imputed in some quar-
ters to a lack of foresight on the part of succes-
sive General Officers Commanding. _ It has,
however, perhaps not been fully realised that
the object of the defence was, not to hold Singa-
pore Island, but to protect the Naval Base. To
do this it was necessary at least to prevent the
enemy bringing that base under observed fire
and also, as far as possible, to keep the enemy
out of close bombing range. Such resources,
financial and material, as had been available
had therefore been applied to the preparation of
defences at a distance from Singapore, begin-,
ning with the Mersing area and subsequently
extending further north. On the eastern front
defences had been constructed as far back as
Kota Tinggi. Major-General Dobbie, the then
G.O.C., had intended these defences to be
part of an extensive system covering the Naval
Base. The estimate of cost was, however, so
ruthlessly cut down by the War Office that the
defences were never completed. The financial
restrictions under which defence work in
