            "description": "now facing, and operate raiding columns from them against the enemy\u2019s lines of communica- tion. x Armoured Division had entered Mak- nassy itself without opposition at 0700 hours on the 22nd but failed to seize a fleeting oppor- tunity and was forestalled at the vital defile some five miles east of the town; when it advanced eastwards later in the day it found that the enemy had hastily organized a defen- sive position there from a German and an lialian reconnaissance unit. Subsequently a battalion of infantry from ro Panzer Division and some Italian tanks arrived between 23rd and 24th March and with these, reinforced by two more infantry battalions and some German tanks, the enemy succeeded in holding the pass. The advance down the Gafsa-Gabes road was also frustrated, for before it could develop the enemy launched a strong attack with the whole of the rest of ro Panzer Division. This counter- attack had some initial success but x Infantry Division held firm and inflicted losses in tanks on the enemy. The attacks were renewed on the 24th and 25th, again without success. It was greatly to the credit of II Corps that they thus kept in play the whole of ro Panzer Divi- sion while the decisive battle was being fought and won by Eighth Army, and although they were denied the pleasure of a spectacular advance into the enemy\u2019s rear they made a solid contribution to the success of operations in southern Tunisia."

            "description": "On roth March an enemy patrol ocoupied the landing ground at Marada, about 80 miles South of Agheila. This move was a forerunner of increased activity by strong enemy patrols which- necessitated the withdrawal of our out- posts from Agheila, the enemy occupying the fort there on 24th March. Italian infantry, supported by German armoured forces and dive-bombers, moved East of Agheila on 30th March, and on 3Ist March our forward troops were compelled to fall back on Agedabia. Blenheims of No. 55 Squadron bombed and machine-gunned enemy M.T. concentrations, while the landing ground at Misurata, from which enemy aircraft were operating in support of their advance, was successfully attacked by Wellingtons and Blenheims. The superior weight of the enemy enabled him to continue his advance, however, despite the opposition of our troops and aircraft."

In order to force the first of these the Commander 11th (A) Division planned to move by two roads, sending the Nigerian Brigade by the southern route, while the Royal Natal Carbineers took the old road to the north. The Babile position looked even more formidable than the Marda Pass. High broken hills, steep-sided and formed of granite blocks, flanked the roads on both sides. The southern road had been blocked by cratering and a cliff fall. Some considerable resistance was met by the Nigerians, who owing to better going reached the position first. The Royal Natal Carbineers found the old disused road extremely difficult going; by dint however of energetic perseverance, they were able to make their presence felt. The Italians had not ex- pected the old road to be used, and feeling the weakness of their left flank, were forced off the position on the evening of 24th March, and the Nigerian Brigade continued their advance on the 25th. ,"

On the night of the 24th March the Headquarters staffs of the Burmese forces, which they had raised during their occupation, deserted. Three days later there was open revolt. The Burma Defence Army had turned against its masters. The revolt was widespread and considerable numbers of Japanese were killed. This rising, although in no way decisive, proved of great value to our operations, and forced the enemy to divert forces to deal with it. On joining the Allies the force was re-named the \u201c Burma National Army \u201d."

At this time I decided to go to Chungking for the purpose of paying my respects to the Generahssimo Chiang Kai-Shek, to explain to him the military situa- tion in Burma, and to ensure that he was satis- fied with the administrative arrangements which had been made for his troops. Accordingly I left Maymyo by air on the 24th March. I was warmly received by the Chinese and had several very satisfactory talks with the Generalissimo, at the last of which he expressed the wish for unity of command of the Imperial and Chinese Forces in Burma, and asked me to accept the command of all his troops in that country. On my return to Maymyo I informed General! Stilwell of the Generalissimo\u2019s wishes and he readily agreed to serve under me as Supreme Commander in Burma. I should like to take this opportunity to add that General Stilwell and his American staff could not have been more loyal or more co-operative through- out the campaign. General Stilwell had my complete confidence. He was obviously liked and trusted by the Chinese, and he understood them and spoke their language."
