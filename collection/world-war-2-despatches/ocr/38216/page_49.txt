length to attack by, landings on the northern
coast. An outstanding feature of the island
is its mountainous southern coast, parallel to
which run a series of mountainous massifs along
the centre of the island. During the season
under consideration, SW. winds pile up tropi-
cal thunderstorms on them from midday until
far into the night. Whilst these are raging,
aircraft based on aerodromes in the southern
(mountainous) half of the island are, for the
most part, seriously handicapped by them.

Squadrons based on aerodromes along the
northern coastal strip are, on the other hand,
not so severely ‘handicapped: although heav;
cloud and raim occur throughout the afternoon
and night, aircraft can effectively operate at all
hours. Mornings are usually bright and cloud-
less Aerodromes in the northern coastal strip
are, however, sited not far from exposed Jand-
ing beaches Their occupation was, therefore,
not unattended by risk.

518. Bandoeng, in central western Java, was
the wartime seat of the Dutch Government, and
of Naval and Military Headquarters. The
latter was known as A.H.K. (The Dutch have
no separate air force—their navy and army
having their own air contingents.

The High Dutch Commanders were —

Dr. A. W. L. Tjardo van Starkenborgh

519. A Combined Allied Fleet was based on
Sourabaya, with a subsidiary base at Batavia.
It consisted of 8 cruisers (3 British, 2 Austra-
lian, 1 American, 2 Dutch), 11 destroyers (5
British, 4 American and 2 Dutch) some Dutch
submannes and other auxiliary craft, and was
commanded by Vice Admiral C E. L. Helfrich,
Royal Netherlands Navy, as Commander of
Naval Forces, He had assumed command on
the 11th February.

520. (2) The Dutch had approximately
25,000 regular troops, made up of four regi-
ments of infantry (native) with artillery, garri-
son and ancillary units. They had a few obso-
lete A.F.V.’s, having been unable to obtain
modern tanks.from the Allies. “Units had been
heavily depleted of white personnel for various
reasons, from a proportion of one white to

five native to a proportion of one to about:

forty. An attempt to re-arm and to re-organise
on modern lines had. failed because modern
armaments were unobtainable for the new units
which had been formed for handling them.
(6) In addition there was a Home Guard
of about 40,000, They were static in role,
and necessarily poorly armed and trained.
Those in west Java’ were reported to be the
best, particularly those in the vicinity of Soe-
bang near Kalidjati aerodrome (eventually to
be occupied by British bombers) where there
were about’ 1;000 mien with twelve arrhoured
cars. go g " gt

(<) To the Dutch Army was added a small
British force under the direction of Major-
General H. D. W, Sitwell. It consisted of a
squadron of light tanks, two Australian in-
fantry battalions (one a machine-gun unit with-
out its machine guns) and a number of small
administrative units. The whole was organised
hastily into a mobile striking force for opera-
tion in western Java, and was under the com-
mand of Bngadier A. S. Blackburn, V.C.
(Austrahan Imperial Forces). To it were
added later an American Field Battaliom much
under strength, and a contingent of 450 R.A.F
airmen hastily armed and trained as infantry
under Wing Commander Alexander. It was
called “‘Blackforce ’’. It co-operated closely
with the Dutch troops (under the command
of General Schulling) located in western Java
for the defence of the Batavia area.

(d) Certain British A.A. batteries were con-
centrated on aerodrome defence in Western
Java as follows:—

Tyilihtan—12 Bofors guns soon after 15th
February. Also one battalion Australian In-
fantry relieved on 25th February by 15th
Heavy A.A. Battery armed as infantry. The
former were relieved from aerodrome defence
duties because they were required as part of
“* Blackforce ’’.

Kalidjait—to Bofors guns soom after 15th
February. Also some Dutch Infantry re
lieved on night 28th February /1st March by
rzth Heavy A.A. Battery hastily armed as
infantry. The former were wanted for ser-
vice with the Dutch field army.

Thus there were no Heavy A.A, guns for
the defence of these aerodromes. The few
available on the island were wanted at more
vulnerable places, including the Naval base
at Sourabaya.

Aw Forces,

521. (a) The Dutch had about 5 Bomber,
3 Fighter and 2 Observation Squadrons in Java,
most of which were much depleted as the result
of protracted operations in the north. Service-
ability of aircraft was low. They and their
administrative units operated under Dutch con-
trol decentralised from Bandoeng.

(b) There were 12 to 15 American heavy
bombers ‘(believed to be B.17’s) and a few
fighters (P.40’s). Whole serviceability was
low. These were located under American
control in east and central Java.

(c) There was also a mixed Dutch, American
and British Reconnaissance Group based in
Java for seaward reconnaissance, which
operated under a Dutch Commander.
No. 205 (F.B.) Squadron formed part-of it.

(d) To this force was to be added the British
Air Contingent under ‘Westgroup, alias Britair,
whose re-organisation has already been
described.

During the time that Abdair remained in
Java, all the above air formations acted under
its direction, control of the first two being exer-
cised through the Dutch A.O.C., General van
Oyen. When Abdair left Java, the latter took
command of them all.

Strategy z

522. An invasion of Java was considered
most likely to approach down the east or west
sides of Borneo, or both. The.Dutch High
Command feared simultaneous landings at both
