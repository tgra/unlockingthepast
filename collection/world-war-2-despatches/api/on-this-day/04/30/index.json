            "description": "rx. The first hostile move by the Iraq forces occurred on 30th April, when two infantry brigades of the Iraq Army, supported by Artillery and some armoured cars, began concentrating around Habbaniya and training their guns on the Camp, thereby constituting a direct threat to the British Cantonment there. A demand for the withdrawal of these troops was refused by the Iraqi Commander, who stated that no normal training was to be carried out from Habbaniya, and that fire would be opened on aircraft or troops leaving the Camp. Hostilities broke out on 2nd May and the Royal Air Force station was shelled intermittently until 5th May. The Camp was also bombed and machine-gunned by the Iraqi Air Force. The Royal Air Force bombed the Iraqi Positions gcoring many direct hits on their guns, armoured cars and machine gun posts. During this period also the Royal Air Force, despite the fact that the aerodrome was often under heavy fire, successfully evacuated by air to Basra a large number of women and children, who had been sent from Baghdad to Habbaniya when the situation at the former place became threatening. (The remainder of the British population of Baghdad were accommodated either in the British Embassy or the American Legation throughout the period of Operations.)"

DUQUESNE had previously embarked at Casablanca a full outfit of ammunition for herself and replenishments for the destroyers, and the assault on the Ile d Oleron was carried out on 30th April with the French ships bombarding gun batteries and other targets throughout the day. Twenty-four L.C.V. (P) were used as lift for assaulting troops and by nightfall all the southern portion of the island was in French hands, and only one of the L.C.V. (P) was lost."

The enemy positions at Jefna were particularly strong and  before they could be grappled with there were many outlying positions, on the hills either side of the road, which had to be cleared. Manteuffel's parachutists fought as well as usual and by 2nd May we were still held up at the immediate approaches to Jefna, though to the north we had outflanked it by some three miles. Heavy fighting continued on 1 Infantry Division front both on Gebel Sidi Meftah and to the north of it but in anticipation of its fall IE Corps were now bringing up x Armoured Division to operate on the extreme right of the Corps in the valley of the Qued et Tine. This valley leads direct to Mateur; no road follows it but it is practicable for armour once the left flank is freed by securing Gebel Sidi Meftah. 78 Division to the east of the Oued had gained ground north of Gebel Ahmera and north-east of Heidous. On 30th April 34 Division scored its most noteworthy success with the capture of Gebel Tahent (Point 609). This commanding domeshaped hill, east-north-east of Sidi Nsir, was defended by parachutists from the Barenthin Regiment, perhaps the best German troops in Africa. :"

The heavy pressure which we had been bringing to -bear since the 22nd had gained us a foothold at the entrance to the plain of Tunis and had stretched the enemy's powers of resistance almost to breaking point, but if I was to finish the campaign quickly, to fit in with the time-table for Sicily, a sudden powerful stroke was necessary. The events of the past week had shown that Eighth Army was unable to make any vital contribution by attacks on their front; indeed, in spite of the pressure they had kept up, the enemy had found himself able to withdraw ali his armour from the southern front. I therefore ordered General Montgomery on 30th April to despatch at once to First Army the best formations he could spare to reinforce the main blow from"

This ground is 150 ft. high and only some 1,000 yards from  the station. The small force of levies at Habbaniyah was quite insufficient to occupy this high ground, on which the Iraqi mechanized force of approximately a brigade, with several batteries and a number of tanks and armoured cars, installed itself on 30th April. While the Ambassador at Baghdad was trying to secure the withdrawal of this Iraqi force by diplomatic means, its numbers were increased, till by the evening of Ist May, the total was about 11 battalions with some 50 guns, over 9,000 men in all. Their attitude became so threatening that the Air Officer Commanding Iraq, Air Vice-Marshal Smart, decided that it was essential to attack these troops without further warning. Accordingly, in the early morning of and May, an improvised air force, made up mainly from the machines in the training school attacked the Iraqi forces. It was hoped that the effect of air bombing might shake the morale of the Iraqi troops and cause them to withdraw. The attacks did not, however, have the desired effect, the Iraqis finding good concealment in broken ground and maintaining their positions, although the ultimate result of this bombing must have contributed to their subsequent defeat and further air attacks on reserves prevented effective reinforcement."

During the early part of May, however, the Royal Navy was fully engaged in the operations necessary for the passage of the convoy mentioned in para. 51 above through the Mediterranean, and was unable to provide the necessary escorts for any large shipping movements between Crete and Egypt. Later, it became obvious that there would be no time to effect reliefs before the German attack developed and that it would be necessary to meet that attack with the troops already in Crete and to defer any question of relief until the German attack had been repulsed. Further, the German attacks on shipping to Crete were so intensive as to make it difficult and dangerous for shipping to approach the island. I visited Crete on 30th April and placed MajorGeneral Freyberg in command. I instructed him to organize the defence of the island with the troops available and with such additional resources as I was able to send him from Egypt."
