REPORT OF A GALLANT ACTION BY
H.M.1.S. BENGAL AND M.V. ONDINA
WITH TWO JAPANESE RAIDERS
The followmg Despatch was submitted to the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on the
8th January, 1943, by Admural Sir James
F. Somerville, K.C.B., KBE, DS.O.,

Commander-1n-Cluef, Eastern tikes.

Admuralty Foreword.

This despatch deals with a calla actron by
H.M.1.S. BENGAL and the Dutch M.V.
ONDINA against two much superior Japanese
raiders.

2. H.M.LS. BENGAL* was escorting the
tanker M.V. ONDINA? on passage from Fre-
mantle to Diego Garcia. Early on T1th Novem-
ber, 1942, 11 Latitude 19° 45’ S., Longitude
92° 40° E, BENGAL sighted two ships pro-
ceeding on a north easterly course at high
speed. These were Japanese armed raiders,
one of the Aikoku Maru Class and the other
of the Kiyosumi Maru Class, of 10,439 and
8,631 tons respectively.

3. BENGAL promptly attacked the nearest,
which was the larger raider, and soon after
opening fire, succeeded in obtaining a hitt aft,
as a result of which this enemy caught fire
and, after a large explosion on board an hour
later, sank by the stern. BENGAL continued
the action with both raiders to draw them away
from ONDINA.

4. Meanwhile ONDINA, who, in spite of
BENGAL’S order to make her eScape by acting
independently, had also been m action with
the first raider, became separated from
BENGAL. ONDINA was then engaged by the
second raider who returned to her after hav-
ing, as she evidently thought, disposed of
BENGAL.

5 ONDINA, after being repeatedly hit, ex-
pending all her ammunition and having her
Master killed, abandoned ship This raider
closed, machine-gunned the survivors in their
boats and fired two torpedves at ONDINA.
These hit, and ONDINA, taking up a 30° list
to starboard, must have been considered
doomed by the second raider who then left
the scene to search for survivors of her con-
sort. The raider later returned to fire a third
torpedo at ONDINA, which missed, but her
principal concern seems to have been to make
good her escape before the intervention of
British warships, and she disappeared over the
horizon in a north easterly direction

6 ONDINA’S crew then reboarded their

ship and brought her safely back to Fremantle.

7._A letter of appreciation of the part played
by HM.I.S BENGAL in this action, which
the Admiralty caused to be sent to the India
Office, is attached as Appendix I,

Eastern Fleet.

Notes —

* BENGAL—a mmesweeper, 650 tons, armed with
one 12-pdr, one smgle Bofors and two Oerlikens.

+ ONDINA—a Shell Company tanker, armed with
one 4-1nch gun whose crew was composed of four R.N
and one RAN R tatings, three Gunners R A and one
Dutch merchant seaman

{~ ONDINA also claimed this hit with the fifth round
from her 4-inch gun at 8,000 yards range It 1s not
possible to adjudicate between these two claims,

HM. Naval Office,
Colombo.
30th November, 1942

The report of the Commanding Officer,
H.M.1.S. BENGAL, which he rendered to me
on his arnval at Colombo is forwarded here-
wath.

The Commanding Officer, BENGAL, in-
formed me that his seal to ONDINA to “‘ act
independently ’’ was made with the intention
that she should make good her escape and that
he was disappointed to observe that she altered
course only go° instead of 180°, but he had no
time to make a further signal to her. His
prompt decision to steer at full speed directly
towards the larger of the two enemy ships in
sight was made solely with a view to give the
ONDINA time to get away; he had httle hopes
that his ship could survive against such odds
He was greatly encouraged on the run in that
fire was not opened on him until he got to 3,500
yards, as at this range his 12-pdr. gun was
effective He states that at full speed steering
1s difficult so that the unsteady course he was
making increased the difficulties of the enemy
in_getting hits. on their tiny opponent. The
BENGAL only carried 40 rounds LA ammu-
nition. -
