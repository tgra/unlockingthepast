From the 8th to the 21st February, when the Japanese attack severed the communications of 7 Indian Division, a total of 923 tons of supplies of all types was dropped on the surrounded elements of that division. The month's total for February of air-dropped supplies in Arakan was 2,710 tons. In April, the total tonnage dropped was:",

            "date": "21st February",
            "description": "On ioth February the enemy carried out explorat attacks against all three roads I have meltitioned, attempting to find out which would prove the easiest for an attack. His main weight was on the right, against Sbiba; the attack on the pass above Kasserine was made by about a battalion of infantry and the force probing the Dernaia pass above Feriana, on the Tebessa road, was only of the nature of a small reconnaissance. South of Sbiba 1 Guards Brigade held firm and repulsed the enemy but the attack in the Kasserine pass was more successful and the enemy began to infiltrate through the American positions. Accordingly on the next day, the 2oth, this thrust was strongly reinforced and the other two abandoned; the pass was cleared and 21 Panzer Division, with the infantry and some of the armour of the detachment from the German Africa Corps, pressed on into the basin beyond. Here Rommel found himself faced with two alternatives,.for the road, after traversing the pass, diverges to west and north. The former direction would take him to Tebessa, our main southern base and airfield centre, but the road passes through difficult country; the other route runs mainly on the flat and leads via Thala to Le Kef. Accordingly on 21st February he passed ro Panzer Division battle group* through zr Panzer Division in a northward thrust, leaving the screening left flank to the German Africa Corps detachment.",

            "description": "At the crisis of the Kasserine battle, on 21st February, I ordered General Montgomery to create as powerful a threat as possible on the enemy's southern flank. He was not as yet well placed to do this since his administrative position was not yet firm; on the other hand there was no immediate risk in advancing ahead of his main strength since the enemy main forces were fully engaged elsewhere. Medenine, the road junction in front of the Mareth line, had been occupied by us on the 18th and by the next day headquarters and one Brigade of 51 Division were at Ben Gardane, with the other two brigades moving forward from Tnpoli. By the 24th Eighth Army had two armoured car regiments in contact with the outposts of the Mareth line and General Leclerc's force, now known as  L  force, had occupied Ksar Rhilane, a desert outpost thirty miles west of the Matmata mountains; 51 Division continued to move up and all three brigades were forward of Medenine, but not in contact with the enemy, by the 25th. In the meanwhile I had informed General Montgomery on 23rd February that the situation at Kasserine was now improved and ordered him, while keeping up a display of force, not to prejudice the future by undue risks. He rephed on the 27th that he had been careful to keep well balanced and considered his present position adequately strong.",

The great dash om Meiktila started on the 21st February, when a mechanised and armoured. column composed of 48 Brigade (17 Indian Division), with tanks, broke out of the Nyaungu bridgehead, captured Hnawdwin 15 miles to the east, and were then temporarily held up by deep ravines beyond the village. Here they were joined by the rest of the Division and 255 Indian Tank Brigade (less one regiment left with 7 Indian Division). The advance continued the same day, but to avoid the difficult country between Pyinsin and Welaung, the Division fanned out, 48 Brigade and a proportion of armour moving on Taungtha, via Kainye, and 63 Brigade with the main body of the Tank Brigade directed south-east on Seiktin and then north-east, via Welaung. Both columns reached Taungtha on the 24th February after overcoming desperate resistance and clearing many minefields. By the evening of the 24th, our leading troops had progressed five miles south-east of Taungtha, towards Mahlaing. By 0900 hours om the 26th we had captured the important Thabutkon. airfield intact, smashing through a determined Japanese effort to protect it. The fly-in from Palel of the air-transportable brigade (99 Brigade).of 17 Indian Division began next morning, by which time our tanks were engaged within five miles of Meiktila.",

It was to pass through 46 Brigade which was already in the Kyaikto area. 46 Brigade was to act as rearguard to the 17 Division. On 21st February the leading battalion of 48 Brigade was only to go as far as the quarries, two miles east of Mokpalin. The remaining battalions were to halt on positions some four or seven miles further back along the main road. To strengthen the bridgehead defence consisting of the 3 Burma Rifles and one company 2 D.W.R., the Divisional Commander subsequently ordered the 4/12 F.F.R. to the Sittang bridge area.",
