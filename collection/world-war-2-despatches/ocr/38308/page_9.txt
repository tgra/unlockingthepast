SUPPLEMENT to tHz LONDON GAZETTE, 2 JUNE, 1948

While the normal practice of the American
air-sea rescue aircraft is to remain at call, it
was felt that should aircraft ditch lite in the
proceedings, so much time would be required
to get the aircraft from its base 265 miles away

that it might entail the Fleet being delayed ~

unnecessarily whilst destroyers were searchi
somewhat blindly in unhealthy waters for the
casualties. This. request was at once agreed
to and although Dumbo was only asked to be
in attendance from 0830 to 1130 the-reply was
received that he was at our disposal until 1430.

It ‘should be noted that air-sea rescue
arrangements whether carried out by an air-
craft or surface ship, again reduce the fighter
strength of the Fleet since a small CAP must
be provided for the ship or aircraft.

At 1203 in position 20° 35’ N 125° 55’ E the
final signals were transmitted to Guam W/T
for various authorities giving final details. At
r7oo with the Fleet steering for its flying-off
position I handed over tactical command to
A.C.1. The operation was named “ Iceberg
Oolong.’’ c

r1th April.

The Fleet arrived in fying of off position 30
miles 202 degrees from Yonakumi Shima at
o600. There was a fresh N.N.E. wind, a
moderate sea and short swell. Cloud base was
oe 1,000 feet with intermittent rain and
dri:

Coursé was feversed ‘and in daylight it was
soon apparent that conditions were unlikely to
improve in the flyi
weather reports showed that conditions over
Matsuyama precluded any hope of attack. It
was considered that a small fighter sweep
coasting round North Formosa might find
Shinchiku, but that their return journey would
be a considerable gamble and surprise lost.
Conditions were most unsuitable also for air-
sea rescue. Operations were accordingly post-
poned 24 hours, and the Fleet continued to
the south eastward.

At 18r3 received Commander 5th Fleet’s
order to ail Task Group Commanders to pre-
pare for heavy enemy air attacks on 12th
April. CTF .57 assumed tactical command at
2000. Course was reversed during the night
to bring the Fleet to the flying-off position at
dawn.

Task Force '58 reported being under heavy
air attack all the afternoon, with the enemy
showing a preference to commit suicide on the

_ decks of radar pickets.

During the night I had informed Commander
5th Fleet of the postponement and that. we
strike Formosa .on r2th and aan April.

The ‘weather had improved considerably.
during the night. At 0530 A.C.1 assumed
tactical command. -

Enemy reconnaissance aircraft possibly
detected the Fleet at 0555 and soon afterwards
enemy air activity was detected to the north-
ward. CAP was flown off at o6r5 and at
0704 Seafires had an inconclusive encounter
with four eastbound Zekes, one of which was
shot down. The main strikes, edch of 24
bombers and 2o fighters, were flown off at-0715

area during the day while .

“and one shadower, all

from position 23° 583’ N 122° 46’ I. and pro-
ceeded in company around the coast. Cloud
prevented either strike going over the
mountains. .

One strike bombed Shinchiku airfields with
delay fuzed bombs and attacked dispersals.

ing - There was flak but no airborne opposition. Due

to cloud conditions over Matsuyama. airfield the
other strike attacked their alternative target
Kiirun harbour where hits were observed on
the chemical plant, dock’ area and shipping.

One flight investigated Matsuama and found
little activity. A nearby railway station and
factory were attacked and one Tess was des-
troyed
south of Matsuama was destroyed and ship-
ping at Tansui shot up.

Two Fireflies which had been sent to

rendezvous with Dumbo aircraft at Yonakuni .

Shima shot down four out of five eastbound
Sonias* at og20 and damaged the other. As
these aircraft had not been detected by radar,

fighters were thereafter maintained over the .

island. .

Corsairs attacked aircraft which had forced
landed on Yonakuni Shima and set fire to 2
Sally.t

At 1135 a shadowing Dinah was chased by
Corsairs,. which, after releasing their drop
tanks, caught and destroyed it.

At 1410 a Dinah escorted by two Oscarst
escaped our fighters in cloud.-

At 1530 Hellcats to the north westward of
the Fleet shot down a Zeke. .

In the evening the enemy made a sortie
from Ishigaki, -which was intercepted by
fighters, no enemy getting within ‘sight of the
Fleet. Hellcats splashed four Oscars and two
Tonies§ and damaged two. The Corsairs
splashed one Vall| and one Oscar, and damaged
one. One Hellcat was badly damaged in this

engagement, the jan being killed when making

a forced Jandin,

During the dey, except for the evening sortie
enemy air traffic
appeared to have been between Formosa and
Sakishima. Fighter Direction of our fighters
during the day was Well carried out, and some
excellent interceptions were made. CTF 57
assumed. tactical command at 2100.

The score for the day was:—

Enemy losses:

Destroyed—airborne 16,
total 17.

Probably destroyed—on ground 1; total I.
Damaged—airborne 2; total 2.
