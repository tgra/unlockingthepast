Letter to Lieut.-General Sir Alan Cunningham, Commander, Eighth Army.

Advanced H.Q. Eighth Army, 24th November, 1941.

1. Having discussed the situation with you and learned from you the weak state to which 7 Armoured Division has been reduced by the past five days fighting, I fully realise that to continue our offensive may result in the immobilisation, temporarily at any rate, of all our Cruiser and American M3 tanks.

2. I realise also that should the enemy be left with a superiority of fast moving tanks as a result of our continued offensive, there is a risk that he may try to outflank our advanced formations in the Sidi Rezegh-Gambut area and cut them off from their bases in Egypt. I realise also that in this event there would remain only very weak forces to oppose an enemy advance into Egypt. On the other hand, it is clear to me that after the fighting of the last few days, it is most improbable that the enemy will be able to stage a major advance for some time to come.

3. There are only two courses open to us: 

" (@) To break off the battle and stand on the defensive either on the line Gambut-Gabr Saleh or on the frontier. This is a possible solution, as it is unlikely that the enemy would be able to mount a strong offensive against us for many :weeks; and! it would enable us to retain much of the ground we have gained, including valuable forward landing grounds. On the other hand, it would be counted as an Axis triumph and would entail abandoning for an indefinite time the relief of Tobruk.

(ii) The second course is to continue to _ press our offensive with every means in our power. There is no possible doubt that the second . is the right and only course. The risks involved in it must be accepted.

4. You will therefore continue to attack the enemy relentlessly using all your resources even to the last tank. Your main immediate object will be, as always, to destroy the enemy tank

377

forces. Your ultimate object remains the conquest of Cyrenaica, and then an advance on Tripoli. 5. To achieve the objects set out in para. 4 it seems essential that you should:  

(i) Recapture the Sidi Rezegh-Ed Duda ridge at the earliest possible moment and join

- hands with Tobruk garrison. It is to my mind essential that the Tobruk garrison should cooperate to the utmost limit of their resources - in this operation.

(ii) Direct the Oasis Force at the earliest possible moment against the coast road to stop all traffic on it and if possible capture Agedabia or Benina, neither of which is strongly held apparently.

(iii) Use the Long Range Desert Group patrols offensively to the limit of their endurance against every possible objective on the enemy lines of communication from Mechili to Bengasi, Agedabia and beyond to the west. All available armoured cars should be used with the utmost boldness to take part in this offensive. The advantages to be gained by a determined effort against the enemy lines of communication are worth immense risks, which will be taken.

G.H.Q., MEF. Operation Instruction No. 110.

* Western Front. roth January, 1942. Lieut.-General W. G. Holmes, Commander, British Troops in Egypt. Lieut-General N. M. R. Ritchie, Commander, Eighth Army.

x. My present intention is to  continue the offensive in Libya and the objective remains Tripoli.

2. In view, however, of the fluidity of the general strategic situation, we must face the Prospect of being unable to continue the Libyan offensive, and of having to pass to the defensive on the Western Front.

3. It this should be forced upon us, it is my intention to stand on the line Agheila  Marada and prevent any enemy advance east of it. General instructions for the defence of this line will be issued separately.

4. If we should be unable to secure this line; or, having secured it, to hold it, I intend to: withdraw north-eastwards and eastwards to the general line Sollum Giarabub, on which the enemy will be stopped.

During this withdrawal every effort will be made to delay the enemy and thereby to retain the use of forward landing grounds as long as aan

The main axis of withdrawal will be Agheila-Agedabia Bir Ben Gania Bir * Hacheim Sidi Omar.

The coast road Bengasi Derna Tobruk  Sollum may be used for the clearance of material and stores, but will not be used by fighting formations or units except those. located north of the line exclusive Bengasi  Mechili.
