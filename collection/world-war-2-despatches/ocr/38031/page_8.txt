signal was broadcast to the Chief of the Italian
Naval Staff giving the position of the remaining
survivors. The Greek flotilla was ordered to
return to Athens.

42. The fleet was shadowed during the
forenoon and at 1530 a dive-bombing attack
was made by about 12 JU.88s, the main attack
being directed on FORMIDABLE. There was
no damage, however, the fleet ‘‘ umbrella
barrage ’’ proving effective. One JU.88 was
shot down and one Fulmar crashed in the sea
just before landing on. There were shadowers
during the rest of the day but no further attack
developed. STUART, GRIFFIN and HERE-
WARD were detached at og2o to Piraeus as
escort for Convoy G.A.8, and AJAX, PERTH,
DEFENDER and HASTY at 1930 to Suda Bay
in order to cover Aegean convoys. BONA-
VENTURE was also detached at this time to
join convoy G.A.8 at daylight 30th March.

Darnage Inflicted on the Enemy,

43. It was not at all clear to the Commander-
in-Chief what ships had been sunk, and the fate
of the LITTORIO battleship was in doubt. But
it seemed certain from the goo survivors on
board ships of the fleet that POLA was the
damaged cruiser that had been detected stopped
and that she had been sunk; that the two 8-inch
cruisers engaged by the battlefleet were ZARA
and FIUME and that they were both sunk; that
HAVOCK had sunk one destroyer and the
battlefleet possibly another; in addition there
might be further losses due to the Royal Air
Force bombing attacks. It was also a possi-
bility that the enemy had suffered damage in an
encounter between their own forces.
30th March, 1941—Fleet Return to Alexandria.

44. The fleet continued to Alexandria and
arrived there at 1730. An 8.79 shadower was
shot down by fleet fighters at 0834. A sub-
marine was reported just as the fleet entered
the Great Pass and the destroyer screen were
ordered to clear the area ahead of the fleet with
depth charges. This operation had no result
apart from creating a marked impression on the
Italian survivors.

Date: 10th April, 1941.

ORION, AJAX, PERTH, GLOUCESTER,
VENDETTA and HEREWARD, having
fuelled, left Piraeus at 1300 on 27th March,
1941.

2. GLOUCESTER had, on the previous day,
run a plummer block bearing and had replaced
it with a spare while in Piraeus, but at the
same time divers had found excessive slackness
in one “A” bracket and her maximum safe
speed had to be regarded as 24 knots.

3. ILEX and HASTY were ordered to leave
Suda Bay so as to join the cruisers thirty miles
south of Gavdo Island (in position 34 2a N.,
24 10 E.) at 0630 on 28th March.

4. On the way HEREWARD examined an
A/S contact in approximate position or2 degs.
Phalconera 15 miles, This may have been the
wreck of the U-Boat attacked by VENDETTA
on 18th March in this position. Light oil was
still to be seen on the surface in the vicinity.

5. The passage to the rendezvous was made
without incident and at 0607 on 28th March two

destroyers were sighted to the northward which
proved to be ILEX and HASTY.

6. The course of 200 degs. at 0645 was
selected to take the squadron further from the
likely area of enemy air reconnaissance, while
remaining in a position suitable for any
eventuality.

PuasE I (0630-1230).

7. As soon as the enemy aircraft shadowing
was identified, at 0633, as a type that is some-
times carried in catapult ships, it was realised
that enemy surface forces might be in the
vicinity. But when the first enemy report from
one of FORMIDABLE’S aircraft reported four
cruisers and four destroyers (a force identical
in composition with my owny, some 35 miles to
the north-east of my position, steering a course
similar to my own, I was in some doubt
whether it was not, in fact, my own force that
was being reported. Enemy warships were
sighted astern before any further aircraft
reports had been received and decoded.

8. The enemy sighted were at once suspected
of being Z. class, since cruisers of this
class had been reported at sea on the previous
day by flying boats. This suspicion soon
proved correct. Knowing that vessels of that
class could outrange my squadron and that,
having superior speed, they could choose the
range I decided to try to draw them towards
our own battlefleet and carrier.

9. The enemy followed and opened fire at
25,500 yards at o812. At the same time one
of the enemy cruisers was seen to catapult one
aircraft. The fire was accurate to begin with
and the enemy appeared to be concentrating
on GLOUCESTER. She snaked the line to
avoid hits.

ro. At 0829, when the range had closed to
23,500 yards, GLOUCESTER opened fire with
three salvos, but they all fell short. The enemy
made an alteration of some 35 degs. away after
the first salvo and put himself outside our gun
range. After this time, although the enemy
resumed a course similar to my own and con-
tinued to fire till 0855, all his salvos fell short.

rz. GLOUCESTER flew off her aircraft at
0830 and it carried out action observation, but
her reports were not received in ORION owing
to ‘ther not using the frequency ordered.

1z. During this action VENDETTA soon
began to lag behind and caused some
embarrassment. By 0834 she was about three
miles astern and I ordered ‘ther to steer to the
southward clear of the action.

13. At 0855 the enemy turned away to port
and ceased fire. He eventually steadied on a
course of about 300 degs. I decided to
follow and endeavour to keep touch.
VENDETTA, by cutting off corners, rejoined
at og25. She was ordered to join the battlefleet.

14. At 0854 a signal from aircraft 5F had
been received, reporting 3 enemy battleships at
0805 in a position which was seven miles from
my own position at 0805. Though this report
was manifestly incorrect as regards position, it
prepared me for a meeting with enemy battle-
ships at any moment.

15. H.M.S. FORMIDABLE reported that at
about 1045 or r100, her striking force was
fired at by my squadron. This may have been
so. Fire was opened on various unidentified
single aircraft at long range about this time.
