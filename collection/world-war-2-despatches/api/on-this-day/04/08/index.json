When the scale of the Japanese offensive was disclosed and it was apparent that there was a threat to Kohima and that the toad to Imphal was likely to be cut, it was clear that 4 Corps could no longer control operations in this area in addition to those to the south and north of Imphal. As a temporary measure, therefore, Kohima was placed under the Commander, .202 Line of Communication Area*, and an extemporised headquarters was set up at Kohima under Colonel Richardst, who had formerly commanded an infantry brigade in 81 (West African) Division. Headquarters 33 Corps was meanwhile flown to Jorhat from India and moved forward from there to Manipur Road, where it arrived on the 8th April."

Regular reconnaissances of Massawa, Dahlak Island and Assab and the Eritrean Coast were therefore maintained, and a constant check kept on the movements of Italian ships and Naval units. After the occupation of Massawa on the 8th April this threat was greatly reduced, since Assab was the only port then remaining to the enemy. Thereafter operations in the Red Sea were largely confined to reconnaissances of the port."

Following their big effort of 8th April, 265 U.S. heavies four days later hit rail targets across the Venetian plain and along the Brenner route. Another large scale assault, prior to the enemy's retreat, was made on the zoth by 500 escorted American heavy bombers who attacked the Brenner route bridges and marshalling yards."

If the Germans succeeded in forcing a way through Yugoslavia the whole position could be outflanked from an easy valley which ran from Monastir down to Kozani. As early as 27th March General Wilson had begun to form a detachment at Amynteion to watch this gap, consisting of the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment, the 27th New Zealand Machine-gun Battalion, less two companies, and the 64th Medium Regiment, the whole under Brigadier Lee. On 8th April, three days after Germany invaded Yugoslavia and Greece, it became clear that Yugoslav resistance in the south had collapsed and that from Monastir southwards the road was open to the Germans. To meet this threat it was decided that no further relief in the Veria Pass should be undertaken by units of the 6th Australian Division, and that a force should be formed about Veve under MajorGeneral Mackay, consisting of x9th Australian Infantry Brigade, less one battalion, with a Field Regiment and an Anti-Tank Regiment.

On the evening of roth April, General Mackay's force was attacked in the Amynteion area. This developed next day into the first serious engagement, which lasted for two days. Although the enemy attack was held and heavy casualties inflicted on him, it was obvious that the Olympus-Veria-Amynteion position could not be held for ever. The position was much too extended for the troops available; there had not been time to consolidate it properly; the left flank was protected only by a Greek cavalry division on an extremely wide front, and between this cavalry division and the Greek forces in Albania there was a large gap through which the enemy were likely to penetrate."

            "description": "A decision to re-equip 6 Armoured Division was taken at the end of December, and the convoy arriving on zoth January brought two hundred and forty-one Shermans. Courses of instruction were organised and the first regiment was due to take over its new tanks on r5th February. Operations in the Kasserine Gap, however, retarded the programme, and its was not until 25th February that re-equipment started. The whole Armoured Brigade was reequipped by 2oth March, and after two weeks  training went into action for the first time with Sherman tanks in the Pichon-Kairouan area on 8th April, The Valentine tanks thus released were handed over to the French, who received them with much satisfaction."
