SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON

It might be worth while to suggest to
Norwegian Government, if they think there
is any chance of reaching an agreement on
‘* Mowinckel Plan,’’ we should see no repeti-
tion no objection to their attempting this.
They themselves will of course realise any
hint to Germans that we had decided on
evacuation would destroy any chance they
may have of reaching an agreement. But
evidently time for this is very short and our
evacuation plan cannot be delayed.”

x0. The whole matter was then discussed
between Sir Cecil, General Auchinleck, Colonel
Pollock and myself upon the ‘basis of this
message. It was agreed that Sir Cecil Dormer
on his return to Tromso should interview
privately certain Ministers, and that he should
suggest the revival of the ‘‘ Mowinckel Plan,”
as proposed in the Foreign Office Message
quoted above: that the King should be told the
following morning, June 2nd, and the Cabinet
officially informed later in the day. Sub-
sequently, I was told by letter that the con-
versations had gone off well and that, after
his talk with the Foreign Minister, the latter—
who already had a meeting arranged in Stock-
holm for the 3rd—drafted a telegram to his
Swedish colleague on the subject of the
“* Mowinckel Plan,’’ which draft he allowed
Sir Cecil to alter as he wished. Colonel Pollock
on the same day gave the information to
General (Rugé. Vice-Admiral Cunhingham was
also informed and entrusted with making
arrangements for the 4 of the King,
Government and others who might wish to
evacuate should the negotiations break down.
Sir Cecil Dormer asked that there should be
a delay of a day or two in order to give time
for the negotiations. After ascertaining that
this would entail no harmful consequences to
arrangements already made, I agreed to a
delay of 24 hours. The first night of evacuation
was, therefore, fixed as June 3rd-4th.
Naturally, at first, there was a feeling of sore-
ness and disillusionment among the Norwegians
on learning of the evacuation but on the whole
the decision was received as being inevitable
under the circumstances and every help was
given to facilitate the withdrawal.

11. I wrote to Admiral Diesen expressing the
hope that he would send all his ships to the
U.K. or assure me that they should not fall into
German hands. The following most satisfactory
answer was received : —

“ 6th June, 1940. 4

‘© My Lord:

My very best thanks for your kind letter.
It has been a great pleasure for me to meet
you, my Lord, and so many officers of the
grand British Navy. As a Norwegian, I can
only present my thanks for all it has done.

I am preparing all the ships that may be
of any use for going to the Shetlands.

You may rest assured about the submarines
as well as of the rest. What cannot be
evacuated will be destroyed.

To you personally, my Lord, I send my
very best wishes for the future of both our
countries. God bless them!

In the hope of a au revoir,

Yours very sincerely,
(Sgd.) N. Diesen.”

The Naval Attaché, Rear-Admiral Boyes, also
had the matter in hand.

12. The evacuation proceeded according to
plan on the dates named. On 5 successive
nights, troops to the numbers of 4,700, 4,900,
5,100, 5,200 and on the fifth the last and most
difficult 4,600, without any untoward incident.
The work was almost entirely carried out by
destroyers working under the orders of Captain
E. B, K. Stevens, D.S.C., Captain (D), gth
Destroyer Flotilla, in H.M.S. HAVELOCK.
The presence of this energetic and capable
officer ensured the programme being carried out
punctually and efficiently. The destroyers were
working almost continuously and, as always,
rose to the occasion. Rear-Admiral Command-
ing 2oth Cruiser Squadron was in direct charge
of the transports at rendezvous and responsible
for the embarkation. Up to the end, air pro-
tection was afforded by the R.A.F. and F.A.A.
working in co-operation and to a programme.
Owing, however, to the weather conditions that
prevailed through the 5 days, low clouds and
tain, the enemy air action was weak and spas-
modic. Dive bombing attacks were, however,
delivered upon STORK and VETERAN in Ofot
Fiord during the afternoon of the 7th but the
enemy did not appear to have noticed any-
thing unusual, for no special effort was made
that evening. The last men to be embarked
in the Transports were the Ground Staff of the
Bardufoss aerodrome. The Gladiators had been
embarked in GLORIOUS but it was feared that

‘ the 8 Hurricanes that remained efficient would

have to be abandoned and destroyed. The
courageous action of the pilots in volunteering
to fly their machines on to the flying deck of
GLORIOUS and of Group-Captain Moore in
allowing it to be done resulted in all 8 being
safely got away—an achievement which
deserved a better fate than that which befell the
gallant men who had carried it out successfully.
