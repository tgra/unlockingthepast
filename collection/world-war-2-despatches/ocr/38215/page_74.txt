parts: of Singapore Island. There seemed to
be two alternatives, either (a) to fall back to the
east part of the Island and hold the Changi
area or (6) to concentrate for the clefence of
Singapore Town. We were not strong enough
to hold both areas. The most important con-
siderations were the location of the water
reservoirs; the location of our main dumps and
depots and of our hospitals and the fact that
the Civil Government and the bulk of the civil
population were still in Singapore Town. I
decided that, in the eventuality under considera-
tion, we would concentrate on holding a peri-
meter round the Singapore Town area and the
outlying islands, even though that meant the
loss of the Changi defences. As regards the
Fixed Defences, the experience at Pasir Laba
that morning had suggested that these would
not long remain in action if the enemy con-
centrated his dive-bombers on them.

The plan in outline was to hold a perimeter
which would include the Kallang aerodrome,
the MacRitchie and Peirce Reservoirs and the
Bukit Timah depots area. It was given out
verbally to the Commanders Northern aiid
Southern Areas on the evening gth February
and issued as a Secret and Persona! Instruction
to Senior Commanders and Staff Officers at
oo50 hrs. roth February. It was issued in
order that responsible senior officers might know
my intentions in case the situation developed
too rapidly for further orders to be issued.
A copy of the Instruction is attached as
Appendix K to this Despatch.

503. During the evening 9th February the
enemy’s artillery concentrated on the area held
by 27 Australian Brigade. This brigade, on
orders from the Commander Western area, had
modified its dispositions to guard against the
threat to its left rear. At about 1930 hrs.
the enemy attacked on a front between the
Causeway and the River Kranji. Again a
large number of his landing craft were knocked
out by artillery and machine gun fire but again
he succeeded in getting a footing. Fighting
went on in this area until midnight.

504. At midnight gth/xoth February after
a day of very heavy fighting the position
was approximately as under :—

Causeway Sector.—The enemy had effected
a landing west of the Causeway and confused
fighting was going on.

Kranyni—fJurong Sector.—The 12 Brigade
were still astride the road west of Keat Hong
Village with troops of the 22 Australian
Brigade in front of them near Bulim Village.
The 44 Brigade Group was occupying a
position astride the Jurong road near the
headwaters of the River Jurong, having
driven off some Japanese troops who had cut
the road east of Jurong Village.

River Jurong Sectoy.—The 2 Malay Bat-
talion of the x Malaya Infantry Brigade
(Southern Area) was on the line of the River
Jurong with forward troops west of the river.

Other Fronts._Except for some artillery
harassing fire there had been no activity on
the other fronts.

Reserve —The 6/15 Brigade was assemb-
ling in the Racecourse area. .

505. Throughout the day ‘the Hurricane
fighters had been in the air almost continuously,

as had indeed been the case during the whole

SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 10948

of the previous week. They had inflicted
casualties on the enemy aircraft and sustained
some themselves. This one weak squadron
fought gallantly against the Japanese Air Force.
With the loss of Tengah, the aerodrome at
Kallang was the only one now serviceable. The
A.O.C. with my consent decided to withdraw
what remained of the fighter squadron to a
base in the Netherlands East Indies intending
to use Kallang as an advanced landing ground
only, In the event no British aircraft were
seen again over Singapore.

506. Under cover of darkness on the night
oth/1oth February a naval force of three fast
armed patrol vessels (Fairmiles) entered the
western channel of the Johore Straits with the
object of disrupting the enemy’s communica-
tions and sinking some of his landing craft.
A few small craft were sunk but no other vessels
were seen and the force had to withdraw
without further success.

The Far East War Council met on the oth
February but no meetings were held on subse-
quent days.

Section LI.—EvENTS OF THE IOTH FEBRUARY,
1942.

507. ' Shortly after midnight 9th/roth Feb-
ruary, his left battalion having been forced back
from the beaches, the Commander 27 Austra-
lian Infantry Brigade issued orders for his
brigade to withdraw to positions north and
south of Bukit Mandai. This movement was
successfully carried out before dawn. It had
the effect, however, of leaving open the vital
position overlooking the Causeway and expos-
ing the left flank of 11 Indian Division. The
enemy was not slow to occupy the hill south
of the Causeway.

508. The 6/15 Brigade, the leading batta-
lion of which arrived at its rendezvous on the
Bukit Timah Road at about midnight gth/zoth
February, was immediately ordered forward by
the Commander Western Area to a position
north of the Jurong road near the headwaters
of the River Jurong and some 4 miles west of
Bukit Timah Village. This position it reached
and occupied, after a tedious march owing to
the congested road, at about 0430 hours.

By dawn the 44 Brigade was in position on
the left of the 6/15 Brigade and south of the
Jurong road.

509. The 22 Brigade was still in the Bulim
area where it had been since mid-day on the
gth and was ordered by the Commander
Western Area to fall back ‘at 0600 hours to fill
in the gap in the Kranji-Jurong Line between
the 12 and 6/15 Brigades. This movement com-
menced according to plan but, partly owing to
the Brigade Commander losing touch with his
units, and partly owing to a misunderstanding
of an order received by him from the Com-
mander Western Area, the brigade became
scattered and only a part of it took up its
allotted position. The. remainder occupied a
Position south of Bukit Timah Village.

510, As previously statéd the Kranji-Jurong
Line had been selected and partially prepared
in peace-time as a Switch Line to protect the
centre of the Island against an attack from the
west. A wide belt had been cleared of trees
and undergrowth between the two rivers. It
was a naturally strong position but the defences
had not been completed.
