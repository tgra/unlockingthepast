Japan. So long as Japanese merchant shipping
was being employed on its normal work,
F.E.C.B. could keep track of every vessel, and
should it be found that an unusual number
was being kept in home ports for no good
Teason, it would indicate the possibility, or even
probability, that the Japanese were ‘refitting
these ships as transports prior to an overseas
expedition. The effect of the embargo, how-
ever, was to drive all Japanese shipping off
the seas for purely economic reasons, and once
in Japanese ports they could be altered as
required without our being any the wiser. This
applied especially to the fast vessels, i.e., round
about 18 knots.

In spite of the preparations going on in
‘Southern Indo-China there were some indica-
tions—at any rate up to the end of Novembér
—that the Japanese did not intend immediate
hostilities. The first was a general one, namely,
ihat if the Japanese intended to attack Malaya,
they would have been more likely to have done
so in 1940, when our forces were far weaker
than they were at the end of 1941. Then the
winter months, December to February, were less
favourable for an expedition against the East
coast of Malaya and the Kra Isthmus than other

periods of the year owing to the North-East’

monsoon. (See also para. 134 below.) Finally.
there was the visit of Kurusu to Washington.
It seems now probable that Kurusu, though pos-
sibly innocent himself, was sent to Washington
with the deliberate object of misleading the
United States and ourselves as to the Japanese
intentions, and keeping us quiet until their
own preparations had been finally completed.
But at the time it seemed to us in Singapore
that this was a genuine attempt on the part
of the Japanese to get relaxation of the restric-
tions that had been imposed, and possibly to
drive a wedge between Britain and the United
States. I believe the same view was held in
England.

95. In the latter part of November informa-
tion accumulated to show that the Japanese
were probably intending an offensive at an
early date. Four Mogami class cruisers with a
few destroyers had been despatched from the
Japanese Combined Fleet to the South China
Sea. Two squadrons of long-range Zero fighters
arrived in South Indo-China. The number of
aircraft in Indo-China rose from a total of 74
at the end of October to 245 at the end of
November. The 5th Japanese Division, which
was highly trained in landing operations, was
reported by the Chinese to have moved to South
IndoChina, There were large movements of
motor landing craft from Central China, though
there was no definite information as to where
they had gone. In addition, a telegram was
received from the War Office to the effect that
the United States Army commanders in the Far
East had been informed from Washington that
the Kurusu negotiations might break down at
any time and offensive operations be started
by Japan against Siam, the Netherlands East
Indies or the Philippines; up to the receipt of
this telegram we had remained completely in
the dark on this matter except for Press reports.

Aeroplanes, almost certainly Japanese, occa-
sionally flew over parts of Malaya in the latter
part of November and early December, in all
probability carrying out photographic recon-
naissance, but owing to the speed and height ai

which they operated we were never able to
make contact and obtain definite identification.

In view of the continued Japanese develop-
ments in Southern Indo-China, which gave
them the facilities needed to attack Malaya, pre-
cautionary steps. were taken on the 22nd
November, and orders were issued for vulner-
able points to be guarded, and on the ist
December the Volunteers were mobilised. Cer-
tain movements of air forces were carried out,
and reconnaissances over the China Sea were
instituted.

During this time we felt great need of air-
craft capable of doing high-altitude photo-
graphic reconnaissance. This applied not only
to the aerodromes in Southern Indo-China, but
particularly to Camranh Harbour, on which
we got no information whatever. We had no
aircraft suitable for the purpose’ since, though
a Catalina could have flown the distance, it
had neither the speed nor the necessary ceiling.
It seemed highly undesirable to aggravate a
strained situation by sending over an aeroplane
which would in all probability have been inter-
cepted and definitely identified as British. I
asked General MacArthur to carry out a photo-
graphic reconnaissance from Manila with one
of his Boeing Fortresses, which had the neces-
sary speed and ceiling, but he replied that
orders from Washington prevented him from
carrying out my request.

96. Near the opposite end of the prospective
theatre of operations, the island of Timor was
important as being a definite link in the air
communications between ‘Australia and the
Netherlands East Indies. Its occupation by the
Japanese would also be a serious threat to Aus-
tralia: The importance of Timor was noted in
the A.D.A. agreement, and it was referred to in
A.D.B. Roughly half the island was Dutch
territory and half Portuguese; it was the latter
half which gave no small anxiety. The Japanese
had a consulate in Dilli, the capital of Portu-
guese Timor, and by November, 1941, had
received permission to run a regular flying-boat
service to Dilli, and were gradually getting an
economic hold on Portuguese Timor. In
November, 1941, a small nucleus of Australian
troops was sent to Koepang in Dutch Timor,
where there was an aerodrome and a flying-boat
base. On the rz2th December one infantry
battalion, one independent company and a few
coast defence troops reached Koepang from
Australia, A combined Australian and Dutch
force occupied Dilli in the middle of December,
1941. About the 7th December, in accordance
with the A.D.A, and A.D.B. agreements, two
flights of Hudsons of the Royal Australian Air
Force moved to Ambon in the Netherlands East
Indies. These were followed later by an in-
fantry battalion.

Order of the Day.

97. The Commander-in-Chief, China, and I
had agreed as far back as May, 1941, that it
was desirable to prepare an Order of the Da‘
before the war broke out, so that it could reac!
Burma and Hong Kong in time to be translated
into the different languages spoken by the
troops in the Far East and be ready for issue
on the first day of war. Drafting this Order
presented difficulty because it had to appeal
to men of varying races and religions, ¢.g.,
British sailors and Burmese troops. The main
object that I had in view when preparing it
was to make an effective appeal to the Indian
