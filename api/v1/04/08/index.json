When the scale of the Japanese offen- sive was disclosed and it was apparent that there was a threat to Kohima and that the toad to Imphal was likely to be cut, it was clear that 4 Corps could no longer control operations in this area in addition to those to the south and north of Imphal. As a tempor- ary measure, therefore, Kohima was placed under the Commander, .202 Line of Com- munication Area*, and an extemporised head- quarters was set up at Kohima under Colonel Richardst, who had formerly commanded an infantry brigade in 81 (West African) Division. Headquarters 33 Corps was meanwhile flown to Jorhat from India and moved forward from there to Manipur Road, where it arrived on the 8th April."

            "description": "Prior to the action on the 3rd April, already described, when four Italian destroyers were sunk or disabled, the considerable force of destroyers and other Italian Naval units at Massawa was a constant threat to our Red Sea communications. Regular reconnaissances of Massawa, Dahlak Island and Assab and the Eritrean Coast were therefore maintained, and a constant check kept on the movements of Italian ships and Naval units. After the occu- pation of Massawa on the 8th April this threat was greatly reduced, since Assab was the only port then remaining to the enemy. Thereafter operations in the Red Sea were largely con- fined to reconnaissances of the port."

The most striking feature of the attacks on railways was now the big effort of the M.A.S.A.F. bombers, which operated against targets nominated by M.A.T.A.F., and thus allowed the latter to concentrate primarily on operations directly connected with the battle. Following their big effort of 8th April, 265 U.S. heavies four days later hit rail targets across the Venetian plain and along the Brenner route. Another large scale assault, prior to the enemy\u2019s retreat, was made on the zoth by 500 escorted American heavy bombers who attacked the Brenner route bridges and mar- shalling yards."

East Africa that Maji had been evacuated and expressing the opinion that the Merille tribe would not submit unless Maji was occupied by regular troops. He also stated that 25th East African Brigade would only be able to garrison Maji for a limited time as it was wanted for further operations, He asked if the Equatorial Corps could take over the garrisoning of Maji. This was agreed to and the Equatorial Corps moved forward to occupy Maji. The rains had already started and the state of the tracks was, appalling. The country is covered with tropical jungle. Progress was slow and diffi- cult. By 25th April the Equatorial Corps was still ten miles from Maji, having been held up by road conditions and flooded rivers. It was not until early in May that Maji was occupied. The only practicable route into Maji came from the north, and 0.C. Equatorial Corps found it necessary to establish a ison at Masci, nine miles north of Maji, where contact was made with 2/4 K.A.R."

            "description": "LN.A. troops. Covering the 65 miles from Meiktila in three days, 32 Brigade reached Taungdwingyi on the 18th April. The booty taken included a useful haul of 1,500 gallons of petrol and 3,500 gallons of oil. \"Surprise was complete ; for some days afterwards, enemy convoys, routed via Taungdwingyi, continued to be welcomed by 20 Indian Division, 32 Brigade was followed by 80 Brigade, which entered Natmauk, 28 miles north-north-west of Taungdwingyi, on the 15th April. Both Brigades then continued their rapid advance westwards to the Irrawaddy. 32 Brigade reached the river at Myingun, nine miles south- east of Magwe, on the 19th without opposition. On the same day, 80 Brigade occupied Magwe after slight opposition from astonished Japanese administrative units. \u2018We thus controlled the Irrawaddy at two points 22 and 33 miles south of Yenangyaung respectively. Considerable equipment was captured in Magwe and, once more, unsuspecting convoys entering the town were captured."

            "description": "232. The situation in 20 Indian Division\u2019s area on the 26th April was as follows. 80 Brigade in the Magwe area had pushed patrols across the river, which reported enemy motor transport moving west out of Minbu. Magwe itself was being heavily shelled from the west side of the Irrawaddy. 100 Brigade was pass- ing through 32 Brigade on the road leading from Satthwa to Allanmyo. After clearing opposition 26 miles north of Allanmyo on the 27th, 100 Brigade again made contact just north of the town. Allanmyo fell the following day, after 36 hours fighting, and we captured five guns. Meanwhile, 80 Brigade, advancing south from Magwe, was destroying many par- ties of the enemy who were trying to cross the river from the right bank and escape east- wards. At Allanmyo, 100 Brigade were 252 miles from Rangoon on the 28th April. By the 2nd May, breaking through all enemy attempts to stop it, it had advanced a further 40 miles and captured the great river port (now in ruins) of Prome, the eastern terminus of the road from Taungup. The last escape route of the rem- nants of the Japanese forces in South Arakan was now blocked."

On the 8th April, on the main Meiktila \u2014Pyawbwe road, Yindaw still held out, but its reduction was left to 161 Brigade of 5 Indian Division, which was following 17 Indian Divi- sion according to plan. 48 Brigade by-passed it and fought their way forward to within eight miles of Pyawbwe, shelling the enemy with some of their own guns, which had been cap- tured on the 6th. Meanwhile 99 Brigade was still fighting north of Yindaw, inflicting heavy casualties. On the 9th April, 5 Indian Division captured Yindaw, killing almost the entire garrison and capturing three guns. On this date, 99 Brigade with tank support captured part of the high ground three miles north of Pyawbwe and reached the landing ground just north-west of the town. 48 Brigade, attack- ing astride the road, broke through stubborn resistance, inflicting heavy losses and capturing. two guns. 63 Brigade occupied a village two miles west-south-west of Pyawbwe, taking three guns and then probed forward to the out- skirts of the town. Meanwhile our armoured columns were operating south-west and south of Pyawbwe, capturing artillery and slaughter- ing the gun crews. Altogether a total of fifteen guns (some medium) were taken by 17 Indian Division during the fighting on the 9th April. Pyawbwe fell on the 10th to co-ordinated attacks by infantry from the north and west and armoured troops from the south-west, the latter assault proving decisive."
