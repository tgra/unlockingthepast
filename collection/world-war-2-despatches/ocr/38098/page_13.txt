SUPPLEMENT to tas LONDQN GAZETTE, 16 OCTOBER, 1947

the sight of two battleships steering straight
for them would shake the nerves of the range-
takers and control officers, who had already
had four anxious days and nights.

The Approaci.

81. Between 0600 and o7o0, D/F bearings
of a series of reports by- MAORI enabled the
telative position of the enemy to be deduced
with reasonable accuracy. The BISMARCK
had settled down to a course of about 330°, at
ro knots. The horizon to the north-eastward
was clear and the light good, but south of east
were rain squalls and a poor background.
The strong wind and heavy sea made it most
undesirable to fight to windward. 1 decided
to approach on a bearing of west-north-west
and, if the enemy held his course, to deploy
to the southward, engaging him on opposite
course at a range of about 15,000 yards and
subsequently as events might dictate. At
0737, when the enemy bore 120°, 21 miles,
course was altered to 080° to close: RODNEY
was stationed on a bearing of oro° and in-
structed not to close within six cables of me
and to adjust her own bearing. NORFOLK
was shadowing from the north-westward, ready
to carry out flank marking for the battleships,
and at 0820 she came in sight and provided
me with a visual link. It had been necessary
to alter course on the way in to avoid rain
squalls and to allow for the reported alterations
of course of the BISMARCK, but at 0843 she
came in sight, bearing 118°, 25,000 yards,
steering directly towards us, our course at
this time being rz0°.

The Action.

82. RODNEY opened fire at 0847, followed
one minute later by KING GEORGE V and
then by the BIS CK. The BISMARCK
had turned to starboard to open ‘A’ arcs,
and directed her fire at RODNEY. This turn
of the enemy made it look as if it would be
better for us to deploy to the north-eastward,
‘and T hoisted the signal to turn to 085°; the
BISMARCK, however, almost immediately
altered back to port, so the negative was
hoisted and I indicated my intention to
turn to 170°. RODNEY, who wished to open
her ‘A’ arcs, had anticipated the hauling
down of the first signal and started to altet
course to port; KING GEORGE V also had
altered 20° to starboard to open her distance
from RODNEY; so that the ships were well
separated, which was entirely in accordance
with my wishes. The BISMARCK’s fire was
accurate at the start, though it soon began to
fall off; she made continual alterations of
course, but it is doubtful whether these were
deliberate.

83. The range was now 20,000 yards and
decreasing rapidly, the general trend of the
enenly’s course being directly towards us.
Shortly after our turn to the southward, the
BISMARCK shifted her fire to KING
GEORGE V. By og05 both KING GEORGE
V and RODNEY had their secondary arma-
ments in action. At this stage the effect of
our gunfire was difficult to assess, as hits by
armour piercing shell are not easily seen; but
after half an hour of action the BISMARCK
was on fire in several places and virtually out
of control. Only one of her turrets remained
in action and the fire of this and of her
secondary armament was wild and erratic.
But she was still steaming,

4859

84. Some interference from our own funnel
and cordite smoke had been experienced, and at
0917 the course of the battlefleet was altered
towards the enemy and right round to north,
RODNEY again anticipating the signal. When
the turn had been completed, the lines of fire
of KING GEORGE V and RODNEY were
approximately at right angles; a heavy volume
of fire could he produced without interference
in spotting between the two ships. DORSET-
SHIRE had been firing intermittently since
ogo2 from the other side of the enemy, qs had
NORFOLK from her flank marking position.

85. In order to increase the rate of hitting,
the battleships continued to close, the range
eventually coming down to 3,300 yards.
1015 the BISMARCK was a wreck, without a
gun firing, on fire fore and aft and wallowing
more heavily every moment. Men could be
seen jumping overboard, preferring death by
drowning in the stormy sea to the appalling
effects of our fire. I was confident that the
BISMARCK could never get back to harbour
and that it was only a matter of hours before
she would sink.

86. The shortage of oi! fuel in KING
GEORGE V and RODNEY had become acute.
It was not merely a matter of having sufficient
oil to reach one of our harbours: I had to con-
sider the possibility of damage to fuel tanks
by a near miss from a bomb or a hit by a tor-
pedo; this might easily result in the ship being
stopped in an area where U-boats were known
to be concentrating, and where I had been
warned to expect heavy air attack. Further
gunfire would do little to hasten the BIS-
MARCK’s end. I therefore decided to break

“off the action with KING GEORGE V and

RODNEY, and I instructed any ships still with
torpedoes to use them on the BISMARCK:
DORSETSHIRE anticipated my order and tor-
pedoed the BISMARCK at close range on both
sides: she sank at 1037 in position 48° 09’ N.
16° o7’ W. Although her sinking had been seen
from the after Director Control Tower in KING
GEORGE V, the fact did not become known
to me until 1100 and I informed. the Flag
Officer Commanding, Force ““H’”’, that I
could not sink the BISMARCK with gunfire:
this signal (1045/27th May), which was per-
haps unfortunately phrased, was addressed
only to him and was intended to ensure that he
should take any steps which might help to
hasten her sinking: when intercepted by
others, it may have caused some misunder-
standing. .

87. The BISMARCK had put up a most
gallant fight against impossible odds, worthy
of the old days of the Imperial German Navy,
and she went down with her colours still flying.
DORSEFPSHIRE picked up four officers, in-
cluding the Third Gunnery Officer, and 75
ratings; MAORI picked up 24 ratings; but at
1140 DORSETSHIRE sighted a_ suspicious
object, which might have been a U-boat, and
ships were compelled to abandon the work of
rescue. Some of the remaining survivors may
have been rescued by the Spanish cruiser
CANARIAS.

88. From the information available, it
appears that the BISMARCK suffered three
hits by gunfire on 24th May, one hit by air-
craft torpedo on 25th May and two on 26th
May, two hits by destroyer torpedoes early on
