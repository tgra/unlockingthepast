The first major development during the period under report was the switch of an air supply base from Agartala to Chittagong on the 27th January, 1945, when No. 3 R.A.M.O. was moved across and reopened as No. 7. This was the first step in bringing the air bases forward to keep up with the advance of Fourteenth Army. Chittagong airfield had originally been designed for the operation of ‘light bombers, and considerable engineering effort was required to adapt the installation to take continuous traffic imposing much heavier loads. Nevertheless C. 46 aircraft started to operate on this route on the 2nd February. No. 7 R.A.M.O., incidentally had no Air Despatch Company allotted to it but, using pioneer labour only, achieved the very fine average of over 700 tons per day in April.",
