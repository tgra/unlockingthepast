likely to prove still more valuable when the
balance ot armour should have turned in our
favour and we were able to take the offensive
once more. But there seemed to be no alter-
native but to evacuate it.

The xst South African Division started to

withdraw from Gazala at dusk on the r4th June
by the road through Tobruk. This was made
possible by the stubborn resistance offered by
the garrisons of Acroma and its satellite
localities, vigorously supported by what re-
mained of our armour. The enemy began to
drive northwards at midday, and in the course
of seven hours of furious fighting these troops
tepulsed enemy tanks three times as numerous
as our own, with the loss of only one position.
Thus the rst South African Division was able
to reach the frontier practically intact. The
50th Division, which helped to cover the with-
drawal of the South Africans, was less fortunate,
being obliged to withdraw south-eastwards
across the desert through country infested by
the enemy. Nevertheless by midnight on the
r5th June a large proportion of this division,
which had lost the whole of the 150th Infantry
Brigade with a regiment of artillery a fortnight
earlier, also reached the frontier.
' Although we had no choice but to give up
our bastion at Gazala, I was determined that
the Eighth Army should not yield more ground
than .was absolutely necessary. I therefore
ordered General Ritchie not to allow Tobruk to
become besieged but to hold a line through
Acroma and E] Adem and thence southwards.
I believed that in spite’ of his heavy losses he
still had enough troops to hold this reduced
front of which the key positions were already
prepared and occupied. The. enemy himself
must surely have sustained heavy losses and
was known to be short of ammunition. More-
over we were still superior to him in the air, as
we had been throughout. General Ritchie had
reached the same conclusions as to the res-
pective capabilities of the enemy and ourselves.
in a telegram which crossed mine conveying
orders to hold that line, he stated that he hoped
to be able to stand on the western perimeter of
Tobruk, at El Adem and Belhamed and to
‘keep a mobile force in being to the south.

I had always been determined that Tobruk
should not again be beseiged, but the circum-
stances now obtaining were rather different to
those I had previously envisaged. Although
there was no denying that it had sustained
‘serious losses and although it had been obliged
to fall back from the Gazala line in conse-
‘quence of the heavy defeat of the armoured
divisions, the Eighth Army was by no means
beaten. .Out of the original five infantry divi-
sions and two infantry brigade groups, there
remained three divisions and a. brigade group
practically intact. The xst and 2nd South
African Divisions and the rrth Indian Infantry
Brigade, had hardly been seriously engaged
and the roth Indian Division had. Jost one field
‘Tegiment and a battalion of infantry. Of the
‘other two divisions, the 50th Division still had
two. brigade groups and the 5th Indian Division
‘one; and-a large part .of the Free French
Brigade Group had survived the attacks on Bir
Hacheim and. was being reorganised. More-
cover, in order to make up for our. losses I had
arranged for the New Zealand Division to move
‘down from Syria. Of.the original three motor
brigades, the 2o1st Guards and 7th Motor
Brigades were fighting vigorously and the 3rd

SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 1948

Indian Motor Brigade was being reorganised.
The armoured car regiments had naturally
suffered casualties, but were still taking their
full part in the battle. '  ¢

The most serious losses had occurred among
the armoured brigades. The 1st, Armoured
Division and the 32nd Army Tank Brigade
which were now fighting round Acroma, had
been reduced to about thirty and twenty-four
tanks respectively. The 4th Armoured Brigade
had managed to retain about sixty tanks. On
the other hand there were about a hundred and
fifty tanks of various types undergoing repair
in the Eighth Army’s workshops, and the roth
Armoured Division was on its way to the front.
The training of that division was not complete,
but would not take very long; and, when it
was ready for battle, its ninety tanks might
well give us the superiority in armour we
required.

The Eighth Army was, I considered, still
strong enough to provide an adequate garrison
for Tobruk and to maintain a mobile field force
to the east and south capable of preventing the
fortress being permanently. beseiged. I was
prepared to accept temporary isolation, pro-
vided the Eighth Army were able to maintain
adequate pressure from the south and east.
Meanwhile a new striking force was to be built
up in the neighbourhood of the frontier. On
the 16th June I telegraphed to General Ritchie
that I was prepared to accept temporary in-
vestment and authorised him to organise the
garrison as he thought best.

By this time the process of encirclement had
begun. On the 15th June the enemy left
Acroma in peace for the time being and turned
his attention to El Adem; at the same time he
pushed strong patrols forward to Belhamed and
Sidi Rezegh. The goth Light Division, sup-
ported by tanks, attacked E] Adem three times.
But the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade, with
the help of columns from the 7th Motor Brigade
from the south and from the rth Indian
Infantry Brigade from the north, repulsed all
three attacks. Our air forces also gave effective
and unstinted assistance.

The enemy then split his armour. The 15th
Panzer Division attacked Acroma again on the
16th June; but the garrison, helped by. the
remnants of the rst Armoured Division, held
firm, At the same time a strong detachment
of the 21st Panzer Division slipped past El
Adem and formed up to attack one battalion of
the 20th Indian Infantry Brigade which was
defending Sidi Rezegh, but was dispersed by
bombing and artillery fire. Then the main
body of the 21st Panzer Division passed down
the valley to Sidi Rezegh under cover of a
feint made towards El Adem by the goth Light
Division. Columns from Tobruk ahd from the
4th Armoured Brigade attacked them as they
passed, but were not powerful enough to arrest
their advance.

I considered it essential to hold El Adem
in order to prevent Tobruk becoming per-
manently isolated, and I ordered General
Ritchie to reinforce it without delay. This
proved impossible, however, and the 2th
Indian Infantry Brigade, except for a detached
battalion of infantry and a. battery of artillery
which fought their way into Tobruk, was with-
drawn, during the night of the 16th June. On
the 17th June our defended locality at Sidi
Rezegh was captured.
