the shooting. Now, for-the first time in the war,
the guns were presented. with a target which
did not take evasive action and which obeyed
all the assumptions, upon which Anti-Aircraft
gunnery had been based. It might have been
expected that exceptional results would at once
be obtained but this was not the case and
successes were less than Io per cent. +

-:74: The. Whole question had been carefully
examined as far back as February, 1944, and
it was believed that the targets could satis-
factorily be ‘dealt with, especially if certain new
Ainerican equipmerits could be acquired in
large numbers, provided+-and this was
especially emphasised—that good results were
not expected at heights between 2,000 and 3,000
feet, where the ‘target would be too high for
light ‘guns and tov low for heavy guns and
where the effectiveness of Anti-Aircraft fire was
likely to be small.. I was therefore perturbed to
find that it was exactly in this 1,000 feet. band
that the. targets’ were almost invariably flying.
- Arrangements were made immediately for a
personal representative to fiy to America to
speed up, if possible, the delivery of the new
American equipment, and General Marshall,
who interviewed him, promised to send at once
165 of: their: latest radar sets, the SCR.584,
together with all the necéssaty ‘ancillaries in-
eluding the No. ro Predictor. This promise was
fulfilled. . .

_ 75. Thére were many other difficulties. The
spheres: of influence of guns and fighters over-
lapped, and a most awkward system of limiting
one’ or the other according to meteorological
conditions: was ‘worked out. The radar sets,
which had-been sited-in hollows to avoid-enemy
jamming, were cluttered--up with spurious
breaks caused ‘by. contours of the ground, The
balloon barrage was extended and many guns
“had to be re-sited,. with resulting. difficulties
over the radar.

"76. Above all, the low height at which the.
targets flew required a. higher rate of traverse .

_ by the guns than the mobile 3.7-inch was cap-

able of giving. The static 3.7-inch gun, on
the other hand, though capable of traversing
sufficiently quickly, required an inordinate
length of time for its emplacement on concrete.
It was at this point that Brigadier J. A. E.
Burls, C.B.E., and the R.E.M.E. Staff pro-

duced a platform on which the static. 3.7-inch |

guns could be emplaced’ quickly, which was
portable, and which in the, end proved to be
one of the keys to success.
lattice work of steel rails and sleepers filled with
ballast. a

I most here pay a sincere tribute to the work
of R.E.M.E. from the day the.Corps, was first
formed. .Under Brigadier Burls’ inspired
leadership there was no job they did not tackle.
: 97. We-decided to: replace all the- mobile
3-7-inch guns with the static version, and the
first 32 had been emplaced and were showing
improved results. when the whole policy of the

‘ co-ordination of guns and fighters was changed.

~ Neither: fighters nor guns were being given
full scope, for the guns had to ensure that the
break on their ‘radar tube was not a friendly
plane before opening’ fire, while the fighters in
pursuit of a V.r often had to give up the chase
when approaching’ the m zone.  Lieut.-
Colonel H.‘J.'R: J. Radcliffe, M.B.E., at that
time my ‘Technical Staff Officer, suggested that
we should re-examine the plan of locating the

gins on the’coast, This plan had always seemed
to us to have great advantages from the.
point of view, but there were difficulties from
the fighters’ point of view in that their scope
was thereby limited by having to break off an
engagement on approaching the coast and start
it again if the target got through the gun zone.
It was, however, now very clear that without
some very radica] re-arrangement, two-thirds
of the V.1s would continue to get through to
London. The fighters were still having only a
limited, success, though that success was much
better than the guns were experiencing, _ |
Fighter Command were evidently thinking on
the-same lines, for at a meeting called on the
afternoon of 13th July, at their H.Q.,.atter a
lengthy discussion the C.-in-C. Fighter Com-
mand decided that the guns should be moved
to the coast, and orders to that effect were
given. % .

* 98. The new belt was to extend from’ Cuck-
mere Haven to St. Margaret’s Bay, and the first
guns began to move on i4th July, 1944:
Apart from the move of all the equipments in
the existing belt to the coast, there was‘a simul-
taneous move of 312 static guns coming in ‘to
replace the mobile guns and a further move of
208 Heavy, 146 40-mm Bofors and over 400
20-mm guns in a deployment on the Thames
Estuary to which I shall refer later. The moves
involved 23,000 men and women, for with the
introduction of the static 3.7-inch gun came
the Mixed Batteries and 30,000 tons of amrhuni-
tion’ and a similar weight of stores; 3,000 miles
of cable were laid for inter-battery lines alone.
“In four days the move to the coast had been
completed. : ue

79. There were various advantages in this
new coastal belt. First, radar sets were freed
from the clutter of inland interferences and,
since the enemy was nct using active jamming
methods, they were able to be put to the best .
possible use; secondly, there was a good chance

‘that many bombs destroyed by the guns might

now fall in the sea instead of on land; thirdly,
the existing defences on the South coast, -in-
cluding those of the R.A.F. Regiment, could
now be’ incorporated in one scheme, and
fourthly, the unsatisfactory and alternating

. limitations on guns and fighters, introduced

because of mutual interference arising from the
fighters’ inability to identify the position of an
inland belt, could now be dispensed with, since
the Ine of the coast would clearly reveal the

“position of the belt to aircraft. The move to

the coast was the second of the keys to success.

80. Almost immediately after this the new-
American equipment, which we were so
anxiously awaiting, began to arrive, and as
soon as troops could be trained in its operation
it was deployed along the belt. Not only was
the SCR.584 the most suitable of all the radar
equipments available, but its use, in conjunc-

. tion with the No. ro Predictor, directed fire

wth a degree of accuracy hitherto unattained.
At the same time the problem of exploding the
shells at the -correct height was solved by the
introduction ‘of the proximity fuze. This equip- -
ment provided the third of the keys to success.
