In the absence of such favourable circumstances he had usually avoided combat. In this sense the operations. had proved slightly disappointing. On the other hand, statistically the results were fairly satisfactory so far as they went, the destruction of t6 aircraft and probable destruction of a substantial number of others being claimed for the loss of 25 of our pilots; and much valuable experience had been gained. Moreover, by a combination of   Circus  and   Rhubarb   operations our ultimate object, which was to seize the initiative, harass the enemy, and force him on to the defensive, had undoubtedly been achieved. :",

The main weakness was the lack of troops to man the defences but Kesselring had all the same ordered the strongest resistance. Eighth Army between zoth and 22nd May was preparing for the assault. Following the failure of the surprise attack on Aquino on the evening of the 18th heavier, but still hasty, attacks had been mounted on the rgth by 78 Division on the right and x Canadian Division on the left; these ran into heavy fire which showed the defences ito be as formidable as had been expected.

In these plans he had the full co-operation of General Prioux, Commander of the French Cavalry Corps, but the light mechanised divisions were much  reduced in strength and probably had no more than one quarter of their tanks fit for action.",

The total strength of the troops on the Canal line did not on this day exceed Io,000 men, and the number of anti-tank weapons was barely adequate to cover all the crossing places: certainly there could be no question of being able to keep an effective watch against small parties of infantry crossing the canal between the bridges. The barges, however, had almost all been moved away or at any rate to the bank furthest from the enemy, and bridges were fast being prepared for demolition.",
