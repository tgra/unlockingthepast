AIR OPERATIONS IN BURMA anp BAY OF BENGAL, JANUARY ist TO MAY 22np, 1942.

General Headquarters, India, New Delhi, India, . 28th September, 1942. From: General Sir Archibald P. Wavell, G.C.B., C.M.G., M.C., A.D.C.

To: The Chiefs of Staff, London.

I forward herewith two copies of a report by Air-Vice-Marshal D. F. Stevenson on Air  operations in Burma and the Bay of Bengal from January ist (the date on which AirVice-Marshal Stevenson assumed command) to May zand, 1942 (the date whem the forces from Burma completed evacuation to India).

- Air-Vice-Marshal Stevenson's report emphasises the remarkable work performed by a small air force in defence of Rangoon, and the difficulties which the Air Force, in common with the Anmy, suffered through lack of the necessary resources for the defence of Burma. I have already commented on these in my  Despatch* of July Ist, 1942, on the Burma operations and I have nothing further to add.

In paragraphs 122 to 132 Air-Vice-Marshal  Stevenson: refers to certain telegrams addressed to ABDA Command to which he received no reply. From the records of ABDA Command it appears that both these telegrams were received with very considerable delay, and not until instructions had been received transferring

Burma back from ABDA Command to the command of -the C.-in-C. India. Also AirVice-Marshal Stevenson had included the pro- -viso that   failing immediate instructions am putting this plan into action commencing



today  . By the time, therefore, that these telegrams were received command had passed from ABDA and Air-Vice-Marshal Stevenson had  presumably already taken action, No reply was therefore necessary.

Please pass one copy of this report to Air

Ministry. A. P. WAVELL, General,
