to an extent which made it feasible to under-
take Zipper in August and we oe the
capture of Singapore by the end of 1945.

The shipping resources available were, as
ever, strictly limited, and it was decided that
the assault should be carried out by a Corps.
34 Corps, formed in embryo in India for the
Phuket operation under Lieut.-General O. L.
Roberts (see para. 94) was therefore allotted
to the new task of undertaking operation
Zipper. General Roberts and the Naval and
Air Force Commanders examined the prob-
lem, and. produced by the 23rd June an appre-
ciation and outline plan. They divided the
operation into three phases ; the securing of the
bridgehead, the advance to the Johore Cause-
way and the assault on Singapore. The last
phase was Mailfist, and the two projects were
combined into one.

298. At a meeting with the Supreme Com-
mander at Delhi on the 30th May I was re-
luctantly compelled to tell Admiral Mount-
batten that the effects of repatriation on my
units was such that I must request a post-
ponement of Zipper from August to early
September.

ft had been decided by the War Cabinet that
the period of overseas service necessary to
qualify for repatriation was to be reduced by
four months, and this decision resulted in
British units being decimated by wholesale de-
partures of battle experienced men to the
United Kingdom. Training and reorganization
was essential, and the Supreme Commander,
considering this and certain other factors,
accepted my recommendation. General Slim
(who had by now taken charge of Zipper plan-
ning —see para. 282) and his colleagues were
so informed, and detailed examination led
to the 9th September being selected as D-Day.

299. The appreciation of the Japanese re-
sistance to be expected, led us to anticipate
that the landing would be lightly opposed,
and that the subsequent build-up against it
would be at the worst three divisions, and at
the best not more than two, in addition to the
garrison of Singapore itself. Against this we
were able to deploy two divisions and one
brigade on D-Day, rising to three divisions and
a Parachute brigade by D plus 8 and a fourth
division by D plus 25. This force, plus non-
divisional troops, comprised 34 Corps. My
plan after the seizure of the bridgehead was
based on making a rapid advance on Singapore
in order to avoid if possible a serious battle
for the Island. If opposition proved light,
34 Corps was to begin the advance south as
soon as possible; and we estimated this might
be possible by D plus 13. It would even then
be necessary to leave two divisions to secure
the Port Dickson/Port Swettenham area, but
the build-up from India and Rangoon was to
come in any case. My plan was to bring in
15 Indian Corps to take over rearward com-
mitments, and thereby allow the Commander,
34 Corps, to devote his entire energies to the
advance south. I planned also a series of
amphibian hooks down the coast, in order to
cut off the Japanese facing 34 Corps and to
prevent them retiring on to the Singapore gar-
ison. To control these diverse operations and
to conduct the battle on the ground, General
Slim and his Fourteenth Army Headquarters
was scheduled to arrive with the second
‘Corps.

300. The landing itself was to be covered by
carrier-borne aircraft for the first 8 to 10
days, by which time a strip had to be operating
ashore. It was essential also to capture a port
through which stores could be landed to sup-
plement the small amount which could be taken
over the beaches. The conclusion reached
therefore was that the main assault by three
brigades should go in over the Morib beaches
on D-Day, with the object of securing the air-
Strips in the area and also Port Swettenham.
Also on D-Day, another brigade was to land
at Sepang to seize the road bridges there; this
subsidiary landing would be a support to the
main one. In addition, on D plus 3, three
more brigades were to land on the somewhat
obvious beaches by Port Dickson, with the
object of enlarging the bridgehead and seizing
another usable port.

301. The plan described in outline above,
was in fact carried out subsequent to the
Japanese capitulation, but its execution did
not take place during the period covered by
my Despatch. Furthermore the Japanese sur-
render caused certain alterations io it, and I
have therefore decided that it would be undesir-
able to go into fuller detail myself. At this
point therefore I shall conclude the Operational
portion of my Despatch, and follow with Part
II which examines the very vital Administra-
ia jpspect of the campaign in considerable

letail.

SECTION XIX (paras. 302-310)—THE
MAINTENANCE PROBLEM
The Northern, Southern and Air Lines of
Communication generally: The size of the
problem.

302. The Japanese failure to solve their ad-
ministrative difficulties in their attempt to in-
vade India led them to disaster at Kohima: and
Imphal. The fact that we overcame the diffi-
culties of administration resulted in the recon-
quest of Burma. The problem that faced us
was immense, and the effort that was put into
its solution was as great. In the final analysis
of military history this may be the outstanding
feature of the campaign, and it is with this
in mind, that I intend to go into this aspect
more fully than is usual in a Despatch.

303. The outstanding administrative problem
of an army is usually its maintenance ; that is,
the unfailing supply of ail the commodities
which keep that army fighting in the field. The
base for our operations was India. The rail-
heads were at Chittagong (with short exten-
sions to Dohazari and to the north for the
Arakan coast) ; Dimapur (Manipur Road), rail-
head for Fourteenth Army; and Ledo and
Chabua for Northern Combat Area Command
and the United States air ferry route to China.
These railheads thus joined the only three road
entries to Burma from the north. A certain
degree of flexibility was provided between the
Assam lines to Dimapur, Ledo and Chabua
and the Eastern Bengal dines to Chittagong by
the rail link between Lumding and Badarpur,
though this link was of limited capacity owing
to gradients. The whole system of communi-
cations between India and Burma has already
been fully described by my predecessor, Gen-
