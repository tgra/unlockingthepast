            "description": "The enemy offensive opened on the night of 30th August with two diversionary attacks on 30 Corps. A German parachute battalion secured temporary possession Of one of our positions on Ruweisat ridge but 5 Indian Division won back the position by dawn. An attack in the coastal sector against 9 Australian Division was completely unsuccessful. At oreo hours on 31st August, shortly after moonrise, the main striking force began to lift the mine- fields on the southern flank, in the area from Deir el Munassib to Himeimat. During\u2019 this operation they were enfiladed by the artillery fire of the New Zealand Division and harassed both frontally and from the south by 7 Armoured Division who had excellent shoot- ing in the bright moonlight. In face of the opposition of two artillery regiments and a motor battalion of 4 Light Armoured Brigade it took six hours to clear two gaps for the two German Panzer divisions and it was not until 0930 hours that the Africa Corps was con- centrated east of the minefield. Even after \u00e9verrunning this obstacle they did not advance with their customary speed, largely because the Italians on their left and the goth Light still further north were encountering even greater difficulties in breaking through\u2122the minefields there which were heavily enfiladed by the New Zealand artillery and under direct fire from 47 Motor Brigade. The two Italian armoured divisions, indeed, hardly came into action at all in this battle. For nearly four hours the two Panzer Divisions were known to be gather-"

Its task was to break through into the. valley of the Po and exploit to seize Ferrara and Bologna. Fifth Army was to assist the first phases of the offensive by carrying out ostentatious preparations to simu- late an imminent attack by both Armies on the front between Pontassieve and Pontedera, which was the sector originally chosen for the main attack. While these maagoeuvres were in progress Fifth Army was to prepare an attack to break through the enemy's centre on the axis Florence-Bologna, using Ii and - 13 Corps. This attack would be ordered by me as soon as it appeared that the enemy had weakened his centre sufficiently to meet Eighth Army\u2019s attack. It was naturally impossible to forecast when this would be, but General Clark was to be prepared to attack at twenty- four hours\u2019 notice, if possible, from D plus 5 of the Eighth Army attack, i.e., 30th August. The cover plan for the attack had to be radi- cally altered and was now designed to per- suade the enemy that our main blow was com- ing in the centre and that the Adriatic coast operations were a preliminary feint by our sumplus armour."

            "description": "preparation almost as though it were not there. Only two assets now remuined to Kesselring to retrieve the situation: the excellence of his Jateral communications and the fact that the \u201c* Gothic\u2019\u2019\u2019 line had been built on the forward slopes of the range. The importance of the former factor in allowing a rapid reinforcement I have aeady emphasized; the latter meant that there was still one more ridge between the Allies and the plains, known from the village on its summit as the Coriano ridge. The Canadians were already over the Conca, on 2nd September, and 5 Corps were about to pass ir Armoured Division \u2018through in a dash for the flat country beyond. Just in time Kesselring succeeded in manning the Coriano ridge with\u2019 1 Parachute, 26 Panzer and 29 Panzer Grenadier Divisions; these three ex- cellent divisions, aided by very heavy rain from 5th to 7th September, resisted all attacks between the 4th and the 12th both on the ridge itself and on its southern flank at Gemmano. As Eighth Army\u2019s offensive developed its full extent the enemy was forced to economize strength on the remainder of his front by withdrawing into the \u2018Gothic \u2019\u2019 line. This was essential if he were to be able to make further reinforcements avajlable for his left; it was also a natural measure of. precaution in case a real _break- through was achieved for, apart from LXXVI Corps, now engaged with Eighth Army, the rest of the German troops were still well south of the watershed of the Apennines. The with- drawal began on 30th August. LI Mountain Corps, between Urbino and Pontassieve, moved straight back into the line on a timed pro- gramme, releasing one division for the central sector, and 10 Corps, following up, made con- tact with the line on 3rd September. At the same time the enemy opposite Fifth Army began to pull back. On the extreme right they went back almost directly into the \u2018\u2018 Gothic \u201d\u2019 line. Opposite 13 Corps, however, the enemy stabilized on 3rd September on the line of hills north of Florence: Monte Morello, Monte Senario, Monte Calvana and Monte Giovi. IV Corps followed up across the Arno on 31st August and II Corps on Ist September. Little Tesistance was met and we were able to occupy"
