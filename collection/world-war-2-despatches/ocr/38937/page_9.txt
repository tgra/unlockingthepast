SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

Lieutenant-General McCreery,* with under
command 46 and 56 Divisions, was to assault
between Salerno and the Sele River, seize
Salerno and the Montecorvino airfield and
establish a firm beach-head, including the moun-
tain passes north-west of Salerno. When firmly
established it was to advance and capture the
port of Naples and the airfields at Capodichino
and Pomigliano. On D-day it was to be
assisted by three American Ranger battalions
and two British Commandos, attacking on its
left flank, and on D plus 4 it was to be reinforced
by 7 Armoured Division. On the right the

Inited States VI Corps, General Dawley,t
was to assault, with 36 Division and one
tank battalion, the beaches south of the River
Sele, establish a firm beach-head and secure
the Army right flank. The Army floating
Teserve consisted of one Regimental Combat
Team of 45 Division under the divisional
commander. As a follow-up, when shipping
became available after the assault phase was
over, the remainder of 45 Division was
nominated, and subsequently 34 Division.
In the original plan a Regimental Combat Team
of 82 Airborne Division was to be dropped
north of Naples in the valley of the River
Volturno to seize the bridges at Triflisco, Capua
and Cancello and prevent the arrival of enemy
teinforcements from the north. This drop was
subsequently cancelled, to the great detriment
of the operations.

It will be seen that the forces available for
the invasion of a hostile coast at the extreme
limit of air cover and well out of touch with
any supporting force were not large, though
I need not say that they were the largest we
could manage. Only three infantry divisions
were to make the assault, with an armoured
division to start disembarking on D plus 4, and
subsequent reinforcement would be slow. The
provision of landing craft was now our acutest
problem. Many -of those needed could not be
withdrawn from Sicily before 19th August, after
which they had to be hastily refitted at Bizerta,
undergo such repairs as might be necessary,
and sail to their loading ports; the many uncer-
tain factors in the programme made it impos-
sible to be sure how many would eventually be
available, We were prepared to strip 13 Corps
of its craft as soon as it had got itself estab-
lished across the Straits, in fact we took some
Landing Ships, Tank, away on D-day of that

ation. Convoy problems were difficult for

e Navy. VI Corps was to sail direct from
Oran in a single convoy, but 10 Corps had to
be loaded into many different of ships
and craft and sail from Tripoli and Bizerta in
a series of convoys of various speeds’and com-
position, All convoys were to pass west of
Sicily and then proceed, on D minus 1, on a
northerly course, turning eastwards towards
Salerno only after last light. A great part of
the route would be along narrow Janes i
swept through the enemy minefields where, if

opposed, alterations of course would be im-
possible and the force would have to fight its
way through. Force ‘‘ H,”’ comprising four
battleships, two aircraft carriers and 12th
Cruiser Squadron, was to cover the assault
convoy from attack by the Italian battle fleet in
Spezia and Genoa while two battleships at
Malta watched Targnto and were available Me
replace casualties support carrier group o!
np light fleet and four escort anexalt cases
was to provide additional fighter cover for the
landing and was itself covered by aircraft from
the fleet aircraft carriers of Force ‘‘ H ”.*

The task of the Air Forces was twofold; first
and most important to neutralise the enemy
air effort and secondly to disorganise his power
of movement. The opening stage in the air
plan was designed to force him to evacuate
his air bases in Southern and Central Italy and
to disrupt the Italian communication system by
attacks on key-points. From D minus 7 until
the bridgehead had been firmly established a
concentrated effort would be made against the
Naples-Salerno area to render useless the air-
fields there and, as far as possible, to isolate
the battlefield from enemy reinforcement. When
this was deemed to be accomplished, and de-
pendent upon the measure of success attained,
close bomber support would become available
for general operations. Fighter cover was to
be provided by a continuous patrol from bases
in Sicily, { supplemented by the Seafires of the
Carrier Support Group, until airfields or emer-
gency.air strips ashore were available. It was
hoped that Montecorvino airfield could be cap-
tured on D-day and that seventy-five aircraft
could be flown into it by D plus 1.

The orders for the Calabrian landing (Opera-
tion BAYTOWN) were also issued on 16th
August. It was a simple plan which was carried
out without any but minor variations, The
troops to be employed were only two infantry
divisions, 1 Canadian and 5 British, reinforced
by an armoured and an infantry brigade and
various Commando units. The artillery sup-
port for the actual crossing, however, was
almost as heavy as Eighth Anmy had ever had,
including an Army Group Royal Artillery, 30
Corps artillery and four battalions of American
mediums from Seventh Army assisted by naval
supporting fire.{ In the air, the attack was to
be supported by the Desert Air Force, with
elements both of XII U.S. Air Support Com-
mand and of Tactical Bomber Force temporarily
under its command.

* The additional fighters provided in this way by
the Fleet Air Arm made a most valuable contribution
to our air cover but they could not have been relied
upon to the exclusion of land-based fighters for they
could only guarantee eighty sorties on the first day,
the number dropping rapidly thereafter, and the effort
could only be sustained for a little over three days. Itis
clear therefore that carrier-borne aircraft alone would
have been inadequate to support a landing further north.

+ Provided the weather remained fine. Rain would
have rendered unserviceable the hastily constructed
strips in the Milazzo area and precluded the use of the
land-based short-range fighters which were to provide
the greater part of the fighter protection over tho
assault area. It was one more risk involved in the
operation. .

¢ Before the assault naval forces, including battle-
ships, heavily bombarded the coast defences. The
assault was supported by three cruisers, three monitors,
two gunboats and six destroyers. The naval operations
wére directed by Rear-Admiral (now Admiral Sir
Rhoderick) McGrigor, K.C.B., D.S.O.
