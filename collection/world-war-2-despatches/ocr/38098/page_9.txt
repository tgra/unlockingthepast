SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 16 OCTOBER, 1947

48. The enemy’s courses west of south were
being covered by SUFFOLK and, to a lesser
extent, by NORFOLK and PRINCE OF
WALES. KING GEORGE V worked across
to the south-westward to cover a southerly
course, allowing for an increase of speed by
the enemy. Consideration was given to flying
off the Walrus from KING GEORGE V to
search the perimeter astern of the ship and so
cover a south-easterly course of the enemy;
but the swell was such that the sacrifice of the
aircraft would almost certainly result, and I
did not wish to expose KING GEORGE V to
U-boat attack whilst picking up the crew. Sub-
sequent analysis shows that such a search might
possibly have located the BISMARCK.

49. Fhe Rear-Admiral Commanding, Second
Cruiser Squadron, was ordered by signal to
organise an air and surface search, with
VICTORIOUS and his four ‘cruisers, north-
west of the last known position of the enemy.
‘When [I issued these instructions, I estimated
that the Rear-Admiral Commanding, Second
Cruiser Squadron, and VICTORIOUS were
well to the northward of this position; but in
point of fact he had been steaming south at
high speed and was now close to it. It is
probable therefore that the air search carried
out did not extend.as far as the circle on which
the enemy now was and would not have found
them even if the aircraft had searched to the
eastward, as the Rear-Admiral Commanding,
Second Cruiser Squadron, and the Commanding
Officer of VICTORIOUS~ had originally
intended. ’

50. This completed the immediate search,
leaving a sector between north and south-east
unwatched. The search was backed up to a
certain extent by the ships which had been
detached by the Admiralty from various other
duties and which were approaching the scene.
RODNEY recovered her screen, which had
earlier been forced by bad weather to drop
astern, and took up an extremely well-
chosen position on the route for the Bay of
Biscay. RAMILLIES patrolled to the south-
ward of KING GEORGE V and PRINCE OF
WALES. EDINBURGH (flying the flag of
Commodore Charles M. Blackman, D.S.O.,
Commodore Commanding, Eighteenth Cruiser
Squadron), who had been patrolling off the
Bay of Biscay and had been sent by the
Admiralty to act as relief shadower, was near
the track for Gibraltar. In addition, some
degree of search was provided by REPULSE,
whom I had been compelled to detach to New-
foundland for fuel, and by LONDON (Captain
Reginald M. Servaes, C.B.E.), who had been
instructed by the Admiralty to search for an
enemy tanker believed to be in the area

‘round 25° 30’ N. 42° W. Force ‘‘ H,’’ some
1,300 miles to the south-eastward, had been
instructed by the Admiralty to steer to intercept
the BISMARCK from the southward.

51. The track of the BISMARCK as drawn
on the attached strategical plot (see Plan 1) is
probably reasonably accurate. It shows how
narrowly she avoided contact with the various
British forces during her run east. She started
by crossing about r00 miles astern of KING
GEORGE V at o800 on 25th May and then
passed about 50 miles from RODNEY and 45
miles from EDINBURGH. On the next day

4855

she passed 85 miles under the stern of convoy ,
W.S. 8B, and 25-30 miles ahead of the
Captain (D), Fourth Destroyer’ Flotilla, who
had parted company with this convoy. It is
understood that the Captain (D), Fourth
Destroyer Flotilla, had disposed the convoy
escort to the westward of the convoy in ‘the
hope that the BISMARCK would be deflected
if she appeared steaming towards it.

52. At 1030 on 25th May, a series of D/F
bearings was received from the Admiralty which
indicated that the enemy was breaking back
across the Atlantic. The signals appeared to
some from the same ship which shad trans-
mitted several signals soon after the T/B -
attack of the night before; they could therefore °
Tteasonably be attributed to the BISMARCK.
These bearings, as plotted in KING GEORGE V,
showed a position too far to the northward,
which gave the misleading impression that the
enemy was making for the North Sea. J broad-
cast this position of the enemy and instructed
all Home Fleet forces to search accordingiy.
PRINCE OF WALES had not yet joined, but
the course of KING GEORGE V was altered to
055°, 27 knots, to make for the Iceland-
Faeroes gap.

53. A position of the enemy transmitted by
the Admiralty made it clear that the enemy was
making for a French port and had a lead of
about I00 miles. The accuracy of the informa-
tion which was issued by the Admiralty
throughout this stage of the operation and the
speed with which it was passed out were
beyond praise. The situation could be clearly
envisaged by all the forces concerned and I
was able to preserve wireless silence.

‘2 54. KING GEORGE V, RODNEY, NOR-

FOLK, EDINBURGH and Force ‘‘H” all
proceeded at their bestspeed towards the Bay.
of Biscay; and a sweep was flown, in the evening
by Coastal Command flying boats as far as
longitude 30° W. When this failed to locate
the enemy, two cross-over patrols by flying
boats were arranged to start at 1000 on 26th
May, across his probable track. In addition to
these forces, COSSACK .(Captain {D), Fourth
Destroyer Flotilla), with SIKH (Commander
Graham H. Stokes), ZULU (Commander Harry
R. Graham, D.S.0:), MAORI (Commander
Harold T. Armstrong, D.S.C.), and the Polish
Ship PIORUN (Commander E. Plawski) were
detached by the Admiralty from convoy
W.S. 8B early on 26th May and instructed to
join and screen KING GEORGE V and ROD-
NEY, to be joined by JUPITER (Lieutenant-
Commander Norman V. J. T. Thew) from
Londonderry; and DORSETSHIRE (Captain
Benjamin C. S. Martin), on receipt of the first
enemy report, reported that she intended to
leave convoy S.L. 74, which she was escorting,
and came up from the south-west to intercept
and shadow.

Other Dispositions.

55. Meanwhile, those forces which could not
reach the most probable track of the enemy
were moving to cover alternative possible move-
ments. MANCHESTER, and BIRMINGHAM
took “up the Iceland-Faeroes patrol and
ARETHUSA that of the Denmark Strait, with
air patrols of all the northern passages to assist.
