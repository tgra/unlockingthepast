All evidence indicates that the rapidity with which British forces arrived in Jraq came as a surprise to Rashid Ali and his supporters and probably accounts for the fact that no"

            "description": "42. Meanwhile in anticipation of the possible necessity of the evacuation of Greece, a com- mittee of the Joint Planning Staff had been formed in the Middle East and was sent to Athens on 7th April under Rear-Admiral Baillie Grohman. The general situation in Greece now betokened the near end of Greek resistance. The Greek forces on the left of the Imperial troops had already disintegrated and it was obvious that little more could be expected * from the Greek armies in Albania. The Piraeus had been so heavily bombed that it was prac- tically unusable as a port, so that to send further reinforcements or supplies to Greece had become a matter of extreme difficulty. I cancelled the sailing of the Polish Brigade and the 7th Australian Division and went to Athens myself on 19th April. The Greek Prime Minister had committed suicide on 18th April. I saw General Wilson and General Blamey and had audience with His Majesty the King, who was now acting as head of his Government. It was decided, with the full approval of His Majesty the King and the Greek Government, that the evacuation of the British forces was essential. It was obviously impossible, in view of the overwhelming superiority of the German air force, to use the Piraeus or any other port for the re-embarkation of the force, which would have to take place from open beaches. I instructed General Wilson that the embarkation should take place on as wide a front as possible and that any troops who were cut off or were unable to embark on the beaches selected should not surrender but should make for the Peloponnesus, where there might be possibilities of evacuating them later."

The following points emerged and show the situation as it was at this time: \u2014 . (a) The new Greek Government had not yet been formed, and a new Prime Minister had not yet been elected. No decision had yet been receiv\u00e9d from the Head of the Government whether they wished to hold out or withdraw."

            "description": "241. Our tanks reached Pyinmana on the 19th April. Finding it held, they by-passed it and captured the valuable Lewe airfield, just to the south of the town, on the 20th. By nightfall, they had reached Yeni, 43 miles from Toungoo and 218 miles from Rangoon. 161 Brigade took over the defence of Lewe air- field after its capture by the armoured column, preparing it for the glider fly-in of aviation engineers. They also cleared the northern part of Pyinmana, the Japanese garrison still re- sisting stubbornly in the southern sector. Mean- while 123 Brigade passed rapidly through 161 Brigade and reached Thawatti, almost catching up with our armour three miles further south. Continuing their rush south, both our tanks and our infantry reached a village 15 miles north of Toungoo on the 21st April. On this date, the enemy in Pyinmana were finally liquidated. ."

On the 19th April, 22 (East African) Brigade captured the village of Dalet on the Tanlwe Chaung nine miles north-east of Taungup. On the 28th April, 4 (West African) Brigade actually occupied Taungup, and with this fitting conclusion 82 (West African) Division and 22 (East African) Brigade passed under my direct command. The for- mations of 15 Indian Corps had completed their task and were withdrawn to India, less Headquarters, 15 Indian Corps and 26 Indian Division in Ramree."
