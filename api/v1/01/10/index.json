            "description": "82. An outstanding “ earthquake ” operation, for instance, was the air contribution to the combined army and air attack directed on 10th January against the enemy stronghold at Gangaw in the Kabaw Valley, where an extensive and well-defended system of bunkers and gun emplacements was holding up the advance of 4 Corps southwards in its vital thrust against the Japanese left flank. Four Mitchell squadrons participated in this operation, as did some thirty-four “ Hurribombers,” defensive cover being supplied by Spitfires and. Thunderbolts. It turned out to be a highly successful day; the bombs were dropped at approximately 1430 hours and within ninety minutes five out of the six main Japanese positions were in Allied hands. The subsequent withdrawal of the enemy from the whole neighbourhood during the next few days was. attributed by 4 Corps to be due in great measure to a lowering of his morale as a result of this air attack. But the participation of so large a number of aircraft in a single operation was not usual, and as the campaign wore on it was realised that Mitchells operating in numbers as low as two or three could do effective work in accurately winkling out small enemy parties from their lairs.",

            "description": "26. While these events were taking place in the Irrawaddy valley and to the north-east, the main strategy of the campaign was beginning to take shape. 4 Corps was removed from the left flank of the Fourteenth Army as soon as the junction with the Northern Combat Area Command was assured, and with two divisions was given the task of pushing southwards from Kalemyo along the Gangaw valley towards Tilin and Pauk. The natural obstacles on this wild route were every bit as great as those prepared by the enemy, who did not appreciate the threat to his left flank that was thus being unfolded. His ignorance of the situation was due to the fact that his reconnaissance aircraft dared not cover the area, and to his tardy realisation of the new mobility of the Allied armies with which air supply endowed them. His defences at Gangaw were overwhelmed on 10th January after an air bombardment to which the Army paid full tribute, and by the 27th the forward units of 4 Corps had reached Pauk. Early in February they established themselves on the right bank of the Irrawaddy below Pakokku. The stage was now set for the crowning blow of the campaign.",

            "description": "180. While operations to close the Japanese escape toad at Kangaw were in progress, the West Africans were engaged in driving the enemy in the.Kaladan Valley south on to the Kangaw block. It will be recalled (vide paragraphs 157 and 158) that by the 10th January, 81 (West African) Division was fighting in the hills about 15 miles north-north-west of Myohaung, with 4 Brigade of 82 (West African) Division under command, at Apaukwa, which lies on the Kaladan River 16 miles north-west of Myohaung. Care had to be taken at this stage to avoid forcing the enemy into making a too early withdrawal before the trap was closed by 25 Indian Division in his rear. The Kangaw landing was timed for the 22nd January, and it was therefore decided to clear Myohaung by a determined drive on the 25th.",

            "description": "35. 2 British Division (Major-General C. G. G. Nicholson) remained concentrated in the Yazagyo area until the 12th December, when it began its forward move to the Kalewa bridgehead. The leading Brigade. the 6th, passed through 11 (East African) Division on the 21st and advanced rapidly along the road from Kalewa towards Pyingaing. West of Pyingaing the advance was checked by a strong rearguard position. With the assistance of 32 Brigade of 20 Indian Division as stated above, the enemy was cleared, and Pyingaing was captured on the 24th. Determined resistance was again encountered in the Wainggyo Gorge, nine miles south-west of Pyingaing, but was overcome with tank support. The advance of 2 British Division continued with great speed. Dominating features astride the road 12 miles east of Pyingaing were cleared, and a large enemy detachment was successfully ambushed on the 28th December. On the 31st, the Kabo Weir, 11 miles north of Ye-U was captured intact. This was an important economic gain, since the Kabo Weir controls the irrigation of an extensive area of rice-growing country. It was a propitious entry into the Shwebo plain— the enemy’s demolition party, sent to blow up the weir, arrived to find us in occupation. On the 2nd January, 5 Brigade had established itself at Ye-U and the Division was driving the enemy back on to Shwebo, the northern outskirts of which were reached by the 8th January. 64 Brigade of 19 indian Division had already reached the eastern outskirts on the 7th, having come via Kanbalu. Shwebo town was finally occupied on the 10th January, after the Japanese rearguard had fought to the last. man. 6 Brigade of 2 British Division was then concentrated at Shwebo after relief by 268 Indian Brigade in the Kabo Weir area. This advance of 150 miles in 20 days was a fine performance by an all-British Division.",
