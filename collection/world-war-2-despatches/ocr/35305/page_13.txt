SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1941 501r

declared an open town and that British troop
movements would prejudice its safety, but no
adequate alternative routes to the Dyle were
available and I was therefore compelled to
adhere to the original plan of using the outskirts
of the city. -

The 3rd Division, on arrival, reported that a
Belgian division was holding the bridgehead at
- Louvain, although I had assumed that this
should be a British responsibility. 2nd Corps
therefore took up a narrow front on their right
with a strong reserve in rear of Louvain.

5th Division, which was training in the area
south-west of Amiens, was ordered to proceed
by march route so as to shorten the move by
motor transport in a later phase, and later
occupied a position on the Senne.

The news from the Belgian army, of which
King Leopold had assumed command on the
outbreak of war, was not good. Belgian cyclist
troops from east of the Meuse were falling back
on Huy. At Maastricht, it was reported that
they had been forestalled by enemy action from
the rear and had been unable to demolish
important bridges over the Albert Canal and
the Meuse across which ‘the enemy had
begun to move. Air bombing was requested
and was extremely effective, but could not
altogether deny the passage of the water
obstacles to the enemy. On my right the
French Cavalry Corps had reached their
position on the line Huy—Hannut—Tirlemont
and reconnoitred the Belgian anti-tank obstacle.
They reported that, as I had supposed, there
was no effective obstacle on the Gembloux line
and that the obstacle on the Perwez line was
not only unfinished but badly sited on a forward
slope. I thereupon conveyed to General Georges
a confirmation of my objections to pushing
forward so as to make use of the obstacle in its
unfinished state, notwithstanding the Belgians’
anxiety that I should do so. Later that day I
was informed that he had decided that the main
line of resistance was to be on the Gembloux
line as planned, but that the French were to
push out advanced troops to the line of the
obstacle. He expressed the hope that the B.E.F.
would conform, and ist and znd Corps
accordingly reconnoitred the anti-tank
obstacles reported to exist round the forest of
Meerdael with a view to pushing forward
detachments with anti-tank guns. They found
them complete only in places.

zo. The first phase of Plan D was successfully

completed by rzth May, and the French Ist
Army on my right then accelerated the pro-
gramme governing their forward movement by
moving by day as well as by night. The enemy
progress across the Albert Canal had up to now
been relatively small, due to a_ successful
counter-attack by the French Cavalry Corps at
St. Trond, but larger concentrations were now
reported north of the Albert Canal. Disquieting
news was received from the Ardennes, where a
German thrust was reported as developing on
the front of the French gth Army, with at least
two armoured divisions.

On this date I requested the War Office to
expedite the despatch of the rst Armoured
Division to the greatest extent possible. I also

asked that they should be shipped to the nearest”

available port and loaded tactically with a view

to operations as soon as possible after landing.
The day was one of great activity in the air,

and afforded great opportunities for the Royal

Air Force to impede the enemy advance ; but
such opportunities were of a fleeting character,
since the enemy established strong anti-aircraft
defences soon after his arrival, particularly in
towns at which roads converged. Tactical
reconnaissance became virtually impossible
without fighter support, and the demands made
on the fighter group of the Air Component were
extremely heavy. They had been met with
unfailing skill and courage, and with marked
success, but by now the group was reduced to
some 50 aircraft, and although I had asked for
four fresh squadrons from home, only one had
arrived. In three days’ operations, the British
Air Force in France had firm reports of the
destruction of ror enemy aircraft, mostly
fighters, against a loss of 78 of our own.

That afternoon a conference was held at the
ghia Casteau, near Mons which = stendesl

y the King of the ians, General Van
Grastastan” M. Daladio’ Generals Georges
and Billotte, and my Chief of the General Staff
(Lieutenant-General H. R. Pownall), as my
fepresentative in my absence. The primary
object of the conference was to achieve
some measure of co-ordination in the
Belgian theatre of war. General Billotte’s
command included the French ist and
yth Armies, between which lay the Belgian
Army under the independent command
of their King, and the B.E.F. which, though
under the command of General Georges, was not
under that of General Billotte. Whatever the
nature of the operations, a common doctrine
was clearly necessary and when General Georges
enquired if the King of the Belgians and I
would be prepared to accept co-ordination by
General Billotte as his representative, General
Pownall said he was sure that I would agree.
The King of the Belgians likewise agreed.

. at. On 13th May I moved my Command Post
forward to Renaix ; no event of major impor-
tance occurred during the day, but some small
infantry attacks developed on the British sector.
These were easily held. Movements of the main
bodies of the French 1st and 7th Armies con-
tinued in accordance with their plans, and units
of the latter were by now north of Antwerp on
the Dutch border. It was, however, becoming
increasingly evident that they would be unable
to Poa the enemy occupation of Walcheren
and Zuid Beveland which was developing from
the north-east.

During the day and the following night the
Belgian forces were in process of withdrawing
their northern forces to the general line Louvain—
Antwerp, and the Staff of the Belgian G.Q.G.
expressed concern lest the simultaneous with-
drawal of their Cavalry Corps and that of the
French, north-west and south-west from their
junction point at Tirlemont, would create a gap.
There appeared to me to be little danger, but
nevertheless I ordered r2th Lancers to watch
the situation, assisted if need be by divisional
cavalry regiments.

22. On 14th May I went to Brussels, where at
12 noon I met the Commanders of Ist and 2nd
Corps at the British Embassy. The Commander
of 2nd Corps reported that the Belgian 1st
Corps was now reforming in 4th Division
area. I also discussed the organisation of the
second position on the Senne canal and of a
Corps reserve line east of Brussels. 5th and 48th
Divisions were ordered to reconnoitre the Senne
position on 15th May. That afternoon at 3 p.m.
