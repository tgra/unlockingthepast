By Monday the 3rd February air reconnaissance proved beyond doubt that the enemy had decided on further withdrawal. Large columns were moving Westward, tanks were being entrained at Barce and general cessation of hostile air activity indicated the abandoning of aerodromes South of Benghazi. It was therefore decided to move, at once across the desert without awaiting completion of force or of supply arrangements. H.Q., 13th Corps, accordingly directed 7th Armoured Division to move on Msus with all available resources,",

However, in view of the Air Ministry's request and my desire to leave nothing undone which offered a chance of hampering the enemy, I agreed to do so. In order to reduce the risk to civilian property to a minimum, the pilots chosen for the job were instructed to use methods which can best be described as   trickling their bombs towards the target  . This technique necessitated five separate attacks of which all but one were made from the direction in which there were no houses adjoining the factory. Two attacks were made on the 3rd February, two on the oth February, and one on the 8th. After the last attack on the oth we judged that the target had suffered enough damage to be left alone in future.",

The BomberFighter component was engaged from the 3rd February onwards in attacks on railways and   airfields and, as soon as the fiy-in had been accomplished, in direct support when called for by the columns. In these tasks the Mustangs (P.51) flew 1,482 sorties and the Mitchells (B.25) 422. Their claims against enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground and in the air amounted to ninety. The glider component of the force carried out fourteen sepatate operations involving the release of 99 gliders which took into Burma a variety of equipment ranging from bulldozers to rivercraft. .",

VI Corps then went over to the defensive in preparation for the enemy counter-attack in force, of whose imminence there was strong evidence. Two positions were to be prepared in rear of the present front lines; the last, corresponding with the initial bridgehead, was to be the final line. 1 and 3 Divisions, both reinforced, plus the newly arrived 1 Special Service Force and a regimental combat team of 45 Division, were in the line; the remainder of the 45th and r Armoured Division, less one Combat Command, were in reserve.
