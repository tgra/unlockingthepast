SUPPLEMENT to tus LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

possible. Communication with Kuantan had
broken down and am officer sent to ascertain
the situation had not yet returned. After dis-
cussion it was. decided ‘that the Commander
Kuantan Force should be instructed to hold the
aerodrome until the zoth January.

263. Late on the 1st January the Commander
rr Indian Division reported that an enemy force
had landed at Ulu Melintang near the mouth of
the River Bernam (a little south of the mouth
of the River Perak) and that he had moved the
12 Brigade Group to meet this threat. He
further said that he thought he could continue
to hold the Kampar position, where a strong
attack had already been repulsed, for several
days but that, if he did so, his ability to hold
the enemy north of the Kuala Kubu Road
Junction might, in view of the threat to his
communications, be prejudiced. He asked for
authority to withdraw his force from Kampar
at his discretion. - This was granted.

264. The Commander 3 Indian Corps was
already having reconnaissances carried out of
lines on which to co-ordinate the withdrawal as
far back as North Johore. With a view to
co-ordinating future defence plans I arranged
to hold a conference at Segamat in North Johore
on the 5th January at which both the Com-
manders 3 Indian Corps and AI.F. should
attend

265. After visiting Port Swettenham and
Port Dickson, I returned to Singapore late on
the 2nd January.

266. During this tour the following matters,
in addition to those reported above, were dis-
cussed :—

(@) Measures to harass the enemy’s com-
munications. ‘‘ Left behind ’’ parties, con-
sisting for the most part of Chinese led by
Europeans, were being rapidly trained at
Singapore. It was planned to send these
parties up to the 3 Indian Corps area as
‘soon as ready. In addition, an offer had
been received and accepted from the N.E.I.
Military Authorites for a detachment of
‘ Marechaussees, specially trained in guerilla
warfare in the jungle, to be sent to Malaya.
. () The preparation of special news sheets
for distribution among the Indian troops to
counter Japanese propaganda.

(c) Methods of anti-tank defence. In this
connection, a very large number of concrete
cylindrical blocks were being manufactured
both at Singapore and at Kuala Lumpur and
ssome were now ready for distribution,

(d) Policy as regards the Federated Malay
States Volunteer Force.—This' Force con-
sisted partly of European and partly of
Asiatic personnel. It was organized on a
‘State basis and maintained out of Federated
‘Malay State funds. In practically all cases
the famulies’ of the Asiatic personnel were
resident in the State and would remain there
after withdrawal. Faced with the prospect
of moving into South Malaya and leaving
their families behind, some of the Asiatic
Volunteers began to show discontent and de-
sertions had taken place. We were faced
with the alternative of continuing to enforce
service with the Colours at the expense,
almost certainly, of weak and discontented
units or of releasing those who wished to
leave. We decided on the latter course.
‘Thereafter, when a unit was to be withdrawn

1289

from its State every Asiatic member was
given the option of remaining with it or of
handing in his arms and equipment and
going to his home. In almost every case
the latter course was chosen. The arms and
equipment were re-issued to units requiring
them as there were few or none at that time
‘in reserve.

267. On return to Singapore I circulated a
letter on Tactics. A copy of this letter is
attached as Appendix ‘‘ D’’ to this despatch.

SECTION XXXII.—TuHe Kuantan
OPERATIONS.

268. The Kuantan area was very isolated.
As already stated, it was over 100 miles,
through desolate jungle country, from Jerantut
on the east coast railway, and it was 160
miles from the Headquarters of the 9 Indian
Division at Raub. These are big distances
when there are no aircraft available for inter-
communication. _Its military importance lay
solely in the R.A.F. aerodrome, g miles.inland
from the town and on the other side of the
Kuantan River. .

Kuantan was garrisoned by the 22 Indian
Brigade Group under command of Brigadier
Painter.

269. Since the 9th December when the aero-
drome had been evacuated, Japanese aircraft
had been daily active over the Kuantan area,
reconnoitring, bombing and machine-gunning,
but little damage had been done. It appears
that the enemy had intended to make landings
on the coast of Trengganu but had been pre-
vented from doing so by his losses, especially of
landing craft, in the Kelantan operations.

Between the 2oth and 24th December our
long distance patrols were in contact with
Japanese troops moving southward in M.T. on
the coast of Trengganu. On the 27th the enemy
were engaged by our artillery near the Treng-
ganu / Pahang frontier.

270. It was now apparent that the threat
against the Kuantan area was developing from
the North, though it might still be accompanied
by a sea-borne landing. It will be recollected
that we had by that time had heavy losses of
material on the west coast and that our re-
serves had been depleted. We could not afford
to have further heavy losses. The situation
at Kuantan was particularly hazardous owing
to most of the material being east of the River
Kuantan which was crossed only by a single
ferry. In consequence of this and of the situa-
‘tion which was developing on the left flank in-
structions were issued to the Commander Kuantan
Force that he should concentrate the bulk of
his force, material and transport, west of the
River Kuantan, holding the area east of the
river with light mobile forces only.

271. This readjustment of the position was
going on when, on the morning of the 30th
December the Japanese advanced via the Jabor
Valley in greater strength than they had pre-
viously shown. They were engaged by our
artillery and small arms fire and confused fighting
continued throughout the day. The ferry,
which had been split into two working halves,
was bombed during the day and one half only
remained in action,

292. By the morning of the 31st December
the enemy were attacking the ferry, but a
bridgehead was maintained during the day.
