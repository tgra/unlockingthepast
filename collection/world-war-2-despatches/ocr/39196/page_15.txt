SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

troops, Bailey bridge sections flown in by
transport aircraft were available to mend the
broken thoroughfare.

99. Attacks on watercraft in Burma were
pressed home by ground-attack fighters of all
types throughout the campaign, particularly
along the Irrawaddy, always an important
Japanese line of communication, and also on
the Arakan coast and the waterways of south-
west Burma, though, as along the land routes
so on the waterways, the enemy moved mainly
by night. A rough estimate of the total number
of inland or coastal watercraft in enemy use
successfully attacked is 11,822 of which 302
were power-driven units. Towards the end
of the campaign, the Irrawaddy tended to
become less a line of communication for the
Japanese than a hindrance to their lateral
mobility, so that boats collected for ferrying
rather than supply craft provided the main
targets. At the same time, air reconnaissance
and attack was maintained at a high rate over
the Bassein-Henzada district in order to dis-
courage the enemy division located there from
moving eastwards to reinforce the main battle-
front in central Burma. In the course of April,
the motor launches supplying this garrison
formation were successfully attacked on a
number of occasions, notably on the 25th,
when their hiding-place south-west of Rangoon
was located and bombed and strafed with
rocket projectiles by a mixed force of twenty-
seven Beaufighters and Mosquitos.

100. A word must be added in connexion
with the patrols flown by Beaufighters to inter-
cept enemy shipping in the Gulf of Martaban.
Owing to the reduction through air attack of the
carrying capacity of the overland routes of
entry into Burma, the Japanese had increasing
resort during 1944 to the shipment of goods
northwards along the Tenasserim coast and
thence westwards across the Gulf of Martaban
to Rangoon, employing for this a number of
coasters of wooden construction eighty to one
hundred and twenty feet in length. A daily
patrol was maintained by Beaufighters, whose
base at Chiringa lay not far short of five
hundred miles distant from the Gulf at its
nearest point, and resulted in the sinking of
twenty-eight coasters, many of which were
destroyed at dawn or dusk soon before ships
reached or after they had left the nooks in
which they hid during the day.

101. Attacks by all types of aircraft likewise
continued, throughout the campaign, to be
directed against enemy bivouac and barrack
areas and against storage points from small
stacks of petrol drums near the front line to
the great dumps north of Rangoon mentioned
elsewhere in this despatch. Despite the un-
doubted accuracy of operations against this
type of target, more particularly by Lightnings,
Mosquitos and Mitchells, difficulties of terrain
often forbade the assessment of results, even
with the aid of photographs, and in default of
the subsequent occupation of the target area
by our own troops it has often only been a
reference in a Japanese diary or an intelligence
report which has arrived weeks or even months
later which served to clinch the evidence of
success. To take one instance out of many,
it was not until several weeks after the event
that the full success of the heavy raids of
8th February on targets at Yenangyaung was

1979

confirmed, when two prisoners of war agreed
that they had been most terrifying, and stated
that one bomb had destroyed thirty-four motor
vehicles parked under shelter, and that another
had landed in a trench in which some thirty
Japanese were sheltering, killing all the
occupants.

Tactical Support of 15 Corps.

102. Tactical support of 15 Corps followed
lines closely parallel to those on which air
support was furnished to the Fourteenth Army.
There were, however, certain special charac-
teristics which deserve mention. After the
initial advance down the Kaladan Valley, the
major forward moves of the ground forces
were marked not by overland offensives leading
to a break-through by mechanised formations,
but by a series of amphibious landings at half-
a-dozen points on the coast. Of the three
island landings, those on Akyab and Cheduba
were completely unopposed, while that on
Ramree met only with slight opposition; few
or no targets presented themselves and the air
support on these occasions was therefore akin
to a peace-time exercise. The mainland land-
ings each achieved tactical surprise, but were
all followed shortly by bitter fighting when the
enemy entrenched himself in characteristic
fashion and attempted to prevent the exploita-
tion of the initial landing. Fierce battles then
developed on the same general pattern as those
for the Irrawaddy bridgeheads.

103. Two developments confined to opera-
tions by 224 Group deserve mention. The first
was the use of Spitfires in the fighter-bomber
role. The second was the employment ,from
February onwards, of airborne Visual Control
Posts, whose success was undoubted. From a
light aircraft they were able to discern targets
in the coastal jungle that were well concealed
from ground observation, and so to pass
directions to the aircraft waiting to attack.
Two of these teams were operating by the end
of the campaign.

104. Indirect support of 15 Corps centred
largely around the maintenance of air attacks
upon the long supply line on which the
Japanese depended for the existence of their
troops in Arakan. Its forward end among the
coastal waterways and along the parallel road
southwards to Taungup was covered by ground-
attack fighters of all types, while the eastward
track from An to Minbu—whose existence had
been established by Beaufighters on recon-
naissance—and the mountain road from
Taungup to the railhead at Prome, also yielded
valuable targets, Stress was laid by the army
in March and April, 1945, upon the need for
maintaining a continuous interdiction of the
latter road by cratering its surface or pre-
cipitating landslides by bombing, even at the
cost of denying ourselves the future use of
a much needed supplementary land line of
communication to the Irrawaddy valley, and
fighter-bombers and also heavy bombers of
the Strategic Air Force were accordingly
diverted to this purpose. Targets along the
Prome-Rangoon railway were attacked as
elsewhere in central Burma; in this, the
destruction of its bridges by Lightnings of the
459th Squadron in February was especially
