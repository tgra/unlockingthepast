The folowing Despatch was submitted to the Secretary of State for War on 2and June, yy Lieutenant-General Sir ALAN BROOKE, K.C.B., D.S.O. Commanding IT Corps, British Expeditionary Force, France,

I have the honour to report that, in accordance with the Instructions of roth June, 1940, received by me from the Secretary of State for War, I duly left Southampton by shi ie at 1400 hours on 12th June, and reached Cherbourg at 2130 hours the same evening.

For reasons connected with local French orders, it was not possible to disembark until 0030 hours on 13th June, when Brigadier G. Thorpe (Base Commandant) came out to the ay in a tug and took me ashore with my staff,

2. At o800 hours 13th June I left Cherbourg

car, and reached Le Mans at 1400 hours

bt a journey much hampered by the crowds of refugees on the roads.

There I was met by Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Karslake, Major-General P. de Fonblanque, G.O.C., Lines of Communication Troops, and Brigadier j. G. des R. Swayne. I at once took command of all British troops in France from General Karslake. I instructed him to return to England, which he did by plane that afternoon.

3. At 1500 hours I left Le Mans with Brigadier Swayne for an interview with General Weygand and, after a journey of some 170 miles, reached the Headquarters of No. 1 Mission* (Major-General Sir Richard Howard-Vyse) at 2000 hours that evenin

4. I had left my staff at Le Mans to get in touch with the situation as it was known by General Karslake and Major-General de Fonblanque The general inference of the enemy's intention seemed to be that, after crossing the Seine south of Rouen, the bulk of the troops engaged would move South in order to encircle Paris.

The situation on the front that evening, so far as it was known, was that the Tenth French Army, which included the 157th Infantry Brigade of the 52nd Division, Armoured Division (less one Brigade) and Beauman Force*, was holding a line from the sea  West of the Seine to Neubourg and thence to Conches. Between the Southern flank of the 157th Infantry Brigade and Damville, there was a gap of some 8 miles, which was only lightly held by elements of the 3rd D.L.M. South of this area the Army of Paris was supposed to be holding a hne from Drevx to Bonnecourt on the Seine, but there was no confirmation that this Army was aciually in

5. At 0830 hours I saw General Weygand. He spoke most frankly and explained the situation to me. He said that the French Army was no longer capable of organised resistance, that it had now broken up into four groups
