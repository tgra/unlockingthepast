Capture of Naples and Foggia.

The first phase of this plan was already prac-
tically completed when I wrote and, after the
pause, we proceeded with the second phase.
-Fifth Army had a hard struggle for the passes
leading down into the plain of Naples but by
28th September ro Corps was through and the
King’s Dragoon Guards entered the great city
at 0930 hours on 1st October. Eighth Army's
principal objective, - Foggia and its airfields,
had fallen four days before on the 27th. On
Doth fronts the pursuit went on, but it was
slower now. On 6th October Fifth Army stood
along the line of the Volturno River and
realised that it would have to force a crossing
against strong resistance; Eighth Army had also
left behind the early days of rapid advance
across the open country of Apulia and the line
ran clear across Italy through the mountains
from Termoli to Benevento and Capua and
down to the Tyrrhenian at Castel Volturno. My
_plan had been based on the German intention
to withdraw to the Pisa-Rimini line and that
intention had now been revoked on the highest
authority; but before proceeding to discuss the
effect of this new situation I must pause to des-
cribe the problems of administration which
now faced us.

Administrative Problems.*

The most serious and most urgent problem
was the imminent danger of the complete break-
down of the maintenance of Eighth Army. This
situation, though no doubt it should in theory
never be allowed to occur, did not reflect any
diseredit on anyone but was the result of 4
deliberate decision to accept an administrative
tisk for the sake of urgent and vital operational
advantage. It would obviously be absutd at
such a time, to sit down and do nothing until
our administrative resources and plans were
perfect, nor was there any simple solution avail-
able, for we had rightly decided not to create
a proper base in Sicily and were therefore still
based on North Africa and Middle East and, to
a certain and increasing extent, directly on the
United Kingdom and United States. It would
have been equally absurd to confine our opera-

‘tions to Calabria until we could build up a
cast-iron administrative backing. The early
days of the landings had gone smoothly
enough; the small ports of Reggio, San Venere
and Cotrone were put into use for the main-
. tenance of the forces in Calabria and although
the initial maintenance of the hastily planned
operations at Taranto was not entirely satis-
factory this was natural enough in the cir-
cumstances.t The administrative staffs were
@ little surprised to get their first positive con-
firmation of the operation simultaneously with
the news of the landing but were soon mollified
by reflecting on the importance of the speedy
capture of Taranto and Brindisi undamaged;
indeed this was of vital importance in averting
_ the threatened breakdown. It was when I
began to be worried about the situation at
‘Salerno that I ordered General Montgomery to
+ push ahead at all risks and he complied in
spite of the warnings of his staff that so rapid
an advance would risk a complete administra-
itive breakdown. Hardly was the danger to

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

Fifth Army averted whem the expected diffi-
culties materialized and Eighth Army found
itself with virtually no reserves at all.

Taranto and Brindisi, however, were now
available so that if our administrative tail could
be switched from the Toe to the Heel there
would be the considerable advantage of a
shorter line of communication and better roads
and ports, and even railways, with which to
operate. On the other hand to carry out this
switch and at the same time continue to support
the Army in its operations was an extraordin-
arily difficult task amd placed a tremendous
strain on the very limited resources avail-
able. It was a great achievement and
it took the rest of the month of Septem-
ber before the situation could be said to
be stabilized again, though even then it
was far from satisfactory. On the 29th
General Montgomery informed me that when
he had reached a line from Termoli through
Campobasso to Vinchiaturo he would have te
pause for ten or fourteen days as he had abso-
lutely no reserve stocks. Our administrative
machinery had been overdriven and could not
sustain any more shocks for the moment; as
I told the Chief of the Imperial General Stalf*
in a signal on the 30th ‘‘ Men can go hungry
but a truck just won't ’”’.

Eighth Army were thus rather breathless after
their splendid gallop through Calabria, Lucania
and Apulia; Fifth Army had had sterner
fighting ‘but their maintenance position was
much easier, for they could use the ports and
beaches at Salerno and Torre Annunziata,
which were close behind their front line, and
would shortly be able to bring Naples into
use. At first sight this looked a disheartening
problem. The port had been most thoroughly
blocked and all the port facilities—cranes,
quays, lighters, etc.—destroyed. Ships of all
sizes, including ten thousand ton cruisers,
hospital ships and two large liners, had been
sunk alongside nearly all the quays and in the
fairway inside the moles. In all, some three
hundred lighters, the total number available
in the port, and all the tugs and small craft
had been sunk at their berths. I need hardly
mention that mines and booby traps were cun-
ingly dispersed everywhere from the harbour
gates to the water’s edge. But we had had
fair experience in opening demolished ports and_
by the second week in October the discharge
capacity was already reaching five thousand
tons per day. This was a splendid effort and
entirely removed any apprehension as to Fifth
Army’s maintenance. .

_ Our next problem, now we were firmly estab-
lished in Italy, was the rate at which we could
reinforce or, in the universally accepted expres-
sion of this war, our ‘‘ build-up’. We were
definitely inferior in numbers to the Germans
and their land communications would enable
them to reinforce much faster than us. The
solution of the problem depended on avail-
ability of formations’ and shipping to move
them. The former consideration was not likely
to influence the situation before 1944 since,
although the number of formations in the
Mediterranean was in fact limited, and althongh
the majority of these were deficient in one way
or another and would therefore only become
available for operations with a varying degree
