protected by the patriot leaders, Dedjasmatches
igasha and Nagash, who had received about
1,000 rifles from us.

Armacheho-Begemeder,

Excluding the forces gathered at Metemma to
meet our offensive there, the enemy had one
Colonial Brigade, twelve Blackshirt battalions
and two Cavalry Groups in the area,

We had Major Arthur Bentinck of Mission
Zor, accompanied by the Emperor’s representa-
tive, Tsahafi Taezaz Haile, as a result of whose
efforts only one chief, Gerasmatch Redda of
Chelga, took armed action against the Italians.
In addition Captain Foley, R.E., was operating
on the Gondar-Metemma road with a small
band and supply of explosives.

Watkait.

The enemy had three Colonial battalions and
one Blackshirt battalion in the area.

We had no representative but had armed two
chiefs, Dedjasmatch Adane and Fitaurari
Misfin, who caused the Italians a certain amount
of trouble.

Shoa and Wollo,

We had no communication with these areas,
which contained some important patriot leaders,
Ras Ababa Aragai, Fitauraris Gerasu Duke
and Shakka Bakale. “

The Plan.

One convoy had reached Mission ror in the
Gojjam since its departure from the Sudan in
August, 1940. The R.A.F. based on the Sudan
had begun deep raiding on Dangila, Bahrdar
Giyorgis and Enjabara. This had stirred the
Patriots to some activity of a minor nature, and
the Italians to counter-activity, raids and cross-
country marches. Some of the irregular Banda
leaders on the escarpment of Gojjam were think-
ing of transferring their allegiance to the Em-
peror. The Italian command, anxious about the
potential threat in Gojjam, appointed their most
distinguished colonial commander, General
Nasi, to the new Western Command, which
included the three first zones mentioned above.
They fnrther agreed (on a financial considera-
finn with the hereditary leader of Gojjam,
Ras Hailu Tekla Haimanot, that he should re-
turn to the province, and by their concentrations
at Metemma and in Beni Shangul were clearly
hoping to forbid our arms traffic into Gojjam,
limited though that was by the lack of animal
transport and the poverty of our own resources.

In November, following the visit of the
Secretary of State for War (Mr, Anthony Eden),
a new G(R) staff for the rebellion was
appointed in Khartoum. Major O. (:, Wingate,
D.S.O., took charge of operations. They were
given considerable resources in finance and
weapons, and the first step in the forward policy
now initiated was a flight on zoth November by
Major Wingate to Colonel Sandford’s Head-
quarters in central Gojjam, where the principles
of the forthcoming offensive were discussed.

At this and later conferences the following
plan of action was evolved.

The Emperor Haile Selassie, with his body-
guard, was to enter Ethiopia as soon as possible

and to make his first camp on the massif of.-

Belaya, a patriot area detached from the escarp-

ment and lying go miles north-west of Burye.
For this purpose, one company of the recently

formed Sudan Frontier Battalion was to

occupy Belaya, and later was to be followed
by three of the remaining companies. .

1 Ethiopian Battalion, which had just
begun its training in Khartoum, was to be dis-
tributed into Operational Centres under British
Officers and N.C.Os., and these were to march
into Gojjam via Belaya and attach themselves
to various patriot chiefs.

2 Ethiopian Battalion and 4 Eritrean
Battalion were to be brought from Kenya to
form the nucleus of the Emperor’s Bodyguard,
which would, however, have a fighting role.

. Further members of the Bodyguard were to
be found by Colonel Sandford in Gojjam and
sent to Belaya for training.

Up to 25,000 camels were to be raised in the
Sudan to transport the necessities for a nine
months’ campaign as far as the escarpment.

Colonel Sandford was to raise up to 3,000
mules in Gojjam for the escarpment haul.

The supply of arms and ammunition to the
quarrelsome and ineffective chiefs north of
Gojjam was to cease, but the section of Mission
IoI was to remain there to keep the population
sweet with money and food. ;

The ultimate object of this plan was to seize
an Italian stronghold in Gojjam, preferably
Dangila, instal the Emperor nearby, and from
this centre to widen the area of revolt and
desertion.

For the rest of 1940 and until 2oth January,
1941, work to put the plan into operation went
steadily ahead. 2 Ethiopian Battalion
arrived in the Sudan from Kenya and began
its training, though 4 Eritrean Battalion arrived
too late to participate in warlike activity. Three
Operational Centres were formed and zoth
January, one had already gone forward. By
the same date four companies of the Sudan
Frontier Battalion, who were to be the spear-
head of the movement, reached of were march-
ing for Belaya, at whose foot an aerodrome was
nearing completion. Thousands of camels with
volunteer drivers had been collected from all
over the Sudan, and were on the move to’
Belaya. Difficulties, however, were experienced
in getting the Abyssinian end of the scheme to
keep pace with the Sudanese, It was found that
the patriot chiefs did not take kindly to the
idea of releasing men from their own forces
and so weakening themselves in order to in-
crease the Imperial Bodyguard: They were
also very slow in collecting mules. In the end
it was found necessary to drive the camel
transport up the escarpment into Gojjam, and
this, in combination with the arduous approach
over lava ‘soil to Belaya, was responsible for
the large animal mortality (12,000 out of
15,000 camels) of the Gojjam campaign. First
attempts to break a route for M.T. to Belaya
failed.

Meanwhile the R.A.F. continued to drop
bombs and propaganda on the Gojjam strong-
holds, and included Burye and the main
frontier Banda posts of Guba and Wanbera
in their programme. Exploiting the rout of
Colonel Rolle’s Banda in October, we armed
the negroid Gumz people near Guba, and
this, associated with the intensification of our

ropaganda and a series of heavy air attacks,
led to the panic abandonment of Guba in. the
first days of January. This constituted the
first Italian territorial loss in the campaign,
and, by removing the threat to our lines of
communication from the south, greatly simpli-
fied our penetration of Gojjam.
