Effect in the N.EJI. of Japanese Capture of
Singapore and Sumaira. =" Bor,
485. On 8th February the Japanese secured
a foothold on Singapore Island and within a
couple of days its imminent capitulation became
evident.

486. On 14th February they attacked and
overran South Sumatra, admittedly at heavy
cost. The British forces, mainly air units, had
to withdraw to Java.

487. Between r2th and 18th February large
numbers of personnel, evacuated from Singa-
pore and Sumatra, arrived in considerable con-
fusion in Western Java: amongst them were
approximately 10,000 R.A.F. of all ranks.
They augmented considerable numbers of
refugees who had preceded them in a steadily
growing stream from the same places and from
other N.E.I, Islands.

488. At this time, mid-February, Abdacom
was still established in Bandoeng, reinforce-
ments were arriving and more were expected.
Nevertheless it was evident now that Java
would be attacked in the near future. A
civilan exodus from Java on a grand scale
replaced the small stream which had been leav-
ing for some time through Sourabaya and
Batavia.

Congestion in Batavia,

489. At Batavia the exodus became confused
with incoming reinforcements and evacuees
from Singapore and Sumatra. For several
days the harbour of Batavia, and the roadstead
outside, were congested with shipping. This
unloaded as best it could. The result was that
quays, warehouses and the roads leading from
them rapidly became blocked with an inextric-
able confusion of merchandise, equipment,
M.T., abandoned cars and goods of every de-
scription. The town of Batavia became con-
gested with personnel—outgoing refugees, in-
coming reinforcements, incoming evacuees and
Dutch treops mobilised for defence of the
locality. ‘

490, Into this confused area the R.A.F.
‘evacuated from Singapore and Sumatra,
arrived, for the most part between 12th and
18th February.

491. Those from Singapore had embarked
there under heavy air attack on shipping of all
kinds as it came to hand, and amongst a num-
ber of civilian refugees. Units had become
much mixed, many personnel were separated
from units and many had become separated
from thet equipment. It had proved im-
practicable to embark much equipment owing
to conditions at Singapore docks, and some cf
what had been embarked had been lost at sea
through enemy action.

492. Units from Sumatra had also suffered
loss of their equipment by reason of the hasty
withdrawal from aerodromes near Palembang,
and still more so by circumstances at the port
in South Sumatra, Oesthaven, at which they
chad embarked: such small amount of equip-
ment as they had possessed in Sumatra, and
which they had succeeded in removing to Oest-
haven, could not be embarked and brought
-with them (para. 476).

493. An appreciable number of bombers and
fighters had, however, reached aerodromes ‘in
the Batavia district, though a high proportion
of them were unfit for operations. ‘

494. Such was the situation in Batavia on
z6th February. It was from personnel and
equipment so placed that a maximum air fight-
ing strength with ancillary services had to be
evolved, and surpluses evacuated from Java.
Twelve days were destined to be available for
this work before the Japanese landed in Java.

RA.F. RE-ORGANISATION IN JAVA.
Situation on 16th February.

495. On the 16th February, the date of the
evacuation of Sumatra, the position in Java
was as follows:—

(a) H.Q. Westgroup (A.0.C.—A.V.M.
P.C, Maltby)—A.O.C. and a nucleus staff
had arrived at Soekaboem: on 14th February
and were organising a H.Q. there; this was
still known as ‘Westgroup. Soekaboemi was
chosen because it is centrally located in
‘Western Java, where all Westgroup units
were being located. Westgroup assumed ad-
munistrative responsibilty for its units on
i6th February. As it was not yet ready to
take operational control, this was retained by
Abdair, which had assumed it on 7th
February whilst units were still operating in
Sumatra (para. 448).

(0) No, 205 (F.B.) Squadron—(Wing
Commander Councell in Command) had
arrived in Batavia on Ist February and was
operating as part of the Aled Reconnaissance
Group (Recgroup), using anchorages at
Batavia and Oesthaven.

(c) Nos 36 and 100 (T.B.) Squadrons—
(Squadron Leader Wilkins in Command).
Aircraft had arrived on 29/30th January
from Singapore for re-organisation. After
being based on various aerodromes they
were rejoined by their ground personnel on
15th February at Tjikampek.

(ad) No. 153 M.U.—(G/Capt. Ridgway in
command) had arrived in Java on the gth
January and moved to Djocjacarta, where
it was ready to start work on 15th January.

(e) No. 152 M.U —(Squadron Leader
S. G. Aylwin in command) had arrived in
Batavia on 14th February and moved on the
17th to Poerbolinggo to form a transit store.

(f) R.A.F. Base, Batavia (Group Captain
Ridgway in command until 18th February
1942 when Air Commodore Silly reheved
him). This base had been established in
Batavia on the 24th January to organise the
reception, sorting and despatch of personnel
arriving by sea from Singapore and Sumatra
and of air reinforcements from the Middle
East and the United Kingdom. It also organ-
ised the reception and erecting of a number
of boxed Hurricanes. By 18th February this

‘base was administering 5 transit camps in

Batavia ‘and one at Buitenzorg. Personnel

of all other units not mentioned in (a) to (e)

above passed through this base for re-

organisation and disposal, a total of over

12,000 being handled. .

(g) Certain A.M.E. Units were installing
radar facilities in the Batavia and Sourabaya
areas. .

(hk) Thirty-nine crated Hurricanes had
been erected in Batavia during the first ten
days of February. Seventeen had pro-
ceeded to No. 266 (F) Wing in Sumatra,
where a number of them were lost. Twelve
were handed over ‘by Abdair to the Dutch
