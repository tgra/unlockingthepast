30. My intentions at this tine and throughout the ensuing chase were as follows: ._

(i) To drive off the enemy from any position from which he could attack the convoy.

(ii) To accept some risk to the convoy providing there was a reasonable. prospect of sinking one or more of the enemy battleships.

To achieve. (ii) I considered the following conditions must be fulfilled:  :

(a) A reduction of speed of the enemy to

20 knots or less by T/B attack.

. ({b) Engagement of enemy. battleships

by RENOWN and RAMILLIES in con-

cert.,

3x. At 1207 RENOWN was reported as having  a hot bearing on one shaft. Revolutions on this shaft had to be reduced. This, combined with a dirty  bottom and paravanes, limited her speed to 273 knots.

32. At the same time as this report  was. received puffs of smoke were observed on the horizon bearing 006  and cruisers in the van * sighted masts and ships. petwcgtt the bearings of 346  and 096 .

33. At 1213 ARK ROYAL's signal timed 1147 was received reporting the composition of the enemy as 2 battleships and 6 cruisers accompanied by destroyers. This however did not disprove the Sunderland's information that a further group of 6 cruisers and  destroyers was still further to the Westward.

34. By this time: our -cruisers were concentrated in the van and  had formed a line of bearing 075 255 , in sequence from  West to East, SHEEFIELD, SOUTHAMPTON, NEWCASTLE, MANCHESTER and BERWICK. NEWCASTLE could not maintain the speed of the remainder and never quite reached her ordered station.

35. At 1158 BERWICK signalled that as his speed was limited to 27 knots he proposed to  jon RENOWN. Vice Admiral Commanding, r8th Cruiser  Squadron ordered BERWICK to join him but by that time the BERWICK had already.turned to implement his proposal and consequently lost ground. BERWICK, took station on the Starboard bow of MANCHESTER but owing to lack of speed dropped back during the action.

36. During. the approach the 9 destroyers in company. (three  being. detachable with the convoy and two with ARK ROYAL) were moving up to a position 5 miles 040  from RENOWN. This position was selected so that they would-  be available to counter attack any destroyers attempting to launch an attack on RENOWN or RAMILLIES.

37. The situation as -seen ee the cruisers immediately before the action commenced was as, follows: 

(i) 3 enemy, cruisers and some destroyers  hereafter teferred to as the Western group  were visible  between the bearings of approximately 340  and 350 , at a range of about

_ Iz miles hull down and steering a Northerly course.

(ii) A second group Of cruisers also accompanied by destroyers hereafter referred to as the Eastern- group to the right of the  Western group, were farther away  and steering approximately r00 



Evidence as to the movements of the Western group immediately before action was joined is conflicting. -It appears probable however that the. Western group was in line ahead on a

 Southerly course until 1210 when they turned

together to a Northerly course. Between 1210 and 1220 further alterations of course may have been made, as, when -first observed from RENOWN they appeared to have a fairly broad inclination to the Eastwards.

The Action.

38. At 1220 the enemy opened fire and immediately afterwards our advanced forces replied. The enemiy's first salvo fell close to MANCHESTER being exact for range but a hundred yards out for line. |

39. At 1223 I informed. Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, that I was engaging the enemy.

40. Immediately fire was opened by our advanced forces on ships of the  Western group, they made smoke and retired on courses varying between N.W. and N.E. Behind  their smoke screen -they appeared to make large and;

frequent alterations of course becoming visible .

at intervals sometimes almost end on, and sometimes at quite a broad inclination remaining in sight for a few minutes before again becoming lost in their smoke.

41. Just before opening fire at the Western group, who were already wreathed in smoke, RENOWN sighted two ships, .who were not making smoke, at extreme visibility, bearing

o20 .. It was thought at the time that these might be the enemy battleships but they later proved to-be cruisers of the Eastern group.

42. At 1224 RENOWN opened fire at the right hand ship of the  Western group at a mean range of 26,500 yards. Six salvos were fired before the latter was lost in smoke.

43. At 1226, RAMILLIES fired  two  en

at maximum elevation to test the range. Thereafter RAMILLIES proceeding at 20.7 knots  dropped astern and followed in the wake of RENOWN throughout the action.

44. When. RENOWN's   iarget became obscured, course was altered to Starboard to close the supposed battleships and to bring the Western group of cruisers  broader on the bow. Shortly afterwards two salvos were fired  at a

 fleeting glimpse of the centre cruiser of the

Western group.

45. Course was  then further altered to Star-

board to open  A  arcs* on-the left hand ship of the Western group which now bore 356 . ight salvos were fired at her when she next appeared, but at 1245 she too was lost to sight in smoke.

  46. During this time. our cruisers had  been

hotly engaged with the  Western group at ranges _

varying betwe n 23,000 and 16,000 yards. Many straddles were obtained  but smoke r en-

dered spotting  and observation generally  #1 ex-

tremely difficult. i

47. MANCHESTER, SHEFFIELD and NEWCASTLE all opened fire initially on the right hand ship of .the Western group,

Admiralty footnote: 

 A  arcs the arcs on which ali guns of a ship's main: armament will bear, thus allowing them to. fire simultaneously at the enemy.
