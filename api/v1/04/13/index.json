My troops had been \u2018embarked for a peaceful landing at a friendly and organized port and could not be ready for active operations for .some days. I decided therefore to disembark the Force at Harstad and to establish my base cthere also in the first instance."

After the fall of Addis Abeba I felt my best chance of a speedy liquidation of the enemy in the south was to advance on Gimma,. the seat of Government for Iea, and I com- menced operations to this end. Before these had developed I received a message from the C.-in-C. to the effect that it was essential that the road from Addis Abeba north to Asmara should be opened as soon as possible so as to. allow passage of troops to Egypt via Massawa. or Port Sudan, and he wished me to attack Dessie which was 250 miles north of Addis Abeba. I therefore instructed Commander r1ths (A) Division to undertake this task with Ist S.A. Brigade Group with the idea that they should fight their way northwards and even-- tually embark from Massawa or Port Sudan for Egypt. This Brigade Group commenced: their advance from Addis Abeba on 13th April. I informed C.-in-C. Middle East that I felt I could not-clear the road northwards of Dessie with my own resources, and asked that the Sudan forces should attack Amba Alagi which: wad the only important remaining defended. position on the road. In due course I received notification that the Sudan Forces would carry out this attack but not until 3rd May."

Enemy pressure on the Burma Division south of Magwe continued on the 13th and xr4th and this caused a wide gap to. be opened between the two Divisions. Moving across country the enemy pushed into this gap threatening the oilfields. Orders for the destruction of the Yenangyaung oilfields were issued on th\u00e9 night of the r4th April and the denial scheme was successfully carried out during the following 48 hours. It required two full daylights to complete the destruction end- ing with the blowing of the power house, which took place when the Japanese were already in the outskirts of Yenangyaung."
