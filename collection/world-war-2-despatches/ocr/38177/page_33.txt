‘SUPPLEMENT to THz LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 1948

. this commimications with the 13th Corps had
broken down, General Ritchie well knew that
its situation ‘was critical and ordered the brigade
to move forward when he keard that it-had
halted. It broke leaguer at night and moved
on, By the evening of the 29th, Point 175
was in sight when Brigadier Pienaar found that
‘his rendezvous was strongly held by the enemy.
The wireless set of a South African armoured

‘car which had reached General Freyberg’s
headquarters broke down at the crucial
‘moment, and Brigadier Pienaar postponed
further advance until daylight when he could
‘see what was happening. By midday on the
30th November wireless touch with the New
Zealand Division was restored, and General
Norrie, who had stayed with the South
Africans, arranged with General Freyberg for
them to attack Point 175 from the east. The
advance proceeded slowly and there was a long
pause when the brigade reached the escarp-
ment east of Point 175. Finally a moonlight
attack was staged. But the position was strong
and well supported by tanks, so that at dawn
on ‘the ist December the South Africans were
still 3,000 yards short of their objective, and
spent the whole day attempting to take the
position. ,
- Belhamed fell early on the rst December
before a heavy attack launched by enemy tanks
and infantry from Sidi Rezegh. The qth
Armoured Brigade rushed from its leaguer
some miles south of Point 175, but arrived in
time only to cover the retirement of the New
Zealand Division to Zafraan.

As the New Zealand Division had had
extremely heavy casualties and was now in
danger of becoming entirely cut off, General
Norrie gave the order for them to withdraw.
Having repulsed further attacks on Zafraan
during the day, they withdrew during the night
with the survivors of the st Army Tank
Brigade, the partner of their successes, and
reached the frontier in the early hours of
the 2nd December, exhausted but in good heart.
At the same time the rst South African Infantry
Brigade was ordered to abandon the attempt to
recapture Point 175. During the night they
retired southwards to Taieb el Essem, leaving
a rearguard to mask Point 175 until the New
Zealanders had passed in safety.

Tobruk was once more isolated, with a
greater commitment than before and smaller
resources. The length of front to be held had
been increased from twenty-seven miles to
forty-four. Two New Zealand battalions had
been cut off from their division on Ed Duda,
but this hardly offset the heavy losses the garri-
son had suffered. The tank strength was now
only twenty runners.: It is not to be wondered
at that the Corps Commander should have
asked leave, if need be, to withdraw to the
original perimeter. General Ritchie gave his
permission, but pointed out that the garrison
would make a valuable contribution to the suc-
cess of the offensive if they could hold the
salient. It reflects high credit on’ the garrison
that the Fortress Commander could decline the
idea and that they, far from yielding any
ground, were ready within a short time to carry
out a further advance.

Preparations for Attacking El Adem.

Judging that the igsue of the battle for Tobruk
still lay in the balance and wishing to be at
hand in case a decision should be required: of

me as Commander-in-Chief, on the rst Decem-
ber I flew to join General Ritchie at his ‘ad-
vanced headquarters near Maddalena. I re-
mained there for the next’ ten days, but

-naturally left the direction of the Eighth Army

entirely in General Ritchie’s hands.

General Ritchie was already making plans
for restoring the momentum of the offensive,
undeterred by the loss of: the positions which
the New Zealand Division so gallantly won
and defended, or by the renewed isolation of
Tobruk, On the day I arrived he visited by
air the headquarters of the 13th Corps in Tob-
tuk, and also the headquarters of the 30th
Corps to concert his plans. It was his firm
conviction—and I agreed with him—that the
enemy was hard pressed and would be defeated
if we continued to give him no rest.

The Eighth Army itself had sustained heavy
blows and was in need of reinforcement. I had
already given instructions for an armoured car
regiment from Syria and the 150th Infantry
Brigade from Cyprus to move to the Western
Desert, and I formed three hitherto unbrigaded
Indian battalions into the 38th Indian Infantry
Brigade and sent it forward to guard the
Eighth Army’s rearward communications. The
convoy bringing the Ist Armoured Division from
the United Kingdom had just’ arrived, and I
arranged for.the divisional armoured car regi-
ment fo join the Eighth Army at once. The
remainder of the division was to move forward
by regiments and undergo intensive training just
east of the frontier under command of the
Eighth Army. .

By regrouping his forces General Ritchie was
able to release fresh troops. He had already
drawn the 11th Indian Infantry Brigade into
reserve near Maddalena and furnished it with

‘ transport, and he now arranged for the and

South African Division to relieve.the other two
brigades of the 4th Indian Division.
