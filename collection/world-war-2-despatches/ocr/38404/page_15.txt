SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 16 SEPTEMBER, 1948

160. Factories distilling alcohol and a num-
ber of other targets on land were also attacked
in November by fighter-bombers with fighter
escort. The fighter-bombers, which attacked
from heights below 5,000 feet, suffered rather
heavy losses from A A fire in these operations
and also in some of their attacks on shipping.
In the past the Blenheim bombers used by
No 2 Group for these ‘‘ shipping strikes ”’
had come up against the same difficulty, despite
attempts by accompanying fighters to silence
the German, gunners by attacks with cannon
and machine-guns.

16r. Meanwhile, on 21st October, I carried
the reduction in the scale of the ‘‘ Circus ”’
offensive a stage further by imposing on No. 11
Group, as the,Group principally concerned, a
limit of six such operations a month.

162 In practice there was” only one
“Circus ’’ after this date © This was carried
out on 8th November in “conjunction with a
high-level fighter sweep and a low-level attack
by fighters and fighter-bombers on an alcohol
distillation plant. An unexpectedly high wind
added to the difficulties of the undertaking,
which resulted in the loss of sixteen fighter air-
craft and thirteen pilots. Later in the day
another aircraft and its pilot were lost in the
course of a fighter sweep.

163. Although not by any means disastrous,
losses on this scale were unwelcome m view

of the shortage of aircraft that was expected.

to make itself felt during the next few months.
I therefore decided to restrict No 12 Group to
three ‘‘ Circus ’’ operations a month in future
instead of six.

164. A few days later the Air Ministry in-
formed me that the War Cabinet had called
attention to the’ desirabilty of conserving re-
sources in order to build up strong forces by the
Spring of 1942. Since the wording of the letter
in which the Air Munistry conveyed this in-
formation made it clear that no risks must be
taken by pressmg attacks in unfavourable
weather, I now imposed a still more stringent
limitation on the Air Officer Commanding
No. «ir Group, who was asked to
undertake no more “‘ Circus ’’ operations with-
out reference to me

165 The outbreak of War between the
United States of America and Japan in
December provided still further grounds for
conservation, since it was clear that the supply
of aircraft from America was likely to cease
or at least be greatly reduced for some time to
come. Consequently the constant drain im-
posed by even minor operations could no longer
be afforded.

166. In point of fact, wintry weather was
already upon us, and after 8th November no
more ‘‘ Circus ’’ operations were carried out.
The intensity of our other offensive operations
was also substantially reduced as the year drew
to its close.

167. A word must be said here about some
of the special offensive operations, outside the
normal ‘‘Circus’’, anti-shipping, fighter-
sweep and ‘‘ Rhubarb ’’ categories, in which
the Command participated between 14th June
and the end of 1941.

168. Reference has already been made to
Bombev Cofpfpand’s attack on the German
warships at Brest and La Pallice on 24th July.

5029 __

In connection with this operation six squadrons
of fighters from No. 11 Group provided escort
for two diversionary attacks on Cherbourg and
another fourteen took part in a “ Circus’
against Hazebrouck, while the equivalent of
nine squadrons from No. 10 Group gave
support over Brest and the Western end of the
English Channel. Since only five squadrons of
single-seater fighters with long-range tanks were
available, the degree of support that could be
given over Brest was necessarily disproportion-
ate to the size of the bomber force, which
suffered accordingly.

169. On rath August a force of 54 Blenheims
of Bomber Command attacked two Power
Stations at Cologne in dayhght. A squadron
of Whirlwinds accompanied them on the first
135 mules of their outward journey, and on their
return journey a wing of long-range Spitfires
met them near the Dutch Coast, while another
Spitfire wmg made a sweep over Flushing in
support. Two ‘‘Circus’’ operations over
France by a total of nineteen fighter squadrons
and twelve Hampdens of Bomber Command
were carried out as diversions. Eleven aircraft
of the bomber force despatched against the
Power Stations were lost, but Bomber
Command expressed themselves as well satisfied
with the results achieved. In the light of our
subsequent knowledge of the enemy’s system
of deploying and controlling fighters at that
time, 1f now appears unlikely that diversions
so far from the scene of the main attacks could
have had any effect on the opposition in that
area.

r70. On 18th December and again on 30th
December, Bomber (Command made further
attacks on the German warships at Brest.
Fighter support was provided by ten and nine
squadrons of the Command respectively. As
before, the results were satisfactory from the
fighter aspect, but once again the bombers
suffered substantial losses.

(iii) Results Achieved by the Offensive.

171. It would be unwise to attach too much
importance to statistics showing the claims
made and losses suffered by our fighters month-
by-month throughout the offensive,

172. The experience of two wars shows that
in large-scale offensive operations the claims to
the destruction of enemy aircraft made by
pilots, however honestly made and carefully
scrutinized, are a most inaccurate guide to the
true situation. Moreover, the results achieved
by an offensive can rarely be judged by a
mere statistical comparison of casualties suffered
and inflicted. Except when an operation has
been launched purely for the purpose of pro-
curing the attrition of the opposing force, a
broader view than this must be taken of the
strategic purpose and the extent to which it
has been achieved.

173. In the present case the original object
was td wrest the initiative from the enemy for
the sake of the great moral and tactical ad-
vantages bestowed by its possession. -Later the
Command was entrusted with the task of co-,
operating with Bomber and Coastal Commands
in order, first to prevent the enemy from with-
drawing any more flying units from the Western
Front after the middle of June, and secondly
to induce him to réturn some of the units
already withdrawn by that time These may be
