primarily to assist the Civil Police. They were
not incorporated in the military organization
but came directly under the Civil Government.

gi: Labour.—The question of the conscrip-
tion of labour in time of war had been con-
sidered and, in accordance with the advice of
‘those best acquainted with labour conditions in
Malaya, rejected as unworkable The ques-
tion of the control of labour in time of war
had, however, been the subject of frequent dis-
cussions and tentative schemes had been worked
out.

Although the grave labour problems which
developed aftcr the outbreak of hostilities had
admittedly not been fully foreseen, some of the
trouble could in my opinion have been avoided
had the problems of war-time control of civil
labour been tackled more energetically in time
of peace.

The Singapore Harbour Board and the
Municipality, independent bodies operating in
co-operation with the Government and carrying
out its policy, had their own labour forces.

92. Passive Airy Defence—The steps taken
by the Civil Government as regards reserve
stocks of essential commodities, medical ser-
vices etc. have already been described in Sec-
tion TX. The general organization of Passive
Air Defence was based on the Home organiza-
lion. Warning sirens were installed at all the
main centres and the P.A D. organizations in-
cluded First Aid and Salvage detachments,
Medical Auxiliary Services, Fire Services etc.
As a tule the detachments were led by Euro-
peans, the members being composed of both
Europeans and Asiatics.

A few blast walls to important buildings were
built. Only very few air raid shelters were con-
structed for the civil population. As regards
Singapore itself this was partly due to the diffi-
culty of constructing underground shelters, and
partly due to the advice of the civil medical
authorities, who were of the opinion that to
obstruct the circulation of air by building sur-
face shelters in the streets might well lead to
epidemics A number of slit trenches had been
dug but these soon became waterlogged and
bred mosquitoes.

In Singapore the general policy was to rely
rather on dispersal to camps constructed out-
side the town area. Apart from members of
the Fighting Services gas masks were provided
only for those persons, such as members of
salvage squads, whose duties might compel them
to work in gassed areas. This decision was
made by the War Committee after consultation
with gas experts, on the grounds that the danger
from gas bombing was not great in the climatic
conditions of Malaya.

Generally speaking, it may be said that the
arrangements for Passive Air Defence were in
1941 on too small a scale and inadequate to
deal with anything but sporadic air raids
Realising this, arrangements were made in
October and November of that year for a series
of lectures to be given at the main centres of
Malaya by Brigadier I. Simson, the Chief
Engineer Malaya Command, who had recently
had experience of Passive Air Defence both in
London and in Scotland These lectures were
‘attended by both military and civil officials, but
there was little time before war broke out for
the instruction given in them to be put into
effect. °

93. Evacuations.—Careful plans were
worked out jointly by the military and civil
authorities for the evacuation, in case of need,
of the civil population from the South Coast
of Singapore Island and from other exposed
areas. Some areas in East Johore were actually
cleared of civilians before war broke ont.

94. Hospitality.—The civil population, fol-
lowing the example set by the Governor and
High Commissioner, were generous in their
hospitality to the troops. Clubs were built,
equipped and operated by civilians for their
benefit. Many civilians invited troops to their
houses and entertained them in other ways. A
debt of gratitude specially is due to the women
of Malaya, many of whom worked untiringly
in that enervating climate in the interests of
the troops.

95. General.—Nevertheless, an atmosphere
of unreality hung over Malaya. In the
restaurants, clubs and places of entertainment
peace-time conditions prevailed. There was no
restriction on the consumption of foodstuffs. A
measure to restrict the hours during which in-
toxicating liquor could be sold was not passed
into law after long delays until November,
I941. Long immunity from war had made it
difficult to face realities.

SECTION XI.—RELATIONS WITH THE SERVICES
AND THE CIVIL GOVERNMENT.

96. Throughout the summer and autumn of
Ig4I the co-operation between the Services
was good, commanders and staffs working to-
gether on friendly and intimate terms. This
was true both in the higher and the lower
formations.

Relations with the Civil Government also
showed a marked improvement Generally
speaking, officials throughout the country co-
operated willingly with the military comman-
ders.

I feel bound to record, however, that in my
experience of Malaya there was a lack of the
team spirit between the Service Departments
on the one side and the Civil Government on
the other in tackling problems of common in-
terest. The vital importance of attaining the
common object, ie., the security of Malaya,
was at times overshadowed by local interests,
aggravated by the insistence of the Home
Government on the maximum production of
tin and rubber. The task of balancing the
tequirements of a country of vital strategical
importance to the Empire with those of a
wealthy and prosperous commercial community
was a difficult one requiring great tact and
patience. Clashes of interests naturally oc-
curred followed very often by long delays due ,
in part to the complicated form of government. /
Other delays, as has so often happened before' ,
in our history, resulted from discussions as to
the relative financial responsibility of the Home
and Malayan Governments on matters of de-
fence. There was also a difficulty in getting full
and accurate information as to civil defence
measures. \

These difficulties and dblays could to some
extent have been overcome if there had been
more regular meetings of the Defence Commit-
tee Malaya, and later of the War Committee
