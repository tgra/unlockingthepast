            "date": "30th November",
            "description": "As a site for a base, Dimapur possessed almost every conceivable disadvantage: heavy rainfall ; unhealthy climate ; and uneven ground (which did not become apparent until the dense jungle had been cleared). Moreover, it lies on a narrow tongue of land between two rivers, both of which are liable to overflow during the monsoon. To these local topographical disadvantages must be added the further one of the liability to interruption of the railway to Assam by the rivers and streams which pour down from the huge catchment area of the Himalayas, the foothills of which the railway skirts. In.1942, the railway was cut by floods from the 24th June till the 30th November."

            "description": "On the 2gth November violent assaults began on both flanks of the corridor. After several heavy,  but unsuccessful attacks on Ed Duda, the enemy at length penetrated between Ed Duda and Belhamed, and secured a foothold on the crest of the position. The garrison launched a counter-attack, and by daybreak the whole position was once more in our hands. Meanwhile the enemy succeeded in making a permanent breach on the southern flank. The New Zealand troops holding Point 175 drove off two attacks in the morning, but eventually fell victims to a ruse, mistaking German tanks for the advanced guard of the South African Brigade. Next day the enemy captured the rest of Sidi Rezegh Ridge. During the afternoon of the 30th November the 6th New Zealand Brigade, reduced to barely one-third of its fighting strength and with only two support tanks left, was assailed by fifty tanks from the west and large numbers of infantry from the south, and after a gallant resistance was overwhelmed."

By midday on the 30th November wireless touch with the New Zealand Division was restored, and General Norrie, who had stayed with the South Africans, arranged with General Freyberg for them to attack Point 175 from the east. The advance proceeded slowly and there was a long pause when the brigade reached the escarpment east of Point 175. Finally a moonlight attack was staged. But the position was strong and well supported by tanks, so that at dawn on  the ist December the South Africans were still 3,000 yards short of their objective, and spent the whole day attempting to take the position. , - Belhamed fell early on the rst December before a heavy attack launched by enemy tanks and infantry from Sidi Rezegh. The qth Armoured Brigade rushed from its leaguer some miles south of Point 175, but arrived in time only to cover the retirement of the New Zealand Division to Zafraan."

G.H.Q. stated that the Japanese had adequate forces to carry out such a move but placed no great credence in the report. They assumed that if such a convoy did leave Saigon it would travel at 15 knots or less and anchor off Nakwan or between Singora and Patani on the S.E. coast of Siam on the morning of either the. 30th November or rst December. G.H.Q. ordered: A.H.Q. to despatch air reconnaissances daily with a view to locating this Force, but in view of the danger that the Japanese might, by holding out a bait, induce us to strike the first blow and thus appear to be the aggressors, with consequent loss of American sympathy, stated that  a striking force will not be ordered to attack the convoy if found . From this day until 3rd December, reconnaissances proceeded without event except that on the 3rd December two large cargo boats were sighted."

            "description": "43. On the Northern Combat Area Command front in Northern Bunma, 36 British Division had been advancing down the Railway Corridor. Following on the capture of Pinwe on the 30th November (already mentioned in para. 23), Naba, Indaw and Katha were occupied in quick succession by the 10th December, and consolidation of the area proceeded without enemy interference. The situation at the end of the month was that 29 Brigade was concentrating at Tigyaing on the Irrawaddy, while 72 Brigade had crossed the river south of Katha and reached a point 25 miles south-west of Shwegu, on the south bank of the Shweli River. At this time 26 Indian Brigade joined 36 British Division and moved up to Indaw. Up till now, the Division had comprised only the two British Brigades mentioned above."
