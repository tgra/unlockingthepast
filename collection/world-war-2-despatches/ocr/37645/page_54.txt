rath (A) Division had head of ast EA
Brigade at about Soroppa advancing north
with great difficulty on account of the rains,
3rd GC Regiment were patrolling north from
Neghelli to Uaddara, and also experiencing
difficulty due to the weather but not to such a
great extent. The 24th GC Brigade less 3rd
GC Regiment were clearing up in Italian

* Somaliland. The important bridges at Dolo,

Lugh Ferrandi and Melka Guba were being
continually broken by the floods, the latter
being the only one by which troops could be
sent from one line of advance to the other, i.e.,
from the Iavello road to the Neghelli road and
vice-versa.’ This was a great handicap as it
eventually proved very difficult to send sup-
porting arms from one Brigade Group to the
other, a procedure which the shortage of guns
etc. made very necessary.

25th EA Brigade (rath (A) Division) were
undertaking operations against Maji with the
object of handing it over to the Equatorial
Corps in the Sudan when captured. It was
thought that the capture of Maji would have
a stabilising influence on the turbulent tribes
of the Ilembe triangle.

16. The enemy Order of Battle south and
west of Addis Abeba was as follows: —

Uaddara front 24th Division
Giabassire front arst Division
Sciasciamanna .« 25th Division
Gardulla-Soddu . Iorst Division
Gimma-Bonga. 2and Division

It should however be remembered that many
of the units had been heavily engaged, and no
reinforcements were available. The divisions
‘were therefore considerably below strength.
Nevertheless they were strong in guns (about
200 exclusive of AA), possessed armoured cars,
and between 20 and 30 medium and light tanks.

17. My instructions to Commander 11th (A)
Division were to attack Gimma as early as
possible and to operate southwards from Ponte
Malcasa against the tail of the column retreat-
ing south through Aselle under General de
Simone, who had been commanding the Italian
troops since the Giuba. I impressed on Major
General Wetherall the importance of ensuring
Proper protection of Adama and Moggio on his
L or C, which would have been very vulner-
able to attack by a determined enemy.

A battalion of rst SA Brigade with support-
ing arms was immediately despatched down the
Gimma road, and steps were taken to move up
23rd Nigerian Brigade to relieve the remainder
of 1st SA Brigade so that they could carry out
the attack on Gimma.

18. On x1th April I received a cable from
C-in-C, which has already been mentioned, to
the effect that he considered it imperative for
me to attack Dessie and open up the road north
to the Sudan. I therefore countermanded the
orders for the attack on Gimma and directed
1st SA Brigade Group on Dessie.

23rd Nigerian Brigade relieved ist SA
Brigade who had two battalions in Addis
Abeba, and one on the Omo River where the
Gimma road crossed it. The bridge at this
point had been blown by the enemy.

Ist SA Brigade commenced their march
on Dessie on 13th April. The account of the
operations carried out by the Brigade Group
is given later.

SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 10 JULY, 1946

19. It was now apparent that with only two
brigades in the Adama-Addis Abeba area I
could not expect to accomplish any great
success against the enemy in Gallo-Sidamo from
the north. It was known that a considerable
force of the enemy in the Quoziam area on the
Blue Nile had been cut off by our occupation
of Addis Abeba, and west of that town, at
Lechemti and Ghimbi, strong forces existed.
Although the presence of the large number of
Italian civilians in Addis Abeba was a cogent -
form of protection in itself, I could not leave
the Fiche and Lechemti roads entirely open.
It was therefore necessary for both local defence
and internal security reasons to keep two bat-
talions in Addis Abeba. rith (A) Division was
left therefore with only three battalions for
operations southwards. Qne of these battalions,
3rd Nigerian Regiment, was. located on the Omo
with instructions to rouse local patriots and
direct them against the rear of the Abalti posi-
tion on the other side of the Omo River. 22nd
EA Brigade with the remaining two battalions
advanced southwards from Ponte Malcasa on
Aselle and Cofole with the object of maintain-
ing maximum pressure on Sciasciamanna in
conjunction with the advance of 2th (A)
Division northwards. My object at this time
was to effect a junction of the two divisions on
the Addis Abeba-Dalle road.

On 16th April the 22nd Brigade Group
advanced successfully to Bocoggi taking some
prisoners on the way, but here found that the
road ceased to exist. As rain had already com-
menced falling it was decided to abandon the
Aselle road and transfer the 22nd Brigade effort
to the Moggo-Adamitullo road where it was
hoped the going was better. Steps were taken
to repair the bridges blown by the enemy on
that road, and by 24th April 22nd Brigade were
advancing south of Ponte Machi.

20. About this time I received information
that a mechanised enemy column of a. brigade
group with tanks, armoured cars and six
batteries, was assembling near Sciasciamanna
under General Bertello with the avowed inten-
tion of attacking the L. of C. at Noggio. Con-
‘siderable M.T. movement at night with head-
lights had been seen on the roads, and heavy
A.A. fire was encountered by our aeroplanes
whenever they approached the woods north of
Sciasciamanna. These woods were bombed by
the Air Force with what was known afterwards
as considerable effect. It was considered advis-
able until the situation was cleared up to arrest
the southward movement and be ready to
occupy a defensive position between the Lakes
Lagana and Algato. Nevertheless a small
column operating west of Lake Algato towards
an enemy position at Ficche continued with its
attack, captured the position, and took 8 guns
and roo prisoners. It seems probable that this
small attack upset the enemy’s plans for counter-
attack as the only northward movement of
the enemy appeared to be carried out by a few
tanks which advanced up the road from
Sciasciamanna as far as the Auada River and
then returned; no counter-attack materialised.

ar. Meanwhile rath (A) Division had con-
centrated the whole Gold Coast Brigade on the
Neghelli road and both this Brigade and
aist Brigade on the Iavello road were advanc-
ing slowly northwards. Two positions on these
roads at Uaddara and Giabassire respectively
had been responsible for holding up the Italians
