SUPPLEMENT To tuE LONDON GAZETTE, 23 MARCH, 1949

6. Finally, it should never be forgotten by
those who seek to draw conclusions from what
follows, that the operation was to all intents
and purposes unopposed, and it is important
to bear constantly in mind this essential fact
het planning combined operations in the

ture.

REPORT OF PROCEEDINGS—OPERATION
“TORCH.”
NavaL COMMANDER CENTRE TASK Force.
Narrative of Events.
Monday, 26th October.

Under the orders of Rear-Admiral Sir
Harold Burrough, K.B.E., CB., DSO. in
H.M.S. BULOLO, the combined fast convoy
(K.M.F. 1), of which I acted as Vice-
Commodore in H.M.S. LARGS, sailed from
the Clyde after dusk and proceeded, without
incident and in favourable weather, towards
Gibraltar on the route ordered.

Wednesday, 4th November.

2. The Oran section, K.M.F.O. 1, parted
company from the remainder of the convoy at
1315. The three “ Ulstermen” (L.S.I. small)
continued with the Algiers section, K.M.F.A. 1,
until proceeding into Gibraltar to fuel. Course
was altered to the westward and subsequently
adjusted so as to lose 21} hours on K.M.F.A. 1
in order to pass through the Straits after dark
on 6th November,

Thursday, 5th November.

3. Rendezvous was made with AURORA at
1700 as previously arranged.

4. Several A/S contacts were obtained
during the day by the screen and attacked but
without visible results. .

Friday, 6th November.

5. BITER flew off A/S patrol at daylight.
Catalinas from Gibraltar carried out A/S
patrol in the vicinity of the convoy.
JAMAICA flew off Walrus to Gibraltar which
returned before dark.

6. At 1600, the convoy formed into three
columns for passage of the Straits. Cape
Trafalgar was sighted shortly after dark. The
passage of the Straits was uneventful. Off
Gibraltar, WIVERN, ANTELOPE,
BRILLIANT and BOADICEA relieved
WESTCOTT, VERITY, WISHART and
VELOX on the screen, the latter proceeding
to Gibraltar to refuel. Many small fishing
gat were passed at the eastern end of the

traits.

Saturday, 7th November.

7. At daylight the M.L. Flotilla was in
sight ahead, the “Ulstermen” in sight to the
southward, and DASHER, escorted by
AMAZON and ACHATES, astern. .

The “ Ulstermen” reported they had been
sighted at some distance on the previous night
by a French destroyer and two submarines pro-
ceeding eastwards.

K.M.S.O. 1* was sighted ahead at 0700.

- Admiralty footnote:—

* K.M.S.O. 1—the slow convoy for Oran, which had
sailed from the Clyde on Thursday, 22nd October.

1521

8. From daylight, A/S patrols were carried
out over the convoy by (a) Swordfish from
BITER, (6) Walrus from JAMAICA, and (c)
Catalinas from Gibraltar, :

9. K.M'S.O. 1 was ordered to form Cruising
Order No. 40 by 1330 in preparation for join-
ing company with K.M.F.O. 1, up to which
time the fast convoy was manceuvred in broad
sweeps astern of the slow convoy.

10. Commencing at 1330, the two convoys
and their escorts were joined together and
divided into groups as previously arranged.

At this time there was a total of 97 vessels
of all types in company, all of which had their
allocated position to take up.

The maneeuvre was completed by 1630 and
was well carried out.

11. At 1815, the two southernmost columns
of the convoy parted company and, led by
AURORA, proceeded towards the ‘western
marking submarine off X and Y Beaches. They
made a successful rendezvous and then divided,
5 ships with their escorts for Y Beach and 7
ships with escorts for X Beach. The latter
sighted a: French convoy of four ships and an
armed trawler straggled out across their line
of advance and were obliged to slow down to
avoid it. This made them late on the schedule,
but the assault craft were eventually lowered
and beached successfully half an hour after
H hour (zero hour).

- The assault craft for Y Beach were lowered
and beached according to plan, their landing,
in common with the remainder of the assault,
being unopposed and undetected.

12. The column (of 7 ships) for Z Beach led
by JAMAICA parted company at 1825,
making for the eastern marking submarine,
HIM.S. URSULA. TEGELBERG, the fifth
in the line, lost touch with her next ahead and
the column straggled badly in -consequence.
LARGS, which accompanied this column,
acted as whipper in and by 2000 all ships were
in station. The submarine’s signal was sighted
right ahead at 2100, and at 2205, Arzeu Island
light and the glare over’ the town of
Mostaganem were in sight,

By that time the wind was nil, the sea

smooth, and even the stars obscured by cloud.
Conditions were perfect.

13. The ships were stopped by orders from
JAMAICA at 2315 and anchors lowered* on
to the bottom in fifty fathoms. At the same
time the assault craft were lowered and
manned, and ,after assembling proceeded in-
shore. From LARGS, five cables on the beam

‘of the anchored column, no sound was heard
‘and not even the flash of a torch was observed.

Sunday, 8th November.

14. H hour (0100).—At Z Beach the assault
craft touched down undetected within .a few
minutes on either side of zero hour and the
troops and beach parties proceeded on their
several missions unopposed. A company of
U.S. Rangers whose mission was to capture

.the fort above Arzeu landed on a small beach
near Cape Carbon. They did not even get their

feet wet. The remainder of the Rangers landed
in Arzeu harbour and quickly secured the dock

area.
