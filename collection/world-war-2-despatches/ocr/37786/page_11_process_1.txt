251. Arrangements were also made for dropping by air; this method was used mainly to meet urgent demands for ordnance stores and in the latter stages of the operation for various natures of ammunition, as there was no other teliable and fast method of meeting such demands, Initially, one aircraft was used each night, but ultimately as many as eighteen were used, During the period, 5th October to rgth November, 334,000 Ibs. and 200 personnel were dropped by 216 Group, Royal Air Force. A greater effort was attempted but thwarted by adverse weather,

252. The evacuation of casualties from the Aegean was carried out iby destroyer, caique, and transport aircraft. From the end of October, the evacuation of casualties from Leros to the Middle East by sea or air was most difficult; accordingly arrangements were made with the Turkish Government whereby they agreed to accept up to forty seriously wounded men in hospital at Bodrum without internment. Cases requiring operation were to be sent to the Izmir French Hospital, Less seriously wounded men were evacuated by caique to Bodrum, whence they were sent on to Castelrosso.

253. Maintenance by all these methods, none of which was reliable, was necessarily somewhat erratic and very difficult to regulate. The maintenance of our forces could never be regarded as assured, but, in spite of this, the combination of the various methods employed proved successful in that, when the operations were finished, G.O.C. Aegean reported that there was no lack of any vital commodity during the final stages of the operations, which were never influenced by a shortage of ammunition or supplies.

254. In fact, throughout the Aegean operations, it had been accepted that our garrisons could be maintained in supplies and ammunition, but that the cost of such maintenance would be high and the difficulties, especially in shipping heavy equipment, serious and at times prohibitive. On the other hand, our presence there was certainly of great value in causing diversion to the Aegean of German material which was badly needed elsewhere. The enemy was forced to concentrate 350 aircraft in Greece, Crete and Rhodes (of which abont 125 were reinforcements) and his aircraft



casualties by 23rd October amounted to over a hundred destroyed, over fifty probably destroyed, and a large number damaged. He had also lost eight motor vessels totalling about 16,000 tons, seven lighters and seven escorts; ; these vessels, although only a small proportion _* of those available, were virtually irreplaceable   from outside the Mediterranean.* Furthermore,

as long as we held Leros the German position

on Rhodes remained under threat, and in

many ways the enemy's difficulties were at

least as great as our own. The crux of

the situation was that Leros could not be

effectively built-up and the enemy's sea move-

ment intercepted owing to the fact that our

air bases were too distant to allow adequate

cover to ibe given to the Royal Navy.

I  our position could be maintained long enough

to effect the build-up on Leros and to take

advantage of the German difficulties, the moral

and political effect on the whole of South-East

Europe would be so great that I decided to

retain Leros as long as possible with the limited

forces available, whilst making every effort to

secure adequate air reinforcements, If these

could be procured, not only would Leros be

secured but the enemy's supplies by sea to th 

whole of the Dodecanese would be seriously

threatened.

255. When the actual German attack came against the garrisons in the Aegean our failure to maintain our positions was due (as had been anticipated) to the impracticability of providing adequate air cover before and during the battles, For this the underlying cause was that the Aegean operations had never been allowed to encroach on the prior demands of the Italian campaign. Major formations, aircraft and shipping alike, could not be diverted from Italy; for Italy, Middle East's available resources had been concentrated, and although an improvised operation in the Aegean was undertaken (on orders from London) in the hope of seizing the opportunity offered by the Italian capitulation, the risks, from the start, were great.

Middle East Base and Training

256. In fact, the Aegean operations were mounted by Middle East at a time when its tole had largely been reduced from an operational command, with troops at its disposal, to that of a base and transit centre and, above all, a training centre for warfare in Europe.

257. As part of its ferction as a base and training centre, Middle East Command was given an important role in training and equiping allied contingents to take their place in field formations or to release British troops for operational roles. This duty involved a constant regard for the acute political problems which disturb all   refugee   governments, in addition to the difficulties of training the formations, equipping them on British war establishments, and instructing them in British methods,
