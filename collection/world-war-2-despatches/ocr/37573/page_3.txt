SUPPLEMENT to Tur LONDON

arrived from the War Office that night. He
brought with him a list showing the order of
priority for shipment of stores, etc., and a
suggested outline plan for evacuation. A Senior
Naval Officer also arrived early next morning.

r5th June. .

12. At 0315 hours Lieutenant-General J. H.
Marshall-Coriwall reported to me, and we dis-
- cussed the situation. I placed all British troops
with the Tenth French Army under his com-
mand, and gave him orders to co-operate with
that Army until an opportunity arose to dis-
engage his troops and withdraw them to Cher-
bourg for embarkation to the United Kingdom.
The subsequent operations of Lieutenant-
General J. Marshall-Cornwall’s troops
(Norman Force*) are described in that
hie report which is attached at Appendix

13. The withdrawal of B.E.F. started in the
early hours of 15th June. The flights of the
Canadian Division which had arrived in the
‘Concentration Area were sent back to Brest
for embarkation, corps troops were re-
embarked at St. Malo, and various L. of C.
troops in the Le Mans area were moved nearer
the port areas.

14. Information as to the position of the
enemy on the front of the Tenth French Army
and southwards was very meagre as bad visi-
bility prevented air reconnaissance, and there
.were no ground troops to reconnoitre between
Alengon and Tours.

The general inference, however, was that
there was little enemy activity west of Rouen,
but hostile infantry were engaging the 157th
Infantry Brigade in the area of Conches.

A British pilot of a Bomber aircraft, who
had made a forced landing, reported that he
had run into heavy anti-aircraft fire about
Evreux and that he had seen a column of all
arms moving south in that area. This report
seemed to confirm previous information that the
Fourth German Army was moving South with
its left on Chartres.

15. At o810 hours I considered that my
position at. Le Mans was too exposed, since
there was no known body of troops covering
that area. I therefore moved my Headquarters
back to Vitre, just west of Laval. I took with
me the G.O.C. L. of C. Area, a part of whose
staff I had amalgamated with my own since
I was entirely dependent on L. of C. Signals
for my communications. My own staff con-
sisted only of four officers and two clerks, the
remainder having been stopped at St. Malo
and sent back to England.

16. At 1230 hours the C.1.G.S. telephoned to
say that the Prime Minister was anxious about
the withdrawal of the.52nd Division (less the
detachment with: Tenth French Army). The
Prime Minister wished the embarkation to be
cancelled, as he feared the effect of such a
withdrawal on the morale of the French.

“I pointed out that my plans had already
received approval, that orders had been issued
for the move, and that any alterations now
would complicate the embarkation at Cherbourg

* Norman Force was an improvised formation
which, on r5th June, comprised :—

3rd Armoured Brigade. .
- 157th Brigade Group (157th Infantry Brigade;
7xst Field Regiment R.A.; Troop-Carrying Com-
pany, 52nd Division). .

and might well endanger it. The C.I.G.S.,
however, said that the Prime Minister did not
wish. the division to be embarked without the
approval. of His Majesty’s Government.

17. At this time the complete absence of any
information of the whereabouts of the enemy
on the Le Mans front caused me some anxiety,
as any penetration of enemy troops towards
Laval and Rennes would have seriously en-
dangered the safety of the B.E.F.

18. I spoke again to the C.I.G.S, at 2150
hours. I explained to him the situation as- I
knew it, and I once more impressed on him
the need to evacuate 52nd Division (less the
detachment with Tenth French Army). The
necessary shipping was available at Cherbourg
and was being kept idle. The air situation was
also at that time favourable.

An hour and a half later the C.I.G.S. gave
permission to embark one field regiment, one
field company and other details of 52nd Divi-
sion which were not needed to support the
infantry of the Division. Orders implementing
these instructions were at once issued.

Ig. Later that night another battalion and a
troop of anti-tank s from 52nd Division
were put under General Marshall-Comwall’s
orders for the protection of the Cherbourg
peninsula at St. Sauveur.

No information of the enemy’s movements
could be obtained, but he did not appear at the
moment to have exploited the gap at Le Mans.

20. During the preceding 24 hours just over
12,000 troops were reported to have been evac-
uated from the different ports.

16th June.

21. At 0700 hours the C.1.G.S. rang me up
and said that all arrangements could be made
for the evacuation of 52nd Division (less the
detachment with Tenth French Army), but that
no actual movement was yet to take place. At
0830 hours, however, he rang up again and
confirmed that 52nd Division (less the detach-
ment with Tenth French Army) could now begin
to embark: Norman Force itself was to con-
tinue to co-operate with the Tenth French
Army. I then asked the C.I.G.S. what the
policy should be with regard to troops of the
French Army who might wish to embark at
Cherbourg. He informed me that they would
be allowed to do so. Orders for the embarka-
tion of 52nd Division (less the detachment with
the Tenth French Army) were issued.

I issued orders to G.O.C. L. of C. to the
effect that work of re-embarkation of personnel,
stores, and vehicles was to continue at all ports
as long as the tactical situation permitted.

22. Owing, once more, to poor visibility no
air reconnaissance was possible, but reports
from Motor Contact Officers and from Norman
Force showed that the enemy was in contact
with the Tenth French Army along its front
but that he was attacking seriously only against
157th Infantry Brigade. Further to the South
enemy movement seemed to be directed on
Chartres.

Information .was received later from cap-
tured orders which showed that the Fourth
German Army was to attack that day with the
ultimate object of gaining Cherbourg and Brest.

23. The C.I.G.S. telephoned at 1325 hours
to confirm that 52nd Division (less the detach-
ment with Tenth French Army) could now em-
bark. He said that he was still unable to give
