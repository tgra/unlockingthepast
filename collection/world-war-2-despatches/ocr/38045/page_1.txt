THE DIEPPE RAID.

The following despatch was submitted to the
Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, on the
30th August, 1942, by Captain J. HUGHES-
HALLETT, R.N., Naval Force Commander.

Portsmouth Combined Headquarters,
Fort Southwick.
30th August, 1942.

T have the honour to submit the accom-
panying report of proceedings for Operation
** Jubilee ’’ which was carried out on 18th/zgth
August, 1942.

2. Generally speaking I consider that the
Naval Forces engaged in the operation carried
‘out their role as well as was possible under
conditions which became increasingly difficult
as the operation proceeded. A number of
minor mistakes were made, chiefly by myself,
and find their place in the narrative.
Fortunately none of these had any vital
influence on the operation as a whole.

3. Iam glad to be able to report that almost
without exception the conduct of all Naval
personnel was exemplary, and in accordance
with the traditions of the Service. Recom-
mendations for honours and awards are for-
warded separately, but I have no doubt that
many unrecorded acts of heroism must have
occurred off the beaches and in vessels which
were lost.

4. The fighter cover afforded by No. 11
‘Group was magnificent and the fact that a
number of bombers got through was to be ex-
pected. It is considered that the loss of only
one ship from bombing should be regarded as
an unusually fortunate result.

5. I wish respectfully to pay a tribute to the
Military Force Commander. No one could
have been more helpful than Major-General
J. H. Roberts. All our major decisions were
jointly made in complete agreement.

6. I wish also to draw your particular atten-
tion to Major P. Young of No. 3 Commando,
who with the troops from a single L.C.P.
effectively diverted the attention of the coast
defence battery at Berneval during an im-
portant part of the operation, thereby averting
the exceedingly serious consequences which
might have resulted from the failure of the
Yellow Beach landings. In my judgment this
was perhaps the most outstanding incident of
the operation.

7. Operation ‘‘ Jubilee’ differed. funda-
mentally from any other Combined Operation
that has been carried out by this country in
modern times, inasmuch as it amounted to
a direct daylight assault upon an important
objective strongly held by the first army of
Europe. From the point of view of its
perspective in the war as a whole, it may per-
haps be compared to the British offensives on
the Western front during 1915. Although from
purely a military point of view the results
achieved were disappointing, and the heavy
casualties sustained regrettable, it is considered
that the operation was well worth while pro-
vided its lessons are carefully applied when. the
time comes to re-enter France on a large scale.
The principal lesson appears to be, firstly, that
much stronger military forces are required to
break through the German coastal defences in
any important area; secondly, that a very much
higher proportion of the military force should
be held in reserve until the progress made in
the initial assaults is known, and that this
reserve should then be employed in exploiting
success. Unless this is done there is no
guarantee that any of the beaches will be
properly secured, and this is an absolute pre-
requisite of success whether the subsequent
phases of the operation are to take the form of
a withdrawal or a further follow-up.
