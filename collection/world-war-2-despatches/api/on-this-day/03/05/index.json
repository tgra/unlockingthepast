            "description": "42. Mopping up in the thick mountainous jungle was a difficult and necessarily slow operation, and it was not until the 5th March that we were able to resume the interrupted course of our offensive. Razabil was captured by 5 Indian Division on the 12th March. It was found to be a position of great strength, complete with underground rooms, etc. The Tunnels position was surrounded by the 19th March, and was finally captured by 36 British Division some days later. Meanwhile, 7 Indian Division had taken Buthidaung and had also captured the outer ring of the Kyaukit defences. These defences were evacuated by the enemy on the 23rd March and considerable equipment fell into our hands. On the 25th, about 500 enemy again infiltrated to the Negakyedauk area, but were dealt with expeditiously."

The system of giving   escort  ,  protection   or   cover  to convoys, according to circumstances, remained in force, but I arranged that   escort   should be given more generously than hitherto in specially dangerous areas, and that, where attacks were likely to be made without warning, fighters giving   protection   should be kept airborne while the risk continued."

On the same day the New Zealand Division, which had secretly and swiftly been brought forward from Tripoh, concentrated in the area south of Medenine. On the 3rd a local attack by Italian troops on the Mareth front, which cost them severe casualties, was also probably designed to distract our attention from the west but the signs there were too strong: all that day and the next heavy movement continued in the mountains, at Toujane, Cheguimi and Ksar el Hallouf. The enemy rested all day of 5th March and on the 6th poured down from the mountains to the attack. As the Panzer Grenadiers moved off on the evening of the 5th down the steep, winding road from Ksar el Hallouf they defiled past the Army Group Commander, standing in his open car at the top of the pass. According to an eye witness on the spot Rommel was obviously a sick man, with a dirty bandage round his neck where he was suffering from desert sores; to a party who stopped near him he said that unless they won this battle the last hope in Africa was gone."

            "description": "The British representatives were therefore faced with the situation that, instead of a strong and effective Greek force to hold the Aliakhmon Line, there would only be one weak division, and that there was every prospect of the Greek forces being defeated in detail. In these circumstances I was summoned to Athens and a series of long conferences took place between 2nd and 5th March, as a result of which it was decided that the Greek army should leave three divisions in Macedonia to defend the prepared positions on the frontier, but would concentrate on the Aliakhmon Line three divisions  and seven independent battalions, to hold the line and prepare it for defence until the arrival of the British contingent, which would be disembarked mainly at the Piraeus, except for certain units and stores which would be landed at Volos. This was a very unsatisfactory arrangement in comparison with the original proposal but it was found impossible to persuade the (Greeks to move back the troops in Macedonia, and the alternative of refusing to send aid to the Greeks altogether seemed politically impossible."

I was still not able to operate strong forces from 12th (A) Division, but ordered the Commander to move light forces to Bardera, Dolo and Lugh Ferrandi. These operations were undertaken quickly. Bardera was occupied on 26th February, Iscia Baidoa on 28th February, Lugh Ferrandi on 3rd March, Dolo on 5th March. A further number of prisoners were taken including the commander and staff of 2oth Colonial Brigade. It transpired that the whole of the African personnel of this brigade, some 3,000 men, had dispersed into the bush."

Commander 12th (A) Division anticipated that if Bardera was occupied he could capture it by 2nd March and Iscia Baidoa by 5th March. To assist in the capture of Bardera and subsequently to garrison that place it was arranged that one battalion of 21st E.A. Brigade from Wajir should move there direct. Considerable apprehension was felt at the time about troops  getting caught by the rains in Bardera and Iscia Baidoa with insufficient supplies. The same day a report was received that a patrol of the 24th G.C. Brigade had entered Bardera which was found to be unoccupied. Reports were also received that Iscia Baidoa and Dinsor had already been evacuated as a result of a message from the Duce ordering the evacuation of Italian Somaliland for Abyssinia. This was confirmed by patrols which occupied Iscia Baidoa on 27th February and captured 200 native troops and large quantities of ammunition, supplies and petrol."

Accordingly when the force was in position of approximately 64 00'N. 4 00'W and darkness was approaching W/T silence was broken for this purpose.
