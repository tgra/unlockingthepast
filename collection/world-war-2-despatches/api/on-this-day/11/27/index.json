Then, after two further attacks on Capuzzo, one of which was comparatively successful, the enemy armoured forces disappeared from the frontier area. By this time,most of them were already hurrying back to Sidi Rezegh in response to insistent calls for help.",

By the 27th November they had recaptured Sidi Rezegh, taken Belhamed on the northern ridge and joined hands with the garrison of Tobruk, who for their part, after holding the salient for five days against numerous counter-attacks, had completed their sortie by taking Ed Duda. By the 28th the whole of this important tactical locality was in our hands.",

            "description": "thrown into the scale against them, the advantage rested with us. Moreover the enemy spent much of his strength and used up most of his reserves in this desperate counterstroke. But it might have succeeded, had the 4th Indian Division shown less determination and the mobile columns less offensive spirit, or had the Royal Air Force not bombed the enemy's principal concentrations so relentlessly. Nevertheless the attempt came as a rude shock, and it was with relief that I heard on the 27th November that the enemy was on his way back towards Tobruk.",

Opposition was strong and our troops suffered a number of casualties, the majority of which were from mines and booby traps. The enemy's rifle and machine gun fire, though heavy, was inaccurate. By 1730 hours in the evening, the town was in our hands, though some of the surrounding garrisons did not get the order to surrender until the following day. A total of 23,000 prisoners was taken.",
