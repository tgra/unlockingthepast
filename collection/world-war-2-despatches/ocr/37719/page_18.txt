These, though disappointing, were not entirely
negligible; several Bombers were shot down in
this area during the experimental period, and
many discovered that they were pursued and
turned back before reaching their objectives.
Night Fighting Development work was also
go.ng on at the same time at the Fighter Inter-
ception Unit at Tangmere in Sussex.

248. A supplementary use was found for the
A.I. by the installation of A.I, “ Beacons”
in the vicinity of Night Flying Aerodromes.
These afforded a valuable Navigational aid for
‘* Homing ’’ in cases where any defect occurred
in the R/T D/F system.

249. Shortly before I left the Command a
new piece of Radio-Location apparatus became
available in the shape of the “ G.C.I.”’ set with
the Plan Position Indicator. This was an
Inland-Reading Set which showed the position
of all aircraft within its range on a fluorescent
screen as the aerial was rotated.

250. The main advantages of this set were
that it had a longer range than the G.L. set
and it was possible to track the Bomber and the
Fighter by the same apparatus instead of
following one with the G.L. and the other by
R/T D/F. Moreover it was found that in
some circumstances the accuracy of the
R/T D/F method was inadequate for night
interceptions.

251. On the other hand, the accuracy of
height readings by the G.C.I. apparatus was
less than that obtainable with the G.L. I under-
stand that this has now been improved.

252. Whatever the exact technical method
of plotting positions and tracks of aircraft, the
object was to place the Fighter behind the

’ Bomber, and in such a position that the echo
of the latter would show in the Fighter’s A.I.
set. The Fighter then tried to overtake the
Bomber until it became visible to the naked
eye.

253. At that time only multi-seaters could
be fitted with A.I., and therefore, concurrently
with the Night Interception experiments,
methods were tried of using the Searchlights’as
pointers for Night Fighters, even if the target
were out of range of the Searchlight Beam.
Experiments were made with the Searchlights in
“clumps’’ to increase their illuminating
power and the visibility of their beams to
Fighters at a distance.

254. A small Radio-Location set was
designed to fit to the Searchlight itself, so as
to get over the time-lag which was such an
insuperable obstacle to the use of Sound

Locators. It is probable that if Searchlights
can substitute the speed of light for that of
sound they may take on a new lease of useful
life.

255. The disadvantage of relying entirely on
Radio-controlled methods of Night Interception
is that “‘ saturation point ’’ is quickly reached,
and when mass raids are in progress only a
limited number of fighters can be operated.
Results obtained in the Spring of r94z show
that Day Fighters can obtain important results
in conditions of good visibility, ecially if
attention is paid to all methods of improving
the night vision of pilots.

256. During the Battle the “‘ Intruder ”’
system was initiated on a small scale. Night
fighters without A.I. were sent across to France
in an attempt to catch Bombers while taking
off from, or landing at, their aerodromes; or
to intercept them at points where they habitually
crossed the French Coast. .

257. I had to leave the Development of Night
Interception at a very interesting stage; but it
is perhaps not too much to say that, although
much remained to be done, the back of the
problem had been broken. The experiments
had, of course, been carried out in a small area,
and raiders which avoided the area could be
intercepted only by previously existing methods;
but the possibilities had been demonstrated and’
could be applied on a larger scale as soon as
the necessary apparatus was provided.

258. The method is, of course, also applic-
able to the day interception of raiders making
use of cloud cover, which have hitherto proved
extremely elusive; and it is not too much to
hope, that the eventual development of very
high-frequency A.I. may enable accurate fire
to be opened against unseen targets, so that not
even the darkest night nor the densest cloud
will serve as a protection to the Raider.

259. The day may come when every Single-
Seater Fighter is fitted with A.J., but this is
not yet feasible. What can be done is to fit all
Searchlights with Radio-Location apparatus so
that every Searchlight Beam is a reliable pointer
towards an enemy, even if the range is too great
for direct illumination.* If then the Fighter
can be informed in addition of the height of
the Raider, Day Fighters will be able to join
usefully and economically in night operations
on dark nights.

* As a result of the experience gained during this
period, all searchlight equipments have since been
fitted with Radar control. This, combined with
intensified training, has made them, since 1941,
extremely accurate.
