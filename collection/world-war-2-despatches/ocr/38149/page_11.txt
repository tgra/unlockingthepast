SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 18 DECEMBER, 1947

arrange a scheme which could use part time
soldiers effectively. oe

- Their terms of service provided that they
should not perform more than 48 hours of
. training and duty in 28 days and in the event
of raids taking place they could only volunteer
for extra duty with the permission of their
civil employers, It was impracticable to permit
‘any of the major defences of the country to
be manned on those terms, even if, as later
occurred, the terms were somewhat modified.

14. It was at this time that we had been
.planning an extension of the anti-aircraft
defences by the widespread introduction of
Rocket Batteries; the supply of rocket weapons
had now increased to the extent-that demands
for shipping had been met and a surplus was
rapidly ‘becoming available for home defence.
Unlike other forms of defence the principle
involved was simple and required no long and
complex training. Rocket weapons appeared to
be eminently suitable for operation by the

’ Home. Guard and I accordingly proposed the
introduction of Home Guard Rocket Batteries.
The proposal was approved and units began
training immediately.

15. It was agreed that each man should be
called upon one night in eight, so that where
178 men were required to keep a site in
action on any one night, a total of 1,424 were
necessary in order to permit full and continuous
manning of the site. These figures will give
some idea of the dimensions of the new project,
but this was far from being the only difficulty.
It was decided that a call for volunteers would
be unsatisfactory because many would prob-
ably be young men who would shortly be lost
under’ conscription. The responsibility for
providing men therefore devolved upon the
Ministry of Labour and they selected those who
were not otherwise employed on any form of
National Service.

’ 16. Disciplinary control over.members of the
Home Guard was virtually impossible and it
was an easy matter for those who were so
inclined to evade all duty. It was due entirely
to the servicegiven by the unselfish that the
Rocket Batteries became and remained a force
which the German aircrews treated with th
utmost respect. °

17, Within a year the Ministry of Labour was

showing signs of being unable to fulfil demands
and men were transferred from Home Guard
infantry battalions. The Home Guard infantry
battalions, formed when invasion was an ever-
present threat, contained all the keenest and
most enthusiastic elements and whole units
might have transferred to an anti-aircraft réle.
But, when called upon to give up men while
retaining an infantry réle, it was natural that
they should allow only their least efficient miem-
bers to transfer to the Rocket Batteries.
: Arrangements were made whereby one or
more Home Guard General Service Batteries
were affiliated to the local AA Battery from
which the latter could draw recruits. Those un-
suitable for AA duty, due either to medical
reasons or change of civilian employment, were
drafted back to the Home Guard Battalion
concerned.

18. In 1942 manpower pressure increased
further.
mittee, charged with relating the requirements

In July, 1942, the ad hoc sub-com- ’

and availability of equipments with the avail-
ability: of manpower for anti-aircraft purposes
throughout the world, allotted to Anti-Aircraft
Command a ceiling. of 264,000; in October,
1942, a reduction to 180,000 was suggested.
By introducing what was termed “ over-
gunning ’’ the ratio of men to guns in Heavy
Anti-Aircraft units was further reduced. In
places where guns were concentrated, batteries
‘became responsible for more than the normal
eight guns and the Home Guard were also
introduced to Heavy anti-aircraft gunnery,
taking over one or more guns under supervision
of the local unit.

Where guns were scattered no over-gunning
was possible. The effect in saving therefore
became more pronounced as the defences in-
creased and as more guns could be concentrated,
rising from about 6 per cent. with 1,500 guns
to 15 per cent. with 2,500. By this means the
number of Heavy equipments in action was not
reduced. Nor was it found necessary to
reduce the number of Light gums in action, for
‘the Home Guard took over the defences of
certain factories and railways with these
weapons and it was agreed that the R.A.F.
Regiment should take over the defence of air-

elds.

1g. Anti-Aircraft Command was at the same
time largely absolved from the responsibility
of holding and draft-finding, which had been
such a, burden hitherto, so that ultimately this
1942 cut was limited to ‘ten searchlight
batteries.-

Cuts in Man-Power. :

20. The size of this cut. was, however, only
kept within these limits by reducing the num-
ber of male Heavy anti-aircraft batteries from
g2 to 64, that is, by replacing men with women
in 28 batteries. I regarded 64 as the absolute
minimum number of male batteries I should
have, since there were certain commitments
which I hoped not to have to ask mixed units
to undertake. I still envisaged using male
batteries only for emergency deployments and
I had to retain some male batteries for train-
ing and holding purposes. -Fortunately the
threat of invasion had receded and I was
now able to move mixed units into those south
and south-eastern areas from which they had
beeti previously excluded.

21. In September, 1943, the question, now
a regular annual one, recurred again. An
assessment of German air strength at this time
led to the conclusion that certain risks might
legitimately be taken in the way of cdnsiderably
reducing the defences in some of the northern
and western areas and cuts were made in all
forms of defence, the manpower in Anti-
Aircraft Command being reduced by 13,700.

22. In June, 1944, further cuts were sug.
gested which had to be postponed because of
the attacks by flying bombs; but in August,
1944, it was proposed to regard large areas
of the country as probably immune from further
attack and during September, 1944, I lost all
Smoke Defences and 28 Searchlight batteries,
followed in November, 1944, by 11 male and
ror Mixed Heavy batteries, 34 Light batteries
and 14 more Searchlight batteries. Finally in
January, 1945, I lost 6 male Heavy batteries,
35 Light batteries, 33 Searchlight batteries and
