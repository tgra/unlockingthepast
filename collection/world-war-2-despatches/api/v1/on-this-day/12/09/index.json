Detachments of Royal Artillery, 7th Hussars (light tanks), ist Durham Light Infantry, Ist South Staffords, machine gunners from 1st Royal Northumberland Fusijers and ist Cheshires, as well as a number of dummy tanks, made up the balance. It remained in observation of Maktila camp until the afternoon of the 9th December, when, learning that Nibeiwa had been captured, Brigadier Selby gave orders to move forward and endeavour to prevent the withdrawal Westwards of the rst Libyan Division. Owing to the comparative weakness of the force and difficult going, it was unable to prevent the withdrawal of the enemy towards Sidi Barrani, but pursued them with all possible speed on the roth December."
