            "description": "203. The loss of Cos deprived us of our only airfield from which single-engined fighters could operate over the Aegean, As a result, no adequate daylight cover could be given to our shipping, which now became exposed to attack iby a greatly strengthened German Air Force based in Greece and Crete, which had been rapidly expanded until it was at least equal to that in Italy; sea transport was henceforth confined to darkness. The disposition of our forces in the Aegean was Teadjusted on 5th October, when the small garrison which we had established in Calino, the neighbouring island to Cos, was withdrawn; but patrols were maintained there and on Gairos, Kythnos, Stampalia and Simi.",

By the 25th the enemy was generally back behind the Usa but not in very good order and advances were made all along the Army front. In the plains we had cleared the whole eastern bank of the Fiumicino by 29th September but the enemy was still holding out in the foothills south of Route 9 when the rain descended with great violence for four successive days. All the fords over the Marecchia and Uso became impassable and the approaches to the bridges, necessarily more congested, were in very bad condition; the Fiumicino, normally a shallow trickle, swelled to a width of thirty feet and its speed and depth made it impossible for infantry patrols to cross. Going off the roads became quite impossible. The enemy took heart from this to maintain a steadfast resistance and it was not until 5th October that the",

General Georges decided, however, that it was inadvisable to await the arrival of the whole British Expeditionary Force in ‘the concentration area and expressed a wish that 1st Corps should move without delay into the sector north of Maulde.
