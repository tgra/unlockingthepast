64. Information from Montevideo was to the
effect that GRAF SPEE was still repairing
damage, having obtained assistance from the
shore, and had provisioned. It was reported
as unlikely that she would sail that night; on
the other hand, once again I did not feel able
to rely on such an optimistic report.

65. I signalled the following appreciation to
ships in company timed 1615/16th December.—
‘* My object Destruction necessitates keep-
ing my force together. My Appreciation.
Rely on getting his time of sailing and initial
course from shore. For subsequent move-
ments rely on CUMBERLAND’S aircraft
reconnaissance reports.

“* Enemy’s courses of Action. (a) North
of Engiish Bank. (b) Between English and
Rouen Banks. (c) Between Rouen Bank
and San Antonio. (d) Double back on any
‘tack. My Course of Action. I rule out
fighting him off Whistle Buoy as being politi-
cally impossible. Until the dawn phase I
want to keep the advantage of light and from
this it follows that I must keep to the east
and move to intercept him from area to area
depending on time and information. My
Pian, To keep within reach of intercepting
him north of English Bank moving south or
doubling back as information comes in.
Tactical. I must keep CUMBERLAND so
placed that she will not have her fire masked
initially, and therefore I will work in divisions
8 cables apart with ACHILLES in close

. order astern of AJAX.

“* After action commences, divisions have
complete freedom of action. CUMBER-
LAND’S aircraft is to be flown off as soon
as news is received of enemy’s sailing.’’

66. The British ship DUNSTER GRANGE
was sailed from Montevideo at 1700 and a
further period before GRAF SPEE could be
allowed to sail was claimed. It was, however,
reported that she had made very rapid pro-
gress with her repairs, and might break out
at any moment.

67. The difficulty of intercepting GRAF SPEE
who had so many courses of action open to
her will, I feel sure, be realised. It was in
the dog watches of this evening that I received
the Naval Secretary’s signal 1717 /16th Decem-
ber informing me from the First Lord of the
Admiralty of the honours so graciously
bestowed by His Majesty the King on myself,
Captain 'W.’ E. Parry, Captain C. H. L.
Woodhouse and Captain F. S. Bell, and also
that I had been promoted to Rear Admiral
to date 13th December. This was a most
stimulating tonic to us all and I took steps to
pass it on to H.M. Ships under my command,
emphasising the share of-all concerned in the
honours which their senior officers had received.

68. The squadron spent the night patrolling
on a north and south line five miles to the east
of the English Bank Light Buoy. OLYNTHUS
proceeded to sea with order to be at the Rouen
Bank by r000 the next morning if GRAF SPEE
had not broken out. ss

Sunday, 17th December.

69. I ordered ACHILLES who was getting
low in fuel, to oil from OLYNTHUS off the
Rowen Bank during the forenoon. AJAX and
CUMBERLAND acted as look-outs at visibility

distance during the operation. The squadron
then cruised in company off the south-east of
the English Bank, remaining concentrated
throughout the afternoon and ready again to
take up the same night patrol as on the previous
night. :

7o. It was reported that GRAF SPEE had
landed all her borrowed welding apparatus dur-
ing this forenoon. We all expected that she
would break out at any moment. I would
like to place on record the fact that at this
stage the most cheerful optimism pervaded all
ships in spite of the fact that this was the fifth
night of waiting for the enemy.

a1. At 1540 I received a. signal that GRAF
SPEE was, transferring between 300 and 400
men to the German ship TACOMA lying close
to her in the ante-port. At 1720, a further
report stated that over 700 men with their bag-
gage and some provisions had now been trans-
ferred, and that there were indications that
GRAF SPEE intended to scuttle herself.

Shorily after this GRAF SPEE was reported
as weighing.

72. 1 immediately altered course to close the
Whistle Buoy, and increased to 25 knots.
AJAX’S aircraft was flown off and ordered
to proceed towards Montevideo and report the
position of GRAF SPEE and also TACOMA.

GRAF SPEE left harbour at 1815 and pro-
ceeded slowly to the westward. TACOMA also
weighed, and followed her out of harbour.

73. I ordered my squadron to assume the
First Degree of Readiness, in case GRAF SPEE
intended re-transferring her crew from
TACOMA outside the harbour, or intended to
break out with or without her surplus crew.

74, AJAX aircraft reported sighting GRAF
SPEE in a position in shallow water some six
miles south-west of Montevideo. At 2054 the
aircraft signalled: ‘‘ GRAF SPEE has blown
herself up.’’

75. The squadron carried on towards
Montevideo, proceeding north of the English
Bank, AJAX and ACHILLES cheering ship
as they passed each other.

76. Once again Captain Woodhouse and
‘Lieutenant Lewin made an excellent recovery
of AJAX’s aircraft, this time under almost dark
conditions.

‘Navigation lights were then switched on and
the squadron steamed past the Whistle Buoy
within about four miles of the wreck of the
GRAF SPEE. It was now dark, and she was
ablaze from end to end, flames reaching almost
as high as the top of her control tower, a
magnificent and most cheering sight. ,
