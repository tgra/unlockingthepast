THE ALLIED ARMIES IN ITALY FROM 3rp SEPTEMBER, 1943, TO
12TH DECEMBER, 1944.

PREFACE BY THE WaR OFFICE.

This Despatch was written by Field-Marshal
Lord Alexander in his capacity as former
Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Armies in
Italy. It therefore concentrates primarily upon
the development of the land campaign and the
conduct of the land battles. The wider aspects
of the Italian Campaign are dealt with in
reports by the Supreme Allied Commander
(Field-Marshal Lord Wilson) which have
already been published.
period that the very close integration of the
- Naval, Military and Air Forces of the Allied
Nations, which had been built up during the
North African Campaigns, was firmly con-
solidated, so that the Italian Campaign was
essentially a combined operation. The very
intimate relationship between the three Services
was undoubtedly one of the governing factors
in securing victory.

The following Despatch was submitted to the
Seer of State for War on 19th Apmil,
sou by HIS EXCELLENCY FIELD-
MARSHAL THE VISCOUNT
ALEXANDER TUNIS, K.G.,
G.C.B., G.C.M.G., CS.1., DS.0., M.C.,
former General Officer Commanding-in-Chief,
Fifteenth Army Group.

I have the honour to submit my Despatch on
the Allied Armies in Italy during the period
from 3rd September, 1943, to 12th December,
1944

The Despatch is divided into the following
four parts:
Part I--Preliminary Planning and _ the

Assault.

Part 11—The Winter Campaign.

Part II1I—The Capture of Rome and the
Advance to the Arno. .

Part IV—The Gothic Line Battles.

It was during this-

Part I.
PRELIMINARY PLANNING AND THE
ASSAULT.

Strategic Basis of the Campaign.

The invasion of Italy followed closely in time
on the conquest of Sicily and may be therefore
treated, both historically and strategically, as
a sequel to it; but when regarded from the
point of view of the Grand Strategy of the
war there is a great cleavage between the two
operations. The conquest of Sicily marks the

losing stage of that period of strat which
began with the invasion of North ica in
November, 1942, or which might, on a longer
view, be considered as beginning when the first
British armoured cars crossed the frontier wire
into Cyrenaica on 11th June, 1940, the morrow
of Mussolini’s declaration of war. The invasion
of Italy was part of the next period in
European strategy which was destined to cul-
minate in the invasion of the ‘West and the
destruction of the German armies. -When the
last German fied across the Straits of Messina
the first aim of Allied strategy had been
achieved: to clear the enemy from Africa and
to open the Mediterranean to the shipping of
the United Nations without fear of interruption;
in the next phase the Mediterranean theatre
would no longer receive the first priority of re-
sources and its operations would become prepa-
ratory and subsidiary to the great invasion
based on the United Kingdom. It was now
called on to break up the victorious team of
armies trained in its hard school and to sur-
tender to the West the picked divisions which
were to form the spearhead of the assault on
the beaches of Normandy.

The nature of the break between the Sicilian
and Italian operations is clear from the con-
trast between the directives for them issued by
