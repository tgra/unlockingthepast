SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 APRIL, 1948

and road facilities of the ports of Calcutta and
Bombay were the first matters to receive their
attention.

‘a7. Transportation by Rail and Road,

Arrangements were made to increase the
capacity of the Assam line of communication
railways to 7,300 tons of military stores daily
by the rst January, 1946. Tihis included
doubling the line between Parbatupur and Ledo,
‘building a bridge over the Brahmaputra be-
tween Amingaon and Pandu, and constructing
a chord line between Namrup and Margherita.

The development of rail service to steamer
landings on the Brahmaputra continued, but
was subject to special hindrance by the mon-
soon. In particular, the bridging of the Kakila
River (three 60 foot and two 20 foot spans)
on the access line to the new river port Neamati
(North of Jorhat on the Brahmaputra) suffered
from monsoon floods.

Severe flooding prevented the completion of
the Dohazari railhead by the target date of
the 1st September. It has, however, now been
completed. The works to increase the capacity
of the railway between Dohazari and Chitta-
gong were finished.

The bursting of the banks of the Damodar
River on the 18th July and the consequent cut-
ting of the main rail and road communications
North-West of ‘Calcutta have already been men-
tioned. As a’result of these breaches, diversions
of traffic had to be made. Two-thirds of the
total Assam stores lift, and all traffic for East ‘
Bengal and Chittagong (with the exception of
fifteen metre gauge wagon loads daily) was sent
via Bombay and the sea routes to Calcutta
oF CHINAEODE, as long as the interruption
lasted.

Among other short term means to improve
the rail capacity of the Assam line of com-
munication were the improvement in efficiency
of operation by United States military person-
nel running the railway. This ¢omprised some
4,600 U.S. army ‘transportation troops who
assisted in operating the Bengal and Assam
Railway, and the view was expressed that an
increase of as much as fifty per-cent. was ob-
tained by improved operation. A request for
thege railway troops was sent to the U.S.A.

‘Another handicap has been the shortage of,
locomotives in India, deliveries of which from,
overseas were awaited. During the period
under review thirteen broad gauge ‘‘ Eagle ’”
and ninety-two metre gauge “‘ Mikado ’’ loco-
motives arrived. A number of the latter were
‘taken into use on the Bengal and Assam Rail-
way. :

To increase the capacity of mechanical road
transport, experiments and trials were success-
fully carried out with trailers, and it was
decided to introduce these at the rate of 25

per general purpose transport company
equipped with 15 cwt. trucks. .

28. Docks.

The development of Chittagong port to meet
operational needs‘fias gone ahead. Additional
moorings for deep sea ships were got from’
Calcutta, and most of the cranes taken from
Chittagong under the denial scheme in 1942
have been replaced,

Dock labour as a whole gave little cause for
anxiety, although the position at Vizagapatain
for a time was not good.

A special jomt investigation was held into
the congestion in the Port of Calcutta. Relief
measures included the provision of mobile
cranes for heavy lifts, the improvement of rail
facilities in depots, and the provision of tank
transporters and additional motor transport for
port operation.

2g. Inland Water Transport (I.W.T.).

This service also has been handicapped by
floods. Rapid erosion at several of the land-
ing places on the Brahmaputra caused anxiety,
but preventive measures succeeded in averting
serious trouble.

In regard to nver craft, India had requested
the return from Iraq of certain river steamers
which had been sent there from India earlier
in the war. In addition to the arrival of
these, ten paddlers, three screw steamers, and
ten dumb craft were released from Iraq for
use on the Brahmaputra. These craft began
to reach India at the rate of two a month,
the first pair arriving in October. Higgins
barges also were brought into use on an in-
creasing scale with good results.

For the transportation of oil in, bulk by
river, seventeen flats were converted for use
as carriers on the Brahmaputra, to supplement
the one solitary flat previously. available.

Successful trials were carried out with
“‘ Airbags’ for lifting sunken craft. An
I.W.T. salvage unit was organised during the
period and was equipped with a number of
these bags.

30. Supplies.

The food scarcity in India* affected the
supply to the Army of indigenous foodstuffs,
and it was not possible to maintain reserves up
to the normal level.

Early in November the situation was serious,
especially in the Fourteenth Army area, Rice
in particular was short, and the ration scale
of rice was reduced by four ounces. This re-
duction was, however, replaced by an equiva-
lent amount of other grain products. Stocks
also of milk, ghee, atta, tinned vegetables and
fruits, and fodder were very low. The shortage
of tinned supplies was due to the difficulties in
obtaining fresh supplies in the forward areas,
so that more tinned substitutes had to be con-
sumed than those for which provision had been
made. The shortages of atta and ghee were
due to the Food Department of the Government
of India being unable to meet the Army’s re-
quirements; and that of fodder to the coal
shortage, since coal is needed for baling pur-

OSes.

The supply situation in the Fourteenth Army
improved latterly, ‘but the stock position cannot
return to normal until the Food Department can
meet the Army’s needs of atta and ghee, and
until demands made to the United Kingdom
for tinned supplies have been met. ,

Attempts to obtain by indigenous production,
foodstuffs that are usually imported—e.g.,
cheese, dehydrated vegetables, jam, etc., have

not_proved as successful as had been hoped.
