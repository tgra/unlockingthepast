6. At 0856 on the  agth DEVONSHIRE detected an aircraft approaching. . A fighter patrol was flown off from FURIOUS but it . quickly became  obvious that DEVONSHIRE had: detected the A/S patrol. The incident was of value in that it brought out various small points of co-operation between R.D.F. ' ships** and the two aircraft carriers. One _ Fulmar landed on when. FURIOUS was stern to wind and crashed.,

7. The whole of  this day  wa very avetcaal. In the afternoon visibility decreased and varied from one mile to five and it was not possible

 asth July.

8. At 0258 ACHATES, which was a-ataitioatit ship of the screen, struck a mine. ANTHONY immediately went to  her assistance, and  ACHATES reported that she was badly damaged forward~but that her engines woul still work. The Squadron  at the same was turned away, and soon after, as it e thicker, it was obvious that with an uncertafin position Seidisfiord could not be made in safetly.

I accordingly turned to the southward looki

for clear weather, and after crossing the .

hundred fathom line turned to is westward at 0730.

 g. The coast was sighted at 0833 but the exact position could not be ascertained as it was shrouded in shifting fog and only the mouritain  tops were occasionally visible. The Force was.turned to the nontkward and. later to the aorth-eastward on soundings. A destroyer was sent inshore at 0951 to try to identify the land, and about r100 an aircraft

* was flown off. Aft about 1130 ANTHONY and ACHATES were sighted, The tow had -

just parted; and they were then about 4o imiles from Seidisfiord.

16. It had been my original intention to send

VICTORIOUS and *SUEFOLK into Reydar-

fiord,* but I  decided that it was unwise to

leave them to make this difficult entrance under the prevailing conditions. At 1400 the Force

  was off Seidisfiord. ..The coast was still com-

pletely shrouded in fog, and INTREPID was sent in and  told to proceed with great caution and endeavour to  find the entrance, of which she was given the approximate bearing. At 1415 Glettinganes Light was sighted and it was possible to fix our position. The Force then proceeded into Seidisfiord,, DEVONSHIRE

 and FURIOUS anchoring above the minefield,

and VICTORIOUS and SUFFOLK joining

. ADVENTURE near the entrance to the fiord.

mz. An As  patrol was carried out by

* destroyers in the mouth of the fiord. On_

anchoring I was told by the Examination Officer, Lieut. R. P. B. Veal, R.N.R., that a U-boat had been operating in the neighbourhood during the preceding two or three days. I was surprised: that I had no information of this from the  Admiral Commanding, Iceland, but I supposed. he thought it was a false teport...My investigations, however, did not at all convince me that it was false and I ordered VICTORIOUS, SUFFOLK and ADVENTURE to move further up the fiord where they had to anchor in forty fathoms. .In the fiord were two A/S trawlers,  WASTWATER and SEALYHAM. I ordered these to carry out an A/S patrol off the entrance.

.12.T had arrived at Seidisfiord eleven hours late on my programme and I decided that it would  be better to hold over the: whole operation for twenty- -four hours and.thus retain its original timing. This had been arranged so as
