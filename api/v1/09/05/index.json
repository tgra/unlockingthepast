            "description": "At 2230 hours on 3rd September the New Zealand Division, with 132 Brigade of 44 Division under command, began to attack southwards as the first stage in closing the gap. They were opposed by go Light Division to the west and Trieste to the east; both fought well and the attack was only partially successful. 5 New Zealand Brigade on the east gained their objective, 28 (Maori) Battalion fighting a particularly gallant action. 132 Brigade were unsuccessful and had heavy losses and to the west 6 New Zealand Brigade also failed to reach their objective. At dawn and again on the evening of 4th September the enemy put in heavy counter-attacks against the three brigades. AH were repulsed but during the night the infantry were withdrawn from their exposed positions, leaving mobile troops to operate southwards. Throughout 4th and 5th September -the retreating enemy was assailed from the north, east and south by our mobile troops and heavily bombed by our aircraft. It was unfortunate that on 4th September another dust-storm made observation difficult and flying impossible during the afternoon. By the evening of 5th September the enemy’s slow and stubborn withdrawal had brought him back to the area of our minefields. Here he turned to stand and it was clear that he intended to make a strong effort to retain this much at least of his gains. Accordingly at 0700 hours of 7th September the battle was called off and Rommel was left in possession of a thin strip of ground which had advanced his positions on the southern flank to a line running from the eastern end of Deir el Munassib to include the peak of Himeimat. The latter was valuable for the excellent observation which it gave as far north as Ruweisat ridge.",

During July and August 120 flying bombs were seen or detected approaching this country from the east: the number actually despatched from that direction was doubtless much greater, for launching the bombs. from aircraft was a tricky business which must have resulted in many premature descents. There followed a lull that lasted until the early hours of the 5th September—four and a half days after the last bomb had come from northern France—when at least another nine bombs approached London from the east. The ‘‘ battle of the bomb ”’ was not yet over; but these nine missiles were Parthian shafts, which marked the end of one phase rather than the beginning of another. They were a postcript to the main attack.",

As soon as this was achieved, and when sufficient landing craft became available, it was proposed to brin, in 78 Division from Sicily, followed by 3 Indian ‘Division from Middle East. The codename for the operation—SLAPSTICK—an undignified term to denote the seizure of the main naval port of Southern Italy, at least illustrates happily the ex tempore nature of the planning. At the same time the Cotrone operation (GOBLET) was cancelled and 5 Corps Headquarters became available. I therefore ordered General Allfrey,* General Officer Commanding to prepare to move to the Heel of Italy with his Corps Headquarters to take over command of such troops as were already there (1 Airborne and such of 78 Division as had landed) and 8 Indian Division when it arrived. His task was defined as to secure a base in the Heel of Italy covering the ports of Taranto and Brindisi, and if possible Bari, with a view to a subsequent advance on my orders. 5 Corps was to come under operational command of my headquarters from 5th September, but I planned to put it at a later date under command of Eighth Army, when the latter should have advanced sufficiently to make contact with it. The result of this decision was that our buildup on the mainland of Italy, no longer restricted to the beaches of Salerno and -the minor ports of Calabria, would be considerably accelerated and Fifth and Eighth Armies would each have an independent axis of supply, on the west and east coast respectively.",

            "description": "sed by the necessity of giving priority to the Seleria operation and there were times when there were considerable differences of opinion between the military and naval staffs. Every effort was made to mount the attack as early as possible; for some time it looked as though the night of 4th/5th September would be the earliest, but we managed eventually to put it forward to 0430 hours on the 3rd. The attack was a complete success. Opposition was light and we met no Germans; by thé morning of D-day Reggio had been captured and in the evening of the same day Bagnara was in our hands, The reinforcement and supply of our forces were exceeding “expectations. | Demolitions were the main factor delaying our advance and there was reason to hope that if these enemy tactics were continued, and providing Highth Army pressed resolutely forward, it would not be as far out of supporting distance of Fifth Army’s Salerno landings as had been feared. It must be emphasized, however, that the roads were few and inferior, the Army was on a light scale of transport and the further it advanced the more difficult would be its maintenance. I will deal with this point later, when I come to discuss the administrative orisis which developed late in September.",
