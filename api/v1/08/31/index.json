A German parachute battalion secured temporary possession Of one of our positions on Ruweisat ridge but 5 Indian Division won back the position by dawn. An attack in the coastal sector against 9 Australian Division was completely unsuccessful. At oreo hours on 31st August, shortly after moonrise, the main striking force began to lift the minefields on the southern flank, in the area from Deir el Munassib to Himeimat. During’ this operation they were enfiladed by the artillery fire of the New Zealand Division and harassed both frontally and from the south by 7 Armoured Division who had excellent shooting in the bright moonlight. In face of the opposition of two artillery regiments and a motor battalion of 4 Light Armoured Brigade it took six hours to clear two gaps for the two German Panzer divisions and it was not until 0930 hours that the Africa Corps was concentrated east of the minefield. Even after éverrunning this obstacle they did not advance with their customary speed, largely because the Italians on their left and the goth Light still further north were encountering even greater difficulties in breaking through™the minefields there which were heavily enfiladed by the New Zealand artillery and under direct fire from 47 Motor Brigade. The two Italian armoured divisions, indeed, hardly came into action at all in this battle. For nearly four hours the two Panzer Divisions were known to be gather-",

Amiens was reached on 31st August, Brussels was entered on 3rd September, and the city of Antwerp on the following day. This advance imposed a considerable strain on administration. Our spearheads were being maintained some 400 miles from the temporary base in Normandy. The greatest strain was thrown on road transport, because only short stretches of railway were available owing to the widespread demolitions. But all difficulties were overcome, and the pace of the pursuit was maintained.",

General Smith, representing General Eisenhower, Admiral Cunningham, Air Marshal Tedder and I were present, and General Clark also attended. It was clear that the Italian Government was prepared to accept any terms we offered but that it was obsessed by the fear that the Germans would be able, when the armistice was announced, to seize control of the whole country in spite of any resistance their troops might offer. German troops continued to pour in; from Naples southwards there were the four divisions which had been evacuated from Sicily, reinforced by two armoured divisions which had not yet been engaged, but there were between ten and twelve divisions in the rest of Italy, including two well placed for a stroke against Rome. Castellano now said that his government could not accept our terms unless we revealed our intentions, so that they could judge whether we were coming in sifficient force.
