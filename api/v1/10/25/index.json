            "description": "356. On 25th October, the Chiefs of Staff — directed that my ‘forces should not be reduced below the minimum required for the maintenance of internal security and for the fulfilment of the condition, which was now accepted, that Middle East Base would ultimately ibe required to support operations in South-east Asia. This decision was clarified on 17th November, when the Chiefs of Staff decided that the primary function of Middle East Base was to support operations in the Mediterranean; units and personnel not required for that commitment must be released. We should eventually bé required as a subsidiary base for South-east Asia Command, but this should not be allowed to influence the drafting away of units and personnel for Italy and 2x Army Group, since we should only be involved gradually in the commitment for Asia, and additional troops would be returned las the commitment ‘became heavier. Nevertheless, no base installation or organisation was to be completely closed, but they were to be kept on a care and maintenance basis, and the army base was not to be reduced so as to prejudice present or future requirements of the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force, or Merchant Navy. On the basis of this directive, Middle East continued until the end of my period in command.",

Sir, ' JT have the honour to forward my report of the opening phase of Operation ‘‘ Neptune,” the period covered being from my appointment as Allied Naval Commander, Expeditionary Force, on 25th October, 1943, to the withdrawal of the Naval Task Force Commanders on 3rd July, 1944. The report is lengthy owing to the need to caver, if only superticially, the very many different aspects of what is acknowJedged to be’ the greatest amphibious operation in history. Because the report is'so bulky, I have decided to write this covering letter in a form which will enable those who wish to do so to obtain a bird’s eye view of the operation ‘as-a whole, including the preparatory period and the build-up,’ without going into detail.",

I had Proposed to use for this x British Infantry Division, which had been originally intended for Eighth Army. The landing craft situation was quite uncertain. I pointed out on 8th November that, on the present programme, my Armies would still be ten thousand vehicles short by xst January and that it would be impossible to mount’ an amphibious operation before 25th December. If the craft were then withdrawn it would be impossible to lift as much as a division with what would remain. However, we decided to go on planning on the assumption that sufficient might be available. The SEXTANT conference was due to open in Cairo on 22nd November and General Eisenhower agreed to press there for the retention of the landing craft which I thought Necessary.",
