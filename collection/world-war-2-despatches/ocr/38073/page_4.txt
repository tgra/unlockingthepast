leadership and masterly handling of the force
by Rear Admiral Philip L. Vian, K.B.E.,
D.S.O., produced a heartening and thoroughly
deserved victory from a situation in which,
had the roles been reversed, it is unthinkable
that the convoy or much of its escort could
have survived.

ENCLOSURE

Office of Rear Admiral Commanding,
Fifteenth Cruiser Squadron.
31st March, 1942.
OPERATION M.G. OnzE—REPort.
(20th March to 24th March, 1942.)
Herewith is forwarded the report on Opera-
tion M.G. One, which includes an account of
an action against Units of the Italian Fleet
in the Gulf of Sirte on 22nd March, 1942.
(Signed) Pxivir Vian,
Rear Admiral Commanding,
Fifteenth Cruiser Squadron.

Part I—NarRRATIVE (GENERAL).

I. The Convoy and Escort arrived in posi-
tion “‘N” (Lat. 034 degs. 10 mins. North,
Long. 020 degs. oo mins. East) at o600, the
appointed time, on 22nd March, 1942.

Westward Passage—Tactical Problems.

2. The problems presented on passage to this
point had been :—

(a) To steer such courses, after being
reported, which, while keeping the ‘force
within fighter range, avoided crossing the
track of the last reported line of advance.
The track used is shown on the strategical
plot: it is known that: one U-boat made
contact.

(0) To afford protection to the A/S Screen
from U-boat attack when, through the slow
speed of $.S. CLAN CAMPBELL, it became
necessary to discontinue the convoy zig-zag.
Protection was afforded by a modified form

of E.Y. (Conduct of the Fleet); the screen zig-
zagged as a whole across the front of the units
screened.

3. At 0800 on 22nd March, 1942,
PENELOPE and LEGION having joined,
course was set 250 degs. 13 knots.

The southerly course was chosen in view of
P.36’s 0131B of 22nd March, received at 0518,
reporting that the enemy had left Taranto; it
was my wish to delay contact until evening,
if’ practicable.

Strategical Background. °

4. In the action to follow, the strategical
considerations governing the courses of action
open to me were: —

(i) The convoy, if it were to reach Malta
at all, must arrive within a very few hours of
daylight.

(ii) Force B could not be oiled at Malta.

(iii) Air reconnaissance from Malta could
not be expected on Day 3.

Tactical Plan,

5. The tactical plan evolved on 4 (i) above
is contained in the Operation Ord.
based on the consideration that the convoy

lers, and was .

must steer west, not south, for the greater part
of the engagement.

6. From 4 (ii) above it was clear that the
enemy must be dyiven off by dark since, if
involved in night operations to the westward,
the oil situation for the return passage to
Alexandria would be most difficult.

7. The probable absence of air reconnais-
sance rendered it imperative that Cruisers and
Fleet Destroyers should be able to move out
from a Cruising Disposition designed to meet
air attack into a disposition suitable for sur-
face action witb the least possible delay.

8. The tactical plan was exercised off
Alexandria by the cruisers and some of the
fleet destroyers about a month before the action.

Air—2and March.

g. No air reconnaissance from Malta proved
practicable. The enemy commenced shadowing
at 0930; air attack began a few minutes later
and was continued, with increasing intensity,
until dusk.

It is estimated that for shadowing, high-level
bombing, torpedo-bombing, and spotting, the
enemy employed 150 aircraft during the day.

First Contact.

ro. H.M.S. EURYALUS, .as in 1805, first
sighted the enemy. Contact was made with
4 ships, range 12 miles, first thought to be
3 battleships, at 1427—.much earlier than was
expected, Cruisers and Fleet Destroyers con-
centrated on their leaders in 5 divisions on a
northerly course, and when at a suitable dis-
tance from the convoy turned east and laid
smoke in accordance with the plan. The gun
action commenced at 1436. By 1444 it was
cléar that the composition of the enemy was in
fact one eight-inch and three six-inch cruisers:
our force was ordered to steer towards the
enemy, who broke off the engagement at 1515
and were lost to sight to the northward.

Second Contact.

rz. At 1637, four enemy ships made contact :
at 1640, three more. The composition of this
force was the battleship LITTORIO, two eight-
inch, three six-inch cruisers and one vessel never
identified.

The same tactics were pursued as before,
our cruisers and destroyers steering easterly
and westerly courses to lay smoke, the enemy
working round to the southwest to cut off the
convoy from Malta. °

In view of the weight of the air attack on
the convoy, I was forced to order the smoke-
laying division—CARLISLE and two Hunts—
to rejoin the convoy and join in its air defence.

This meant that Cruisers and Fleet Destroyers
had to lay smoke, not only to cover themselves,
but also to cover the convoy.

Smoke laid for the latter purpose seriously
hampered gunfire: while CLEOPATRA, nor-
mally at the head of the formation, fired 1,000
rounds in low angle.* PENELOPE, generally
in the centre, fired 64, and ZULU, leading a
division in the rear, none.

12. (CLEOPATRA was hit on the after part

‘of the bridge at 1644, but in turn a palpable

hit on the bridge of a Bolzano was obtained,
probably by DIDO.

* Admivalty footnote: Low angle—i.e, at ship
targets.
