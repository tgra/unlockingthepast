            "description": "During the period while Fifth and Eighth Armies were developing their main attacks x0 Corps, acting as the connecting link between the two forces (but under command of Eighth Army), had been following up and hastening the enemy’s withdrawal on the axis of Route 7z, the Arezzo-Cesena road. Its frontage was very extensive for its small strength but the enemy also was weak in this sector. On 24th September the watershed was gained after a stiff fight for the Mandrioli Pass, for which the enemy put up a strong defence. After this heavy tains prevented further operations until 30th September; the division and the armoured brigade under command were transferred to the Adriatic sector and replaced by 1 Guards Brigade Group and2 Anti-Aircraft Brigade from Fifth Army for use as infantry. With these forces, reinforced ‘by three dismounted armoured car regiments and three independent infantry battalions, it was impossible to force the pace. The enemy, however, continued to withdraw and by 6th October 10 Corps had gained a position astride Route 71 on the upper teaches of the Savio, not much more than fifteen miles from Cesena.",
