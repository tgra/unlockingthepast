SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

if successful, would cut the only escape route
for the wheels and guns of all their forces in
the north. The Commandos were heavily
shelled .and continuously counter-attacked
throughout the next 48 hours. They suffered
considerable casualties, yet yielded no ground.
On the night of 23rd-24th January, 51 Brigade
of 25 Indian Division landed, and one battalion
pushed through the beachhead. The enemy
resisted fiercely from extremely strong bunker
position, and continued to build up against us.

175. Starting on the 25th January, a three
days’ air offensive was arranged to soften
up the main hill features commanding the
road. The bombing was well concentrated
and accurate, and 51 Brigade attacked
on the 28th. One battalion reached and
captured an wunder-feature near Kangaw
Village, but was later called off by the
Brigade Commander as the feature proved
to be completely dominated from the east.
Another battalion secured a precarious footing
on a small feature further east, and held on
despite strong counter-attacks. On the 28th
January alone, the enemy fired about 1,000
shells into our restricted positions, using guns
of all calibres, including 150-millimetre and
25-pounders, the latter presumably captured in
Malaya.
evitable, including some divisional troops.

176. It had become evident that the enemy
defences protecting the road were stronger than
originally anticipated. It was, therefore, de-
cided to abandon further attacks on the hill
features north of the road and concentrate
our forces on the right flank, where, by secur-
ing Kangaw Village and the hills to the east
of it, the object of effectively blocking the road
could be achieved. A strong enemy counter-
attack on the night 28th-29th January was te-
pulsed with loss. On the 29th, we drove the
enemy from Kangaw Village and captured the
small hill which dominated it, and from which
any movement on the road could be prevented
by fire. On the early morning of the 31st
January, the Japanese launched the most
desperate attack of the whole Arakan cam-
paign, but gained no ground and received.
severe punishment. It was now eleven days
since the initial assault on Kangaw had been
made, a period in which our field, medium and
Naval artillery, together with the Thunderbolts
and Spitfires of the R.A.F, had hammered the
enemy without intermission. The capture of
Kangaw and of an important hill to the east of
it which had followed on the Ist February,
marked the turning point of the battle; the
enemy’s escape road from Myohaung and
Minbya had been finally cut. 51 Brigade then
secured a dominating position north of the
road, which effectively prevented any possi-
bility of a break-through from the north. As
will be seen later, 82 (West African) Division
had already begun their task of driving the
Japanese up against this block. This result
could not have been achieved without the work
of Naval craft and beach parties, which con-
tinued to land supplies under heavy fire.

177. I have dealt with this action in some
detail both in justice to the gallantry and en-
durance displayed by our troops and in view
of its strategical importance. It provides a
striking illustration of the principle, that, if you
wish to bring a retreating enemy to battle,-you
must hit him where he is most sensitive. This

we did, by cutting the only road escape route
for all the Japanese forces to the north. In
their struggle to regain this vital area the
Japanese threw in three regiments, as well as
Divisional and Army troops. They suffered
at least 2,000 killed and lost 16 guns, 15 large
motor craft, and quantities of other equipment.
Against this, our casualties were under 600
and the morale of 3 Commando Brigade and
51 Indian Infantry Brigade, after six days of
the most gruelling hand-to-hand fighting, was
very high.

178. On the Ist February, part of 74 Brigade
crossed the Min Chaung from the neck of the
Myebon Peninsula, and, after establishing
themselves on the east bank, launched opera-
tions against the Japanese positions two miles
north-west of Kangaw. Faced with encircle-
ment by the rapid advance south of 82 (West
African) Division (which I will shortly de-
scribe), the enemy began to withdraw into the
mountains to the east. By the 8th February,
the leading brigade {the 2nd) of 82 (West
African) Division was in contact with the
enemy nine miles north of Kangaw, but the
Japanese continued to resist as the jaws of the
trap closed. On the 9th, 2 (West African)
Brigade passed under command of 25 Indian
Division and a series of co-ordinated attacks
were made on successive enemy positions. It
took another nine days before the whole area
was cleared. The toll of captured guns rose
to 26, but the enemy threw all their remaining
artillery into the chaungs, and gun muzzles
protruding from the water bore silent witness
to the magnitude of the Japanese disaster.

179. 51 Brigade of 25 Indian Division and
3 Commando Brigade were now withdrawn
from operations, as part of the phasing-out
programme of 15 Indian Corps, which was to
take place before the monsoon. 53 Brigade,
after completing its task of clearing the chaung
country between Akyab and Minbya, had
already been concentrated in Myebon. Thus
25 Indian Division was left with two brigades
in the area, the 53rd and the 74th.

180. While operations to close the Japanese
escape toad at Kangaw were in progress, the
West Africans were engaged in driving the
enemy in the.Kaladan Valley south on to the
Kangaw block. It will be recalled (vide para-
graphs 157 and 158) that by the 10th January,
81 (West African) Division was fighting in the
hills about 15 miles north-north-west of
Myohaung, with 4 Brigade of 82 (West African)
Division under command, at Apaukwa, which
lies on the Kaladan River 16 miles north-west
of Myohaung. Care had to be taken at this
stage to avoid forcing the enemy into making
a too early withdrawal before the trap was
closed by 25 Indian Division in his rear. The
Kangaw landing was timed for the 22nd
January, and it was therefore decided to clear
Myohaung by a determined drive on the 25th.

181. Operations southwards towards
Myohaung began on the 15th January. By
the 19th, Teinnyo had been occupied, and our
forward troops were established six miles north
of Myohaung. Opposition continued stubborn
for the next four days, particularly east of the
toad, and there were no signs of the enemy
tesistance weakening, though we continued to
press forward. Early on the 23rd January,
