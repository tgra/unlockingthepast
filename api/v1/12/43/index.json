            "description": "Shortly afterwards two Japanese launches flying a white flag crossed the harbour. The delegation brought written proposals for sur- * render, similar to those of 43th December. It \u2018was thought that the Japanese supposed our morale to be shaken. The proposals were signed by Lt.-General Sakai and the Naval \u2018C.-in-C  Vice-Admiral Niimi. The envoys appeared genuinely surprised and disconcerted when the proposals were again summarily re- jected. They left with the hint that future \u2018bombardments might not be so discriminate."
