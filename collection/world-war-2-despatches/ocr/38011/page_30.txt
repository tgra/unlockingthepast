specially to bring to notice the services of the
following officers: —

Captain L. E. H. Maund, R.N. and:Com-
mander G. Hubback, R.N. were closely
associated with the operations and planning
side of my headquarters throughout, the
operations, and rendered invaluable assist-
ance to me and my staff and to the troops,
British and French.

Group Captain M. Moore, O.B.E., R.A.F.,
commanded the air component and it is due
very largely to his energy, determination and
tactical ability, first that it so quickly and
decisively gained superiority over the enemy
air forces.

T cannot speak too highly of this officer’s
services.

Brigadier C. McV. Gubbins, D.S.O. com-
manded the forces round ‘Bodo in most diffi-
eult circumstances with the greatest skill and
determination, and it was largely due to his
devoted efforts that a premature withdrawal,
which might have seriously compromised
the whole campaign, did not occur in this
area.

Brigadier J. A. H. Gammell, D.S.O.,
M.-C. acted throughout as my Brigadier
General Staff and Chief Staff Officer with
marked success. His energy, determination
and devotion to duty were remarkable, and
the success of the operations was due in no
smali measure to his untiring efforts.

Brigadier R. M. Wootten, M.C. as my
chief administrative staff officer, bore
practically the entire burden of responsibility
for coping with the many and varied problems
to which the rapid changes of policy gave
rise. The results of his work speak for them-
selves and, in my opinion, stamp him as an
officer of outstanding ability and firmness of
character.

SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 10 JULY, 1947

112. I need not again mention the services of
General Bethouart, commanding the Franco-
‘Polish Expeditionary Force, as their outstand-
ing nature should be evident from the accounts
-of the operations conducted by him. I would,
however, like to bring to notice, the work of
‘Major D. A.W. Watney, O.B.E., liaison officer
with General Bethouart, whose fluent know-
‘ledge of French and sound tactical sense, added
to’ ‘his, quick understanding and engaging
personality, were largely responsible for the
cordial and constant co-operation which
obtained between- my headquarters, French
headquarters, and the Royal Navy.

113. Ihave to acknowledge the close and un-
failing support I received, often in very diffi-

cult circumstances, from the following
Norwegian officers: —
General Rugé. Commander-in-Chief,

Norwegian Army.
General Fleischer. .

Norwegian Division.
Colonel H. Finne.

Headquarters.

114. Finally, I wish to record my deep
sense of gratitude to the Commander-in-Chief,
Admiral of the Fleet the Earl of Cork and
Orrery, G.C.B., G.C.V.O., under whom I
served throughout the campaign, for his quick
understanding of the problems before me, his
unfailing consideration, and the generous and
ready help which he gave me on all occasions,
thereby making it possible for me to carry out
