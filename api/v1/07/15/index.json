The task of Balkan Air Force was completed and on 8th May instructions were issued by the Supreme Allied Commander that the A.O.C. should cease to exercise co-ordinating functions in respect of trans-Adriatic operations. Until its final disbandment on 15th July, 1945, Headquarters, Balkan Air Force, therefore con- tinued as an ordinary R.A.F, Headquarters with responsibility only for the control of its various Wings and units."

            "description": "20. In\u2019Kenya a similar policy of holding the frontier posts for as long as possible was fol- lowed. The principal engagement took place at Moyale, where a company of the King\u2019s African Rifles held the small fort on the British side of the frontier for several: weeks against an Italian force which amounted to about a brigade. It was not until a second Italian brigade was brought up that it was decided to withdraw the Company, which was successfully done on 15th July, although the enemy had by this time practically surrounded the post."

On visiting that port on 15th July I found a certain amount of confusion existing in the naval organisation which was absorbing the attention of Rear-Admiral McGrigor, to the detriment of the performance of his functions as Flag Officer Sicily. As I was anxious that he should proceed to and carry out these functions in Augusta without further"

            "description": "to the improved results achieved by the fighters after the first week in July. By the 15th July I was using a tofal of thirteen single-engined and nine twin-engined (Mosquito) squadrons against flying bombs. Six of the Mosquito squadrons alternated between this work and operations over the lodgment area, two of them doing bomber-supp\u00e9rt work as well. I found that, while some pilots took readily to the work of shooting down flying bombs, the majority preferred shooting down enemy aircraft - over France. To instil enthusiasm for the novel and impersonal business of shooting at pilotless missiles, and ensure that pilots were not kept long enough at the task to make them stale, was not the least of my anxieties."

London had endured heavier bombing than this in 1940; but for various reasons an intermittent drizzle of malig- nant robots seemed harder to bear than the storm and thunder of the \u201c Blitz\u2019.

Between the 13th June and the 15th July it killed about 3,000 people, seriously injured 10,000, and irreparably damaged 13,000 houses. Although no objectives of vital importance to the war effort were hit, many public buildings such as churches, hospitals, and schools appeared in the casualty list."

These continued until, on rst July, a letter was received from the Italian Comman- der asking for a meeting which was fixed for 1100 hours on 2nd July. . At this meeting terms of surrender were discussed and settled. Our troops entered Debra Tabor on 3rd July and took over all important installations. The enemy garrison marched out on 6th July, and, after receiving the honours of war, laid down their arms. Patriots occupied the forts and native quarters. Prisoners captured were 2,400 Halians, 2,000 natives and a miscellaneous collection of M.T., sufficient to lift x,200 men. Six guns and a quantity of ammunition were also taken. The surrender of Debra Tabor was strange, considering the Italian Commander at Gondar intended to relieve this garrison on 15th July."

It is unlikely that they will produce any major effort until their crops are harvested. Major Ringrose, his bodyguard, and one company of 3 Ethiopian Battalion attacked the enemy positions at Cianch be- tween Wolchefit and Bosa on 26th August capturing 108 Italians, 8 natives and some mortars and machine-guns, The patriot forces under, Major Douglas have moved closer to Gondar and, supported by the S.A.A.F., are - increasing their pressure on Gondar from this direction. Communications at the moment are , bad, and news is only coming through by runner, taking in some cases five or six days to reach Asmara. '"

            "description": "Army had been directed (on 15th July) to pre- pare plans for an unopposed landing in Naples. This directive was still in force, but priority had now been shifted to the operation against Taranto, Nevertheless, the great prize of the capture of Naples still glittered; it would give us control of an area capable of maintaining any Allied force which could be placed in Italy in 1943, it would establish our armies well on the road to Rome and it would oblige the Ger- mans to withdraw not only from Calabria but probably from Apulia as well. But if the required conditions were unfulfilled there were weighty arguments against an assault landing in so well defended an area; in particular the lack of air cover and the time which must elapse before our troops advancing from Calabria could make contact. We were likely to capture Cotrone, from which we could cover operations against Taranto, sooner than Scalea, the first place from which we could cover Naples; exploitation overland from Cotrone to Taranto would be much easier than from Scalea to Naples; for the present the priority of the Taranto operations must stand."
