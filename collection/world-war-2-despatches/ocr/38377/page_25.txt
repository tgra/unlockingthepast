. 240°, 2,000 yards, which was confirmed as a
submarine.

She immediately attacked, held contact up
to 100 yards, and fired a 14- charge shallow
pattern at 0933.

A black circular buoy with electric cable
attached came to the surface after’ this attack;
at 0945 a loud underwater explosion was heard
and felt, and oil started to come to the surface.

\ GURKHA was unable to regain contact.

LEGION, who was hunting with GURKHA,

, ._ Among the wreckage picked up were an
‘ Italian dictionary, a mattress pillow, numerous
pieces of wood, some with bright screws, and
a piece of human scalp attached to a piece
of wood by a splinter of metal, The interiors
‘of the dictionary, pillow and mattress were
dry.
There appears to be no reasonable cause to
doubt that an Italian U-Boat was destroyed by
GURKHA and LEGION.*

Convoy M.G.2.—Passage from Malta

Gibraltar.

164. As stated earlier (paragraph 33) the first
ship, S.S. MELBOURNE STAR, sailed from
Malta at noon on 26th September (D.2).

The remaining two ships, S.S. PORT

- CHALMERS and S.S. CITY OF PRETORIA,

‘ left Malta at 1030 on 27th September (D.3),
escorted until 1930 by GLOXINIA.

165. After an uneventful passage MEL-
BOURNE STAR arrived at Gibraltar at 0700
on 29th September (D.5).

166, PORT CHALMERS and CITY OF
PRETORIA were reported by Italian aircraft
at 1200/27, shortly after leaving Malta. No
enemy surface craft or aircraft were seen until
2320, when what was believed to be an E-Boat
was sighted by PORT CHALMERS, who was
following in the wake of CITY OF
PRETORIA. The enemy craft when . first
sighted by PORT CHALMERS was lying
stopped” 3-400 yards on the port beam of
CITY OF PRETORIA, who saw nothing except
gunfire from her consort.

PORT CHALMERS sheered off to starboard,
and 10 minutes after fiisti ‘sighting heard E-Boat
engines approaching from'the port quarter; she
turned to starboard to bring the enemy astern,
and opened fire with her 4-inch gun at the,
enemy's bow wave.

The enemy opened fire at PORT
CHALMERS with her machine-gun, but
scored no hits, and after PORT CHALMERS
had fired six rounds of 4-inch, the enemy
crossed astern and made off. PORT

CHALMERS then resumed her station astern
of CITY OF PRETORIA.
This action took place 15 miles S.S.W. of

Pantellaria. 2c

167. At 0535/28 (D.4) the Commodore of
the Convoy ordered PORT CHALMERS to part
company. The latter then proceeded at full
speed, wearing French colours.

168. An Italian reconnaissance seaplane
(Cant 506) approached from the direction of
the French coast ,and circled CITY ae
PRETORIA at o915 vi 28, subsequently makin 3
off to the westward and paying POR
CHALMERS the same attention. Both ships
were wearing French colours and had taken
care to keep all service personnel out of sight.
They were fully ready for action, but did not
open fire as the aircraft took no offensive
action. a

16g. At 1015/28 CITY OF PRETORIA was
circled several times by a large 3-engined sea-
plane, with distinct French markings, which
approached from Bizerta. An ‘hour and a half
later, when approaching the Galita Channel,
‘CITY OF PRETORIA sighted an Italian twin-
engined seaplane stopped on the water, five
miles to the north. She lost sight of this air-
craft at 1215.

170. PORT CHALMERS sighted neither of :
these aircraft and was left alone until 1555,
when she was circled by an Italian Breda 20,
which did not attack, although the Master
considers she could not have been deceived
‘by the French colours.

171. CITY OF PRETORIA was attacked at
1725/28 by three T/B aircraft. As these
approached with obviously hostile intentions,
British colours were hoisted and fire opened
as soon as the leader came in range. There
is good reason to suppose the leading aircraft
was damaged.

By skilful handling, all three seeepedtous.y were
avoided. ‘While one aircraft was machine-
gunning the ship at long range, a submarine
periscope was reported on the starboagd quarter
by two independent lookouts.

Three smoke floats and a depth charge set
to 150 feet were dro] , and under cover
of smoke CITY OF PRETORIA tured away.

She signalled ‘‘ Help Major ’’ at 1730, and
“(Major now all right ’’ three quarters of.an
hour later.

yy2z. As CITY OF PRETORIA was
approaching Cape de Gata at 0200/30 (D.6)
‘an unidentified vessel, possibly a submarine,
was seen to be following. Two or three rapid
shots, followed by a dull explosion, were heard.
CITY OF PRETORIA made smoke and
dropped smoke floats and then made close in
to Almeria Bay, into territorial waters, thus
shaking off ‘her pursuer.

173. PORT CHALMERS arrived at Gibraltar
at 0900/30, followed during the afternoon by
CITY OF PRETORIA.

174. The able and resolute handling of both
PORT CHALMERS’ and CITY OF
PRETORIA in successfully driving off enemy
attacks deserves high praise.
