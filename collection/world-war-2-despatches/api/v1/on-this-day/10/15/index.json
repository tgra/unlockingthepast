            "description": "207. Nevertheless, in spite of all we could do, the enemy continued methodically to consolidate his position in the smaller islands. Naxos and Paros were occupied on 12th October, and on 15th October Simi, which we had evacuated two days before after heavy dive-bombing raids had made the position untenable, was occupied by the enemy. The German Air Force was well dispersed; its heavy bombers were concentrated at Eleusis, its fighters at Kalamaki and Argos, its divebombers at Megara and Marizza, and from these bases constant attacks were made on Leros. Delayed-action bombs put Portolago Bay, on Leros, temporarily out of action on 16th October, and on 17th and 18th October, Castelrosso was bombed for the first time since our occupation."

Ships BELVOIR (Lieutenant J. F. D. Bush, D.S.C., R.N.) and BEAUFORT (Lieutenant-Commander _ Sir Standish O G. Roche, Bt., D.S.O.) were ordered to intercept and destroy it. They were reported and heavily attacked by J.U. 88s and J.U. 87s though fortunately without incurring damage, and the convoy was diverted to the northward, thereby evading our force who had to withdraw to the southward due to lack of fuel. H.M. Ships PHEOBE (Captain C. P. Frend, R.N.), FAULKNOR (Captain M. S. Thomas, D.S.O., R.N.) and FURY who entered the Aegean at dark, continued to search, but made no sighting and had to withdraw from the Aegean before daylight. At 1300B on x6th October, H.M. Submarine TORBAY (Lieutenant R. J. Clutterbuck, R.N.) sighted the convoy to the northward of Levitha and sank one of the merchant ships. During the night of the r6th/r7th, H.M.S. HURSLEY (LieutenantCommander W, J. P. Church, D.S.O., D.S.C., R.N.) and H.H.M.S. MIAOULIS (Commander E. Boudouris, R.H.N.) searched Kos roads and the east side of Kalymnos, setting a small merchant ship on fire in Port Vathi, sinking an E-boat and a landing craft and setting a sloop"

The decision to entrust this task to a staff division of Supreme Headquarters itself, and not to the Allied Expeditionary Air Force, foreshadowed the imminent demise of the subsidiary formation. Now that the Allied Armies were firmly established on the Continent, that body, which had been formed primarily to plan and supervise air operations in support of the assault and build-up, was considered to have fulfilled its purpose. On the 15th October, therefore, the Allied Expeditionary Air Force was formally disbanded. Consequently my Command re-named Fighter Command and the Second Tactical Air Force became independent formations, Thereupon the constitutional responsibility for the air defence of the United Kingdom which had hitherto rested on Air Chief Marshal Leigh-Mallory devolved upon me, with this difference: I had no control over the Second Tactical Air Force. A situation in which I was responsible for defending the country against long-range rockets while responsibility for conducting the only countermeasure open to a fighter force was exercised by another Command, not under my control, was no longer merely inconvenient; it was clearly untenable."

I cannot sufficiently express my admiration for the way in which the troops of Fifth Army, in spite of the most arduous and exhausting conditions, in mud and snow, returned again and again to the attack on one mountain position after another, regardless of the heavy and continuous losses which thinned their ranks. Casualties had been mounting steadily during the longdrawn-out offensive, more particularly in II Corps, and, as with Eighth Army, a serious replacement crisis had arisen. On oth October General Clark informed me that by-rst November, at the present rate of wastage, he would be eight thousand infantry short for his United States divisions which would mean a shortage of seventy-five men per rifle company. He had already asked  General Devers,* Deputy Supreme Commander, if he could be allotted replacements from the pool scheduled . for Seventh Ammy, which was in the theatre. General Devers did not feel able to comply with this request and on 15th October, as a last resort, I signalled personally to General Eisenhower to ask him if he could allot Fifth Army three thousand replacements from the resources of the European Theatre of Operations. This was rather a roundabout method, as"

The existing 50 Indian Parachute Brigade formed the nucleus of this new Division, and this formation was the one which had been originally earmarked to take part in operations in Burma to assist 33 Corps. It had, however, been used in an infantry rdle in the Imphal battle and had suffered severely. It had not been fully reconstituted and so was not now available.
