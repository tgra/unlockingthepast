There were indications that the Persians did not intend to satisfy our demands for the surrender of Axis nationals and on 14th Sep- tember the War Office intimated that a joint Anglo-Russian advance to Teheran would begin as soon as mutual arrangements with the Russian Commander had been campleted. The Russians agreed to a simultaneous entry into Teheran at 1500 hours on 17th September by the British from the South and the Russians from the East and West. This was carried out according to plan, relations between our troops and the Russians were most cordial."

There was a strong suspicion at this time that the German raiders were using two pro- minent landmarks\u2014the Isle of Dogs and Hyde Park\u2014over which they turned to their various objectives. Two geographical barrages, de- signed to explode over these two points, were, therefore, worked out and were fired for the first time on the night 26th/27th September, 1940. There was no marked improvement in the number of raiders destroyed but the plan had the advantage of controlling the ammu- nition expenditure. ;"

The arrangements for concentration and embarkation were delegated very largely to Headquarters Tripolitania District, owing to the great distance from the main base at which the operation had to be mounted, and in spite of the fact that a single port was used for the embarkation of so large a force, and of the dis- tance from main base, the task was success- fully accomplished. For the assault, nine per- sonnel ships, eight stores ships and ten L.S.Ts. sailed from Tripoli on 7th September, whilst a further 170 L.S.Ts, completed the Corps by mid-November. In all, including follow-up shipping, some 73,000 men, 14,000 vehicles, 600 guns and 400 tanks were embarked from Tripoli, involving the use of 342 vessels."

            "description": "At 2230 hours on 3rd September the New Zealand Division, with 132 Brigade of 44 Divi- sion under command, began to attack south- wards as the first stage in closing the gap. They were opposed by go Light Division to the west and Trieste to the east; both fought well and the attack was only partially successful. 5 New Zealand Brigade on the east gained their objective, 28 (Maori) Battalion fighting a particularly gallant action. 132 Brigade were unsuccessful and had heavy losses and to the west 6 New Zealand Brigade also failed to reach their objective. At dawn and again on the evening of 4th September the enemy put in heavy counter-attacks against the three brigades. AH were repulsed but during the night the infantry were withdrawn from their exposed positions, leaving mobile troops to operate southwards. Throughout 4th and 5th September -the retreating enemy was assailed from the north, east and south by our mobile troops and heavily bombed by our aircraft. It was unfortunate that on 4th September an- other dust-storm made observation difficult and flying impossible during the afternoon. By the evening of 5th September the enemy\u2019s slow and stubborn withdrawal had brought him back to the area of our minefields. Here he turned to stand and it was clear that he intended to make a strong effort to retain this much at least of his gains. Accordingly at 0700 hours of 7th September the battle was called off and Rommel was left in possession of a thin strip of ground which had advanced his posi- tions on the southern flank to a line running from the eastern end of Deir el Munassib to include the peak of Himeimat. The latter was valuable for the excellent observation which it gave as far north as Ruweisat ridge."

In the railway corridor, 36 Division, which had replaced Special Force, made steady progress; it cap- tured Hopin on 7th September and by 10th December had reached the junction at Indaw. A drive southwards from Myitkyina carried Chinese units to Bhamo at approximately the same time. Thus by the end of the monsoon period the forces of the Northern Combat Area Command were in a position seriously to threaten the right flank of the enemy ele- ments facing the Fourteenth Army."

Only two assets now remuined to Kesselring to retrieve the situation: the excellence of his Jateral communications and the fact that the \u201c* Gothic\u2019\u2019\u2019 line had been built on the forward slopes of the range. The importance of the former factor in allowing a rapid reinforcement I have aeady emphasized; the latter meant that there was still one more ridge between the Allies and the plains, known from the village on its summit as the Coriano ridge. The Canadians were already over the Conca, on 2nd September, and 5 Corps were about to pass ir Armoured Division \u2018through in a dash for the flat country beyond. Just in time Kesselring succeeded in manning the Coriano ridge with\u2019 1 Parachute, 26 Panzer and 29 Panzer Grenadier Divisions; these three ex- cellent divisions, aided by very heavy rain from 5th to 7th September, resisted all attacks between the 4th and the 12th both on the ridge itself and on its southern flank at Gemmano. As Eighth Army\u2019s offensive developed its full extent the enemy was forced to economize strength on the remainder of his front by withdrawing into the \u2018Gothic \u2019\u2019 line. This was essential if he were to be able to make further reinforcements avajlable for his left; it was also a natural measure of. precaution in case a real _break- through was achieved for, apart from LXXVI Corps, now engaged with Eighth Army, the rest of the German troops were still well south of the watershed of the Apennines. The with- drawal began on 30th August. LI Mountain Corps, between Urbino and Pontassieve, moved straight back into the line on a timed pro- gramme, releasing one division for the central sector, and 10 Corps, following up, made con- tact with the line on 3rd September. At the same time the enemy opposite Fifth Army began to pull back. On the extreme right they went back almost directly into the \u2018\u2018 Gothic \u201d\u2019 line. Opposite 13 Corps, however, the enemy stabilized on 3rd September on the line of hills north of Florence: Monte Morello, Monte Senario, Monte Calvana and Monte Giovi. IV Corps followed up across the Arno on 31st August and II Corps on Ist September. Little Tesistance was met and we were able to occupy"
