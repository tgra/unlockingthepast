SUPPLEMENT ‘to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 5 APRIL, 1951

The second squadron of the first wing (No. 849
Squadron) reported being attacked on the run
in to the target, when they were without close
escort of fighters.

35. The enemy’s A.A. defences had been
improved both in quantity and quality since the
first strike. The first squadron to go in (No.
857 Squadron) bore the brunt of the A.A. fire
and was lucky not to suffer heavier losses.

36. The balloon barrage was reported to be
less severe than at Pladjoe and again many
Avengers dived through the balloons to drop
their bombs at low altitude. Two aircraft of
No. 854 Squadron were lost through colliding
with balloon cables.

37. The bombing results were excellent and
bombs were concentrated in each of the target
areas: important plants which were specific
targets received direct hits. Photographs taken
during and after the attack show a sea of
flames in both the distillery and the power
house areas.

38. The withdrawal round to the southwards
gave the Avengers a long passage back to the
tendezvous.

No. 854 Squadron in particular received
little support from our escorting fighters during
this period and all the aircraft of the squadron
were attacked by hostile fighters. The standard
of Japanese air gunnery was reported as poor:
though all the Avengers suffered some damage
none were shot down. Lieutenant (A) G. J.
Conolly, R.N.V.R., distinguished himself by
shooting down a Tojo* with an Avenger’s front
guns.

39. The form up at the rendezvous was
carried out expeditiously, and the striking force
returned to the fleet without being further
attacked, The total losses over the target were
four Avengers, one Firefly and one Corsair.

40. In the course of air combats the fighter
escort claimed seven enemy fighters destroyed
and three probably destroyed.

-41. As a result of damage from enemy
fighters and A.A. fire, nine aircraft of the strike
had to ditch ; the crews of eight were recovered.

42. An armed reconnaissance of Mana air-
field by Fireflies found that the only form of
activity was a football match.

43. The strike started to land on at 1010,
landing on being completed at 1100.

Own and Enemy Aircraft Losses

44. Our own losses of aircraft from all
causes in both strikes totalled 41; 16 by enemy
action, 11 by ditching, and 14 in deck crashes,
etc. 38 enemy aircraft were claimed destroyed
on the ground, with 30 certainly and 7 prob-
ably destroyed in the air.

Enemy Air Activity Round Fleet—29th

January

45. There was no radar indication of any
enemy aircraft in the vicinity of the fleet until
0900. This bogey} was sighted by Seafires at
0917: it was a fast single engined aircraft
which escaped by diving into clouds.

46. At 0939 a few enemy aircraft approached
from the north. They probably did not sight

the fleet, which was then under low cloud.
Seafires were sent to intercept and shot down
one Dinah* twenty-eight miles west of the fleet.

47. At 1026 a group of twelve plus enemy
aircraft were reported approaching from the
north. Corsairs and Seafires of the fighter
patrols were vectored out. The Corsairs
Teported sighting two single engined enemy
aircraft carrying bombs which were chased far
to the eastward. One Corsair from VIC-
TORIOUS failed to return.

48. At 1028 a few enemy planes were
detected passing the fleet on a southerly track
some 40 miles to seaward. No fighters were
sent to intercept as the enemy seemed to have
no knowledge of the fleet’s position.

49. At 1152 a raid was detected approaching
low from the southward and seven Seafires of
the low patrol were sent to intercept. This
Seafire patrol was flying wide of the fleet to
the northward when given their first vector.
They intercepted the raid as it was sighted from
the fleet. The enemy formation, which was
originally reported by radar as “one large”,
consisted of one Helen} and six Sallies.

50. The Combat Air Patrol was due to be
changed at this time and three Helicats took
- from INDOMITABLE as the ship opened

51. The standard of fire discipline and fire
control in the fleet was low. The enemy attack
was broken up by our fighters, which dived in
a most determined manner through our own
anti-aircraft fire and pressed in to close range
of the enemy bombers.

52. The enemy formation attacked from the
port quarter of the fleet upwind, height about
50 feet. They broke up when the Seafires inter-
cepted and appeared to try to carry out low-
level bombing attacks on ILLUSTRIOUS and
INDEFATIGABLE. From the form of the
attack when it first developed it was thought
that the enemy aircraft were carrying torpedoes
and the fleet was accordingly manceuvred so
as to present a difficult torpedo target.

53. Most of the attackers succeeded in
reaching the main body- and were shot down
close to the ships. Of the seven aircraft which
attacked, certainly six and probably all seven
were destroyed. It is believed that the enemy-
losses were accounted for by

Seafires—two or three
Seafires and Corsairs—one
Seafires and Hellcats—one
Helicats—one
gunfire—one,

54, During the attack ILLUSTRIOUS was
struck by two shells fired by our own forces
and suffered 12 fatal casualties and 21
wounded.

55. From 1212 to 1430 the fleet was
apparently shadowed by an aircraft which re-
mained 45 to 60 miles to the eastward. It is
possible that this aircraft may have been keep-
ing track of us by receiving either our radar
or our beacon transmissions.

56. At 1818, a quarter of an hour before
sunset, a single aircraft approached from the
north-eastward at 15,000 feet. VICTORIOUS’
