SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON

28 Field Regiment was under orders to sail for
the Middle East, and could not be retained in
the forward area later than rgth July.

RAF.

Since this operation, the pressure on Gondar
and the Wolchefit Pass has been maintained
mainly by the R.A.F. and S.A.A.F. On
completion of their operations in the Galla
Sidamo, the S.A.A-F. was placed at the dis-
posal of 203 Group R.A.F.

Patriot Activity. :

Since 15th July patriot activity has died
down. The weather is bad and the patriots
are anxious about the cultivation of their
crops. It is unlikely that they will produce
any major effort until their crops are
harvested. Major Ringrose, his bodyguard,
and one company of 3 Ethiopian Battalion
attacked the enemy positions at Cianch be-
tween Wolchefit and Bosa on 26th August
capturing 108 Italians, 8 natives and some
mortars and machine-guns, The patriot forces
under, Major Douglas have moved closer to
Gondar and, supported by the S.A.A.F., are
- increasing their pressure on Gondar from this
direction. Communications at the moment are
, bad, and news is only coming through by
runner, taking in some cases five or six days
to reach Asmara. '

Part VII.

Operations in the Blue Nile Frontier Area and

Baro Salient.

Along their western frontier, the Italians had
maintained garrisons covering the entrances
into Ethiopia. During the summer and autumn
of 1940, the strength of the Sudan Defence
Force had not allowed more than defensive
patrolling by Police and ‘‘ Armed Friendlies.”
Many of these patrols were led iby Political
Officers of the Sudan Civil Service, who were
not professional soldiers, but who displayed
commendable skill and courage in this frontier
patrol work. The efforts of these small parties
were assisted by the R.A.F. who effectively
bombed enemy garrisons and carried on a leafiet
and propaganda war, mainly directed against
his native troops, whenever aircraft could be
made available.

Tt was not until January r94z that sufficient
reinforcements in the form of 2/6 King’s
African Rifles and the Belgian Contingent in
the Sudan allowed of more active operations
being undertaken in the frontier area.

It was important that the enemy’s frontier
posts in the neighbourheod of the Blue Nile
should be removed so that the camel routes
into Ethiopia could be opened for the supply
and maintenance of the rebellion, which could
not have flourished without a steady flow of
arms, money and material from the Sudan. The
removal of the enemy forces from this area
automatically lessened the threat against the
Nile L. of C. and the Sudan Railway, which,
if cut about the Sennar Dam, would have left
the troops operating in the Butana Bridge and
Gallabat areas isolated from Khartoum.

On oth January our patrols entered Guba,
the Italian frontier post covering the north bank
of the Blue Nile. The post was found deserted,
and a considerable quantity of war material
was discovered. This post had been induced
to evacuate by air action, and the action of
armed friendlies.

GAZETTE, 10 JULY, 1946 3551
On 2oth January 5 Patrol Company, Fron-
tier Battalion, encountered a force of the enemy
at the Shogali crossing of the Blue Nile. A
sharp action ensued, the enemy withdrawing
towards Asosa. On 12th February Kurmuk
was captured'by detachments 2/6 K.A.R. and
Sudan Frontier Police. This cleared the last
Italians out of the Sudan. Operations con-
tinued with the object of attacking Asosa.

Topography.

The Sudan, east of the White Nile, is mainly
flat grass country. As the frontier is approached,
the country rises into foothills of considerable
size, and, about Asosa and Afodu, is moun-
tainous, Afodu itself being on top of an
escarpment.

At this time 2/6 K.A.R. were spread trom
Kurmuk to the ‘Baro Salient, a distance of over
200 miles. The Belgian Contingent was dis-
posed behind the K.A.R. protecting the White
Nile. Advancing from the north based on
Roseires, the Eastern Arab Corps, Sudan
Defence Force, with 5 Patrol Company, Frontier
Battalion, and C Troop Light Artillery Bat-
tery, S-D.F., under command were co-operat-
ing with the northern detachment 2/6 K.A.R.
Between 14th February and 9th March Qeissan
and Belad Deroz were captured by the Sudan
Defence Force, and, on 9th March, after heavy
fighting, the escarpment at Afodu was stormed
by the Eastern Arab Corps with two companies
2/6 K.A.R. under command. Guns and stores,
and some M.T. fell into their hands. The ad-
vance was immediately pressed on towards
Asosa.

In the meantime a detachment of the Belgians
had moved forward, and was in a position
facing Asosa from the south. Unfortunately
the Belgian Contingent, which had been ordered
to cut the road east of Asosa, was too late,
and a considerable body of the enemy escaped.

After the fall of Asosa the whole of the Blue
Nile frontier was cleared and open for the
passage of camel caravans to the Gojjam. Units
of the Eastern Arab Corps were moved to the
area east of Gallabat, as has been previously
described.

Operations against Gambela.

The next important centre of enemy resist-
ance was in the area Gambela-Dembi Dollo.
A detachment of 2/6 K.A-R. which had been
operating at Asosa now marched south-east,
encountering strong enemy positions on the
Dabus River based on Mendi. By zoth March
the remainder of 2/6 K.A/R. had been concen-
trated, and was about three miles west of Gam-
bela. Here they were subjected to heavy
attacks by enemy aircraft. On 23rd March the
Belgian Battalion from the Asosa area was also
moved south to operate against Gambela, and
from now on the whole of the Belgian Contin-
gent, later brought up to three battalions and
one field battery, operated in this area. On
zand March 2/6 K.A.R. with that portion of
the Belgian Contingent which had been moved
forward, attacked Gambela and, after severe
fighting, captured it on the 23rd. Here again
the enemy escaped.

From Gambela the Belgian Contingent
patrolled towards ‘Dembi Dollo, while 2/6
K.A.R. moved north to the Dabus River and
Ghidame. The enemy’s position at Dembi
Dollo was found to be strong. Throughout
April there was considerable fighting here, with
