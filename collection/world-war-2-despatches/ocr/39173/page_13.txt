SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951

open the Tamu-Palel road westwards, and
against 31 Division which was operating
against Kohima. The four Vengeance squad-
rons flew over 2,000 sorties during this month.
Their bombing was extremely accurate, and
in addition to direct support tasks they
attacked enemy dumps and camps. On the
8th April No. 82 Squadron carried out its
Jast operations on this front and then rejoined
No. 224 Group. Over 750 sorties were flown
by Hurricanes in offensive sorties against fleet-
ing targets and troop positions.

90. In May, direct support operations centred
around Kohima, where the town itself and the
Aradura Spur to the south were eventually
cleared of the enemy after intensive attacks
by Vengeances and Hurricane fighter-bombers
against bunker positions and slit trenches. To
the south of Imphal, where the enemy made
several attacks on the Tiddim road from the
west and also on Bishenpur, fighter-bombers
and ground-attack fighters attacked concentra-
tions of enemy troops and vehicles. Further
south on the Tiddim road, Moirang was also
attacked by fighter-bombers and Vengeances.

ing this month Vengeances flew over 1,000
sorties on the 4 and 33 Corps fronts and Hurri-
cane fighter-bombers 1.693.

91. In this battle the Strategic Air Force
again assisted With its heavier striking power.
In May the Wellingtons of Nos. 99 and 215
Squadrons flew 125 sorties against tactical tar-
gets, American Liberators (B.24) 12, and
Mitchells (B. 25) 106. Apart from one attack
on the Mintha-Tamu road, the whole of this
effort was made against targets on the Imphal-
Tiddim road, especially in the neighbourhood
of milestones 120 and 87, two points of great
tactical importance in preventing enemy rein-
forcements from coming up the road. Attacks
against enemy strongholds included one against
the village of Ningthoukhong, which was accu-
tately bombed by forty-eight Wellingtons and
Mitchells (B.25) on the 9th May. Once again,
however, the enemy withstood the effects of
the bombardment and was able to repulse the
subsequent assault by ground troops.

92. The enemy’s efforts to deploy in the
Imphal Piain during the month were decisively
defeated by the Hurricanes and Vengeances
which attacked at extremely short intervals
any concentrations in the foothills reported by
ground troops through the Army Air Support
Control operating at a high standard of effi-
ciency. By the end of the month, Fourteenth
Army were going over to the offensive and it
was possible to predict that the threat to
Imphal had been averted. Constant attacks
on the tracks through the jungle which served
as his Lines of Communication had prevented
the enemy bringing his full potential strength
up to the perimeter of the plain, and the effec-
tiveness of air attack in thick jungle had im-
pressed on him the futility of advancing over
open country without overwhelming forces.
The attacker was becoming the attacked ; the
period of attrition and defence was over, and
the squadrons supporting 4 and 33 Corps could
look forward to the prize for which all air
forces hope—the annihilation of an enemy in
retreat.

93. Positive results in the form of men
killed, storage areas devastated, and transport
destroyed are hard to achieve against an enemy

with such a high standard of camouflage and
concealment who, when on the offensive, moves
in small groups with little impedimenta. No
army can maintain its standard of camouflage
in retreat, however, and as this despatch is
being written, the air forces in this theatre are
proving again what has been and is being
demonstrated in every other theatre of war,
that an enemy experiencing overwhelming pres-
sure from advancing ground forces provides
the best targets for air attack. The experience
gained by Army Commanders, who have come
to cee the Heaton od Posstbilitics of air
support during the period of trial, is now pay-
ing fall dividends, Be results of which should
form an impressive achievement during the
monsoon operations now beginning.

94. During these six and a half months the
American squadrons of the Northern Air Sec-
tor Force had, as their primary task, the main-
tenance of the air superiority necessary to
guarantee the safety of the air route to China
and of the bases of the Air Transport Com-
mand. They were also, however, responsible
for giving air support to General Stilwell’s
Chinese-American Forces in their advance
down the Ledo Road, which culminated in the
assaults on Kamaing, Mogaung, and Myitkyina.

95. By February the ground forces had suc-
cessfully advanced as far as Maingkwan in
the Hukawng Valley, and the Mustangs and
Kittyhawks comprising the force had given
valuable support in the form of attacks against
camps, concentrations of troops, M.T. and
stores, both in the valley and along the road
from Kamaing to Mogaung. The work of
ground attack squadrons in sweeps along the
flanks of the road was reported by prisoners
of war as particularly effective. Liberators
(B.24) and Mitchells (B.25) were also used in
attacks on this sector of the front, dropping
155 tons of bombs on Kamaing, 93 on
Mogaung and 40 on Myitkyina. This support
continued when the Hukawng Valley had been
left behind, and by the end of the period
covered by this despatch Mogaung was being
invested by ground forces and the main strip
at Myitkyina, taken on 17th May, was in the.
hands of the N.A.S.F., forming a potential
advanced all-weather base.

V.—ATTACKS ON COMMUNICATIONS

96. The comparative lack in Burma of large
static targets suitable for heavy bombers has
been offset by the extreme vulnerability of the
Japanese lines of communication. No. 27
Squadron, R.A.F., has been operating on Beau-
fighters against these communications since
January, 1943, and No. 177 Squadron, R.AF.,
similarly equipped, from September of the
same year. As a result of their persistent and
ubiquitous attacks, both by day and by night,
the enemy has been driven to remove the main
weight of his transport from road to river and
from river to rail. His major movements have
been restricted to the hours of darkness, and
for protection during daylight he has been com-
pelled to resort to an ingenious and complex
system of camouflage coupled with the estab-
lishment of an extensive network of gun posts
as a supplement to his more orthodox anti-
aircraft defences. The Taungup Pass road,
the shipping on the Irrawaddy, the Ye-u and
Myitkyina railway lines, as examples, have long
