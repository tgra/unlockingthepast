It so happened that when mobilization was required the defences were already manned in part and had been as a precaution since+28th April, 1939, with the result that the problem in the end was not fully presented."

            "description": "On the northernmost sector progress by II Corps was steady and continuous throughout this period. The enemy defences were strong and long-established and the terrain, as I have said, was particularly difficult; these advantages outweighed in the early stages their numerical inferiority and the lack of reserves for the defence, but as position after position was wrested away there were increasingly less troops to man the positions in rear. 9 and 1 Infantry Divisions attacked on, the morning of 23rd April on the Sedjenane-Mateur and B ja-Mateur axes respectively. On the first day 9 Division gained its objective west of El] Aouana 1 Division made slightly slower progress but by the 25th had reached the high ground a mile to the south-east of Sidi Nsir station. This advance had exposed the left flank of the division and 34 Infantry Division was now brought in between the other two to clear up the area astride the Sidi NsirMateur road. The mdge of hills west of Sidi Nsir was cleared by 28th April after three days of concentrated artillery fire and on the same day the high ground east of the village was captured after close and heavy fighting."
