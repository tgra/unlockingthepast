In Syria we began, early in 1942, to establish advanced bases to hold thirty days  supplies for the garrisons of the fortified areas and for the whole of the Ninth Army at full strength. This work was nearly completed by the 15th August 1942. The construction and stocking of the Persia-Iraq base with stores and munitions sufficient for ninety days for three armoured and fifteen infantry divisions continued."

Prior to the formation of the new Command, an administrative reorganization had been introduced by General Headquarters Middle East, with the object of freeing Commander Tenth Army from the administration of the bases and lines of communication in Persia and Iraq so that he could concentrate on his operational task. By this measure, which came into effect on 15th August, 1942, the control of the general administration of the ports, depots and communications behind the Tenth Army was vested in a senior Staff Officer of General Headquarters Mideast, designated the Inspector General of Communications (1.G.C.); while there was created an area Command, known as Pibase, to deal with the internal security and local administration of the Base and Lines of Communication area. At the same time the zone of responsibility of the Commander Tenth Army was to have been further reduced by transferring Northern Iraq from the Tenth to the Ninth Army."

The sustained resistance which they were meeting in South-East England probably led them to believe that Fighter Squadrons bad been withdrawn, wholly dr in part, from the North in order to meet the attack. On the 15th August, therefore, two large raids were sent, one to Yorkshire and one to Newcastle. by Fighters. The distance was too great for Me. rogs, but not for Me. rros."

            "description": "I assumed command of the Middle East Forces from General  Auchinleck on 15th August. I selected as my Chief of General Staff Lieut.-General McCreery who had been my GSO 1 when I commanded r Division -at Aldershot and in France in 1939 and 1940. His scientific grasp of the whole sphere of military matters made him of the greatest assistance to me throughout my period of command in Africa. My,General Headquarters continued to be located in Cairo, but I established an advanced Tactical Headquarters at Burg el Arab,{ adjoining the Headquarters of  the Eighth Army. My predecessor had, as a temporary measure, assumed personal command of Eighth Army but it was intended that he should be succeeded in that capacity by Lieut.-General Gott, previously General Officer Commanding 13 Corps. Before he could assume command the aircraft in which he was flying to Cairo was shot down by enemy fighters over its airfield  and he was killed by machine-gun fire on the ground while assisting the rescue of the other occupants. General Gott had been in every battle in the desert since the beginning; he had commanded 7 Support Group in the first campaign, 7 Armoured Division in 194% and 13 Corps since February, 1942. It was particularly tragic that, having survived the early days of triumph and disaster when skill and endurance alone could be thrown into the balance against the inadequacy of our resources he should now be robbed of the chance of the high command he had so well deserved at a"

It consisted of the 27 Australian Infaniry Brigade with attached troops. As the commander of this Brigade had been prevented on medical grounds from accompanying it, Lt.- Col, Maxwell was, on the recommendation of the Commander, AI.F., appointed by the Australian authorities to command it. The Brigade Group had had the advantage of a period of training in Australia but had had no experience of bush warfare. It was accommodated temporarily on Singapore Island pending the completion of hutted accommodation in West Johore and Malacca,"

            "description": "East of Etna the country offered many obstacles to a rapid advance. It is a thickly inhabited narrow strip, confined between the mountains and the coast, and the cultivation, especially the walls of the vineyards and olive groves, makes it excellent defensive terrain. 5 and 50 Divisions could make only slow progress, although the enemy had by now decided to evacuate and was seeking only to impose the maximum delay. Thanks to the difficulties of the terrain which I have already mentioned, he was able to extricate a high proportion of his troops, though not, of course, their heavy equipment. The Messina area was very heavily defended; anti-aircraft fire, for instance, was described by our pilots as worse than over the Ruhr. General Montgomery was anxious to bring a Corps into reserve to prepare for the invasion of Italy and on 13th August he pulled out 5 Division and 13 Corps Headquarters to join the Canadian Division in preparation for the new assault, 50 and 51 Divisions continued the pursuit. An attempted landing in rear of the enemy on the night of 15th August, in the style of those carried out on the north coast, was very nearly successful but the enemy were retreating too fast for any to be cut off."

The first half of the month, when Japan was still at war, supply operations continued much the same as on previous months. After 15th August, when surrender was announced, the situation became somewhat confused."

            "date": "15th August",
            "description": "35. The position early on 15th August was as follows. Observation Hill, which was vital to the defence of the whole position, was dominated by artillery from Round Hill at Many of the defences had been destroyed; and the garrison, which had gallantly resisted for four days, was becoming tired. Attempts to dislodge the enemy from the Mirgo Pass and from the low ground south of Castle Hill had failed. There was also a threat from the enemy detachment advancing along the coast road from Zeilah, though this advance, which had been shelled by the Navy from the sea and bombed by the R.A.F., was not being pressed with any great energy. Enemy air attacks on troops and transport in the open had been constant. They were not very dangerous but had a considerable nuisance effect. In these circumstances General Godwin Austen came to the conclusion that a retreat on Berbera and evacuation was the only course to save the force from a dangerous defeat and possible annihilation. He accordingly telegraphed G.H.Q., Middle East, giving the two aliernatives, immediate evacuation or continuation of the action with probable loss of a very large proportion of the force."

            "description": "36. During the morning of 15th August the enemy remained inactive but during the afternoon he renewed his attacks. Black Hill was not directly attacked but the enemy infiltrated round this position and endeavoured to dig in a pack battery in a position behind the post. They were dispersed by gun fire and then shelled Black Hill heavily. Castle Hill was also shelled. The brunt of the enemy's effort was, however, made on Observation Hill which was subjected to a very heavy bombardment for two hours. This was followed by a fierce infantry attack at 1700 hours, under which the garrison at last gave way. I regret that the 3-pdr. gun of H.M.A.S. Hobart was here lost together with the detachment. Their presence and conduct had been of the utmost value to the morale of the garrison."

            "date": "15th August",
            "description": "It will be noted that no decision had been taken, at the time this directive was issued, whether ANVIL should be mounted or not; on the other hand the forces to be provided for it from Italy had now risen to seven divisions. This uncertainty was a very great handicap to our planning, and its psychological effect on the troops expecting to be withdrawn, especially on the French, was undoubtedly serious. It is hard to expect troops to give of their best when they are continuously  ' looking over their shoulder   to a new objective, particularly when it is so attractive an objective as the liberation of their own country. This situation lasted throughout June. On the 14th I was instructed that VI Corps Headquarters was to be withdrawn at once, 3 Division on 17th June and the 36th on 27th June. On the 24th a French division was to be withdrawn to the Naples area, followed by a second in the first week of July. On the same day  the Combined Chiefs of Staff signalled   the destruction of the German armed forces in Italy, south of the Pisa-Rimini line, must be completed. There should be no withdrawal from the battle of any Allied forces that are necessary for this purpose  . Nevertheless I was informed on the 16th that, in order to preserve the possibility of mounting ANVIL, it was necessary to proceed with the programme of withdrawal of forces already laid down. We could still hope that we might get these troops back again later but this became more unlikely after it was known that General Eisenhower had strongly recommended the operation in a signal of 23rd June. The final decision in its favour was communicated to me on 5th July. ANVIL* was eventually launched on 15th August."

            "date": "15th August",
            "description": "as we knew to have arrived, was not strong enough to hold the   Gothic  line against a really powerful attack. Of our own troops I wrote  I have now two highly organised and skilful Armies, capable of carrying out large scale attacks and mobile operations in the closest co-operation. Morale is irresistibly high as a result of recent successes and the whole forms one closely articulated machine, capable of carrying out assaults and rapid exploitation in the most difficult terrain. Neither the Apennines nor even the Alps should prove a serious obstacle to their enthusiasm and skil! . I proposed, therefore, to give the enemy no breathing space but to continue to press the pursuit up the centre of the peninsula to the line Bibbiena-Florence-Pistoia-Pisa and then over the Apennines; if they were held in force I would mount a full-scale attack on Bologna not later than 15th August. I would then establish a firm base in the area of Bologna and Modena for the development of further operations either westwards into France or north-eastwards into Austria according to the requirements of Allied stategy at that time. At the same time I would secure and protect any airfield areas in the Po valley considered ne for the operation of the Allied Air Forces. As I explained, this plan was only possible on the assumption that I retained the forces I then had in Italy; I had to work on this assumption as long as I could while the fate of ANVIL was being decided."
