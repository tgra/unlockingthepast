130. Before leaving this phase of operations,
it is interesting at this point to review the
achievements of 33 Corps. By this means it
is possible to see the magnitude of the cumula-
tive defeat of the Japanese forces. On the 3rd
April, 1944, Headquarters, 33 Corps, had
opened at Jorhat and had proceeded at once
to organize the operations which led to the
relief of Kohima. Exactly one year later, the
troops comprising this Corps were able to claim
the following successes: Japanese killed (and
actually counted) 19,547, prisoners taken 720,
guns captured or destroyed 252. The following
advances had taken place: on the right 597
miles, in the centre 549 miles, on the left 645
miles. The Japanese had been cleared from an
area of 35,000 square miles. At least 11,000
inhabited localities had been liberated, includ-
ing the city of Mandalay.

IN ARAKAN

131. I think that this is the appropriate place
to tum from Fourteenth Anmy to the opera-
tions of 15 Indian Corps in Arakan. The
object of these operations has already been
given (paragraph 12), as has the outline of
the plan (paragraph 14). Some reference
has been made also to the progress there
in November and December (paragraph 49).
In this and the two ensuing sections,
I propose to describe in more detail these
plans and operations, showing how, from first
being at the release of formations
for post-monsoon operations against Rangoon,
they developed so that their new object became
the assistance of Fourteenth Army to capture
Rangoon before the monsoon, by containing
enemy forces, establishing air supply bases and,
finally, by mounting an ancillary seaborne
operation against Rangoon itself.

132. In the Arakan sector, we were faced
with peculiar difficulties. The first was
topographical. The country entirely favoured
the Japanese. The tangled, jungle-clad
mountains run down to a narrow coastal strip
of paddy or mangrove swamp, which is inter-
sected by unfordable tidal creeks. These creeks
or “ chaungs ” present problems which few who
have not experienced them can imagine. They
are mostly bordered by mangrove forest to a
considerable depth on each side, which makes
landing altogether impossible except at the
extremely rare landing places, of whose import-
ance the enemy was obviously aware. These
landing places, however, are only short
stretches of muddy bank. The chaungs vary
a very great deal in size, some being arms of
the sea, while others are narrow and winding
streams, hedged in both sides by the mangrove
forest. In the latter case visibility is only to
the next bend in the chaung. Near the sea,
tidal conditions add to the difficulties.

North of Akyab a few beaches can be found,
but south to beyond Taungup, the mangrove
swamp conditions are at their worst.

133. The other great difficulty is the weather,
which is a major strategic factor. The excep-
tional severity of the monsoon in Arakan is

apparent when one realises that the rainfall is
over fifty inches during the months of July and
August. During June and September the rain-
fall varies betwen fifteen and twenty inches for
the former and between twenty and thirty
inches for the latter month. This has two main
effects. Movement on land is more or less im-
possible except between mid-December, when
the ground dries out, and the breaking of the
monsoon about mid‘May, or a little earlier.
Not only do the waterways rise and flood, but
the paddy fields, which form most of the open
country are under water and impassable. The
impracticability of the employment of armour
is obvious. and the absence of all-weather roads
makes a land of L. of C. impossible during the
rains. The second effect of the monsoon is that
sea conditions prevent the use of landing craft
except in virtually inland waterways. The
number of days on which landing is impossible
becomes progressively greater during April, and
it will be seen later how the Japanese in fact
anticipated no landings from the open sea after
mid-April, until the monsoon was over.

134. Fortunately we had two advantages
which enabled us decisively to overcome both
the natural difficulties and the Japanese. We
had secured complete command of the sea and
the air and were thus able to utilise to the full
the mobility conferred by this supremacy. Thus
although the country favoured the land defence,
we were in a position to force the enemy to
fight on ground of our own choosing and to
make ourselves independent, to a great extent,
of overland Ls. of C. The campaign there-
fore hinged upon a series of combined opera-
tions, rapidly and efficiently mounted by a
combined headquarters. Excellent team-work
was established between Lieutenant-General
Sir Philip Christison, commanding 15 Indian
Corps, Rear-Admiral Martin, commanding a
naval force consisting, in part, of his own land-
ing craft of Force “W”, which was arriving
from England, and a scratch force of landing
craft from India, and Air Commodore (later
Air Vice-Marshal) the Earl of Bandon, com-
manding 224 Group, R.A.F. The planning and
execution by these Commanders and their staffs
was excellent. In conjunction with these
amphibious operations, the operations further
inland by 81 and 82 (West African) Divisions
fulfilled a very important réle. Fighting under
very arduous conditions, they kept the enemy
spread over a wide front, containing the equiva-
lent of about three Japanese regiments, and,
by preventing the enemy from concentrating
more troops in the coastal sector, materially
assisted the speed of operations there.

135. To recapitulate what has been said in
the early paragraphs of this Despatch, the
primary object of the Arakan campaign was to
liquidate the very unsatisfactory position which
then existed. We had four divisions contained
there by a very much inferior enemy force,
which was able to threaten to outflank our
positions by an advance up the Kaladan Valley.
By a limited offensive to capture Akyab,
Myebon and Minbya, we would eliminate this
threat, and, by the coming monsoon, be en-
abled to reduce our garrison to about four
brigades. The remaining formations could be
withdrawn for post-monsoon operations, which
at that time (November, 1944) were visualised
as including an amphibious and airborne
assault on Rangoon.
