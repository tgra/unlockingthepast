During the period on which I am reporting, they carried out a great measure of reorganization of their respective divisions of the staff and carried very heavy responsibilities. I cannot speak too highly of the work of these officers and their staffs, and I consider that the success achieved by my forces was to a great extent made possible by the work and ability of these two officers.
