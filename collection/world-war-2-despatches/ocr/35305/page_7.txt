SUPPLEMENT to taz LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1941 5905

as instructors to assist in the training of new
formations, while an equal number have been
attached to the Force, for instruction, from
units at home,

Despite the almost complete absence of battle
casualties the supply of officers has caused me
concern, Over four hundred candidates have
been sent home for training as officers, while a
further four hundred have been recommended
for immediate commissions.

These have been aye to a large extent from
Warrant Officers Class IIT.

A large number of War Establishments, par-
ticularly for the Intelligence Corps and for units
on the Lines of Communication, were found to
need adjustment and steps have been taken to
this end.

The existing War Establishment of an infantry
battalion, which was not designed for Continental
warfare, has called for modification and I am

grateful that my recommendations for an in-- ~

crease have been accepted.

The Royal Corps of Signals has been put to
great strain in providing communications not
only for the Army, but for the whole of the Air
Forces in France. The degree of dispersion
required in modern warfare has materially
added to their difficulties.

The success with which these demands have
been met is due not only to the spirit in which
the personnel of that Corps have faced and
overcome difficulties, but to the successful
arrangements for co-operation with the French
military and civil organisations, and with the
General Post Office. The Wireless Intelligence
Staff have done valuable work, and the cipher
duties of the Force have been most efficiently
performed by personnel of the Army Educational

rps.

The Survey Directorate has been called upon
to carry out a great deal of work under difficult
conditions and has fulfilled all the demands
made upon it.

Liaison with the French.

25. On the arrival of the British Expeditionary .

Force in France a French Military Mission was
established at my headquarters to deal with
French military and civil authorities and to act
as a link with Grand Quartier Général. In
addition, officers and non-commissioned officers
of the French Army are attached for liaison
duties to the headquarters of each formation
and unit as it arrives.

I wish to express my sincere gratitude to the
chief of the Mission, Général de Division Voruz,
and to all his staff for their ever ready help to
the-British Army on all occasions.

Thanks to their efforts, matters relating to
billeting, hire of land, and local purchase of
material have been handled without friction.
To them is due, in large measure, the friendliness
of the relations which exist between the French

ulation and the troops, and also as between
Brench and British staffs and regiments.

A British Military Mission under Brigadier
J. G. des R. Swayne was established with the
Headquarters of General Georges under whose

immediate command the British Expeditionary
Paros 3 is serving.

Distinguished Visitors.
26. On 4th December His Majesty The King
visited his troops in France and was received

-everywhere with enthusiasm. During the three

days tour His Majesty was able to make a
detailed inspection of forward and rear areas,
On his return to England, His Majesty was
graciously pleased to send a message to his
Army which was warmly appreciated by all
ranks, . ;

The President of the French Republic has

‘spent a day with the British Expeditionary

Force.

The Prime Minister and other members of the
War Cabinet, the Ministers from the Dominions,
many members of the Army Council and seven
Field Marshals are amongst those who have
visited my Headquarters at various times.

Honours and Awards.

27. I am submitting separately the names
of officers and other ranks whom I wish to
recommend for reward or to bring to your notice
for gallant or distinguished service.

I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient Servant,
GORT.

General,
Commander-in-Chief,
British Expeditionary Force.
