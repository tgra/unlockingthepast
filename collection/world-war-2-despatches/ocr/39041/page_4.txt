The former was escorted by five destroyers,
four cérvettes, two minesweepers and four A/S
trawlers, with the EDINBURGH, NORFOLK
and two destroyers providing close cover: the
westbound convoy had the LIVERPOOL, five
destroyers, one minesweeper and two trawlers.
The KING GEORGE V,-DUKE OF YORK,
VICTORIOUS, KENT, NIGERIA and eight
destroyers provided heavy cover. '

4. P.Q.14 ran into ice south-west of Jan
Mayen Island and was delayed and scattered:
two-thirds of the convoy lost touch and returned
to Iceland, with several of the escort who had
deen damaged by ice. The remaining nine
ships, with most of the escort, continued their
“passage. .The delay had probably disorganiséd
to some extent the German arrangements for
attack, but the convoy was sighted by enemy
aircraft on 13th April and attacked by U-boats
east of Bear Island on 16th April, one ship
being sunk.

5. Q.P.10 was subjected to air and U-boat
attacks for three days, while on passage between
the Kola Inlet and Bear Island, and four ships
were sunk. One other returned to Kola, the
remaining eleven arriving safely in Iceland.

P.Q.15 and Q.P.11

6. Before the next pair of convoys was due
to sail, I suggested once more that these con-
voys, if they could not be postponed until the
ice moved north, should be limited in size.
This proposal was not accepted: convoys
P.Q.15 and Q.P.11, which sailed on 26th and
28th April respectively, contained 25 and 17
ships. .

7. The eastbound convoy was escorted by
four destroyers, one A.A. ship and three mine-
sweepers, and included a C.A.M. ship*; the
NIGERIA and two destroyers provided close
cover. The westbound convoy was escorted by
five destroyers, five corvettes and two
trawlers, with the EDINBURGH as close
cover. Distant cover for both’ convoys
was given by the KING GEORGE V,
U.S. battleship WASHINGTON,  VIC-
TORIOUS, U.S. cruisers WICHITA and
TUSCALOOSA, KENYA and ten destroyers
{of which four were American). This was the
first occasion on which United States ships
operated as part of the Home Fleet.

8. Four submarines were disposed off the
the Norwegian Coast, moving north-eastwards
with the convoy, to provide cover against the
surface forces at Trondheim ; being joined later
by the TRIDENT, which accompanied P.Q.15
as far as longitude 5° East.

4.M.S. EDINBURGH Torpedoed _

9. Q.P.11 left the Kola Inlet on 28th April
and was sighted.and reported by aircraft and
U-boats the next day. On 30th April the
EDINBURGH, about fifteen miles ahead of the
‘convoy, was struck by two torpedoes from a
U-boat. Her stern was blown off and she was
unable to steer, but she proceeded at very slow
speed towards Murmansk, escorted and towed
by the FORESIGHT and FORESTER, who
‘were detached from the convoy escort. Mine-
sweeperts, tugs and Russian destroyers were sent
from Murmansk to assist. ,

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1950

10. The protection of these Russian convoys
against surface attack must always involve
grave risk of ships of the covering force being
torpedoed by U-boats. The convoys come
under early air reconnaissance and for a great
part of the voyage have up to eight U-boats
within striking distance. The number of
escorts and the hecessity for strict economy of -
fuel do not permit of prolonged A/S hunts ;
the speed of the convoys is 8 knots or less ; so
U-boats put down by the escorts have little diffi-
culty in regaining contact. The risk from

- U-boats has always been appreciated by the

Flag and Commanding Officers of the covering
cruisers ; but it is obvious that effective protec-
tion against surface forces in the varying visi-
bility usually experienced can only be provided
if the covering cruiser is in the vicinity of the
convoy.

QP.11

11. The convoy drove off an attack by four
torpedo aircraft and, on Ist May, was five times
attacked east of Bear Island by three large Ger-
man destroyers. The escorting destroyers,
though greatly inferior in gunpower, met these
attacks with gallantry and skill and by their
aggressive tactics succeeded in driving off their
powerful opponents. One merchant ship was
sunk and the AMAZON was damaged, though .
able to proceed. No further losses were suf-
fered by this convoy. ‘

12. The three German destroyers then trans-
ferred their attentions to the EDINBURGH,
who was now in tow of a Russian tug and
escorted by the FORESIGHT and
FORESTER, one small Russian destroyer and
the minesweepers HARRIER, HUSSAR, GOS-
SAMER and NIGER. The German destroyers
located her on the morning of 2nd May, in low
visibility and extreme cold. The tow was im-
mediately slipped and the EDINBURGH, who
was unable to steer, circled slowly at about
eight knots.

13. A series of most gallant actions followed,
the enemy being engaged in turn by the FORE-
SIGHT and FORESTER, the remaining guns
of the EDINBURGH, and the minesweepers.
One enemy destroyer was sunk and the other
two “damaged; but the EDINBURGH was
struck by another torpedo and had to be aban-
doned, being sunk later by a torpedo from the
FORESIGHT ; two officers and 56 ratings
were lost. The FORESIGHT and FORESTER
were seriously damaged, both being brought to
a standstill during the course of the action, but
each in turn covered the other while she effected
the repairs necessary to enable her to proceed.
‘The minesweepers were not damaged, though
more than once they had engaged enemy des-
troyers single-handed and driven them off:

14. P.Q.15, which had sailed from Hvalfiord

‘on 26th April, was reported by enemy aircraft

two days later, in spite of a spirited attack on .
the sighting aircraft by the Norwegian seaplane
providing A/S escort. A U-boat made contact
the following day. On 1st May the convoy was
bombed wthout success by six Ju.88s, one of
which was shot down. As all the enemy des-
troyers in the Far North had been sunk or
damaged in the final action of the EDIN-
BURGH, I instructed the NIGERIA and
LONDON to leave convoy P.Q.15 west of Bear
Island and not to proceed into the U-boat
waters further east unless the convoy was
threatened by enemy cruisers or larger vessels.
