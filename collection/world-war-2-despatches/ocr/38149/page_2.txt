In addition, to ease the supervision, of this
organisation, three AA Corps were created:
r AA Corps in the South (1, 5, 6, 8 and
9 Divisions) corresponding with ‘ro and II
Groups R.A.F. ,

“2 AA Corps in the Midlands (2, 4, 10 and
rr Divisions) corresponding with 9 and 12
Groups R.A.F.

3 AA Corps in the North (3, 7, and 12

Divisions) corresponding with 13 and 14
Groups R.A.F. :

8. When I was appointed to the command of
the Anti-Aircraft defences on 28th July, 1939,
I was faced with the most grave shortage of
equipment. At the outbreak of war the total
number of Heavy Anti-Aircraft guns under my
command was 695, many of which were of old
and obsolescent types and a number of which
were only on loan from the Royal Navy. The
approved and recommended total at this timie
was 2,232. :

The position with Light Anti-Aircraft guns
was even worse, there being only 253 out of
an approved total of 1,200, some of which
again had been borrowed from the Royal Navy.
Of the best Light Anti-Aircraft gun, the 4o-mm,
Bofors, there were only 76.

Searchlights were in a somewhat better posi-
tion, as there were 2,700 equipments out of an
approved total of 4,128 and a recommended
total of 4,700.

g. The increase in equipments throughout
the period under review. may conveniently be
noted here. 2

At the end of 1939 there were 850 Heavy
guns, 510 Light guns and 3,361 Searchlights.

At the beginning of July, 1940, when air

attacks on the United Kingdom ‘began in
earnest, there were 1,200 Heavy gums, 549
Light guns and 3,932 Searchlights.

By May, 1941, there were 1,691 Heavy guns,
g40 Light guns, and Searchlights had reached
a total of 4,532 early. in 1941 but owing to
shortage of manpower the number of equip-
ments in action had to be reduced before May,
1941.

ro. The Anti-Aircraft defences at the out-
break of war were entirely manned by units
of the Territorial Army. Their total strength
at the time they were mobilised was 106,690.

While the training of a Territorial Army in
peace time bristles with difficulties, the Terri-
torial system has many advantages which far
outweigh the disadvantages. :

The Territorial Army has always attracted
men anxious to fit themselves to defend their
country. These men were the cream of the
manhood of the country. In the’ Command
it is no exaggeration to say that the success
which it achieved was due in great part to the
excellence of the personnel and without some
similar voluntary organisation in the future I
do not see how the Anti-Aircraft defences of
this country can be adequately manned except
at prohibitive cost.

rz. As a. result of the introduction of con-
scription early in 1939 it was intended to allot
20;000 militia every three months to help man
the defences. In actual fact, war began three
months before the arrival of: the first allotment.
By July, 1940, the total manpower in Anti-
Aircraft Command was 157,319 and in May,
£94X, just over 300,000:

12. It very soon became evident that the
‘ quality of the conscripts allotted to the Com-
mand was. inferior and that I was not receiv-
ing such a good selection of the Army intake
as other arms. This was due to restrictions
as to age and medical fitness on the men to be
posted to Arms liable to serve overseas, and
I later had occasion to protest against a pro-
cess of allocation of manpower which involved
the posting of the best type of recruits to other
Arms at the expense of A.A. Command,

13. Throughout the period covered by this
part of my despatch, and indeed throughout the
war, I was constantly faced with manpower
problems. The shortage of manpower and the
Jarge demands made on the Command to sup-
ply personnel and units for the Field Army
(in all 170 gun or searchlight regiments went
overseas) led first of all to the introduction of
Mixed Units and later to the Home Guard man-
ning anti-aircraft equipment. It led also to
drastic reductions in the number of searchlight
units. .

14. The deployment of the anti-aircraft de-
fences at the outbreak of a war is a very delicate
matter, The possibility of an immediate and
paralysing attack from the air means that they
must be ready at a very early stage, before the
normal process of mobilization has been de-
veloped. They bese big responsibility at that
time for the protection of the national economy
upon which the whole war effort must depend.

15. The,various means by which the troops
might be called up before official mobilization
took place in such a way as not to damage
further any strained international relations were
investigated. .The B.B.C. was obviously out
of the question and might in any case be off

" the air at the time it was needed; the telephone
.service would undoubtedly be overloaded;
letters or telegrams provided no confirmation
of delivery of the message and I -finally con-
cluded that messages by hand to key men,
through whom the order would be spread down-
ward to all who were involved, provided the
only satisfactory solution. It so happened that
when mobilization was required the defences
were already manned in part and had been as
a precaution since+28th April, 1939, with the
result that the problem in the end was not
fully presented.

16. When war began without any major air
attack the first task was to improve the stan-
dard of training throughout Anti-Aircraft Com-
mand. Training in an anti-aircraft réle requires
progressive development. First, the individual
has to be trained for his particular task+on
the equipment; next, the detachment has to be
trained to work as a team and finally, the
various detachments have to learn to co-ordi-
nate their efforts as a tactical whole.

.17. While I have already placed on record
the splendid service which the Territorial units
rendered in the early months of the war, their
training, limited as it had been both by lack
of equipment and the little time they had been
able to spend on it, fell far short of that re-
quired for war. Some units, forcibly converted
to a searchlight réle, were found to contain.
some men unsuitable for the work and others
who preferred their original réle. The targets
with which they had had to practise had been,
very slow and had taken no evasive action. °
