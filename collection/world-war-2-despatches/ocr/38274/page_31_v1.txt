CoNcLUSION.

60. This Despatch has carried the narrative of events in the India Command up to the point when this ceased to be an operational headquarters for the purpose of conductiag  the war against Japan in this theatre.

The Despatches of my predecessor coupled with this record have told the story of an up- - hill struggle. That struggle has been not only against an enemy who attacked us with the advantages of long preparation and special training, but against ail the difficulties of staging a campaign on the Eastern Frontier of India.

It has also involved the commencement of the gigantic work of converting India itself into a base, adequate for such a campaign. It is perhaps fitting therefore that this concluding narrative of a series dealing with a somewhat bleak period, should have more to say about the building up of our resources and making our preparation in this theatre, than about actual fighting agaist the enemy.

We have learnt enough about fighting the Japanese to realise that intense preparation not only in resources and paraphernalia of war on land, sea and in the air, but in training our men to counter Japanese methods of warfare, are necessary if success is to be assured. Indeed, in this theatre our men have to acquire an almost entirely fresh technique in the tactics and stratagems of jungle warfare. Only thus can they gain complete confidence of being able to beat the Japanese at his own game, and so gain the moral ascendancy over him essential to final success.

Our afforts to organise, equip and tnain ourselves to this end, with a full realisation of He eared of the task ahead, have been indicated in the above. review of the monsoon period of 1943. Much remains to be done, but the extent of the progress made and the success already achieved are promising for the future.

The continuance of peaceful conditions both anternally and on the North-West Frontier, and the  failure of Japanese efforts, to incite subversive elements, and to cause unrest in India by propaganda or through agents, are satisfactory features of the period. The continued flow of recruits for the Indian Services, though slightly reduced in volume, is also reassuring, and indeed remarkable, when it is temembered that every man who joins the fighting forces is a volunteer.

Tn one direction the period has shown a marked change in our favour.  hat is in the air The details recorded of the build-up not only of strength and efficiency of aircraft and aircrews, but of the great and varied support-  ing organisations behind them, constitute an achievement of the first magnitude. Little less noteworthy was continued successful pursuance of our air offensive over Burma in spite of the monsoon, while the Japanese air effort practically ceased during that period.

Yet another feature of major significance and 2 milestone in the progress of the air

effort in this theatre has been, the integration (brought about with the inception of the South-East Asia Command) of the British and American Air Forces in India. With the successful model of the combined Air Forces in the North African and subsequent compaigns, plans are being laid to make the integration in this theatre so effective that it will become a single stnking force under unified control. Similar unified subordinate commands will operate the various branches, viz. strategical airforces, tactical airforces, supply dropping and airborne forces, and photographic reconnaissance.

This re-organisation will be no longer my responsibility; but in so far as [ can assist with the development of resources and installations in back areas, and the provision and maintenance of efficient communications and supplies, these matters will be my constant concern.

The Indian Air Force which remains my responsibility (except for those squadrons actually operating against the Japanese) is still in its childhood. It is too early yet to try to foretell on what lines it will be organised, or how it will be  officered; but 1t can only be to its advantage that in its early years its growth was amid the storms of war, rather than in the sheltered atmosphere of peace.
