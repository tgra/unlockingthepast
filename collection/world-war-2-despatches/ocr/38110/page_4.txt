unselfishness of the Commanders whose divi-
sions wére already nearly trained, iand to the
initiative and drive of the Commanders of the
new divisions who had to fit a six months’
programme into three, all difficulties were over-
come, and on the day Forces G and: U* carried
out’ their assaults with the precision of yet
another rehéarsal. ,

18. It. had always been felt that the enemy
might ‘react, when large scale exercises were
‘carried out in the Channel.” He did not do so
until exercise ‘‘ Tiger,’’ which was the final
rehearsal for Force U, when during the night
‘of 27th/28th April three groups ‘of E-Boats
-penetrated-the-patrols covering Lyme Bay and
delivered a successful attack on the llast convoy
to sail to the exercise consisting of eight’ L.S.T.f
Two L.S.T. were sunk and one was damaged,
and there was a regrettably high loss of life.
Naval defensive measures on this occasion were
undoubtedly on the weak side and this incident
underlined: the need for every available war-
ship and craft to take part in the opening
phases of ‘‘ Neptune ’’ when the enemy must be
expected to attack our convoys with everything
at his disposal.

Ig. The final rehearsals for the other four
assault ‘forces took place on 4th May under the
code name of ‘ Fabius’. Opportunity was
taken to exercise the simultaneous sailing from
the Isle of Wight area of the three forces based
there and also to try out the arrangements
whereby A.N.C.X.F.{ would assume control of
all operations in ‘the Channel. So far as the
naval assault forces were concerned the exer-
cises were satisfactory, but a freshening south-
westerly wind in the afternoon of the first day
caused the full programme to be curtailed to
avoid damage to landing craft. Enemy reac-
tion to ‘‘ Fabius ’’ was negligible, being con-
fined to an aircraft attack on a destroyer in
one of the covering forces. That it was not
greater, and indeed that our naval preparations
proceeded with so little interruption, must be
largely attributed to the very high degree of
air superiority achieved in the months before
D day. .Enemy air reconnaissance was slight
and infrequent.

Mining.

20. Sea mining is carried on continuously
by the Admiralty and by Bomber Command,
but for some months elors ‘“ Neptune ”’ the
mining programme was planned to afford direct
assistance to the operation both as regards Joca-
tion and timing of each lay. Considerable
“success is known to have been’ achieved by
mines laid during this period under plan
“ Maple,”’ which was really an integral part
of operation ‘‘ Neptune.”’

Meteorological.

a1. Early in planning it was appreciated that -
the decision which you as Supreme Commander
would have to make to launch the operation
would be one, of the most’ difficult. and far-
reaching of the whole war. Not only was good
weather necessary for the assaults, but also for
the period "immediately following them, ne

e
meteorologists were doubtful of their ability to
forecast the weather more than 48 hours ahead
for certain, which was barely sufficient to cover
the hour of the assaults, as Force U from
Devonshire had to sail 36 hours before H hour.*
To assist the forecasts, two additional U.S.
and two British warships were stationed in the
Atlantic to transmit weather reports for some
days before D day. For security this pro
cedure was also adopted before exercise
“ Fabius’ and this, im additiod, . served *to
practise the meteorological team concerned in
making their deductions.

Availability of Landing Ships and Craft.
22. During planning there were frequent dis-
cussions as to what percentage availability of

“landing ships and craft should be taken for the

operation.
go pe

The original planning figures of
per cent. for L.S.T. and 85 per cent. for

.L.C.T.. and L.C.I. (L)t were challenged by’

Washington who held that the U.S. Navy could
achieve a higher standard of maintenance.
