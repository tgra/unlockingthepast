extinguished at 1720. Six Corsairs and one
. Avenger were destroyed by fire on deck. The
explosion blew out a flight deck rivet and thus
allowed burning petrol to fall into the hangar
which had to be sprayed. As a result a further
three Avengers and eight Corsairs were
damaged. The total replacements required were
therefore four Avengers and 14 Corsairs, of
which three Avengers and seven Corsairs were
fiyable duds.-

Casualties were fortunately light—one killed
and a few injured.

_ At 1755 H.MS.’ FORMIDABLE reported
being fit to land on aircraft and that during
the engagement she had definitely shot down
one enemy by gunfire.

The ‘state of the Carrier Squadron was as
follows. H.M. Ships FORMIDABLE and
VICTORIOUS could operate, but the former
‘had only four bombers and rx fighters service-
able, and also had two pom-pom mountings out
of action. H.M.S. VICTORIOUS could operate
a few aircraft at a time, but the damage to her
lift seriously reduced her speed of handling.
In the ciréimstances I concurred with a recom-.
mendation from A.C.x that the Fleet should
withdraw to fuel, sort out and make good the
damage, etc, and return to strike on r2th/x3th

As- TG (52.1 had been ‘ordered to cover
Sakishima on days when TF 57 was not strik-

programme, dictated first by weather and then

by damage consideration, must have caused
inconvenience to CTG 52.1; ‘this is regretted.

During the day 8 enemy aircraft were des-
troyed, 2 on the ground, 3 3, py suicide, 2 by
gunfire and by fighters. Also on the ground

Force. The enemy appeared to have aban-
doned his previous practice of a high approach

.in favour of a low one, thereby greatly reduc-

ing the length of warning ‘and making inter-
ception by fighters much more difficult.

To combat this, it was decided: —

(a) ‘To station two radar pickets, each con-
‘sisting of a 6 in. cruiser and a destroyer, 12
miles to the north west. and south westward
of the Fleet so-as to increase the range of
detection. Two fighters would be allocated
to each picket, and at first contact with the
enemy, other fighters would be sent to the
threatened sector.

(6) To bring in the 5.25 in. cruisers from
the screen and to station them with the main
body of the Fleet to increase A.A. protec-
tion for the carriers "whenever in the opera-
tion area, .

(c) To station a dectraven astern of each
carrier to afford more gun protection in what
* appears to be'the enemy’s favourite position

for attacking carriers.

(d) To increase mutual gun support when
attack threatened by bringing in the carriers
to the 2,000 yards circle, and the battleships
and cruisers of the main body until their
distance from adjacent carriers is 2,000 yards.
This new disposition was to be given a trial
during the next: strike period.

The question of reducing the distance
between ships had been under review for some
time: there are many, factors to take into con- *
sideration, not least of: these being the inter-'
ference caused to flying in and off and forming
up. Its adoption for trial now is a measure of
the improvement of the pilots’ skill, etc., during |
the present operations.

The Fleet was also instructed that in future
attacks enemy aircraft’ must be brought under
fire much earlier than has been the case
recently. Commanding Officers of ships were
ordered to give this matter their personal
attention. At 1915 the Fleet disengaged from
the Tanker Group for the night.
