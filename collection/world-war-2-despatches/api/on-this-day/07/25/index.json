            "description": "On 25th July Radio Roma announced the fall of Mussolini, the suppression of the Fascist party and the accession to power of Marshal Badoglio. Although we had often considered the possibility .of this, the actual announcement came as a surprise, for the secret of the coup d' tat had been well kept, as was natural with so few persons involved in the plot. It was not a case of a popular rising nor even of a wave of popular discontent,.for the Italian people in general was still sunk in its usual apathy; though, of course, claims to that effect were subsequently put out, mainly by Italian exiles in Switzerland. If there had in fact been any such occurrences we should have been less surprised, and so would the Germans, who were struck with consternation. We had a certain advantage over them, as we were aware of the discontent of some senior officers in the Italian services, and there had already been some cautious approaches by Italian commanders in the Balkans which showed a willingness to abandon a lost cause and a now mepepslar alliance."
