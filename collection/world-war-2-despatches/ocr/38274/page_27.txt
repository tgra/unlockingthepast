SUPPLEMENT 10 tar LONDON GAZETTE, 29 APRIL, 1948

the five months from July to November 1943

the total output was 810 aircraft, the monthly
figure jumping from 116 aircraft during August
to 265 aircraft in October. This total did not
merely entail normal routine upkeep services
in respect of aircraft held; a very large number
of modifications were also continually being
carried out.

Almost throughout the first four years of
war, the India Command’s priority for equip-
ment has been low. Inadequate stocks over
most of the ranges of equipment have had a
direct bearing on the output from repair units.
Tools, certain types of engine spares, dopes,
American spares and ground equipment,
marine craft spares and practically all items ot
ordnance supply were short. M.T. spares and
domestic and barrack equipment were prac-
tically unobtainable. Thus in November there
were over 160,000 demands which had not been
met.

Although after August a slight improvement
appeared, the situation continued poor owing
to the demand fer spares continuing to increase.

44. Maintenance and Repair of M.T. Vehicles

and Marine Craft of the R.A.F. and 1.AF.: *

The administrative difficulties peculiar to the
maintenance and repair of aircraft in this Com-
mand apply equally in the case of M.T. and
marine craft of the Air Forces but in general
the problems have not proved so formidable.
West of Calcuta (by using the available civilian
capacity), it has been possible to decentralise
the repair of M.T. to the main towns. East
of Calcutta, mobile repair units, known as M.T.

-Light Repair Depots have been formed and

operate as a part of the field maintenance
organisation.

The formation of this completely new
organisation has been necessary now that the
second and third line maintenance of Air Force
vehicles has become too large a responsibility
ea the Army who formerly undertook this
task.

As regards marine craft, prior to this period
no arrangements existed to deal with their
maintenance’ and repair. Since then, however,
contact has been established with the Director-
ate General of Shipbuilding and Repair, and
the naval authorities, and satisfactory arrange-
ments have been made.

45. Research and Development Work for the
Air Forces.

Research and development work for the
Air Forces is now carried out in Air Head-
quarters, India Command; at the Scientific In-
dustrial Research Laboratories, ‘Delhi, and at
the ordnance laboratories, Cawnpore.’ These
bodies deal also with the problem of indigenous
manufacture. In addition, research work is
carried out at Bangalore for electrical and radar
development, at Chaklala for airborne forces,
and again at Cawnpore for armament modrfica-
tions. .

Among the achievements of the Research and
Development Section of the Air Forces in this
Command are:—

The development of new parachute
material which has eased the production
problem and improved the performance of
the supply-dropping parachute.

2677

The production of a new type of supply-
dropping container,

A roller conveyor for use in- supply-
dropping operations.

An enlarger for microgram negatives.

Substitute proofing lacquer for carburettor
floats.

A substitute for duplicator stencils.

Satisfactory aircraft dopes which can be
manufactured indigenously. ‘

The manufacture of petrol-resisting tubing
in this country-which has now been developed
to a point where the product is little inferior
to that produced in the United Kingdom.

The production of various types of jettison
tanks, including one design which utilises
locally produced jute and shellac.

In addition the more important India Com-
mand Modifications which have been proto-
typed are;—

Self-sealing long-range tanks inside the
wings of Hurricanes Mark HID and IV.

The redesigning of the fuel system on the
Vengeance aircraft, and provision for them
of jettison tanks.

A bomb-cum-jettison tank modification for
Hurricane aircraft.

Compregnated wooden blades for fitting to
a propellor.

Certain modifications to Dakota -aircraft..

Modifications to the Spitfire VIII pressur-
ised fuel system.

46. Admunistrative Development in * various
Ancillary Services of the Air Forces.

The Balloon Branch, the Air Sea Rescue,
the Meteorological Service and the Flying Con-
trol Organisation have all expanded and made
important progress: The operational work of
the first three has already been referred to
above.* :

All were handicapped in their development
by lack of equipment, shortage of personnel
and absence of training facilities, while in the
Meteorological Service the issue was compli-
cated iby the existence already of separate Civil
and U.S.A.A.F. organisations working in the
same sphere. °

Tue PROBLEM OF THE MEDICAL SERVICES IN
Nortu-East Inpia.

47. General.

The period covers the annual malarial season,
and was therefore one of anxiety.

The sick rates as a whole were consistently
high. They varied from a maximum of fifty per
thousand per week from all causes for British
troops in July, to twenty-five per thousand per
week for Indian troops—the lowest figure
recorded for fighting personnel during the
period.

There was no remarkable rise in the autumn
rates—indeed for a time in August, when sick-
ness is usually expected to increase, a general
fall in the sick rate took place. This was
probably due to the widespread and thorough
anti-malarial measures that had been in pro-
gress since the previous year. At. the’ same
time active operations during the period were
on a small scale. The worst exposure to infec-,
tion therefore (i.e., that occasioned by lack of
opportunity to take precautions against malaria
and other diseases), affected very few.
