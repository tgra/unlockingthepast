SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 FEBRUARY, 1948

and the Commanding Officers of the sub-
marines.

This briefing was carried out by the officer
of my Staff (Commander Davies) who had
been responsible for the planning.

Security.

25. Special security measures at Port HHZ
were increased as from the 1st September. No
leave was allowed, none but specially selected
officers and ratings were permitted to leave the
area, and all ships present were retained in the
port until the completion of the operation. Tt
is considered that the security of the operation
was well maintained.

Departure for the Operation.

26. Soviet reconnaissance on the 3rd Septem-
ber had shown that TIRPITZ, SCHARN-
HORST and LUTZOW were present in the
Alten area, and it appeared likely therefore
that the operation would be carried out in that
area (Operation ‘‘Funnel’’). On the 7th
September, however, the first Spitfire sortie
showed only LUTZOW present, and the
TIRPITZ and SCHARNHORST were later
reported off Ice Fiord, Spitzbergen.

27. In order for Day D to be the 2oth
September in the case of Operation ‘‘ Funnel,”
it was necessary for the X-craft to be sailed
from Port HHZ on 1ith-rath September.
Furthermore it was not desirable to postpone
Day D by more than two or three days owing
to the waning moon. It was therefore vital to
obtain the re-disposition of the main units as
soon as possible. *

28. However, visual reconnaissance at
roooA on the roth September confirmed the
return of the TIRPITZ and SCHARNHORST
to Alten Fiord, and the SB.N.O, North
Russia that evening signalled the exact posi-
tions of both ships in their berth in Kaafiord.
LUTZOW was not seen,

2g. I arrived at Port HHZ on the morning
of the roth September, to see the crews before
they sailed and to witness the start of this great
enterprise.

30. On the following morning I signalled to
Admuralty, Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet,
and Admiral Commanding Orkney and Shet-
lands, my intention to carry out Operations
“Source ’’ and ‘‘ Funnel’, Day D being 2oth
September.

31. Submarines, each with an X-craft in tow,
sailed from Port HHZ as follows:—
r600Z, 11th September—
TRUCULENT and X 6.

SYRTIS and X 9.
1800Z, 11th September—
THRASHER and X.5.
2000Z, 11th September—
SEANYMPH and X.8.
2130Z, 11th September—
STUBBORN and X.7.
1300Z, 12th September—
SCEPTRE and X.10.
The operational crews of the X-craft were
embarked in the towing submarines and the
A2

X-craft were manned for the passage by
passage crews.*

The Passage.

32. The passage was uneventful from the 11th
to 14th September. Good weather was ex-
perienced and all submarines made good speed
with their X-craft dived in tow. X-craft sur-
faced to ventilate three or four times every 24
hours for approximately 15 minutes during
which time speed was reduced. The average
speed made good over this period was
approximately: .

““T”’ class submarines
“S$” class submarines . .

ro knots.
84 knots.

33. ‘With the arrival of photographs, flown
to this country from Russia by Catalina, of the
preliminary Spitfire sorties, a detailed interpre-
tation of the net defences was carried out and
on 15th September the results were signalled to
the submarines taking part in the operation.
The presence of LUTZOW in Langfiord wa
confirmed by P.R. on the 14th September which
also showed TIRPITZ and SCHARNHORST
in Kaafiord, and the geographical positions of
these ships were signalled to the submarines
and Target Plan No. 4 ordered.

Target Plan No. 4 allocated X.5, X.6 and
X.7 to attack TIRPITZ, X.g and X10 to
attack SCHARNHORST, and X.8 LUTZOW.

15th September.

34. At o400Z on the 15th September, when
X.8 was being towed by SEANYMPH at 8
knots, the tow parted X 8, who was dived
at the time, surfaced five minutes later, but,
although the visibility was estimated at 5 mules,
there was no sign of the SEANYMPH X.8’s
estimated position at that time was latitude
69° o4’ N. 08° 14’ E. At 0430Z, X 8 set course
029°, speed 3 knots, on main engines.

35. The fact of the tow parting was not
immediately apparent to the SEANYMPH, and
it was not until 0600Z, when X.8 was due to
surface to ventilate, that it became apparent.
