tion of any action by DORSETSHIRE to stop
scuttling and capture the enemy ship.

Action taken by Enemy to Abandon Ship and
Scuttle.

13. Within a further three minutes, i.e. at
1730, the enemy turned to starboard, stopped
and commenced to lower boats. I decided to
withhold fire and continued zig-zagging at high
speed outside his gun and torpedo range, while
within ours. In this I had in mind the possi-
bility that the enemy was a Raider, with British
merchant seamen on board, and that he should
be allowed sufficient time in which to get the
boats clear and thus save the unnecessary loss of
British lives.

14. At 1744, by which time DORSETSHIRE
had crossed the enemy’s bows, the boats were
seen to be moving away from the ship, which
had a definite list to port. Range of enemy
8-g: miles. A faint flashing light was seen from
her bridge, which was impossible to read.

15. At 1751 smoke commenced pouring from
the bridge and foredeck, indicating she had
been set on fire. This fire took hold rapidly,
flames reaching the height of the funnel, with
occasional minor explosions probably caused
by ammunition. By 1805 she was heavily on
fire when a large explosion in the forepart of
the ship settled the business, and she sank at
182r leaving only a trail of smoke behind and
a number of survivors in boats.

to Scuttling.

16. When at 1805 it was evident that the self-
destruction of the enemy was certain, I altered
DORSETSHIRE’S course to one at right angles
to the enemy’s line of advance so as to clear
the area as soon as possible and recover our
aircraft. This was effected at 1910, and the
aircraft refuelled and flown off again at 1930 to
make a further reconnaissance of the area of
the boats.

Reports from Arrcraft.

17. Observation by the aircraft was not easy
as the light was failing, but it was definitely
established that there were fourteen boats, one
large raft pamted white, and one large raft
painted red in the position where the ship had
gone down. It was estimated that each boat
contained between 25 to 30 survivors at least,
plus those on the raft painted white. The raft
painted red had a five foot staff with a red ball
on it, and was being used either as a sea-
anchor or a rallying point for the other boats
which were clustered around it.

18. As the aircraft circled the boats at a
height of between 4oo and 500 feet no demon-
stration was made or action taken, neither were
any survivors seen in the water.

1g. The aircraft proceeded to examme the
second lot of boats, which had been first sighted
by the ship at 1708. These were closmg the
scene of the survivors’ boats—distant by now,
four to five miles—and consisted of one large
power boat (possibly two) with two tows of
two cutters each. These boats were fully
loaded with what appeared to be packages
and crates, and manned by about three men
in each. It is considered ‘that they were
actually transferring these stores to a U-Boat,

or about to do so, at the time of “‘ first sight-
ing ’’, as the enemy could not have had time
to hoist them out between 1653 and 1708, and
remain steaming at the speed she did. No
U-Boat however, was sighted by the aircraft.

Other Observations.

20. Enemy did not fire on DORSETSHIRE
and no torpedo tracks were observed. The
smoke screen attempted—if it was intended as
such—was a poor effort, and supports the
supposition that it was a signal and not a
smoke screen. In any case, at 18,000 yards or
‘more, she would have had little chance of
doing DORSETSHIRE much damage, before
she herself was out of action with heavy casual-
ties, while there remained two hours of day-
light My own opinion is that the enemy was
relying on U-Boat protection, and with the
large number of men on board decided to
abandon ship at the first opportunity, hoping
DORSETSHIRE would close to pick up sur-
vivors, when perhaps an opportunity for attack
by U-Boat would present itself.

ai. The efficiency and speed with which she
abandoned ship shows that‘ this evolution must
have been practised frequently, as must also
have been the arrangements for scuttling and
setting fire to the ship

22. The large number of survivors—esti-
mated by aircraft to be about 500—is signifi-
cant If she was a ‘Raider this would account
for British merchant seamen prisoners, other-
Wise the only explanation offered is that they
were spare crews for U-Boats.

Final Remarks.

23 Now that U-Boats are known to be
operating in the South Atlantic as far south as
30 degrees, in company with Supply Ships and
Raiders, the problem of dealing with them
hinges almost entirely on one of identification.
In this case the enemy, by definitely acting in
a suspicious manner, helped us to solve the
problem and take action accordingly but there
are many cases where the contrary is the case.

British’ and Allied merchant ships, inde-
pendently routed, are frequently met at sea
often hundreds of miles from the position where
taey ought to be on the plot. Their identity
can only be established by signalling, which is
extremely difficult outside a range of 8 miles.
In these circumstances the temptation to close
to signalling distance (5 miles or less) is very
great, especially if the course of the vessel to
be identified 1s in the opposite direction to that
on which the cruiser wishes to advance, and
the’ more so if daylight is running short. A
more detailed memorandum on this matter is
being forwarded as a separate submission.

a4. Although this encounter did not fulfil our
expected desire of an action with the enemy,
its successful result is, I submit, due pnmanily
{o your initial dispositions and orders.

After spending over a hundred days at sea
during the last four months, mostly on this
particular kind of operation, it is at least some
satisfaction to the officers and ship’s company
chat at last a ‘‘ dividend ’’ has been earned,
and both your signal, and that made by the
Admiralty of ‘‘ Well done ’’ is much appre-

ciated.
