SUPPLEMENT 10 tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 22 APRIL, 1948

appear about the middle of March, made land-
ing hazardous, and it was obvious that the
enemy had by now made full preparations to
defend all landing places. General Irwin
Tecommended that we should prepare defensive
positions and give up the attempt to clear the
Mayu peninsula, I refused to accept this
recommendation and to take up a defensive
attitude without first obtaining a marked suc-
cess over the enemy, so that the troops should
be confident of their ability to beat the
Japanese. I directed General Irwin to use the
6th Brigade (British) of four battalions, which
had been held at Chittagong in readiness for
the attack on Akyab, to assault the Donbaik
position in conjunction with the 71st Indian
Brigade. My intention was that the attack
should be delivered in great strength and depth
with the object of swamping the Japanese
positions.

8. Meanwhile the Japanese began a counter
offensive, directed in the first instance against
our eastern flank on the Kaladan river. Two
small columns had moved into the Kaladan
valley at the time of our advance on Rathe-
daung. One column, consisting of a battalion
of Indian infantry from the 123rd Brigade,
moved from the Mayu valley by a track
across the hills into the Kaladan valley; the
other, consisting of two companies of Tripura
Rifles (State Forces), came down the valley
from the north. Our forces had occupied
Kyauktaw by the time of the Japanese
attack, The enemy appears partly to have

come up the Kaladan river from Akyab and,

partly to have infiltrated through the hills from
Pakokku on the Irrawaddy. They employed
their usual enveloping tactics against com-
munications and forced the battalion of the
123rd Brigade to withdraw westward across
the hills with some loss, and the Tripura Rifles
to retreat northwards up the valley. The
enemy followed up this success by crossing
the hills and attacking the communications of
123rd Brigade opposite Rathedaung. After
some heavy fighting, the 123rd Brigade, which
had been closely engaged for three months,
was relieved by the 55th Brigade and withdrew
to Buthidaung.

9. The attack of the 6th Brigade on the
" Donbaik position took place on March 18th
and failed. The troops succeeded in advancing
some distance into the enemy defences, but
were unable to deal with the enemy’s under-
ground strong points, which remained in
action behind our forward troops; while the
enemy guns, mortars and machine-guns, con-
cealed in the jungle, carried on firing on our
troops which had penetrated the line quite
regardless of their own troops which were still
holding out. Our forward troops were eventu-
ally all killed or compelled to withdraw. The
attack was made with great dash and deter-
mination but was not carried out in the
strength or depth that I had considered
necessary to overrun the enemy position. The
losses of the attacking troops were heavy,
especially in officers.

ro. Meanwhile the 55th Brigade opposite
Rathedaung was attacked in flank and rear
and cut off from Buthidaung on March 17th,
By a counter-attack and with the assistance
of 71st Brigade it succeeded in extricating
itself from a dangerous position but lost some
equipment and a considerable number of

animals. East of the Mayu river we were now
forced back to a position covering Buthi-
daung.

The enemy then began similar infiltration
tactics against our troops west of the Mayu
range, and at Indin on April 5th overran the
headquarters of the 6th Brigade. There was
heavy fighting here, and severe casualties were
inflicted on the enemy in counter-atiacks; but
by the middle of April we had withdrawn on
this flank to positions covering Maungdaw.

11. By the end of March, the 26th Division
had taken over the greater part of the front,
most of the r4th Division being withdrawn
further north to rest. Some of the troops were
tired and many units were weak through battle
casualties and disease; reinforcements took
some time to settle down to the abnormal
conditions of jungle fighting. But in view of
our command of the air I still hoped we could
regain the initiative. I actordingly issued the
instructions to Eastern Army which are given
in Appendix B. They were to the effect that
positions to cover the Maungdaw-Buthidaung
toad, the Maungdaw air-field and the mouth
of the Naf river were to be held for the
monsoon period in as great depth as possible,
and that we were meanwhile to regain the
initiative by offensive action on both sides of
the Mayu river.

‘12, Shortly afterwards, in the middle of
April, I was summoned to the United Kingdom
to discuss plans for the winter of 1943-44 (see
paragraph 46 below). During the first three
months of 1943 I had visited the Eastern
front on a number of occasions and had kept
in close personal touch with Commanders and
operations. During the remainder of the
period under review, I was in the United
Kingdom or U.S.A. and in touch only by
long-range telegraph reports.

13. 'We failed to regain the initiative, and
in fact lost our positions at Maungdaw and
Buthidaung. Japanese forces continued their
infiltration tactics through the thick jungle
along the spine of the Mayu ridge; and by
early May established themselves with a
strength of at least two battalions on the road
between Maungdaw and Buthidaung and de-
stroyed a bridge. All attempts to dislodge
them failed, so that it was necessary, on May
wth, to withdraw the force from Buthidaung
by the Ngakyedauk Pass to the west of the
Mayu ridge south of Bawli Bazaar. The
movement was carried out without interference
by the enemy; but a quantity of transport
which could not be removed had to be
destroyed.

14. The enemy continued to infiltrate against
our communications; and it was finally de-
cided to take up positions further north,
abandoning Maungdaw, although it had been
developed as an advanced base since its
capture in December, and its loss involved the
destruction of considerable quantities of stores.
An attempt might have been made to hold
and maintain it by means of the Naf river;
but in view of the tired state of the troops and’
their lack of jungle training the attempt was.
not judged advisable. By the start of the
monsoon, our forces in Arakan were back
approximately in the positions from which:
the advance had begun five months earlier.
The enemy. who was also obviously suffering,
