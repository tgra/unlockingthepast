            "description": "25. Before describing the enemy\u2019s counter attack, it may be mentioned that on 21st March the last Italian detachment left in Cyrenaica had been captured. This was the force occupy- ing Jarabub Oasis, which had retreated there in the middle of December after the battle of Sidi Barrani. It originally comprised about 800 Italian and 1,200 native troops. Ever since then it had been merely observed by the divisional cavalry regiment (mechanised) of the 6th Australian Division. I had not the transport available to maintain a larger force at such a distance from the main line of com- munications and estimated that the exhaustion of its supplies would compel the surrender of the force. Although practically the whole of the native troops had surrendered, the Italian part of the garrison was still in its defences by the middle of March and was being supplied by air, Since the force observing Jarabub was required in Greece I determined to attack and capture the garrison. This was carried out by the 2nd/gth Australian Infantry battalion under Brigadier Wootten, and the Divisional Cavalry Regiment already in front of Jarabub. In face of a skilfully conducted attack the garrison surrendered, putting up a poor fight in spite of its strong defences."

            "description": "to4. A column consisting of 3rd\u00b0G.C. Regi- ment, 51st G.C. Light Battery and a troop of armoured cars left Dolo at 0630 hours on r7th March to reconnoitte to Neghelli. Progress was slow owing to minefields and road-blocks. Four miles east of Neghelli opposition was met and overcome, and Neghelli itself was occupied at 0830 hours on 21st March. No administra- tive arrangements could be made at that time to maintain troops in Neghelli, so the column returned to Dolo on 26th March. On 23rd March the Commander rath (A) Division had been ordered by me to do what he could to keep the enemy forces north of Neghelli en- gaged. By making a show of force in this area it was hoped to delay the withdrawal of enemy forces on the route Neghelli-Addis Abeba and thus to contribute to the success of operations being undertaken by rrth (A) Divi- sion in the Harrar-Auasc River area. ' Un- fortunately this message was delayed and be- fore receipt the Neghelli columns, which had never \u2018been intended to stay, had been with- drawn. Accordingly, re-occupation was decided upon provided the necessary admini- strative arrangements could be overcome. A column of 3rd G.C. Regiment less two com- panies, one troop of E.A.A.C. Regiment and a section of 51st G.C. Light Battery left Dolo early on 30th March and reached Neghelli on ist April. In the meantime, however a patrol of r/and K.A.R. from the 21st E.A. Infantry Brigade at Iavello had already re-occupied Neghelli on 30th March. The 3rd G.C. Regi- ment remained in Neghelli and the 1/and K.A.R. patrol returned to Iavello. No enemy were reported near Neghelli but local riots were taking place-between Boran-and:Somaii tribes- men and punitive patrols had to be sent out to round up offenders. The enemy were believed to be holding a position in the area Uaddara and a patrol was accordingly sent out to in- vestigate. The patrol returned on 5th April"

At 13.00 hours on the 21st March, a report was received of a single unidentified aircrait approaching and two Hurricanes were sent off to intercept, but were unable to make contact. At 13.23 hours the approach of an enemy formation, was confirmed and all avail- able fighters took off. But they numbered only four Hurricanes and six P.gos. At 13.30, 22 bombers escorted by ten fighters attacked, bombing and machine gunning the airfield. Our fighters intercepted and \u2018destroyed four enemy aircraft with one probable and one damaged, but the weight of the attack got home and considerable damage resulted in which com- munications were destroyed. :"

A total of 31,500 lbs. of bombs was released with good results on such objec- tives as troop concentrations, aerodromes, road and railway communication and river craft. Constant reconnaissance was carried out over the entire front towards Rangoon and in the Valley of the Sittang, while a close watch was kept on our old air bases in the Rangoon area and at Moulmein for signs of the arrival of the enemy air force and reinforcements. Some effort, however, was wasted because bombers available were held standing by for objectives which the Army did not provide."
