SUPPLEMENT 10 THz LONDON GAZETTE, 15. JANUARY, 1948

Meanwhile the enemy’s assaults on Bir
Hacheim were renewed. Beginning on the 6th
June, the attacks continued and grew in
intensity. The Free French resisted valiantly,
but on ¢the evening of the 8th June,
General “Koenig was obliged to report
that the situation had become serious. It
seemed likely that the stronghold would fall
unless the garrison was given support from
outside.
becoming critical, General Ritchié was anxious
‘to retain possession of it since, if it were lost,
we should have to form a new and extended
front facing southwards behind which we might
be hemmed in and deprived of our power of
manoeuvre. The threat to our rear would be
increased, and, while it would be more necessary
than ever to attack the enemy’s supply lines,
to do so from the south would become corre-
spondingly more difficult. I agreed that we
must hold the enemy frontally and do everf-
thing in our power to deprive him of supplies.
Orders were therefore issued for an armoured
regimental group from the 4th Armoured
Brigade with two columns each from the 7th
Motor Brigade and the 29th Indian Infantry
Brigade to attack the goth Light Division in
the rear next day, At the same time a convoy
was to be passed in, and arrangements were
made for aircraft to drop supplies. It was in-
tended that the armoured regimental group
should eventually (join the forces operating
round Mteifel. ;

On the 8th June, an enemy attack on Bir
Hacheim for the first time made some pro-
gress, one of our positions being overrun. Next
morning the garrison was subjected to intense
dive-bombing and shelling. Attacks from the
north continued all day, but in the evening the
Free French drove the enemy back once more.
On the roth June General Ritchie decided to
order the Free French to evacuate Bir
Hacheim, Enemy pressure continued from the
south and the attacks of the armoured regi-
mental group had not succeeded in relieving
it. It was clear, too, that the resistance of the
garrison was being worn down. Having beén
again subjected to heavy bombing from the
air, and having again held off a strong enemy
attack, the ist Free French Brigade withdrew
during the night escorted by the 7th Armoured
Division. Next morning it was reported that at
least two thousand men had been safely with-
drawn and that many others were coming in.

The Defeat of our Armour.

The enemy’s reaction to the evacuation of
Bir Hacheim was immediate and determined.
By midnight on the 11th June, the goth Light
Division had moved up to an area some nine
miles south of El Adem where it leaguered.
The r5th Panzer Division, having been engaged
with inconclusive results by the and and 4th
Armoured Brigades, leaguered to the left of the
goth Light Division, with the Trieste Division
echeloned in rear, guarding the left flank.

The zgth Indian Infantry Brigade was hold-
ing a defensive locality on the ridge south of
EI Adem, with a. detachment thrown out on
the northern escarpment where the by-pass road
crosses it. The 2nd and 4th Armoured Brigades
lay immediately to the west of the locality with
orders to destroy the enemy armour. Columns
of the 7th Motor Brigade and the arth Indian
Infantry Brigade under the 7th Armoured

“Division were in the south, ready to attack the

Moreover the supply situation was-

enemy’s southern and eastern flanks. The 2and
Armoured ‘Brigade remained at Knightsbridge
watching the 21st Panzer and Ariete Divisions
which had not’ movéd from their positions west
of Bir Harmat. All three armoured brigades
were under command of the ist Armoured
Division. . : ~

The enemy’s next move made it seem as if
the orders of the 27th May had been issued
again. While the 15th Panzer Division pro-
tected its western flank, the goth Light Division
attacked the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade at
El’ Adem. This attack was successfully re-
pulsed, but the enemy occupied the landing
ground to the north. The 15th Panzer Division
then swung north-west to meet the and and 4th
Armoured Brigades, whose attempts to get to
grips in the morning liad been frustrated by a
characteristic enemy anti-tank screen, The
ensuing armoured battle lasted until nightfall,
by which -time the 2nd and 4th Armoured
Brigades had ibeen forced back some four miles
north of the Batruna ridge. The goth Light
Division took advantage of this to establish
a series of defended posts on the ridge.

On the 13th June, after a quiet morning, the
15th Panzer Division returned to the attack,
engaging the and and 4th Armoured Brigades.
Soon the 21st Panzer Division was thrown in
from the west, and the 22nd Armoured Brigade
also joined in the battle which took place in
the area of Maabus es Rigel.and Hagiag er
Rami. When evening came, the enemy had
gained possession of both these ridges and was
consolidating, thus extending the line of posts
he had secured on the Batruna ridge.

This battle was the culmination of the
armoured fighting which had been going on
intermittently since the 27th May. At its con-
clusion our armour in the Acroma area was
reduced to thirty cruiser and twenty infantry
tanks, while the enemy was believed to possess
at least twice this number. Moreover the Eighth
Army had lost the inestimahle advantage of
being able to recover its damaged tanks from
the battlefield.

Withdrawal from Gazala and Investment of
Tobruk,

The loss of so considerable a part of our
armour called for a complete revision of our
plans. The security of the twenty-four mile
long southern flank of our position between
Gazala and Tobruk depended on a strong
armoured backing which no longer existed. It
would tbe only a matter of time before the
enemy cut the supply lines of the two forward
divisions, and their reserves would last them
at best a week. In. that short time it would
be impossible to restore our armoured strength
sufficiently. to turn the tables on the enemy.
Having obtained my permission, General
Ritchie therefore gave orders on the rqth June
for the 1st South African and 5oth Divisions
to be withdrawn from the Gazala—Alem
Hamza position into reserve. The zorst Guards
Brigade, which had been garrisoning Knigiits-
bridge and whose position had becoma
dangerously exposed, had already been ordered
to retire to Acroma the previous night. «

‘The Gazala—Alem Hamza position gave us
a tactical advantage I was loth to abandon.
Straddling the coastal road, it denied the enemy
easy access to his supplies and made reinforce-
ment slower. Besides being of great value so
long as we remained on the defensive,-it was
