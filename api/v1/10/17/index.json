            "description": "53. On roth October information was re- ceived from His Majesty\u2019s Government to the effect that a proposal had ibeen made to the Russian Government for the withdrawal of both Russian and British troops from Teheran and its neighbourhood and that plans should imme- diately be made with the Russian Commander for joint withdrawal to take place as soon as possible. The withdrawal was carried out on 18th October after a combined British-Russian parade on 17th October. The Russians with- drew to Kazvin and Pahlevi and our troops to Sultanabad and Hamadan."

            "description": "196. Whatever the merits of this decision, as far as I was concerned the situation to which it led had one grave disadvantage: Air Marshal Coningham, with his many commitments in the battle area, could spate few aircraft for sub- sidiary tasks. Instead of making sorties over the Hague expressly for the purpose of observ- ing and harassing the firing troops, as my forces had been able to do, the Second Tactical Air Force was obliged to rely on its general pro- gramme of armed reconnaissance over the enemy\u2019s lines of communication. This method of tackling the problem was probably right in the circumstances; but from my point of view it had several shortcomings. It left us without any means of judging the effect of so indirect a counter-measure; nor did it throw any light on what the enemy was doing at the Hague or meet our demand for visual reconnaissance of suspected areas. Indeed, from the date when the Second Tactical Air Force assumed respon- sibility for armed reconnaissance up to the 17th October\u2014when this issue came to a head \u2014we were without any report to say that pilots of that Command, while engaged on these duties, had seen or attacked anything on the ground which could be associated with long- Tange rockets."

            "description": "On 17th October 2 Polish Corps, which had taken over the sector on the left of 5 Corps Previously under ro Corps (and commanded in the interim by the Headquarters of the dis- banded x Armoured Division) opened an attack to improve our communications in the mountains. the minor road which leaves Route 7z at San Piero in Bagno and joins Route 67 at Rocca San Casciano, crossing the valleys of the Bidente and Rabbi. Possession of Route 67 would be of the greatest importance for improv- ing communications between the two Armies. The Poles made good progress in the mountains. Galeata, commanding the upper Bidente valley, fell on 19th October and Strada, in the valley of the Rabbi, on the 2zst; here the enemy showed signs of an intention to resist more strongly. Meanwhile in the plains Cesena had been entered on 19th October and on the 2oth 4 Division seized a precarious but tenaciously defended bridgehead over the Savio in the neighbourhood of Route 9. Further to the south x0 Indian Division established two more bridge- heads and in the southernmost built up rapidly for an assault on Monte Cavallo, on the water- shed between the Savio and the Ronco. By the 2ist there were no enemy forward of the Savio except in the coastal sector, where they still held Cervia. ."
