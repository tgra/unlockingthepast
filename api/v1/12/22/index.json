            "description": "When the Guards Brigade reached Antelat on the 22nd December, they found a hostile force including thirty tanks lying around Beda Fomm, covering the Axis withdrawal down the coastal road. One of its battalions, which occupied Antelat, was driven out again on the 23rd by a strong detachment of this force. Bythat time the Support Group had reached this neighbourhood and had been sent north-westwards to interfere with whatever the enemy had in hand at Carcura, off which seven ships were lying. When the news reached him that the Guards Brigade had been attacked at Antelat, General Gott ordered the Support Group to turn about and move at once to their assistance. At the sight of both brigades assembled to attack him the enemy withdrew from Antelat towards Agedabia. The pursuit of this force would have been an excellent task for ihe armoured regiment which had arrived during the morning, but after a brief engagement with enemy tanks it had no fuel left with which to give chase.",

These special craft were originally landed at Singora and transported across the peninsula by road to the west coast in the State of Kedah where they were launched on the 22nd December. These sea-borne operations had good and continued air cover. Had there been available at Singapore some fiotillas of fast armoured and properly equipped coastal craft it is certain that the enemy would not have been able to exercise the constant threat to our communications with sea-borne forces which they did in fact succeed in doing.",

            "description": "153. On the 17th December, 22 (East African) Brigade began to take over the defence of the Tunnels area, thereby releasing 51 Brigade to [mop up a numbes of bewildered Japanese detachments, who were garrisoning strongholds on the Mayu Ridge, by-passed by the advance of the other two brigades of 25 Indian Division. By the 22nd December, 51 Brigade began to spread southwards down ithe coastal plain and concentrate at Indin, where it remained until it later rejoined 25 Indian Division in Akyab. It had taken 25 Indian Division less than three weeks to secure their final objectives on either side of the Mayu Range, a fortnight ahead of schedule. The enemy had withdrawn east to Kanzauk and a large column was known to have moved from there to Myohaung. It thus appeared unlikely that 82 (West African) Division would encounter much determined Tesistance on its way into the Kaladan Valley.",

            "description": "150. Meanwhile, by the 18th December, 53 Brigade had occupied Seinnyinbya, seven miles south of Buthidaung. Leaving a detachment heavily engaged in this area, the Brigade effected a double river crossing and occupied the large village of Kwazon on the 21st December; while another detachment advanced, against opposition, down the east bank of the river. On the 19th December, 1 Brigade of 82 (West African) Division to the north made a great stride forward and occupied Kindaung, forcing the crossing of the Saingdin Chaung. 4 Brigade, released from its protective réle at Taung Bazaar, was at this time rounding up scattered enemy parties north of Buthidaung, preparatory to rejoining the Division in its advance on Htizwe. After securing Kindaung, 82 (West African) Division encountered stubborn resistance. A number of attacks failed to dislodge the enemy rearguards from their strong hill positions, despite concentrated air support, On the 22nd December, however, the enemy was outflanked by a strong force which moved down the river in boats and seized the high ground north of Zedidaung against stiff opposition. From this area, we were able to overlook the enemy’s line of retreat and his resistance collapsed. The Kalapanzin Plain, north of the Saingdin Chaung, had been cleared of the enemy.",

            "description": "g. After discussing Burma’s defence problems with the Governor and G.O.C. I cabled from Rangoon on 22nd December to the C.I.G.S. an appreciation in which I emphasised the weakness of Burma’s defences, the lack of an Intelligence system, and the need for air forces. I said that the t#mmediate requirements of Burma were two bomber and two modern fighter squadrons, a divisional headquarters and two brigade groups, apparatus for a warning system and anti-aircraft artillery.",

I found the situation better than I had expected and, after discussing the situation with the G.O.C. I reported to the Chiefs of Staff that I did not consider the situation immediately serious, provided that the reinforce_ment of Burma with land and air forces proceeded without delay, and that some naval force was provided to prevent a landing near Rangoon from the Tenasserim coast. I had already on roth January authorised General Hutton to accept any Chinese troops available. It may be remarked that those I -had originally accepted on 22nd December, the 93 and 49 Divisions, had not by this date yet reached Burma.",
