originally earmarked for the assault on Akyab,
but that the operation was in fact carried out
by 25 Indian Division, which had advanced
down the Arakan coast. 71 Brigade of 26
Indian Division was doing Combined Opera-
tion training in India at Cocanada with 41
Beach Group. The speed of 15 Indian Corps’
campaign necessitated their early return to
Burma. Ships fitted out at Calcutta were
Tushed to Vizagapatam where the Brigade and
Beach Group were embarked, and then sailed
to Chittagong where they arrived on the 4th
January. In spite of bad weather, vehicles
were discharged, waterproofed and _ re-
embarked, and the force mounted by the 8th
January, when the convoy. sailed on to stage
at Akyab. This convoy was followed: shortly
afterwards by the remaining Ramree assault
convoys, which sailed on the 17th, 18th and
19th January.

343. Due to the combined results of our own
bombing, the Japanese denial measures and
general neglect during the occupation, the port,
and accommodation facilities at Akyab and
Kyaukpyu were found to be almost negligible.
At Akyab the main stone jetties and
approaches required extensive repairs, and the
removal of two ships sunk alongside was
necessary. In addition considerable new con-
struction was required. Development began
on the 15th January. By the 12th February,
seven pontoon jetties had been built, and a
fortnight later the stone jetty had been suffi-
ciently repaired to be used for personnel. A
new solid timber piled wharf 600 feet long
and twelve feet wide was built in a space
of six weeks, and by the end of April, not
only had a wreck at the main jetty been
removed ‘but the jetty itself had been com-
pletely repaired, all the stone for which had had
to be imported. For all this work, only one
Port Construction Company was employed,
which carried out its task more efficiently, des-
pite shortages of material. The target set for
the development was 1,200 tons daily before the
monsoon and 800 tons daily during it. By
the beginning of April, the target had been
exceeded and on the 3rd April a record dis-
charge of 2,406 tons was achieved. The initial
working of the port in the early stages was by
41 Beach Group ut the responsibility was
handed over early in February to a Port Com-
mandant.

344. At Kyaukpyu there were no existing
facilities at all. Development as a beach port
began on the 2ist February. Despite the fact
that only one Port Construction Company was
available, and that it had to do most of the
sorting of stores besides its proper work, (by the
end of April five pontoon jetties with Bailey
Bridge approaches had been built, a timber
pier 130 feet long with a 122 foot pontoon head
had been completed, and a start made on a
trestle jetty. As in the case of Akyab, the
initial working of the port had been by 41
Beach Group who soon handed over to the
Port Commandant. The target port capacity
was the same as for Akyab, but with very
incomplete facilities. This target was early
exceeded, a record discharge of 1,767 tons
being achieved on the 17th March.

345. The development of Kyaukpyu port and
the Ramree Advanced Base was complicated

by the fact that in March it became necessary

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

to switch the maintenance of 15 Indian Corps”
mainland operations to them. As the de-
velopment of the Base was then in its early
stages, the requirements of 15 Indian Corps
could not be met in full without prejudicing
its completion. Priority was given to the
development of the Base, as this was now
essential to ensure the readiness of the airfields
for the supply of Fourteenth Anmy as it
advanced southwards towards Rangoon, and
the 15 Indian Corps Commander’s plan for
destroying the enemy had to be modified con-
siderably. I have already referred to the
necessity for taking 15 Indian Corps off air
supply at this time, since all transport aircraft
were required for the maintenance of Four-
teenth Army.

346. Bulk petrol tankage projects were
planned for both Akyab and Kyaukpyu, with
a target completion date of the Ist May. In
the case of Akyab, however, this was acceler-
ated to the 15th April; and the’ first tanker
discharged on the 21st, just in time for the
intensive air supply effort to support Four-
teenth Army in the last critical stage of their
advance. Nevertheless, the situation gave cause
for anxiety. Squadrons were greatly exceeding
the rates of maximum effort, which resulted in
abnormal consumption of petrol, oil and lubri-
cants. Although the actual consumption was
far in excess of estimate, our petrol stocks just
held out. Aero engine lubricants were flown
in from Chittagong and even from Western
Bengal, and the emergency was met.

347. In the meantime the various landing
operations on the Arakan coast had taken place.
The operations at Kangaw, the success of which
will be remembered from Part I, were main-
tained by Naval landing craft and I.W.T. from
the Base Maintenance Area which had been
established at Myebon. The operations against
Ru-Ywa were mounted and maintained from
Myebon and Kangaw. The Tamandu opera-
tions were maintained from Akyab, and the
Letpan landing by Naval landing craft and
LW.T. from Ramree.

348. The last important event on the
Southern L. of C. was the mounting of the
modified Dracula operation from Ramree in
April. This was done under supervision of
453 Sub-Area. With the very limited port
facilities available, this task caused consider-
able interference with the build-up of the
Advanced Base, but as progress was well ad-
vanced iby this date, the repercussions were
not serious. To start with, the only available
facilities at Kyaukpyu were a small beach and
a ricketty jetty. IW.T. creek steamers were
used for the embarkation of personnel while
“Z” craft and ramped cargo lighters were
employed for loading vehicles and stores. The
weather fortunately remained calm and the
mounting was carried out in accordance with
the programme in spite of a number of last
minute changes due to the rapidity with which
the whole plan had been prepared.

349. In spite of the meagre facilities avail-
able, and the additional strain put ov the port
by the mounting of Dracula, the discharge of
maintenance cargo ships was maintained at a
most satisfactory rate. The work done in
