being acted on, and although no major
operations took place in the Middle East during
the latter months of the period of my command,
administrative commitments continued on a
large scale, and in some respects were greater
than during the ‘North African campaign. The
administrative effort involved in the continued
maintenance of our forces established in Sicily
and Italy remained unaffected, and that the
importance of the Middle East Base was
enhanced and not diminished by the opening
of the Mediterranean is shown by the fact that
our military imports for August and September,
1943, reached the record figures of 305,000
and 297,000 tons respectively, whilst military
exports throughout the year averaged over
200,000 tons per month.

359. The increased activity of the Middle
East Base at this time is illustrated ‘by the fol-
lowing statistics. During the period, February,
1943, to January, 1944, Royal Engineer work-
shops produced inter alia 2,660,000 forty-
gallon petrol drums and, including Jerricans,
5,400,000 four-gallon returnable petrol con-
tainers. The output of the Royal Electrical
and Mechanical Engineers’ base workshops was
greater in December than in February, 1943,
and included over 300 tanks, 600 armoured
cars, scout cars or carriers, 3,500 ‘‘ B’’ vehicles
and 6,000 ‘‘B’’ vehicle engines. Similarly,
the activity in ordnance installations during the
quarter ending 31st December, 1943, was
greater than during the quarter ending 31st
March, 1943. Nearly 150,000 tons of ammuni-
tion were received compared with 135,000 tons;
113,000 tons of ammunition were issued com-
pared with 102,000 tons; while 173,000 tons of
stores were received compared with 148,000
tons.

360. In the same way as the changed role of
the Command has not affected the volume of
administrative effort, it has left the number of
men under command largely unaffected. Like
the administrative commitment, they showed
a slight increase, rather than a fall in numbers.
When I took over command I had 520,000
officers and men under command; when I
handed over, there were 635,000 troops in the
Command, and of these the lange proportion.
of 113,000 were allies under training.

361. The change of role could not have taken
place, and Middle East Command could not
have maintained Eighth Army and mounted the
forces for Sicily and Italy, without close co-
operation with the Royal Navy and the Royal
Air Force, an excellent administrative system,
and confidence in internal security. For the
last requisite, the uniformly good conduct of
officers and men has been an invaluable contri-
butory cause.

362. I wish to bring to notice the services
of the undermentioned officers during my
period of command: Lieut.-General Sir W.
Lindsell, Lieut.-General in Charge of Adminis;
tration, Middle East Forces. It was due to his
outstanding capacity for administration and
organisation that the Eighth Army in North
Africa. was maintained and the expeditions
against Italy launched. In addition, as Chair-
man of the Middle East Supply Board and Civil
Affairs Committee, he was responsible for the
build-up and efficiency of these and other para-
military organisations concerned with post-

Central Mediterranean campaign.

Lieut.-General R. W. G. H. Stone, Com-
manding British Troops in Egypt, was respon-
sible for the local administration and movement
of the various formations and units during the
concentration period, which proved of invalu-
able assistance to the staffs concerned. He has
paid particular attention to the welfare of the
troops.in the Command and is responsible for
raising it to a high standard of efficiency and
popularity. He was responsible, throughout
the period, for the maintenance of good rela-
tions with the Egyptian Government, a difficult
and exacting task which he executed with tact.

Lieut.-General W. G. Holmes, Commanding
Ninth Army, established firm and good rela-
tions with the French authorities in Syria and
the Lebanon, in spite of great difficulties and
provocation. He maintained throughout an
attitude which enhanced the prestige of the
army and avoided friction. He was responsible
for the training of British and Allied forma-
tions; he produced good results and also dealt
with certain political troubles that arose with
the Greek Force with acumen and tact.

Major-General D. F. McConnell, Command-
ing Palestine Area, carried out a difficult task
with commendable firmness and tact. He is
responsible for the excellent relations existing
with the Civil Government for dealing with
disturbances,
