SUPPLEMENT 10 THE LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 10948

be’ postponed until early summer, Had the
Germans been able to renew their offensive
when the snows melted, starting from the line
they had gained during the autumn, their
advanced guard would in all probability have
appeared south of the Caucasus at the very
moment when we were considering how we
might oppose their gathering strength in Libya.
I have described how in January and February
Japanese successes in the Indian Ocean made
it necessary to withdraw several divisions from
the Middle East, and how I was obliged to
instruct the Ninth and Tenth Armies to retire
in the event of an enemy advance. Develop-
ments in Libya during the months that fol-
lowed caused the troops allotted to the defence
of the Northern Front to be still further
reduced.

‘With the approval of the other Commanders-
in-Chief, I decided in March temporarily to
reduce the garrison of Cyprus, in order to com-
‘pensate for our losses and to find troops for
‘Libya. It had been estimated that one infantry
division with a proportionate amount of armour
and artillery and six additional] infantry batta-
lions were required to defend the island. My
policy was to keep in the island all the equip-
ment, transport, ammunition and stores re-
quired for this garrison, but to reduce the in-
fantry and artillery personnel to about one-
third. It was expected that we should have
about three weeks warning of-attack, and it
should be possible with the help of the-Royal
Navy to bring the garrison quickly to its full
strength.

At about this time the 4th Indian Division
relieved the 5th Indian Division in the island,
and Major-General Tuker finally reorganised its
defences. The basic principle of the defence
was that the air forces on the island should be
kept in full operation. It was not considered
possible to prevent the enemy getting a foot-
hold at some point on the coastline, and the
main effort of the defence was therefore to be
concentrated on protecting the landing grounds
in the central plain. For the same reason all
important depots and installations were sited
inland wherever feasible. As large a propor-
tion of the garrison as possible was to be made
mobile so that it might operate against enemy
landings. Instructions laying down these prin-
ciples were issued on the 1st July.*

The reduced strength of the Cyprus garrison
caused some uneasiness in London lest the
enemy should undertake a combined operation,
now that our own naval and.air forces in the
Eastern Mediterranean were so much reduced.
After examining the problem again, the Com-
manders-in-Chief were able to reassure the
Chiefs of Staff, as it was thought that an
attempt at invasion was unlikely unless the
enemy had the use of landing grounds in
Southern Anatolia. = ©

During April the mounting strength of the
German and Italian forces in Cyrenaica had
compelled me once more to review the policy
for the defence of Syria and Iraq, and on the
2gth April I issued revised instructions for deal-
ing with an attack through Anatolia.

By now it had become evident that our
original estimate of the forces required to defend

the western frontier of Egypt against an enemy
attack in strength would have to be consider-
ably increased. This meant that many of the
troops allotted to the defence of the Northern
Front would not be available, should need arise,
and that, therefore, we must contemplate
having to withdraw even further to the south.
In Iraq and Persia I hoped to be able to hold
the same positions as under our previous plan,
but on the left, in order to meet the possibility
of having to abandon the Lebanon fortresses,
I gave orders for fresh positions to be fortified
in Northern Palestine and along the Jordan.
It was still my object to keep our bases and
ports and the oilfields of southwestern Persia
secure, but this seemed to bbe ‘becoming more
and more difficult to achieve, if the expected
enemy offensive should take shape.

The question of giving aid to the Turks, in
the event of their being attacked by the Axis
Powers, had been periodically under review
ever since the previous December. At that time
the Middle East Defence Committee had
advised His Majesty’s Government in the
United Kingdom that, as the existing communi-
cations in Turkey were poor and vulnerable, it
would be unwise to suggest to the Turks that
we should be able to assist them with consider-
able land forces should they be attacked in the
spring of 1942. The Committee recommended
instead that we should rather stress the help
we might be able to afford them in the air, and
also urged that every effort should be made to
send the Turks all the small arms, engineering
stores, motor vehicles, and raw material for
their munition factories that could be spared.
The Turks, on their part, though obviously
anxious to accept our aid and to see our cause
successful, were extremely careful to avoid any
overt action which might cause Germany to
question their neutrality, and this made it most
difficult to make really effective preparations to
assist them.

In April, the Commanders-in-Chief recom-
mended to the Chiefs of Staff that Turkey
should be included in the sphere of action of
the Minister of State in Cairo, in order to
enable our relations with her to be co-ordinated
iby one authority on the spot, particularly in
regard to assistance in the event of an Axis
attack. This recommendation, however, did
not meet with the approval of the Foreign
Office in view of the complicated and delicate
nature of the relations between Turkey, Great
Britain and the Soviet.

In spite of these difficulties we pressed for-
ward steadily with our schemes for assisting
Turkey, and a considerable amount of useful
preparatory work was done, in the way of im-
proving ports, roads and railways, and aero-
dromes. We were also able to introduce un-
ostentatiously a large quantity of warlike stores
into Anatolia. In all these activities we were
greatly aided by the tactful and untiring efforts
of Major-General A. Arnold, Military Attaché
at Ankara.

On the roth May I issued instructions govern-
ing the action to be taken in the event of enemy
attack through the Caucasus* It was fairly
safe to assume that the enemy would be un-
able to invade Turkey at the same time, and
that the Ninth Army could therefore be left
with just sufficient troops for guard duties. In
