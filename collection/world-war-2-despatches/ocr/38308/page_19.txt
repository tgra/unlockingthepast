SUPPLEMENT 10 tz LONDON GAZETTE, 2 JUNE, 9i8

7th May.

At 0625 Cruising Disposition was formed on
the tankers, and fuelling recommenced.

Fuelling and exchange of stores, mail and
correspondence were completed by 1400, when
the Fleet disengaged from the tankers.

H.M.A.S. NORMAN was ordered to escort
R.F.A.s WAVE KING and WAVE MONARCH
to Leyte, and H.M. Ships WHIMBREL and
AVON similarly escorted R.F.Ass SAN
eds SAN ADOLPHO and CEDAR-

During this day and yesterday H.M. S.
FORMIDABLE was busy making good bomb
damage, and became fully operational. :

At 1400 the Fleet in Cruising ‘Disposition took
departure for the operations area,

Late this night the very satisfactory and
gtatifying news of the unconditional surrender *
of the German Armed Forces to the Allies was
received. Active operations were’ ordered to
"cease at ooorB on gth May, 1945.

U.S. Task Group 52.1 covered Sakishima.

8th May

The plan for the day was to bomb Miyako
and Ishigaki, to maintain the usual island
CAPS, and also to bombard Ishigaki runways
and A.A. positions with the battleships and
6 in, cruisers. The Carrier Squadron, supported
by both 5.25 in. cruisers and 8 destroyers were
to close Ishigaki behind the bombarding force
until such time as land echoes would just not
interfere with air warning.

The weather deteriorated during the night,
and at'0400 as the forecast gave-no hope of
improvement, the plan to bombard was can-
- celled in favour of one to carry out four bomber
strikes following previous patterns.

At 0515 A.C.1 assumed tactical command,
and at.o600 CAPS for the islands and Fleet
were flown off in position 22° 53’ N 125° 40’ E.
The weather was overcast .and raining at the -
time, and the island CAPS soon reported similar
conditions with the islands difficult to locate.
The first strike was therefore cancelled. It was
decided to remain in the operating area to await
better weather, but at ror5 the island CAPS
reported no improvement and the meteorologi-
cal chart showed Formosa to be shut down by
similar weather.

Since it was thus evident that Sakishima
could be of no use, to the enemy in such con-
ditions, at 1050 the Fleet withdrew to the south
eastward, maintaining a reduced CAP.

Although the weather forecast for the follow-
ing day promised deterioration rather than
improvement I informed Commander 5th Fleet
of the withdrawal due to weather, and of my
intention to strike on oth and roth May. Plans
for bombardment on on May were abandoned.
At 1805, just after the last CAP for the day
had been flown off, visibility shut down com-
pletely with continuotis heavy rain. There were
indications of clearer weather to the westward
and course was shaped towards it. It was with
difficulty that fighters were vectored back to
the Fleet and searchlights were burned to aid
them. At 1905 the fighters at sea level, having
“sighted the searchlights, reached the Fleet and
were flown on.

CIF 57 assumed tactical command ‘at,1920.

oth May

At o5zo0 A.C.1 assumed tactical command,
The weather although showery was much im-

proved and continued ‘to do so during the day.

At 0545 the CAPS were flown off in position
23° 06’ N 126° oo’ E. Weather over the
targets was reported as satisfactory. All run-
ways at Hirara were reported as serviceable.

Four bomber strikes were flown off during
the day, two to each island, the first being
launched at 0830 in position 23° 40’. N
125° 34’ E. All runways were re-cratered, a
direct hit was scored on one aircraft on the
ground at Miyako. A motor transport park at
Ishigaki was attacked, three vehicles being
destroyed for certain.

Low flying fighters discovered a Val hidden
in a cave: Firing through the entrance to the
cave they destroyed the enemy in flames.

At 1145 the Fleet was sighted by a ‘bogey
which, approached within 30 miles. Fighters
drove it off but were unable to catch it.

At 1645 bogeys were detected very low 22
miles to the westward, coming in fast. Four
Seafires intercepted at 15 miles, but allowed
themselves to be all decoyed away by one air-
craft which they shot down. Meanwhile four
other enemy planes evaded another division of

eafires, and after climbing to about 3,000 feet
penetrated to the Fleet.

From 1650 onwards the Fleet was radically
manceuvred by emergency turns at 22 knots.-
One minute after such a turn of 60° to star-
‘board was executed, a suicider made a 10°
angle dive onto H.M.S. VICTORIOUS from her .
starboard quarter. “The enemy was well hit by
close range weapons ‘but crashed onto the flight
deck near the forward lift. The resulting fire.
was quickly brought under control, but the
bomb explosion holed the flight deck, put the
accelerator out of action, rendered one 4.5 in,
gun unserviceable, and damaged one lift hoist-
ing motor.

At 1656 another Kamikaze made a shallow
pore glide from astern on H.M.S. - VIC-

ORIOUS. Though hit hard by gunfire, and
well on fire, it hit the flight ik: aft a glancing
blow, and burning furiously passed over. the
side. Damage to the ship was confined to one
arrester unit out of action, a 40 mm. gun direc-
tor destroyed, and four Corsairs on deck
damaged beyond repair. .

Casualties from both these attacks were three
killed, four seriously injured, and 15 wounded..

At 1657 a third suicider made a pass at
H.M.S. VICTORIOUS but then shifted target
to H.M.S. HOWE. further ahead,’ and ap-
proached her from the starboard quarter in a
Jong shallow dive. This time the attacker was
hit at a more reasonable range, and continued
to be so until he crashed in flames roo yards
from’ H.M.S. HOWE after passing over the
quarterdeck.

At 1705 a fourth Kamikaze approached
H.M.S. FORMIDABLE and then H.MS.
INDOMITABLE, being engaged by both ships.
without apparent result. It then turned’ and
dived into the after deck park of ELMS. :
FORMIDABLE.

There was a large ‘explosion and fire and a
great deal of smoke. Speed was reduced’ to
15 knots to aid control of the fire which was
