whilst the entire- anchorage had ‘been heavily
mined. All types of mines were swept during

the next few days in Cherbourg harbour—-

moored contact, ground contact, fired on a snag
line, moored magnetic, ground magnetic, and
ground acoustic. A great number of ships
‘had been sunk in the harbour, and full scope
was given to the genius of Commodore Sullivan,
U.S. Navy, in effecting the clearance of the

port, which in the event took nearly 90 days. . |

Sound Army Administrative Position.

79. During the first few weeks: of the opera-
tion frequent representations were made by
your staff and those of your Army Group Com-
manders whenever the build-up: appeared to
fall any distance short of the plan. This was
natural and their desire for the maximum rate
of reinforcement and of landing stores was fully
shared by me. Sometimes. I felt, however,
that their protests were not entirely related to
facts as, so far as I know, the position of the
Expeditionary Force was never in doubt from
D+2.onwards. The naval view had always
been that the build-up plan should be an
optimum plan at which we should aim but
that its attainment was most improbable, if
only by reason of the naval difficulties inherent

- in the continuous turn round of such a large

volume of shipping. In the event, not only
naval difficulties were experienced during the
first few weeks, but also a considerable number
of military ones, especially with regard to
loading in the port of Southampton, and the
programme did fall behind as we had expécted
that it would. It was very satisfactory, there-
fore, to me that your Chief Administrative
Officer was able to report at his meeting held
on ist July, that the ‘‘ Commanders in the
field had complete freedom of action so far as
the administrative arrangements were con-
This, it was considered, confirmed
our view that the Navy had in fact met the
Ammy’s ‘requirements for their! reinforcement
and maintenance.

Withdrawal of Task Force and’ Assault Force
Commanders. Transfer of Naval Com-
mand ashore. + - so,

80. During the last few days of June the

British and U.S. Assault Force Commanders

- were successively withdrawn from the assault

area when conditions ‘in their sector penmitted.
On 25th June, Rear-Admiral J. W. Rivett-
Carnac established his Headquarters ashore as
F.O.B.A.A.* and Rear-Admiral: J. Wilkes
similarly hoisted his flag as F.O, West on 27th
Jane. (Rear-Admiral Sir Philip Vian left the
British Assault Area on 30th June when the
Command was assumed by F.O!B.A.A. Rear-

‘Admiral Alan Kirk withdrew ‘from the U.S.

Assault Area on 3rd July, when F.O. West
assumed command. The withdrawal of all
these officers and the transfer of the two naval
commands to the shore marked the stabilisa-
tion of the naval position in the assault area
and the conclusion of the first phase in the
capture of the lodgment area by our armies.
Both during the training and planning period,
and during the operation, the Task Force and

’ Assault Force Commanders and their subor-

dinates rendered the very highest service to
the operation and thus to the Allied cause. The

experience that the majority of them had gained
in other theatres in-previous amphibious opera-
tions proved invaluable. They afforded me
the greatest possible measure of support and
assistance and I could not have wished for
more loyal or helpful*commanders.

Comments and Recommendations of Task
Force Commanders. oO

8x. A large number of comments”on the
operation and recommendations arising there-
from are included in the reports of Navak
Commanders Eastern and Westetn Task Forces. ~
It is clear that Naval Commander Western
Task Force and his staff had considerable diffi-
culty both during the preparatory period and
during the operation in working in a foreign
country.and with a command system which
was unfamiliar to them. The fact that they
overcame these difficulties so well reflects great
credit on them all. - It is obvious that the generak
organisation and procedure to be adopted for
‘any joint operation must be that of the natiom
from whose country it is launched. Although.
British and American methods are by no means.
similar, we are-now becoming accustomed to:
each other’s working, and with: the mutual
trust and goodwill which’ has obtained in the
past there should be no undue difficulties im
this respect in the future.

My Relations with the Home Commands.

82. The introduction of a Flag Officer as.
Allied Naval Comimander-in-Chief to conduct
an operation of the nature and extent of
«Neptune ’’ naturally called for a careful con-

sideration of the system of command and divi-
sion of responsibilities as between myself and?
the respective Home Commanders-in-Chief im
whose stations I was called upon to.plan and!
to operate. It was clear’ that whilst’ I was:
charged with the preparation of the naval plan
and with the formation and training of the
naval assault forces, and later with the chief:
naval command of the operation, the executive
implementation of the plan must very largely
remain in the hands of the Home Commanders-
in-Chief. From the very outset it was my

policy to make them my agents for this opera~ -

tion and to employ existing organisations,
where these existed, rather than to institute
new ones. This policy worked admirably.

83. Some resentmerit might -well have been.
felt by the Commanders-in-Chief, Home Com- .
mands in the Channel, at receiving directions.

from an authority other than the Admiralty, {

especially as all three were senior to me. IT
cannot speak too highly, however, of the
unselfish manner in which they accepted the
situation and I would particularly mention
Admiral Sir Charles J. C. Little, Commander-
in-Chief, Portsmouth, on whose Command fell
the’ main burden of ‘the operation on the naval.
side. Admiral of the Fleet Sir John C. Tovey
(Commander-in-Chief, The Nore) and Admiral
Sir Ralph Leatham (Commander-in-Chief,
Plymouth) together with Admiral Sir Henry
D. Pridham-Wippell (Admiral Commanding
Dover) also thiew themselves wholeheartedly
.and unselfishly into our preparations, quickly
gtasping the problems ahead of them and re-.
organising their Commands to deal admirably
with the particular requirements of
“Neptune ’’.. During the operation the co~
ordination between the Commands was perfect,
