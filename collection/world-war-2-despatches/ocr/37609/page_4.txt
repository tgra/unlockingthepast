in Abyssinia on the outbreak of war with Italy.
For the reasons stated in paragraph 8 above,
our preparations had been considerably” ham-
pered, but a number of arms had been collected
and a Mission had been formed to get in touch
with the patriots ds soon as possible. The
Emperor, His Majesty Haile Selassie, arrived in
the Sudan, with the object of providing a focus
for the rising. Arrangements were made for
him to be accommodated at Khartoum until it
should be possible for him to enter Abyssinia.

23. Meanwhile, on 17th June, the French
Government had asked for armistice terms,
which they accepted on 22nd June. It was at
first hoped that the French Colonies and Over-
sea territories would continue the struggle; but
General Nogues in North Africa, after a little
hesitation, decided to obey the orders to capitu-
Jate, and his example was followed shortly after-
wards by General Mittelhauser in Syria, who
only a few days earlier had declared to me at
Beirut his unalterable determination to continue
the struggle. General Legentilhomme at Jibuti
held out for nearly a month longer.

The collapse of the French in North Africa
meant that the Italians could employ the whole
weight of their large ground and air forces in
Libya against the Western frontier of Egypt.
The defection of Syria meant that Palestine no
longer had a secure and friendly northern flank
and that the French force of three divisions
which had constituted the general reserve of the
Middle East for assistance to Turkey or Greece,
or for the defence of Egypt if required, could
no longer be counted on.

A certain number of officers and men from
Syria, including the greater part of a Colonial
battalion -which had, at the request of the
French, been stationed at Cyprus, joined the
British forces and were formed into a mobile
battalion which is now engaged on the ‘Western
Frontier of Egypt.

A Polish force of some 4,000 men, which had
been formed and was under training by the
French in Syria, came to Palestine and joined
the British Forces.

A note on the foreign contingents which have
joined the Forces in the Middle East is given in
Appendix B.

24. Thus before the end of July it became
obvious that unless reinforcements in men and
material were sent to the Middle East forthwith,
there was grave danger of our being unable to
withstand the enemy’s attacks. I received
orders to visit England to discuss the situation
with the military authorities and the War Cabi-
net, As a result of the discussions reinforce-
ments were despatched to the Middle East. The
greater part of the forces available who were
sufficiently equipped and trained were moved to
the Western Desert. This included a New Zea-
land Brigade Group and later an Australian
Brigade Group.

. Italian Attack on Somaliland

. 25. Meanwhile in French Somaliland General
Legentilhomme had found himself unable, in
spite of his gallant efforts, to induce the Colony
to continue to fight. The Italians were thus
enabled to concentrate the whole weight of their
very numerous forces in the East of Italian East
Africa against British Somaliland, which they
invaded early in August. The operations,
which resulted in the temporary loss of British
Somaliland, have already been described in a
despatch dated 12th September, 1940.

SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 13 JUNE, 1946

Operations on Western Frontier of Egypt.
June-November, 1940.

26. The force sent to the Western frontier of
Egypt was the 7th Armoured Division less one
armoured brigade. Actually the troops to pro-
ceed to the frontier were the 7th Hussars, a light
tank regiment of the 4th Armoured Brigade;
the 11th Hussars, armoured car regiment; the
1st King’s Royal Rifle Corps and 2nd Rifle
Brigade, motor battalions; and two regiments
of Royal Horse Artillery, one of which was
an anti-tank regiment with 37 mm. Bofors
guns for which only a limited supply of
ammunitian was available. The 6th Royal
Tank Regiment, the second regiment of the 4th
Armoured Brigade, was kept in divisional
reserve. The 4th Armoured Brigade had no
third regiment, and all its units were much
below establishment.

27. Just east of the Egyptian frontier an
escarpment several hundred feet high runs from
Sollum south-eastwards for about 30 miles, and
is passable to mechanised vehicles only at a few
places. At Sollum itself the road up. the
escarpment is steep with a number of hairpin
bends. South and west of the escarpment the
ground is generally easily passable by all types
of mechanised vehicles. Between the escarp-
ment and the sea the going is more difficult
and movement is generally confined to certain
tracks.

Our force on the frontier was operating at
a distance of 120 miles from the railhead at
Matruh which made the administrative pro-
blem an extremely difficult one and limited the
number of troops that could be employed.

28. On the night of 11/12th June the rxth
Hussars crossed the frontier and captured a
detachment of two Italian officers and 59 other
ranks. On 14th June the enemy’s two frontier
forts at Capuzzo and Maddalena were attacked
and captured by the 7th Hussars, 11th Hussars
and a company of the King’s Royal Rifle
Corps, about 220 prisoners being captured.

2g. On 16th June a most successful action
was fought by the 7th Hussars and 11th
Hussars supported by a troop of ‘‘ J’ Bat-
tery R.H.A. nine miles north of Sidi Omar.
Twelve enemy tanks were destroyed, and a con-
siderable number of the enemy killed and about
160 prisoners taken. Three guns and a number
of lorries were also captured or destroyed. On
the same day a troop of the 11th Hussars inter-
cepted a convoy on the Tobruk-Bardia road,
destroyed 30 lorries and captured a number of
prisoners, including a general officer.

Several other successful patrol actions were
fought during the next few weeks. An opera-
tion to capture the Jerabub Oasis was planned
for the beginning of July, but abandoned owing
to great heat. Meanwhile large enemy forces,
amounting to at least two divisions, had
advanced towards the frontier. An enemy
brigade reoccupied the ruins of Fort Capuzzo,
which had been destroyed, and advanced
towards Sollum, but was repulsed. The
enemy’s position.at Fort Capuzzo was made
extremely uncomfortable for him. His force
was continually shelled by our artillery, and
transport bringing up supplies from Bardia was
constantly attacked or shelled, with the result
that the enemy undoubtedly suffered extremely
heavy casualties both in men and in vehicles.

By the middle of July the enemy had two
divisions, and elements of two more, on the
