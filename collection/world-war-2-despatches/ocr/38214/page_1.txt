\ The following Despatch was submitted to the

: Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on the
17th December, 1941, by Vice-Admial Sir
Geoffrey Layton, K.C.B., D.S.O., Comman-
der-n-Chnef, Eastern Fleet.

Office of the British Naval
4 Commander-in-Chef,
Eastern Fleet,
17th December, Ig4I.

/ Be pleased to lay before the Board the accom-

: panying reports on the operations resulting in
the loss of H.M. Ships PRINCE OF WALES
and REPULSE on ioth December, 1941.

2. These reports comprise a narrative of the
operations drawn up by my direction and the
original reports from the Commanding and sur-
viving Officers of H.M. Ships concerned.*

3. The press of time and circumstances have
prevented a more thorough analysis of the
operations being made so far and I consider it
preferable to despatch forthwith the available
evidence, as many of the officers concerned are

| now returning to the United Kingdom.

4. In the circumstances, I feel unable, as
I would wish to have done, to bring to the
| special notice of Their Lordships cases of indi-
vidual good service, of which there were many.
| I will submit my further observations at a later
stage, but in the meantime I would ask Their
} Lordships to obtain from Captain W. G.
Tennant, R.N., and Lieutenant-Commander
‘ A. G. Skipwith, R.N., their recommendations
for the recognition of those who were specially

\ deserving.
5. All accounts agree that 1n coolness, deter-
mination, and cheerfulness m adverse circum-
stances, the ships’ companies of these two ships

NARRATIVE OF OPERATIONS OF
FORCE Z.

otherwise indicated) .

Intentions of the Commander-in-Chnef.

It was the intention of the Commander-in-
Chief to attack Japanese transports and war-
ships which had been reported early on 8th
December to be landing troops on the east coast
of the Kra Isthmus and at Kota Bharu.

2. It was known by noon on that day that our
Air Force and aerodromes in the north were
being heavily attacked and that large Japanese
forces were landing at Kota Bharu in Malaya
and between Singgora and Pattani in Thailand.
It appeared likely that our Army and Aur Force
would both be hard pressed and it seemed to the
Commander-in-Chief inacceptable to retain a
powerful naval force at Singapore in a state
of inaction.

3. The Commander-in-Chief hoped that, with
fighter protection if possible, or failing that, by
surprise, he might attack the Japanese forces
off jpinggora and Kota Bharu at dawn on the
Toth.

with the Eastern Fleet Admiral Layton assumed
command of the Eastern Fleet at about 1500GH on
the roth December, 1941 He had therefore no
responsibility for the operations ot Force Z nor for any
