SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

which would have come as a very welcome
Present to the German people at the beginning
of a hard winter. I devoted my attention,
therefore, to the exclusion of adventures further
afield, to the task of containing, and man-
handling as far as possible, the German forces
facing us in Italy.* :

Battles of Termoli and the Voléurno.

Now that the Foggia plain had been over-
run the sector allotted to Eighth Army was a
mountain and foothill region separated from
the Adriatic Sea by a narrow coastal plain.
The lower slopes of this area offer only moder-
ate difficulties to an advancing army; but on
the left the centre of the pensinsula is in all
places steep and precipitous, completely un-
suited to the manoeuvre of armour, for all
movement is confined to the roads. The
coastal plain with its gentle slopes presents
greater opportunities but here trees and in-
tensive cultivation also favour the defence by
limiting the field of view and the effectiveness
of weapons. Major rivers cross the whole
Tegion at approximately ten mile intervals,
at right angles to our line of advance; in the
Mountains they are swift-running streams
usually between high banks and in their lower
teaches they spread out into broad sandy and
gravel beds where the streams meander widely,
normally shallow but liable to sudden flash
floods. We could expect plenty of rain in the
autumn, up to five inches a montht, and snow
above two thousand feet as early as December.
This would assist the effectiveness of bridge
demolitions and render movement off the roads
most difficult. The only good continuous
roads forward lay on either side of the Army
sector, forty miles apart; these were the coast
road through Termoli and Vasto (Route 16)
and a mountain road through Vinchiaturo and
Isernia (Route 17). A number of first or
second class laterals connected these roads by
tortuous routes over mountains and along
river valleys, and between them lay other less
direct routes forward which could be used by
up to one division.

Eighth Army’s maintenance situation was
now better and likely to improve and General
Montgomery decided to seize with light forces
a line including Termoli, where there was a
small port which might be of use, and Vinchia-
turo, a communications centre on Route 17.
After this it would be necessary to pause to
establish our administrative facilities on a
firmer basis before advancing to contact the
main German winter line on the Sangro. The
enemy on this front consisted of the LKXVI
Panzer Corps with 1 Parachute and 29 Panzer
Grenadier Divisions, holding a front from the
Adriatic to Benevento.
originally under command of XIV Panzer
Corps in the Benevento area, came under com-
mand after the beginning of October, operat-
ing south of the Benevento-Isernia road with a
detachment operating on the Foggia-Isernia
road. General Montgomery’s plan was to em-
ploy 13 Corps for his advance with 78 Division

*I have here dealt with the proposed operations
in the Balkans from the purely military point of view.
There were, of course, political reasons both for and
against such a course.

} For those to whom such statistics mean little,
the mean annual rainfall of London is 23% inches.
The Italian winter climate came as a great disappoint-
ment to-all those who were only acquainted with it
from tourist propaganda.

tight and i Canadian Division left while 5
Corps took command of the remaining forma-
tions, x Airborne, 5 Infantry and 8 Indian
Infantry Divisions, with the task of organising
the administrative build-up, securing the Army
lines of communication and protecting the left
flank of 13 Corps. On 3rd October the Royal
Navy landed 2 Special Service Brigade (Com-
mandos) at Termoli ahead of the advance of
78 Division and captured the town and port
intact, together with a number of prisoners.
They made early contact with the leading
brigade of 78 Division across the Biferno but
the difficulties of the crossing rendered this
contact precarious. A brigade of 78 Division
was therefore landed in the bridgehead area
on the night 3rd/qth October and a
further brigade was taken in by sea on 5th
October. The enemy reacted violently and
rushed over 16 Panzer Division from Army
reserve in the western sector. Fierce fighting
continued for some days. The Biferno rose in
flood and cut communication by road, but by
the 7th the enemy had accepted defeat and
drew off westward to his next line behind the
River Trigno.*

While the fighting at Termoli was in progress
1 Canadian Division was advancing up Route
17 against skilfully conducted German rear-
guards who forced our troops to deploy against
every defensible position without themselves
imperilling their withdrawal. 5 Division came

. under command of 13 Corps on gth October;

it was put in on the right of the Canadians on
11th October and on the 13th entered Casa-
calenda on Route 87. On the 14th the
Canadians captured Campobasso and om the
15th Vinchiaturo. The first part of the Army
Commander’s plan was thus completed and
the necessary pause ensued,

On the west Fifth Army’s maintenance posi-
tion, from its nearer bases, was much easier
and by the end of the first week in October
both ro and VI Corps had reached the River
Volturno. were now faced with a diffi-
cult military problem in the crossing of this
broad and swiftly flowing river and ‘the tecent
change in intentions made it certain
that the defence, though not pushed to the last
extreme, would be stubborn and protracted.
The weather was miserable, It was origi!
hoped that VI Corps would be able to force a
crossing on the night 9th/1oth October and 10
Corps on the following night, but delays were
imposed by heavy rain and bad going, com-
bined with extensive demolitions and mining.
The enemy forces opposing Fifth Army con-
sisted of XIV Panzer Corps with, from east
to west, 3 Panzer Grenadier, Hermann Goering
Panzer and 15 Panzer Grenadier Divisions.
In the lower reaches they had the advantage
of a higher flood bank on the northern side of
the river and superior observation from Monte
Massico, just in rear. Sites for a crossing were
restricted, by the difficulties of the going, to
existing sites and the river continued to rise
and fall in a baffling manner.

The attack eventually went in on the night
of the 12th. 10 made diversionary
attacks with 56 Division at Capua and 7
Armoured Division at Grazzanise and a main
attack by 46 Division at Cancello, The latter
was successful but heavy fighting followed in
difficult and open country while 56 Division
