SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, r048

The party was then withdrawn to Port
Swettenham. With a little more persistence
even greater results might perhaps have been
obtained.

2x7. It was hoped to repeat and develop
this enterprise which undoubtedly offered great
possibilities. That it was not found possible to
“ do so was due to the lack of sea transport
which resulted in the main from losses suffered
as a result of the aerial supremacy which the
enemy had established on this coast. The last
hope disappeared when on the Ist January five
“* Eureka ’’ fast coastal vessels which the Army
had purchased from America and handed over
to the Navy to operate were attacked by air-
craft on their way north to Port Swettenham
and either sunk or driven ashore. On the 30th
December also H.M.S. ‘‘ Kudat’”’, the base
depot ship for this force, was bombed and sunk
in the harbour of Port Swettenham.

218. Air Operations —The 23rd December
was the first day of intensive air action against
our troops in the forward areas. Up till then
the enemy’s air effort had been concentrated
chiefly against our aerodromes. On that day
heavy attacks were made against troops in
bivouac areas and on the move and against
Ipoh railway station. These attacks continued
for the rest of the month. Our own troops were
almost entirely without air support as all the
remaining fighters except for a few which
operated from Kuala Lampur had by now been
withdrawn to the Singapore area.

Air attacks against the Singapore area were
not renewed until the 29th December when the
first of a succession of might attacks took place.

Our own Air Striking Force, which seldom
consisted of more than half a dozen machines,
carried out night attacks against enemy
occupied aerodromes. The Sungei Patani Aero-
drome in particular, where over 100 Japanese
aircraft had been located, was attacked on
several occasions, In addition, aerial recon-
naissances were carried out daily off both the
east and west coasts as far as the availability
of aircraft permitted.

The C.-in-C. Far East laid down as a policy
that convoy protection work must in the future
take precedence over all other calls on the Air
Force.

21g. Strategy.—In a telephone conversation
which I had with the Commander 3 Indian
Corps at r100 hrs, 29th December it was agreed
that it would be better to fight the enemy in the
positions then occupied rather than carry out
any rearward movements in the immediate
future, although this in no way altered the
general instructions.

On the same day I informed the Commanders
3 Indian Corps and A.I.F. that I had arranged
with the Director of Public Works to form
Works Groups in selected areas under State
engineers who would report to them for orders.
The object of this was to prepare a series of
obstacles, especially anti-tank obstacles, in
great depth on the probable line of the enemy’s
advance. The idea was that the officers of the
Public Works Department should be given out-
line instructions and be left to carry out the
work themselves with civil labour.

On the 28th December the Commander
Singapore Fortress was ordered to prepare
schemes for the destruction of the Causeway
which connected Singapore Island with the
mainland.

Section XXV.—THE BoRNEO AND CHRISTMAS
IsLAND OPERATIONS.

220. Sarawak and Brunei.—On the 13th
December the Miri detachment, having com-
pleted its task, left for Kuching in H.M.S.
“ Lipis ’’.

ae 0330 hrs. on the 16th December Japanese
troops landed at Seria. Some of them pro-
ceeded by road to Belait. Early on the 2and
they reached Danau.

On the 19th and 20th December Japanese
aircraft attacked the aerodrome at Kuching and
also dropped bombs on and machine-gunned
the town. Many of the inhabitants evacuated.
On the 23rd December the O.C. Troops re-
ported that there had been a complete ‘break
in civil labour.

221. On the evening of the 23rd December
two Japanese cruisers and seven transports
arrived off the mouth of the River Santubong
near Kuching and landings were made during
the night. Before arrival the convoy had been
attacked by submarines of the Royal Dutch
Navy and three transports and one tanker were
reported to have been sunk or disabled. The
Japanese troops advanced in landing craft up
the waterways leading to Kuching and were
engaged by our forward troops at Pending and
elsewhere. Later in the day, the situation
having become confused, the forward troops
were withdrawn to the vicinity of the aero-
drome. In the meantime, in accordance with
the instructions received from Singapore, the
denial scheme on the aerodrome had been put
into operation.

222. At 1305 hrs. 24th December I received
a wireless message from O.C. Troops Sarawak
and Brunei to the effect that, as the aerodrome
was no longer required by our Air Force, he
presumed that he was at liberty to withdraw his
force into Dutch West Borneo. I replied to
the effect that he should fight the enemy for
as long as possible, and that subsequently he
should act in the best interest of West Borneo
as a whole, withdrawing if necessary into
Dutch territory.

223. On the evening of the 24th December
the enemy ships off Kuching were attacked by
a small force of Blenheim Bombers.

After some sharp fighting in the vicinity of
the aerodrome on the 25th December contact
was broken off in the evening and withdrawal
to Dutch West Borneo via the 50 mile jungle
path was effected. All’wheeled transport had
to be abandoned. The force arrived at Sanggau
in Dutch Borneo on the 29th December and
came under orders of the local Dutch com-
mander. Arrangements were made by Head-
quarters Malaya Command to drop supplies
and ammunition on the aerodrome at Sink-
awang for this force.

224. The Japanese arrived at the Sarawak—
Dutch West Borneo frontier on the 7th
January, 1942, but were held there by the
2/15 Punjab Regt. until the 18th January.
Much bitter fighting took place here in the
endeavour to prevent the enemy reaching the
large Dutch aerodrome at Sanggau. Eventually
the aerodrome, installations and bomb stores
were successfully demolished. A rearguard
action was then carried out to Nyabang, where
contact with the enemy was lost.

225. Subsequently it was decided to move
to the South Coast of Borneo in two columns,
