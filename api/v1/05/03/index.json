During the 28th, plans for the evacuatioa were concerted with Admiralty representatives and orders were issued to both General Carton de Wiart and General Paget as to how the evacuation was to be carried out. The evacua- tion of the French was commenced on the night of the 28th/2g9th and arrangements were made for the evacuation of the remaining troops from Namsos to be completed on the nights of the 1st/and and 2nd/3rd May. Plans for the evacuation of Andalsnes were for the evacua- tion to be carried out on two nights, Ist/2nd, and 2nd/3rd May, but the plan was made suf- ficiently elastic so that if nec the process of evacuation from this latter port could be put forward 24 hours. It had been planned when the force was evacuated from Namsos that a rearguard should fall back by land to Mosjoen retiring in the face of the enemy, and that in the meantime a party should be sent by sea to ensure holding the latter port against enemy troops landed by parachute from the air, and orders to this effect were issued. General Carton de Wiart opposed this plan on the grounds that owing to lack of petrol and trans- port and more important still, the fact that the road during the thaw was practically im- passable, the operation would be likely to end Subsequent telegrams did not induce him to alter his view and even the passage by the land route of a small party of French Chasseurs was by him deemed impossible. My final wire on this subject was to the effect that if in the opinion of General Audet the retirement of a small rearguard of French Chasseurs by the land route was impossible, this rafion was not to take place. It was evident that, if French Chasseurs could not retire along this route, the Germans could not advance along it. In the event no withdrawal by land did take place, though this was an error as the Germans have since made full use of this route, and have advanced so rapidly along it that our troops in Mosjoen have not had time to get properly established and it is more than likely that we shall not be able to hold the place."

            "description": "I therefore decided to recast the whole plan. T took the decision on 3rd May, based on a conference on 2nd May which I had been pre- vented from attending by impossible flying weather, to cancel the American assault in the west and transfer the whole weight of Seventh Army to the south-east of the island, on the immediate left of Eighth Army. I decided, in fact, to take a risk on the administrative side rather than the operational risk of dispersion of effort. This was contrary to what had hitherto been regarded as one of the funda- mental principles of the operation: that we must capture Palermo at the earliest possible oppor- tunity if we were to have a hope of maintain- ing sufficient forces for the reduction of the . island. On my new plan the only ports we should be certain of capturing in the first stage would be Syracuse and Augusta, the latter more a naval anchorage than a port, and pos- sibly Catania; the whole of Seventh Army would have to depend on beach maintenance except for such help as it might get from the small port of Licata which, as already stated, was only rated at a capacity of six hundred tons a day.* The risk was therefore grave, but there were two factors which brightened the prospect. The first was that there was a reasonable probability of suitable weather in July for beach maintenance. The second was the coming of the Duxw. I need not describe these ingenious amphibious vehicles, which are now familiar to everyone, but it is interesting to note, in view of the great part they later played, that I had never seen one up to that time. General Millert, my Major General, Administration, had received advance reports and had ordered large quantities from the United States on 22nd March. When they arrived it was discovered that the claims made for them were fully justified by their perform- ance. It is not too much to say, indeed, that the Duxw revolutionised the problem of beach maintenance. Nevertheless I arranged that Eighth Army should meet the commitment of providing a thousand tons per day through Syracuse for Seventh Army from D plus 14 to supplement their maintenance over the beaches until they could capture and bring into use the port of Palermo.:"

In spite of all these . difficulties the attack was begun on 3rd May when the znd Gold Coast Regiment made a wide flanking march cutting their way through the belts of thick forest with their pangas. On 4th May xst Gold Coast Regiment supported by artillery attacked two prominent hills which were strongly held by the enemy. A.F.V.s were sent up an old Abyssinian track to support the flank attack by 2nd Gold Coast R\u00e9giment but could make little progress. Later in the after- noon 2nd Gold Coast Regiment came in.on the enemy\u2019s left rear and by 5th May had cut the toad behind the position. The enemy however still held his main positions and it was not until roth May that he was finally driven from them on the two hills. In capturing this very formidable position the determination shown by the Gold Coast troops sustained the fighting teputation which they had gained in the first phase of the campaign."

H.Q. Frontier Battalion reached the outskirts of Debra Tabor on 7th May and from then until arrival of 4 Company on 16th May, in spite of continual rain, inadequate clothing and cover, and much lameness caused by jigger sores, they maintained systematic nightly bombing attacks on the Debra Tabor garrison, which consisted of two Blackshirt and two Colonial battalions and a regular Banda group. 4 Company continued the work with mortar support until 2oth May, when the battalion was ordered to Dessie, much to the regret of the commander, who, after an exchange of correspondence with Colonel Ange- lini, commanding the Debra Tabor garrison, believed, that in spite of his instructions to hold out to the last man, Angelini would have surrendered with a little more pushing. Major Simonds was withdrawn at the same time. Debra Tabor did not fall until the beginning of July 1943, but it remained isolated throughout the intervening period as a result of the work of Beghemder Force and the Frontier Battalion."

The tifle companies occupied in succession the hills to the west of the village, so timing their movements that the last thing the enemy saw before dark was a steady advance towards his position. After dark vigorous patrolling was carried out and one patrol succeeded in scaling the precipitous Bald Hill. This bluff was successful. The enemy believed he had repulsed a strong attack. Behind 3/18 Garhwal Rifles noise, activity and the display of lights, all carefully controlled, gave added realism to the decep- tion.

            "description": "4. After the fall of Addis Abeba I felt my best chance of a speedy liquidation of the enemy in the south was to advance on Gimma,. the seat of Government for Iea, and I com- menced operations to this end. Before these had developed I received a message from the C.-in-C. to the effect that it was essential that the road from Addis Abeba north to Asmara should be opened as soon as possible so as to. allow passage of troops to Egypt via Massawa. or Port Sudan, and he wished me to attack Dessie which was 250 miles north of Addis Abeba. I therefore instructed Commander r1ths (A) Division to undertake this task with Ist S.A. Brigade Group with the idea that they should fight their way northwards and even-- tually embark from Massawa or Port Sudan for Egypt. This Brigade Group commenced: their advance from Addis Abeba on 13th April. I informed C.-in-C. Middle East that I felt I could not-clear the road northwards of Dessie with my own resources, and asked that the Sudan forces should attack Amba Alagi which: wad the only important remaining defended. position on the road. In due course I received notification that the Sudan Forces would carry out this attack but not until 3rd May."

On the entry into Rangoon on 3rd May, 1945, theatre strategy was directed to the liberation of Singapore at the earliest possible date with a view to opening up the sea-route to Indo-China and the East Indies, and to liberating enemy-occupied countries. There- after, strategy subsequent to the re-occupation of Singapore would depend upon the march of events in the Western Pacific Theatre."

I have already mentioned in various Places in this Despatch the major changes in organization which took place and I do not propose to go into more detail except in regard to the formation of areas, etc., in L. of C. Command. The following figures, however, are of interest as indicating the amount that was done in this direction. Between the 12th November, 1944 and the 3rd May, 1945, the total number of units of all types raised was 753, reorganized 627, and disbanded 407. As tegards L. of C. Command, its organization continued to expand as the liberation of Burma progressed, The Headquarters had been raised in November. In January and February, five additional L. of C. Sub-Areas were established in Burma. No. 505 District for North Burma and No. 1 Area, South-East Asia Command, for Rangoon, were raised in March. The H.Q. for 505 District moved into Shwebo early in April, while the move of No. 1 Area into Rangoon has already been described in Section XXIH of the Despatch. In April No. 2 Area, South-East Asia Command and No. 555 Sub- Area were raised in anticipation of the require- ments of future operations."

By the afternoon of the 3rd May, when 17 Indian Division was still 32 miles from the city and held up by a flooded chaung, Ran- goon \u2018was being entered by 15 Indian Corps. 4 Corps had been frustrated, not by the Japan- ese, but by the elements. In their advance from Pyawbwe they had covered 260 miles in 20 days.

It was on this day that it might be said that the first element of the Imperial forces re- entered Rangoon. An R.AF. pilot, after seeing signals from the ground and a Union Jack flying over the jail, landed at the airfield seven miles north of the town. He was greeted by the local inhabitants, and made his way into the city and, after contacting our prisoners in the jail, went down river in a country boat and gave 26 Indian Division the news. By 2200 hours on the 3rd May, 36 Brigade had occu- pied Dala Village, opposite the Rangoon docks, against minor opposition. They had also crossed the river and entered the dock area. This was found to have been wrecked by our bombers, but the only serious damage to the residential part of the town was to the water and lighting installations. Meanwhile, 71 Brigade had occupied Syriam, the only resistance coming from snipers, and were pre- paring to cross the Pegu River."

From them it was learnt that there were some 600-700 prisoners, not fit to move, still in Rangoon gaol. These were liberated when we re-entered Rangoon on the 3rd May. The general condition of these prisoners of war was somewhat better than was expected, there being only some 50 stretcher cases. Their morale was high, despite the fact that they had been ill-treated and underfed for three years, All Allied prisoners of war were immediately evacuated by returning transport aircraft to Allied Land Forces, South-East Asia Advanced Base Hospitals at Comilla. After a week\u2019s re- cuperation, they were transferred to Base Hospitals in India."

This Division was ordered to act as rear guard to the Chinese Fifth Army. General Sun felt that his task was difficult and he was anxious that the movements of his Division should be closely co-ordinated with those of 1 Burcorps. I had already issued orders about this but as a result of General Sun\u2019s visit I again impressed on the Commander x Bur- corps that he must not withdraw from the Ye-U area until the Chinese 38 Division had passed to the north \u2018of Shwebo.
