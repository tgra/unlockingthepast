Early on the 27th he struck rapidly northwards towards Acroma and E] Adem. Meanwhile he made an abortive attack on Bir Hacheim and a half-hearted demonstration against our posi- tions between Gazala and Alem Hamza. Though somewhat scattered, the 30th Corps met the enemy\u2019s northward thrust, and heavy but indecisive fighting continued all day and resulted in the enemy being held south of a line through Knightsbridge and El Adem."

All troops were much exhausted and the enemy air bombing was as intensive as ever. The enemy had by this time landed some 30,000 to 35,000 troops on the island. Early on the morning of 27th May General Freyberg decided that evacuation was inevitable, and reported to me accordingly. In view of the situation he described and the impossibility of sending further reinforcements, I gave orders for the withdrawal of our garrisons from Crete."

            "description": "On these orders the pursuit was pressed rapidly. The main difference was that 13 Corps was no longer directed on the Terni- Rieti area but farther afield; this meant that the South Africans were no longer to turn east- wards to cross the Tiber to seize Narni as originally planned, but to press on to Orvieto. Here again a difficult question of routeing was involved since both they and II Corps were in danger of arriving simultaneously at Viterbo. I decided to give precedence to the armour and II Corps was halted in place until the South Africans were through. Meanwhile VI Corps made rapid progress up the coast in spite of the arrival of two fresh German divisions. On the gth it captured Tarquinia and a task force from 1 Armoured Division, operating on the inland flank, cut into II Corps\u2019 territory to capture the Viterbo airfield. On the rrth, however, VI Corps was relieved by IV Corps and moved to Naples, coming under command of Seventh Army for operation ANVIL. II ad pushed forward with 85 and up the axis of Route 2 and consolidated the position between VI and 13 Corps. It was relieved by the French on oth June. On the oth Eighth Amy had also carried out a regrouping; the Tiber was now to be the boundary between 13 and 10 Corps, with the latter commanding all the troops for- merly in 13 Corps east of the river. The final result was to give 13 Corps 78 and 6 South African Divisions, with 4 Division in reserve, and 10 Corps 6 British Armoured and 8 Indian Infantry Divisions, with 10 Indian as reserve. The Canadians were grounded south of Rome. The Polish Corps, which had passed to Army Group reserve on 26th May after the capture of Piedimonte, assumed command of the Ad- riatic sector from 5 Corps on 17th June, re- maining under direct command of my head- quarters until 29th June when it passed to Eighth Army.

            "description": "Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes, who had been carrying out liaison duties with HLM. the King of the Belgians since the opera- tions began, came to G.H.Q. on the morning of \u00a9 26th May, and I expressed to him my earnest hope that the Belgian Army would fall back towards the Yser. Sir Roger Keyes took this message back to the Belgian G.Q.G. at Bruges, where he saw His Majesty. Later he telegraphed to me saying that the Belgians would do their best, but that His Majesty considered that the only method of avoiding immediate and com- plete disaster was a strong and immediate counter offensive between the Lys and the Escaut. Such an operation was, however, quite out of the question since, now that 5th and 50th Divisions had been committed, my reserves were again reduced to one weak cavalry regiment."
