But he lost little time, and, whereas on the 22nd June only light forces appeared on the northern flank of the frontier positions and occupied Bardia, on the 23rd his divisions were manifestly gathering for a thrust round the south of Sidi Omar. The 7th Armoured Division, however, succeeded in preventing all but a very few from passing the fr ntier wire up to the evening of the 23rd June. ~",

The roth Indian Division and the 151st Infantry Brigade began to thin out from Sollum on the 22nd June, and the same evening the 2nd South African Brigade also began to retire from the eastern end of the escarpment. On the 23rd June, fearing that they might be cut off, General Ritchie gave General Gott permission to withdraw the remainder of the roth Indian Division from Sollum and the 3rd South African Brigade from the western end of the escarpment.

            "description": "force being cut off, the. 4th Armoured Brigade was given the: order to retire to the southern flank of.the Matruh position, where it came under the command of the 1st Armoured Division, Thexzaznd Armoured Brigade had already been withdrawn, so that by the 23rd June the columns of the two motor brigades above the escarpment, and of the 69th Infantry Brigade below it, were the only troops remaining in contact with the enemy. : F  Meanwhile changes had been made in the arrangements for fighting a decisive battle round Matruh. On the 22nd June it was decided that the New Zealand Division was more suitable for a mobile role than the roth Indian Division, and orders were issued for it to pass to the command of the 13th Corps as soon as the roth Indian Division arrived from the frontier. There was a great shortage of field artillery, and, as a disproportionate amount of infantry were likely to prove an encumbrance, instructions were-given for the infantry divisions, or what remained of them,  to be organised  into battle groups. These battle groups had as their foundation the maximum number of field guns that could be provided for each, and only just as many infantry as were needed to protect them.  The idea was that in this way the defence could be kept mobile, the battle groups being moved rapidly to that part of the front where the danger was greatest. Moreover, these groups, being comparatively weak in infantry, were not encumbered with large numbers of vehicles and could therefore .be. used in the closest co-operation with the armour. I visited Eighth Army: Headquarters on the 22nd June and confirmed these arrangements,",

            "date": "23rd June",
            "description": "It will be noted that no decision had been taken, at the time this directive was issued, whether ANVIL should be mounted or not; on the other hand the forces to be provided for it from Italy had now risen to seven divisions. This uncertainty was a very great handicap to our planning, and its psychological effect on the troops expecting to be withdrawn, especially on the French, was undoubtedly serious. It is hard to expect troops to give of their best when they are continuously  ' looking over their shoulder   to a new objective, particularly when it is so attractive an objective as the liberation of their own country. This situation lasted throughout June. On the 14th I was instructed that VI Corps Headquarters was to be withdrawn at once, 3 Division on 17th June and the 36th on 27th June. On the 24th a French division was to be withdrawn to the Naples area, followed by a second in the first week of July. On the same day  the Combined Chiefs of Staff signalled   the destruction of the German armed forces in Italy, south of the Pisa-Rimini line, must be completed. There should be no withdrawal from the battle of any Allied forces that are necessary for this purpose  . Nevertheless I was informed on the 16th that, in order to preserve the possibility of mounting ANVIL, it was necessary to proceed with the programme of withdrawal of forces already laid down. We could still hope that we might get these troops back again later but this became more unlikely after it was known that General Eisenhower had strongly recommended the operation in a signal of 23rd June. The final decision in its favour was communicated to me on 5th July. ANVIL* was eventually launched on 15th August.",

            "date": "23th June",
            "description": "So far I had been conducting operations on the assumption that the forces which had been withdrawn provisionally for ANVIL, or which were still to be withdrawn, might yet be returned to my command for the exploitation of the Italian campaign if the decision went against ANVIL. As the time lengthened during which that decision hung in the balance it became urgent to plam what could be done with the forces available on either hypothesis, I therefore called a conference of my Army Commanders on 23th June and explained what my plans would be if I were assured the same forces as at present. The object of operations in Italy must be to invade southern Germany by an overland advance through north-eastern Italy and the Ljubljana gap. By this means we should strike directly at territory which it was vital for the Germans to defend, even at the cost of diverting strength from other fronts, and have the possibility of joining hands with the southern wing of the Red Army and with Marshal Tito's partisan forces. The alternative,. an advance into Southern France across the Maritime Alps, would be less profitable and more difficult. I appreciated that the enemy intended to hold the Northern Apennines until driven from that position in overwhelming force but, with the troops then available to him, he would be unable to do so and would be risking certain disaster, provided we could bring our whole strength against him. Coming down to tactical details, I considered that the  * Gothic   line should be attacked in the centre both for topographical reasons, which I shall discuss later, and because that would-lead most directly to the important objectives in Northern Italy. The conference agreed to the plan as outlined but took note that if ANVIL were launched it would not be practical. In particular the administrative organisation of the Allied Armies in Italy would be   hamstrung  , in General Robertson's expression. General Clark also made the point about the bad effect of the present state of indecision on the morale and efficiency of the troops now engaged.",
