            "description": "Meanwhile the enemy\u2019s assaults on Bir Hacheim were renewed. Beginning on the 6th June, the attacks continued and grew in intensity. The Free French resisted valiantly, but on \u00a2the evening of the 8th June, General \u201cKoenig was obliged to report that the situation had become serious. It seemed likely that the stronghold would fall unless the garrison was given support from outside. becoming critical, General Ritchi\u00e9 was anxious \u2018to retain possession of it since, if it were lost, we should have to form a new and extended front facing southwards behind which we might be hemmed in and deprived of our power of manoeuvre. The threat to our rear would be increased, and, while it would be more necessary than ever to attack the enemy\u2019s supply lines, to do so from the south would become corre- spondingly more difficult. I agreed that we must hold the enemy frontally and do everf- thing in our power to deprive him of supplies. Orders were therefore issued for an armoured regimental group from the 4th Armoured Brigade with two columns each from the 7th Motor Brigade and the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade to attack the goth Light Division in the rear next day, At the same time a convoy was to be passed in, and arrangements were made for aircraft to drop supplies. It was in- tended that the armoured regimental group should eventually (join the forces operating round Mteifel. ;"

Next morning the garrison was subjected to intense dive-bombing and shelling. Attacks from the north continued all day, but in the evening the Free French drove the enemy back once more. On the roth June General Ritchie decided to order the Free French to evacuate Bir Hacheim, Enemy pressure continued from the south and the attacks of the armoured regi- mental group had not succeeded in relieving it. It was clear, too, that the resistance of the garrison was being worn down.

Moreover, operations were to be developed against Le Haye du Puits and Coutances at the earliest possible moment without waiting for the fall of Cher- bourg. As additional American troops were available, First United States Army was to break away to the South directed on Gran- ville, Avranches'and Vire. Second Army was to capture Caen and provide a strong Eastern flank for the Army Group: continuing the policy of absorbing the enemy reserve divisions in its sector."

The destroyers then pro- ceeded approximately 70 miles to rendezvous where they loaded direct to liners, three of which were filled at a time. These in turn moved to anchorages in the Fjords awaiting orders for the forming of the main convoy, which was done during the night 7th/8th June. At each embarkation place, alternative points for embarkation were selected in case of bomb- ing, whilst a reserve of \u201c\u2018 puffer \u2019\u2019 craft was held at each locality to meet all probable eventualities. These craft were formed inte small fleets with an Army officer in charge, and two British O.Rs. on board each ship."
