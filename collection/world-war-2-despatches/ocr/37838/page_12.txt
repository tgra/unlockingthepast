Disruption of Enemy Radar Cover and W/T
: Facilities:

103. The enemy Radar cover on the Western
Front was complete from Norway to the
Spanish border. This cover was obtained by a
chain of coastal stations, each composed of a
number of installations. The density of these
stations was such that there was a major site,
containing an average of three pieces of equip-
ment, every ten miles between Ostend and
Cherbourg. This coastal chain was backed by a
somewhat less dense inland system and by
numerous mobile installations. The attached
map* shows the location of the principal enemy
Radar sites and the coverage of this Radar
Chain.

104. The scale and variety of equipment in
this Radar organisation was such that com-
pletely to destroy the system by air attack
alone would have been a formidable proposi-
tion, This, however, was not necessary—the
destruction of certain vital Radars and the
comprehensive jamming of others could so
gravely interfere with the operation of the
system as almost to make it useless. I there-
fore decided to attack Radar stations between
Ostend and the Channel Islands in accordance
with the following principles: —

(a) Radar installations which could not be
jammed electronically, or were difficult to
jam, should be destroyed:

(6) Radar installations capable of giving
good readings on ships and of controlling
coastal guns should be destroyed:

(c) Radar installations likely to assist the
enemy in inflicting casualties to airborne
forces should be destroyed:

(d) Two targets outside the assault area
were to be attacked for every one attacked in
the area.

The attacks had a dual purpose. They aided
both current air operations and naval opera-
tions in the Channel, and they prepared for the
assault by blinding the enemy.

105. On roth May, 1944, a series of attacks
was begun against the long range aircraft
reporting stations, and on 18th May, on the
installations used for night fighter control and
the control of coastal guns, On 25th May, 42
sites were scheduled for attack. These sites
included 106 installations; at D-3, fourteen of
these sites were confirmed destroyed.

106. To conserve effort, I then decided, three
days before D-Day, to restrict attacks to the
twelve most important sites; six were chosen
by the naval authorities and six by the air
authorities, These twelve sites, containing
thirty-nine installations, were all attacked in
the three days prior to D-Day.

107. Up to D-Day, 1,668 sorties were flown
by aircraft of A.E.A.F. in attacks on Radar
installations. Typhoons in low level attacks
flew 694 sorties and fired 4,517 x 60-lb. R.Ps.
Typhoons and Spitfires made 759 dive-
bombing sorties, dropping 1,258 x 500-lb.
bombs and light and medium bombers dropped
217 tons of bombs. In addition, the sites and
equipment were attacked with many thousands
of rounds of cannon and machine-gun fire.

108. These Radar targets were very heavily
defended by flak and low level attacks upon
them demanded great skill and daring. Pilots

of the R.A.F. Second Tactical Air Force were
mainly employed and losses among senior and
more experienced pilots were heavy. There
is no doubt, however, that these attacks saved
the lives of countless soldiers, sailors and air-
men on D-Day. The following details of some
of the. successful attacks made during the last
three days before the assault, show the out-
standing results obtained by Typhoon and Spit-
fire pilots in low level attacks pressed home to
very close range.

(a) Cap de la Hague] Jobourg, This site
was attacked by rocket firing Typhoons of 174,
175 and 245 Squadrons, Second Tactical
Air Force, on 5th June, and 200 x 60-lb.
R.Ps. were fired. The ‘‘ Hoarding ’’, an
installation used for long range aircraft re-
porting, was destroyed. Three of the attack-
ing aircraft were destroyed by flak.

(b) Dieppe/Caudecote. This site was at-
tacked by 18 R.P. Typhoons of 198 and
609 Squadrons, Second Tactical Air Force,
on and June. 104 x60-lb. R.Ps. were fired,
with the result that the ‘‘ Hoarding ’’ was

destroyed and the ‘“‘Freya’’ and
‘Wuerzburg’ installations, used _for
medium range aircraft reporting, night

fighter control and control of coastal guns,
were damaged. One of the Typhoons was
destroyed by flak.

(c) Cap q’Antifer. This station was at-
tacked several times. On 4th June, 23
Spitfires of 441, 442 and 443 Squadrons,
Second Tactical Air Force, dive-bombed

+ with 23 x 500-lb. M.C. instantaneous bombs;
direct hits were scored. The
‘* Chimney ’’ and one ‘‘ Giant Wuerzburg ””
were destroyed, and other installations

damaged.

10g. In addition to the attacks on the enemy
Radar stations, attacks were also made on the
most important of his navigational beam
stations and on certain special W/T stations.

110. Navigational Stations. There were two
enemy radio navigational stations important to
the assault area, one’at Sortosville, south of
Cherbourg, and the other at Lanmeur, near
Morlaix. Both of these stations were attacked,
the first target being destroyed and the second
rendered unserviceable, at least temporarily.

x11. W/T Stations. Four W/T stations of
the highest importance were subjected to attack
by R.A.F. Bomber Command. These attacks
were triumphs of precision bombing and com-
pletely achieved their object. Details of these
attacks are given below.

(a) Boulogne/Mt. Couple. This large
installation contained about 60 transmitters.
The first attack was unsuccessful, but two
nights later, 31st May/xst June, in an attack
by 105 heavy bombers dropping 530 tons of
bombs, at least 70 heavy bombs were placed
on the target, which is some 300 yards long
and 150 yards wide. Only a negligible frac-
tion of the transmitters on this site survived
the attacks, a maximum of three being sub-
sequently identified in operation.

(b) Beaumont Hague] Au Feure. This in-
stallation was attacked on the night of 31st
May/i1st June by raz aircraft; 498 tons of
bombs were dropped and good results were
obtained, The main concentration of bombs
