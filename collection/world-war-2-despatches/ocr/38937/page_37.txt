SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

the assault. This began on 7th February and
the intention was to capture the whole area in
a night attack. In actual fact the stubborn
resistance of 1 Division and counter-attacks
by 45 United States Division meant that five
days of heavy fighting were necessary before
the objective was secured on the x2th. VI
Corps was now back on its “‘ intermediate ”’ line
astride the Anzio-Albano road and it was clear
that this road would be the axis of the enemy’s
main attack. To meet it VI Corps relieved
1 Division and handed over the sector to 56
and 45 United States Divisions. On. 17th
February General Truscott, Commander of 3
United States Division* was appointed Deputy
Commander of the Corps. He directed, with
great success, the defence against the great
Gemman counter-offensive and on the 23rd
succeeded General Lucas as Corps Commander.
It was a new réle, for General Truscott had
made his reputation, and continued to increase
it, as a dashing commander of hard-hitting
offensives; indeed the defence was a new réle
altogether for our armies in Italy. The troops
showed, however, that they were fully equal to
the demands made on them, encouraged by the
massive support of our concentrated artillery
fire, which was augmented by the big guns of
the Allied Navies and the bombs and machine-
gun fire of the Air Forces,

By the time the German attack began two
t divisions had been brought in to re-
inforce Fourteenth Army: 114 Jaeger from
Jugoslavia and 362 Infantry from North Italy,
and the three independent regiments and two
heavy tank battalions already mentioned had
also arrived. This gave the Germans the
equivalent of about ten divisions against an
Allied strength of rather less than five. German
morale was particularly high; a special order
from Hitler was read out to all troops before
the attack in which he demanded that this
“‘ abscess ’’ must and would be eliminated in
three days. They were told that they would
get massive air support from the Luftwaffe,
combined with numbers of heavy tanks, em-
ployed for the first time in Italy, and would
have the privilege of operating for the first
time on any front the new secret weapon, the
‘* Goliath ’” remote-controlled explosive tank.
The plan was to attack on a very narrow front
of some four thousand yards straight down the
Albano-Anzio road on to Anzio itself, only
eight miles away. The loss of Anzio would
mean that the bridgehead would be split in
half and deprived of its port; this would have
made further defence hopeless and even evacua-
tion would have been almost impossible for
the beaches were already known to be entirely
inadequate. The assault was to be made by
four divisions, reinforced by eleven battalions,
led by the crack Lehr Regiment, the Infantry
Demonstration Regiment from Doberitz, pride.
of the German Army. Four hundred and fifty-
two guns supported the attack. Two mobile
divisions, 26 Panzer and 29 Panzer Grenadier,
reinforced by two battalions, one of Tiger and
one of Panther tanks, were echeloned behind
them to exploit the success of which no one
doubted.

The attack began at 0630 hours on 36th
February after half an hour’s artillery prepara-
tion, with massed infantry covered with smoke

and supported by tanks. By the end of the
day a salient of some two thousand yards had
been driven down the road in the sector of
45 Division. The airstrip at Nettuno had
been rendered unserviceable by long-range
artillery fire, which also destroyed four aircraft
as they were about to take off; fighter cover,
as a result, now had to be flown wholly from
the Naples area. Before midnight the attack
was resumed. Fighting on the 17th was even
heavier; the enemy made fewer diversionary
attacks and concentrated on his drive down the
Anzio road. By now there was a wedge two
and a half miles wide and over a mile deep in
the centre of 45 Division’s front. Against this
wedge the whole of VI Corps’ artillery was
directed, supported by all the air resources
available, some seven hundred bomber sorties.
The enemy was now getting very near the
‘Final Beach-head Line’’ and General
Truscott moved two brigades of x Division into
that line in rear of 45 Division.

The 18th was the most critical day. After
infiltration during the night into the shoulders.
of the salient the enemy moved forward under
a lowering and overcast sky which prevented
a repetition of the previous day’s tremendous
programme of air support. Once more waves
of infantry attacked in the morning and in the
afternoon Mackensen threw in his Corps de
Chasse, not now to exploit a breakthrough in
the Allied lines but to make one. For four
hours the battle raged east of the road on the
final beach-head line. The honours of the
day go mainly to the United States 179 In-
fantry Regiment and 1 Battalion of
the Loyals, Corps artillery
which did deadly execution in the attacking
masses. The enemy was held, and that night it
was clear that he was pulling back to re-
organise. The time had come for the planned
counter-attack. On the I9th an armoured
force from 1 United States Armoured Division
together with elements of 3 United States In-
fantry Division attacked the eastern flank of the
Genman salient and gained some fifteen hundred
yards causing disorganisation and panic. In
the afternoon 2 Brigade of x Division cleared
up some enemy penetrations and re-established
the final line. A last, badly mism: enemy.
attack on 1 Loyals on the morning of the 2oth,
repulsed with heavy losses, was the end of the
German offensive. It was clear that they would
attack again, for Hitler was insistent, but their
losses would render essential a pause to
reorganise.*

Fresh Plans of Campaign.

The failure of the main offensive attempts
by both sides, by the Allies in the second battle
of Cassino and by the Germans at Anzio, left
us with the same problem as before and the
necessity of thinking out some new solution for
it. I felt confident now that the bridgehead
could be held, for, unless they could find fresh.
formations, a renewed German attack would
have to be made in much reduced strength.
I could concentrate, therefore, on Cassino and
try to find some new method of taking this
fortress which had twice defied our best efforts.
I still had one division uncommitted, the 78th,
but the weather was very bad and the Liri
valley a sea of mud; it was no good putting my
last fresh troops into a repetition of our former
