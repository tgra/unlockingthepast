The move of formations from Eighth Army,
the redisposition of 9 Corps and the dumping
of ammunition and other stores would take
some time, and D-day for the attack, which
was given the codename VULCAN, was fixed

as 6th May. As a preliminary 5 Corps was to -

capture Gebel Bou Aoukaz on the afternoon of
5th May in order to free the left flank of the
attack from threat from this direction. On the
morning of the 6th the 9 Corps attack would
start before dawn on a front of three thousand
yards with 4 British Division right and 4 Indian
Division left, supported by artillery concentra-
tions from over four hundred guns, centrally
controlled. The infantry were to begin by
seizing a line north of the road through the
small village of Frendj, about six thousand
yards from the start line. 6 Armoured Division
was to follow 4 British, and 7 Armoured
4 Indian. Their first bound was to the area of
St. Cyprien, twelve miles further on and the
same distance from Tunis, before the enemy
could recover from the shock and occupy the
perimeter defences. 5 Corps, which had 46
Division north of the river and x and 78
Divisions to the south, was to hold the corridor
open and be prepared to support 9 Corps.
XIX Corps was to launch an attack against
Gebel Zaghouan on 4th May; on the same day
the New Zealanders on Eighth Army’s left
would mount local attacks south of Saouaf to
assist’ the French and pin down the enemy on
their front. II Corps was to continueVits
successful advance towards Bizerta. a

I summed up these orders in a personal
letter to General Anderson on 3rd May which
I reproduce here as giving the clearest picture
of my conception of the final plan.

“q, The primary object of your attack is

‘to capture Tunis. Every effort must be made
to pass the two armoured divisions through
on the same day- as the infantry attack starts
so that the enemy is not allowed time to build
up a strong anti-tank screen.

2.9 Corps must seize a bridgehead
through the immediate defences of Tunis as
early as possible, before the enemy has time
to man these defences.

3. The mopping up of localities which the
enemy continues to hold on the fronts of
78 and 1 Divisions must come later.: The
chief task of 5 Corps after the armour has
passed through is to keep open the funnel.

4. Concentration must be maintained and
it would not be sound to aim at advancing
on too wide a front. For instance, 46
Division may well be required toi nourish
the threat and to assist 5 Corps to keep the
funnel open. An advance north of the river
Medjerda would not contribute to the main
object. Troops north of the river will be
forced to withdraw when you reach Tunis
and cut their communications.

5. I consider the best way to prevent the
enemy withdrawing a large part of his forces
to the Cape Bon peninsula is to reach Tunis
as early as possible, thus cutting off all troops
north of Tunis. In any case I do not wish
your operations for the early capture of Tunis
fo be prejudiced by preoccupation with pre-
venting the enemy withdrawing to Cape
Bon ’’.

_ Duritig the period before the offensive opened

intentions continued and showed evidence of
producing good results. The enemy did not
reinforce the area which I had selected for my
point of main effort but left its defence to
I5 Panzer Division, now in a very weak state.
By contrast he retained both ro and 21 Panzer
Divisions in the Kourzia area, opposite my
i Armoured Division. Shortly before the attack
began a battalion from go Light Division was
brought round from Eighth Army front to St.
Cypren but on 4th May, on the other hand,
the enemy removed two battalions of heavy
anti-tank guns from the Massicault area to the
area north-east of the Kourzia marshes. It was
gratifying to realise that we had been so suc-
cessful in obtaining surprise and that the enemy
had split his armour, leaving the stronger part
ms it away to the south of our point of main
effort

The attack on Gebel Bou Aoukaz by 1 Divi-
sion went in on 5th May at 1700 hours with
strong and effective air support. As I have
already explained the capture of this mountain
was essential to the whole conduct of opera-
tions in order to clear the left flank of the
attack. The fighting on the mountain was
severe and the enemy counter-attacked many
times; major credit for the success must go
to x Irish Guards who finally cleared the
crest, at the cost of many casualties, within
the time table laid down for the operation.
Gebel Bou Aoukaz was in our hands by night-
fall and all that night the infantry of 4 British
and 4 Indian Divisions were moving forward
to their assembly areas. On 6th May, at 0330
hours, they advanced to the attack side by
side on a very narrow front. The massed
artillery of First Army, backed by the dumps
of ammunition which we had been nourishing
so long for this event, fired concentrations on
known enemy localities. At dawn the air forces
went in. It was their greatest effort in the
war up to that date, over two thousand sorties
of all types. The weight of the attack was
too much for the defenders, already weakened
physically and morally by the heavy fighting
since 22nd April. Most of them did their duty
but there were isolated instances of demorali-
sation. By 1030 hours the first infantry objec-
tives were captured and by 1130 hours the
village of Frend) was reported clear. The two
armoured divisions, which were close on the
heels of the attacking infantry, at once passed
into the lead. So deep had been our initial
penetration that they found enemy resistance,
though gallant and desperate, to be but little
organised, they met some groups of enemy
tanks, from 15 Panzer Division, and many
of the 88 millimetre guns withdrawn from air-
field defence, but the impetus of the offensive
was so strong that it carried them by nightfall
as far as Massicault, half-way to Tunis. 6
Armoured Division leaguered for the night to
the south-east and 7 Armoured Division to the
north-east of the village. The enemy were en-
deavouring to form a new defensive position at
St. Cyprien. °

The first day’s fighting in the Medjerda valley
had thus ended in a great success. Meanwhile
II Corps to the north was about to reap the
reward of its steady and well conducted ad-
vance. Under this constant and increasing
pressure the German, front, in thg. mountains
broke on the night of 2nd May and next day
reconnaissance elements of 1 Armoured Divi-
