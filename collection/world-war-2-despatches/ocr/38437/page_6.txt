the strength of these from 216 to 36. We also
Proposed to do without searchlights in this
area, other than those provided by the normal
layout. Under the revised plan, all the Bristol
guns, both heavy and light, would have to be
withdrawn by ‘“D’’ Day; but we hoped that
by that date the threat to that city, never very
serious, would have been neutralized by
bombing,

39. As for the Solent, fortunately that area
would, in any case, be heavily defended against
orthodox air attack during the final stages of
preparation for ‘‘ Overlord’. In these circum.
‘ stances no special ‘‘ Diver ’’ deployment would
be needed there, apart from a few searchlights.
We visualized, however, a possible re-
disposition of the ‘‘ Overlord ’’ guns to fit them
for a dual role. Here, again, there would be a
substantial saving.

40. Under the original plan, balloons would
provide a third line of defence for London. For
this purpose I had originally proposed to put
a permanent* barrage of 480 balloons immedi-
ately behind the guns on the high ground
between Cobham (Kent) in the east and Limps-
field in the west. It so happened that I was
already seeking authority from the Chiefs of
Staff to reduce the balloon defences of the
country by 500 balloons: by appropriating this
saving to defence against pilotless aircraft the
problem of providing the ‘‘ Diver’’ barrage
could be solved. As these balloons were not
needed for ‘‘ Overlord ’’ there was no need
to alter these proposals in the revised plan.

41. It was, then, with the revised plan
ready for action that we awaited the beginning
of the German attacks. To say that this plan
represented a compromise between the require-
ments of ‘‘ Overlord ’”’ and those of ‘‘ Diver ”
would not be strictly true; for the defence of the
base against ‘‘ Diver’ was itself an essential
“" Overlord ’’ requirement. But it provided at
once the largest appropriation that could be
spared for the job, and the smallest that was
likely to be effective against the threat which
was then foreseen. The number of guns to be
deployed, in particular, was no more than a
bare minimum. In the circumstances it was
impossible for us to budget for more guns; but
we took care to frame.the plan in such a way
that the numbers could easily be increased if
further guns should happen to become avail-
able. TI also took the precaution of pointing
out that if the pilotless aircraft should fly
between 2,000 and 3,000 feet instead of at the
greater altitude expected by the Air Ministry,
the guns would have a very awkward task, for
between those heights the targets would be too
high for the light anti-aircraft guns and too low
for the mobile heavy guns which at that time
could not be traversed smoothly enough to
engage such speedy missiles.

42. In the event, the threat which materialised
in the summer was to prove a very different one
from that foreseen in February when the plan
was made. This was not only because the
height at which the pilotless aircraft flew had
been over-estimated, but also because the fore-
casts of the enemy’s capabilities with which the
Air Ministry provided us were based on

knowledge which was incomplete in one im-
portant respect. Consequently, when the attack
developed we soon found that we needed not
only more than the 288 heavy and 282 light
A.A. guns postulated in the revised plan, but
more than the 528 and 804 respectively for
which we had budgetted in our original, super-
seded plan.*

(b) The Eve of the Attacks

43. Ironically enough, the emergence of this
undiscovered factor which upset our calcula-
tions was due to the very success with which
we had bombed and neutralized the ‘‘ ski
sites’. By the end of April most of the sites
had been rendered unfit for use. Although the
Germans repaired some of them, from that time
onwards there were never at any time more
than ten ‘‘ ski sites ’’ in a state to fire.

44. Fortunately for them, the Germans soon
realised how vulnerable the ‘‘ ski sites ’’ were,
and began to build other launching sites which
were more carefully hidden and harder to
destroy. By simplifying the plan of construc-
tion and using pre-fabricated parts, they were
able to complete these new sites very quickly.

45. Since the armistice the Germans have
told us that they began this new programme of
construction in March 1944. However, it, was
not until the 27th April that the first of the
‘* modified sites ’’, as we called them, was seen
on a reconnaissance photograph. By the middle
of May twenty such sites had been located, and
by the rath June the number had risen to 66.
Forty-two were aligned on London and the rest
on Bristol or south-coast ports.

46. The ‘‘ modified sites ’’ made difficult
bombing targets. _ When Typhoon bombers
carried out an experimental attack on one of
them on the 27th May the site proved hard to
find and the results were poor. Besides being
small and well concealed, the sites comprised
few buildings at which bombs could be aimed.
Unlike the ‘‘ski sites’’, they seemed to be
intended as launching points and nothing more.
The conclusion was that any stocks of pilotless
aircraft held locally would not be kept on the
sites themselves, but stored elsewhere or dis-
persed in the wooded country amongst which all
the sites were placed.

47. At least partly for these reasons, we made
no further attacks on the ‘‘ modified sites ’’
until after the Germans had begun to launch
missiles from them. Meanwhile, the officers at
the Air Ministry and elsewhere who were
responsible for offensive counter-measures .were
debating whether to attack certain other con-
structions, usually referred to as ‘‘ supply
sites ’’. They believed that these constructions
had something to do with the storage or main-
tenance of pilotless aircraft; but they were not
sure. Nevertheless, two attacks on one of the
sites were made about the end of May. From
that time onwards, little was done to hinder
the enemy’s final preparations for the offensive.

48. This state of affairs was a natural con-

sequence of the awkwardness of the ‘“‘ modified
sites ’’ as bombing targets, and our uncertain

guns, over 700 rocket barrels, and some 600 light
guns (mostly 20 mm.) manned by the R.A.F. Regiment
and the Royal Armoured Corps.
