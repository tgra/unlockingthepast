active reconnaissance and in his painstaking
training and preparation before the operation,
is worthy of special note. Credit is also due
to the Captain (S), Eighth Submarine Flotilla
and the Commanding Officers of His Majesty’s
Submarines P.45, P.48, P.221, P.54 and
URSULA for their efficient co-operation.

7. The arrival of the assault forces at their
initial positions off their beaches proceeded
without a hitch. Contacts were made with
beacon submarines as planned. In fact the
operation up to this point proceeded with a
flawless accuracy which reflects high credit on
Task Force Commanders,* Commanding
Officers of His Majesty’s Ships and Masters of
Merchant Vessels alike.

8. Assaults at Oran beaches passed off with-
out a hitch; but at Algiers B and C Beaches
things went awry and delay and confusion re-
sulted, which might well have endangered
success had the opposition been determined or
alert. These points are well brought out in
the report of the Naval Commander Eastern
Task Force (Vice-Admiral Sir Harold M.
Burrough, K.B.E., C.B., D.S.O.) and that of
Lieutenant-Commander H. M. C. Willmott,
D.S.O., Royal Navy.t I would only wish to
state my entire concurrence with the remarks
of the former and re-emphasise that these diffi-
culties are not “lessons learnt ”, but recognised
and foreseen disadvantages which had re-
luctantly to be accepted owing to the speed with
which the operation was staged and the con-
sequent short time available for training,
coupled with the difficulty of co-ordination of
uae scattered initially from Scapa to Sierra

eone.

9. The actual landings when the troops
reached their beaches appear to have gone
according to plan and the work of the beach
parties was excellent, but unnecessarily large
numbers of landing craft were crippled as the
disembarkations proceeded. These losses were
mostly avoidable and due to lack of training
and bad seamanship. In this connection it is
recommended that the use of new entries, not
properly disciplined, in this type of operation
be avoided.

Various suggestions have arisen, chiefly from
United States Army reports, that landing craft
should be manned and operated by the Army
on the score of improved co-ordination and
training. In fact, it is felt that it matters little
what uniform the crews wear provided that
they are disciplined, trained and practised
seamen and provided that they are organised
and operated by officers competent in their
jobs and in close touch with the requirements
of the troops they are required to land and
maintain. As, however, the ships taking part
in an assault are tied to a great degree to their
landing craft during the period of unloading,
it remains essential that the control of the latter
should rest in the. hands of those responsible
for the safety of the ships.

10. The direct assaults planned against the
harbour of Algiers and Oran (Operations
“Terminal” and “ Reservist”) were in no
sense planned as imitations of Zeebrugge but

were intended te be launched just before the
surrender or capture of the ports with the
purpose of preventing sabotage of ships and
port installations. The choice of the correct
moment for entry was a difficult one, depend-
ing on the existing situation and the large
degree of resistance encountered.

In the event, neither operation was successful
in its object but both were remarkable for the
determination ard gallantry with which all
concerned tackled their task, and both were
guocenstil in forcing an entry through the

Ooms.

Operation “‘Termind”. - :

11.. His Majesty’s Ship BROKE (Lieutenant-
Commander A. F. C. Layard, Royal Navy) suc-
ceeded in getting alongside in Algiers and dis-
embarked her troops, but they were pinned
by machine-gun fire and did no good. It is
considered that the Commanding Officer’s de-
cision to retire from a position rapidly be-
coming untenable was a correct‘one. It is
auch to: be regretted that an underestimate of
damage sustained should have led to the sub-
sequent foundering of this ship when she might
by then have been safely berthed in Algiers
harbour.

Operation “ Reservist”.

12. The choice of the ships for this operation
had rested on their American appearance, and
their chance of a friendly reception lay largely
in this appearance and the use of the American |
Ensign. In the face of serious opposition it ~
could not be expected that they would succeed
in their task. In the event, the moment chosen
could hardly have been less fortunate, since
the French alarm to arms was in its first full
flush, whilst darkness prevented any American
complexion to the operation being apparent.

The expedition was a failure, redeemed by
the gallantry displayed by officers and men of
both nations as they strove to achieve their
object in the face of hopeless odds. It is much
to be regretted that Captain F. T. Peters, V.C.,
D.S.O., D.S.C., Royal Navy, the leader, having
survived this ordeal, lost his life in an aircraft
accident on his way to the United Kingdom.

Support Fire.

13. The experience of units detailed to pro-
vide supporting fire for soldiers ashore served
only to re-emphasise the well known fact that
ship gunfire cannot be expected to knock out
forts by obtaining direct hits on gun positions.
Ships’ gunfire is capable of very considerable
moral effect when using heavy calibre guns,
and of smothering effect from the rapid volume
of medium calibre fire of any calibre gun at
close range, but that is the most that should
be expected. Cases reported of delays in re-
sponding to calls for fire are attributable to
two main causes, namely, inability of military
authority to appreciate that a ship cannot
remain waiting indefinitely in her bombarding
position in submarine infested waters, and
failure to make proper use of the support wave
for rapid communication.

Air Support.
Fighters.

14, Taken as a whole the provision of fighter
support over the shipping and beaches left
little to be desired. It suffered from all the
known limitations of carrier-operated aircraft,
