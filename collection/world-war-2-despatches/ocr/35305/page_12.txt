5910 SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1941

and troop carrying companies were allotted to
Corps in such a way as to complete the move
in go hours.

At the same time 44th Division was to march
to an area north-west of Audenarde, with a
view to organising the defence of the Escaut in
this area.

Movement in the first phase was to be con-
tinuous by day and night. The French had
decided to restrict the movements of their main
bodies to the hours of darkness, but I judged
the time factor to be of paramount importance
and accepted the risk that our air support might
be insufficient to prevent enemy interference
with the move. Events proved that the risk
was justifiable.

In the second period, to be completed by the
end of the sixth day, 48th Division (Major-
General A. F. A. N. Thorne) and 4th Division
(Major-General D. G. Johnson, V.C.) were to
move by march route and motor transport into
1st and 2nd Corps reserve respectively, while
ist Army Tank Brigade consisting of two
battalions was to move chiefly by rail into
Ist Corps area.

The third period was to be completed by the
tenth day, and included the movement of 50th
Division to 2nd Corps reserve, while 4th Division
moved into the line on the right of 3rd Division.

The fourth period included the forward
movement of 3rd Corps. 5th Division (Major-
General H. E. Franklyn) was to move to
positions in G.H.Q. reserve, al the river
Dendre, north and south of Grammont ; 42nd
and 44th Divisions to the line of the river
Escaut around Tournai and to the south of
Audenarde respectively, to organise bridgehead
positions pending orders for a further advance.

Detailed instructions had also been issued
for the preparation of defences on the three
river lines of the Dyle, Dendre and Escaut, as
also for the necessary demolitions arid inunda-
tions. Special arrangements had been made
for the control of traffic, including refugees for
whom routes had been allotted; definite bodies
of troops were detailed for these tasks.

The Belgian Anti-Tank obstacle

17. Late in April and early in May, I received
reports regarding the siting of the Belgian
anti-tank obstacle; it appeared that, without
informing either the French High Command or
myself, they had sited the obstacle much
further to the east than had originally been
planned, namely on the line Namur—Perwez~
Louvain: furthermore the obstacle was not
as yet by any means completed. The matter
was discussed with General Georges.

On the British front, the river Dyle was so
far superior as an anti-tank obstacle to any
artificial work further east which the Belgians
might be preparing that I had no hesitation in
urging adherence to the existing plan for the
defence of the Dyle position.

On the front of the French rst Army the
situation was different : the absence of a natural
obstacle forced them to rely on that prepared
by the Belgians. To clear the matter up,
information was demanded as to the true site
of the artificial obstacle. These negotiations
were begun through our Military Attaché on
8th May, but they were not destined to be
concluded.

OPERATIONS—FIRST PHASE
(roth-16th MAY)

Belgium calis on Allies for assistance: advance
to the River Dyle by British and French
Armies: the Belgian anti-tank obstacle is
Sound to be sited further forward than had
been expected. The enemy penetrates the front
of French oth Army and crosses the Meuse.
Action by Royal Atr Force. General Billotte
appointed to co-ordinate action of British,
French and Belgians. The Dutch lay down
their arms.

roth May—The enemy invades Holland and
Belgium.

18. The tension which had been increasing
during April had lessened somewhat during the
early days of May; during this period I had
received reports of enemy activity from several
sources of varying degrees of reliability, culmin-
ating in a report from the Hague, but it was not
until the night of 9th-roth May that information
was received of exceptional activity on the
frontiers of Luxembourg, Belgium and Holland.
The weather was set fair, and with the exception
of some heavy thunderstorms which had no
effect on operations, remained so to the end of
the month. At about 4.30 a.m. on roth May,
enemy aircraft appeared over my headquarters
at Arras and bombs were dropped on aero-
dromes in the neighbourhood and on a number
of towns including Doullens and Abbeville.
At 5.30 a.m., a message was received from my
mission with General Georges ordering ‘' Alertes
I, 2 and 3,” namely, instant readiness to move
into Belgium. I at once sought, and obtained,
the release of the 5th Division from War Office
reserve, and henceforward it was employed
under my orders. At about 6.15 a.m. I received ~
instructions to put Plan D into effect.

It was ascertained that 12th Royal Lancers
could be ready to cross the frontier at 1 p.m.,
ae accordingly I laid down this time as zero

our.

At I p.m. I opened my command post at
Wahagnies, midway between Douai and Lille.

Ist and 2nd Corps experienced some delay
in moving, due largely to the fact that owing
to the short notice received, preliminary moves
of transport had not taken place ; apart from
this, moves on this day proceeded according to
plan ; very little interference was experienced
either from enemy aircratt or refugees and
rzth Lancers reached the Dyle unopposed at
10.30 p.m.

The French armies on our right and left were
reported as advancing on time.

The Belgian population received the allied
armies in the most cordial manner, and in
particular the leading troops were loudly cheered.

Operations between 11th and 15th May.

1g. On 11th May, enemy air action increased
somewhat, but did not interfere with the forward
movement of troops, and during the afternoon
and evening, the leading infantry brigades
reached the Dyle, refugee traffic being
handled successfully. The original arrange-
ments, of which the Belgian Government were

_ aware, included the use by the B.E.F. of roads

passing through the northern and southern
outskirts of Brussels, but not through the
centre of the city. A series of requests was
however received to discontinue the use of these
roads on the ground that Brussels had been
