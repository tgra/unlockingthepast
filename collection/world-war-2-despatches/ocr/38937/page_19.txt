efforts of the defence. By the evening of that
day I felt that the crisis was past and the
situation beginning to turn in our favour.
7 Armoured Division had begun to disembark
in 10 Corps’ area on that day and a Regimental
Combat Team of 45 Division also landed and
came into Army reserve.* These moves were
part of the original programme and the emer-
gency moves on which we had decided were
also beginning to show their effect. Before I
left on the 15th I signalled to General Eisen-
hower to the effect that although I was not
actually happy about the situation I was
happier than I had been twenty-four hours
earlier. The troops were tired but on the whole
in good heart. I informed him that I had
issued certain instructions, details of which I
would give on my return next day. I also said
that I had asked for 1,500 British Infantry
replacements from Philippeville to come as early
as possible. I asked him to inform Admiral
Cunningham and Air Marshal Tedder that our
air bombing and ships’ gunfire had been great
morale raisers to, the troops. :

The Germans in their counter-attacks had
been working under definite limitations of
time. They had, deliberately, as good as
broken contact with Eighth Army in order to
fling the troops coming up from Calabria
against Fifth Army, but they could not ignore
Eighth Army’s adyance beyond a certain
date. By the 15th they decided that they had
failed; on that day reconnaissance elements of
5 British Division were at Sapri, about fifty
miles south of the VI position, with
patrols forward, and by the roth the whole
division was concentrated in the area Lagonegro-
Sapri-Maratea with a brigade at each place.
On the same day patrols of 5 Reconnaissance
Regiment made contact with patrols from VI
Corps five miles west of Vallo and the
Canadians were in a position to threaten
Potenza. The enemy had already begun to
withdraw in front of VI Corps, and with that
confession of his inability to destroy our bridge-
head our hold on the mainland of Italy could
be considered firm.

Part II.
THE WINTER CAMPAIGN
Planning.

On 2zst September I issued instructions to
both Army Commanders giving the broad basis
of our plan for future tions. The situation
at that date was briefly as follows. Fifth Army
had just advanced VI Corps, on its right, north-
wards to follow up the German withdrawal
which was taking the form of a great wheeling
movement, pivoting on the Salerno i i
ro Corps was regrouping and reorganising after
the heavy fighting of the past week and was
preparing to launch a direct attack on the Naples

in through the gorges north of Salerno.

having made contact with Fifth Army on its
left and 5 Corps on its right; it was now neces-
sary to pause after the rapid advance to the
assistance of Fifth Army while the administra-

brought up and the new axis of supply estab-
lished through the Heel ports. 5 Corps Head-
quarters had landed at Taranto on r8th Septem-
ber and on the 22nd a special force under
command of Headquarters 78 Division, and
including elements of that division and of 4
Armoured Brigade, was due to land at Bari for
mobile operations against Foggia. 1 Airborne
Division had reached a line from forward of
Bari to near Matera, where they were in contact
with x Canadian Division; all the area south-
east of this line, including the ports of Bari,
Brindisi and Taranto, was clear of the enemy.
The Italian fleet and air force had surrendered
in accordance with the terms of the armistice
in so far as they were not prevented by the
action of the Germans but the Italian army had
been eliminated except for a few poorly equipped
formations in the south and the troops in Sar-
dinia and Corsica. Mussolini had been rescued
from his prison on the Gran Sasso but this,
though irritating, was not considered likely to
add to our difficulties in Italy, an appreciation
which proved wholly justified. The ‘‘ Quad
rant ’’ conference at Quebec had broken up and
I was informed of its main decisions regarding
the Mediterranean on 18th September. No
change was made in the allotment of forces
to the theatre; this involved the withdrawal to
the United Kingdom of. eight good divisions,
to be replaced in part by French divisions as
the latters’ equipment progressed, reduction of
the bomber strength by about a hundred and
seventy aircraft by December 1943 and a con-
siderable withdrawal of troop-carrying aircraft
and assault shipping and craft.

My plan of campaign had to be based on these
considerations. It had to be flexible and general
in terms and as I put it to my Army Command-
ers it was rather a general directive on the
method of conducting the coming operations
and an indication of the bounds of our advance.
Our object I defined as ‘‘ the seizing of
certain vital areas which contain groups of all-
weather airfields, ports and centres of road com-
munications. On these firm bases the Armies
can be regrouped, reorganised and balanced,
and from them strong offensive operations can be
developed to destroy the German forces in the
field. Light mobile forces and patrols will be
operating ahead of these bases against the enemy
continuously. This advance screen harasses the
hostile rearguards, obtains information of all
natures, and aids us to keep the initiative °’.

I indicated four phases into which our
advance could be divided. The first was the
consolidation of our present position on the line
Salerno-Bari; the second was to give us the port
of Naples and the airfield centre of Foggia.
The third aimed at securing Rome and the air-
fields round it and the important road and rait
centre of Terni. For the next phase I indicated
as eventual objectives the port of Leghorn and
the communications centres of Florence and
Arezzo; but this was well in the future, depen-
dent on the enemy reaction, the strength of
our own forces, ‘how our ports and communica-
tions were functioning and so on. Throughout
the advance I planned “‘ to take full advantage
of our control of the sea and skies to put ashore
small but hard-hitting mobile forces behind the
enemy so as to cut. him off ’’. In the event I
was only able, for reasons which will appear
later, to carry out two of these amphibious
operations, at Termoli and Anzio.
