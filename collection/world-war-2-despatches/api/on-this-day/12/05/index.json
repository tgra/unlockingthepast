Noball  was the code word used to designate the sites being prepared by the enemy for attacks on the United Kingdom with flying bombs and rockets. The operations against these sites carried out under the title of   Crossbow *  had begun as early as 5th December, 1943, and constituted a considerable diversion of bomber effort. This bombing, while it did not, of itself, succeed in completely eliminating the menace of the flying bomb, was fully justified, in view of the fact that the original scheme had to be abandoned by the Germans. Details of the effort involved and an indication of the results achieved are given in Part III of this Despatch.",

Accordingly, on the 5th December the Second Tactical Air Force and the American Ninth Bomber Command began a series of bombing attacks on the   ski sites , The Strategic Air Forces, in the shape of our own Bomber Command and the American Eighth Bomber Command, also contributed their quota. By the end of the year, 3,216 tons of bombs had been dropped on the sites about the weight that fell on London in an average fortnight during the night   Blitz \"  of 1940-41. So far as the Air Ministry could judge, the effect of these attacks was to   neutralize  twelve sites and seriously damage another nine. But since 88   ski sites   had been located by this time, and the existence of another 50 was suspected, the neutralization of all the sites with the bombing resources that could be spared from other tasks seemed likely to prove a longdrawn business.",

An offensive with this object in view was to be launched on 21st November, as already provided for, and it was estimated that it would hardly have reached its objective before the first week in December.* This determined the timing for Fifth Army. By 5th December it would have completed its programme for the relief, rest and training of the four American infantry divisions in II Corps; 13 Corps had only been able to rotate their forces so that only a limited offensive effort  could be called for from them. American artillery ammunition was sufficient for not more than about fifteen days  full-scale offensive operations. In view of that fact and the other considerations which made it inevitable that this should be the last major offensive before the spring of 1945 it was essential that every chance should be calculated to ensure its success and I directed that the actual timing of the offensive, which would be some date after 7th December, must be dependent on the weather and, if necessary, it must be postponed until the weather was propitious. :",
