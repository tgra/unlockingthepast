flown by these aircraft. At this time too, the
presence in Singapore of Dakotas belonging
to 31 Squadron, which operated over Sumatra,
assisted materially in bringing out of Sumatra
some of the first prisoners-of-war.

target areas of South East Asia for the first
three weeks during which Operation “ Mastiff ”

Working of RAPWI and the S.D. Squadrons.

_ 442. The evacuation of prisoners-of-war and
internees required the maximum co-operation
between Naval, Land and Air Forces,

443. An Inter-Services Initer-Allied Com-
mittee was therefore established at the Head-
quarters of the Supreme Allied Commander,
at Kandy, Ceylon, for planning and co-ordina-
tion of control. This Committee acted as the
clearing house for information, and declared
the decisions of the Supreme Allied Com-
mander on policy, priorities, and allocation of
responsibility.

444. The working organisation was known
as RAPWI (Release Repatriation of Allied
Prisoners-of-war and Internees), which had a
Central Control for aid by air at Kandy, with
Army and Air Force Officers, and Sub-Con-
trols at Calcutta, Rangoon, Colombo and
Cocos. As the necessity for air dropping
decreased, these Controls were inconporated in
the RAPWI Control Organisations with Naval,
Army, Air and Allied representation.  Sub-
sequently a Control was opened at Singapore.

445. The RAPWI Controls were responsible
for co-ordination of executive action in
matters of supplies for RAPWI, and the
evacuation of personnel by aircraft and white
and red ensign ships.

446. For the prodigious effort put up by
the Cocos based squadrons engaged on opera-
tion “ Mastiff”, Red Cross and other stores
for RAPWI were packed at Sigiriya, Ceylon,
and handed over to the R.A.F. for delivery
to the Cocos Islands. This-demanded a very
heavy ferrying commitment to the Cocos
as two-thirds of the prison camps were
supplied by the Cocos based squadrons. Every
available Liberator and Sunderland aircraft
was used during the inauguration of
“ Mastiff ”.

447. This extra effort by the S.D. Liberators
based on the Cocos was due to the Jarge loads
which had to be carried to the prison camps
at Singapore and Southern Sumatra—tloads
which averaged from 3,500 to 4,000 Ibs.

448. No praise could be too high for the
air and ground crew personnel of these Cocos
based squadrons. Despite the severe shortage
of experienced crews and, indeed, aircraft, a
daily average of seven sorties, and sometimes
nine, was maintained. One squadron flew to

widely differing dropping zones throughout
Malaya, Sumatra and Java. Ninety ives -
sonnel were dropped on these sorties, of whi
65 were doctors or medical orderlies, and all
arrived safely despite the short notice at which
most of the sorties were laid on. On the first
day of the “Mastiff” operations, indeed, one
pped a medi team on
Changi Airfield at dawn on August 29th,
making a round trip of 3,400 miles.

449. The great distances covered and the
adverse weather conditions encountered were
difficulties which were not overcome lightly and
without danger. A Liberator on a supply
dropping mission to the prison camps at
Palembang was seen to spin whilst executing
a steep tum and all nine crew members were
killed.

450. It became obvious that Operation
“ Mastiff ” would continue for some consider-
able time until the last prisoner of war and in-
ternee had been evacuated from all areas by
air and sea. As September advanced the
numbers brought out mounted steadily. There

-has been praise on all sides for our squadrons

co-operating with the other Services in this
rescue of men and women who have endured
untold hardships, indignities and, in some cases
barbarous cruelties—comments of praise which
I have confirmed myself during talks with
tepatriated prisoners of war flown out of the
prison camp areas.

Tue JAPANESE PLANNED COUNTER MEASURES
TO INVASION OF Maraya.

451. The the Allies’ powerful “Zipper”
operation for the landing in Malaya would
have succeeded, and that mastery of the air
covering the landing would have been secured
almost from the start, seems a justifiable claim
after careful examination of evidence made
available through interrogation of Japanese
aed following the surrender in South East

452. It was evident that the Japanese, ir
their defence of Malaya, were unable to con-
form to one of the first principles of modern
warfare—that air superiority must be gained,
and that the battle in the air must first be
won, before ground forces can wage their
operations with any likelihood of success.

453. The Japanese counter invasion plan
was based on the fact that very few opera-.
tional aircraft were available since it had beer
