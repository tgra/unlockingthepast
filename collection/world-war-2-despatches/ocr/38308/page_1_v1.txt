-THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE BRITISH PACIFIC FLEET TO THE ASSAULT ON OKINAWA, 1945. .

The following Despatch was submitted to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on the qth June, 1945, by Admiral Sir Bruce A. Fraser, G.C.B., K.B.E., Commander-inChief, British Pacific Fleet.

Office of the Commander-in-Chief, British Pacific Fleet. 7th June, 1945.

 * ICEBERG  REPORT.

Be pleased to lay before Their Lordships a Teport on the actions fought by the British Pacific Fleet during the first phases of Operation   Iceberg. 

2. It is impossible yet to judge the effect of  

these operations on the conquest of Okinawa, but I consider that we have successfully carried out our undertakings, employing a method of sea warfare with which we were previously ae

Tt is not less than was expected, since all had turned their minds to it, but the credit must go to Vice-Admiral Sir Bernard Rawlings, K.C.B., O.B.E., whose inspiring leadership, resolution and: fine judgment were responsible.

4. Doubt as to our ability to operate in the Pacific manner was somewhat naturally in American minds. This, however, was soon changed. The toll taken by the suicide bomber of the more lightly armoured American carriers led to an increase in the proportionate effort provided by our carriers, and the evidence of American eyes that we could support ourselves logistically, relieved their anxieties on that score. We have now, I am sure, become not only welcome but necessary in Central Pacific operations.

- 5. Despite their doubts, the Americans put their trust in us unstintedly, and the ne generosity

and help of all were  invaluable to our success, a result which I know is most satisfactory to them. .

_ 6. We shall not, however, be able to play our full part until sufficient forces are available to form a second task group, since the effort of one, alternatively striking and re-fuelling, must necessarily be discontinuous and uneconomical of force.

7. The British Pacific Fleet have been making British naval history by operating off the enemy coast for periods up to 30 days each, but  it is well to remember that similar American task groups are doing the same thing for twice as long.  When we have mastered the technique of ammunitioning and storing at sea, we shall also be able to do this. .These are matters receiving close attention.

8. In this connection, I wish to commend: most whole-heartedly the work of Rear-Admiral D. B. Fisher, C.B., C.B.E., whose  successful   servicing of the Fleet at sea and in harbour has been the admiration of all.
