The weather was strong south-easterly to
east-southeasterly gale, with a rising sea and
swell. Fuel in the ‘‘ K’’ class and Hunt class
destroyers wag insufficient to allow an extra
day to be spent in the central basin west of
Benghazi, so it was necessary to get as far
ot as possible through bomb alley by day-
ight.

The Return Passage

67. At 2004, PENELOPE and LEGION
were ordered to join the convoy.

AVON VALE had been ordered to proceed
fo Malta with the convoy, as, in the pre-
vailing weather, it was considered she would
hold the rest of Force B back. In accordance
with the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean
Station’s message timed 1302 of 22nd March,
1942, CARLISLE was also ordered to remain
with the convoy.

68. At 2130, ‘owing to the strong easterly -

gale speed had to be reduced to 18 knots,
and at 0325 on 23rd March, to 15 knots.
Even so, only one destroyer (SIKH) had
not lagged by daylight, ZULU had to reduce
to 10 knots for half an hour at 0530. At 0630
the cruisers turned to 1180 degs. to collect
destroyers, and at o700 proceeded at 14 knots.
At 0800 force was in position 34 degs. 23
mins, N., 20 degs. 14 mins. E., course o80
degs.; course was altered at 0900 to I00 degs.

69. During 23rd March speed was gradually
increased as the weather slowly improved. By
1300, 20 knots was achieved, but at 1535 speed
had to be reduced for an hour to enable
LIVELY to repair weather and action damage.

SUPPLEMENT to tue LONDON GAZETTE, 18 SEPTEMBER, 1947

Aiy Attack and Fighter Protection .
70. Two Beaufighters arrived at 0756 an
from this time on with a few intervals fighters
were present. Fighter Direction was not good

because of bad communications.

Shadowing by the enemy aircraft commenced
in the forenoon but no attack developed until
1610 when 8 JU.87s attacked. Six of these
aircraft attacked LIVELY who was then astern
of the cruisers. No damage was sustained.

From this time until dusk, sporadic attacks
were made by JU.88s and torpedo-bombers.

71. At 2200 the weather having moderated
considerably, speed was increased to 22 knots.
An evasive course well north of the normal
track was used during the night.

At 2248 LIVELY reported that she was
unable to maintain more than 17 knots and
she was detached to Tobruk where it was
considered she could repair damage before
proceeding to Alexandria.

. 72. At daylight on 24th March speed was
increased to 26 knots.

Air—on 24th March
73. At 0730 on 24th March an A.S.V.*

. Sunderland arrived, and at 0735 two more air-

craft, thought at first to be Beaufighters, made
an almost unopposed torpedo attack. No
damage resulted and no further attacks de-
‘eloped. Fighter escort was provided from
0800.

74. The Force arrived at Alexandria at 1230
where they were honoured to receive the great
demonstration which then ensued.
