There was a strong suspicion at this time that the German raiders were using two prominent landmarks the Isle of Dogs and Hyde Park over which they turned to their various objectives. Two geographical barrages, designed to explode over these two points, were, therefore, worked out and were fired for the first time on the night 26th/27th September, 1940. There was no marked improvement in the number of raiders destroyed but the plan had the advantage of controlling the ammunition expenditure. ;"

The westward move to this area was made openly in daylight and when the division moved due north after dusk it was represented in the staging area by the measures I have already described. A wireless network of Io Corps, with all its brigades, was represented as operating in the southern sector up to D-day and from D mirfis 1 onwards occasional false messages were sent suggesting a move forward into 13 Corps  area."

            "description": "i89. On the 27th September No. 12 Group sent four Tempest pilots to make an armed reconnaissance of the area between Amersfoort and Apeldoorn. They saw signs of military activity at two points in and adjoining the Speulder Bosch and a third point just south of the neighbouring railway; but there was no proof that this activity had anything to do with rockets. However, on the same day and the two following days six more rockets fell near Norwich and one off the Norfolk coast. In four of these seven cases the information furnished by radar suggested or was consistent with firing from the area between Amersfoort and Apeldoorn. Whether our suspicions of the Speulder Bosch were justified or not evidently"

            "description": "The furthest point in Fifth Army's advance down the Imola road had been reached with the capture of Monte La Battaglia on 27th September. While the enemy was expending his strength in vain counter-attacks to recapture this vital position, attempts which continued until they died down from exhaustion on 6th October,t General Clark decided to take advantage of the progress made by the left wing of II Corps to concentrate the main weight of the Corps on the axis of Route 65, the direct road to Bologna. The factors which had militated against the choice of this axis for the original attack no longer applied, since we had now left well behind the strong defences and difficult terrain of the Futa Pass and were over the Radicosa Pass as well. Accordingly 13 Corps were to take over responsibility for the Imola axis and were to relieve 88 Division on Monte La Battaglia. I felt that this new drive would be the climax of our operations in the mountains; the season was already far advanced, and the break in the weather had come earlier than  usual; unless we could get through now we were likely to be stuck in the mountains for the winter. In order, therefore, to give the maximum weight possible to the attack, and since all three divisions in 3 Corps were very tired after continuous fighting, I decided on 2nd October to reinforce it with 78 Division, my only fresh formation, just back from a restful tour of duty in the Middle East. Even with this addition, as I reported on the same date, I feared that   we may not be quite strong enough to carry it"

After the departure of these ships, nearly all personnel of the Troupes Frangais du Levant had been repatriated."
