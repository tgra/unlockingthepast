SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 AUGUST, 1948

181. I attribute the immunity from attack
experienced by Force X and the convoy after
passing Skerki Channel to using the route pro-
posed by the Vice-Admiral, Malta. This well-
judged move ‘coupled with HERMIONE’s
bombardment appears to have deceived. the
enemy completely.

(Signed) J. F. SOMERVILLE,
Vice Admiral,

Flag Officer Commanding,
Force H.

OPERATION ‘f HARPOON ”
The following Despatch was submitted to the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on
the 24th June, 1942 by Vice-Admiral Sir

Alban T. B. Curtets, K.C.B., Senior Officer,
Force T. .
° HM.LS. KENYA,
24th June, 1942.

REPORT ON OPERATION ‘‘ HARPOON ”
Be pleased to lay before Their Lordships the
following report on Operation ‘‘ Harpoon *’—
the passage of a convoy of six merchant ships
through the Western Mediterranean to Malta.

Passage from Clyde as far as the Straits of
Gibraltar. Thursday, 4th June to Friday,
t2th June,

(Times Zone —2 (suffix B) }
2. Having hoisted my flag in KENYA at

goo on 4th June and having that afternoon ~

held conferences with the Commanding Officers

of H.M. Ships of Force T present in the Clyde

and other officers concerned, Convoy W.S.19Z
and escort sailed as required to comply with

Admiralty messages, forming up a.m. Friday,

5th June as follows: —

- Convoy W.S. 19Z— \

TROILUS (Senior Liaisov2-w.ncer acting as
Commodore), BURDWAN, CHANT,
, ORARI, TANIMBAR.
Ocean Escort—
KENYA (Senior Officer, Force T), LIVER-
POOL.
A/S Escort—

. ONSLOW (Captain (D), 17th Destroyer
Flotilla), BEDOUIN, ICARUS, MARNE,
MATCHLESS, ESCAPADE, BLANKNEY,
BUENO: BADSWORTH, KUJA-

3. It early became clear that the merchant
ships would not live up to the name of a 14-knot
convoy, for BURDWAN claimed to be able to
do only 13 knots and CHANT failed to produce
much more, while TANIMBAR, a diesel ship,
was unable to steam in the range of her critical
revolutions, approximately 12.5 to 13.5 knots.
However, favourable weather and a route
selected short in anticipation of delay enabled
the force to keep to timetable.

4. The passage was uneventful except for

(a) heavy oil consumption by KUJAWIAK
necessitating detaching her at 0800 / 9 to
refuel;

(5) identifying Portuguese VILLA
FRANCA—Greenland to Lisbon with cod at
2100/8;

(c) several A/S contacts and attacks all of
which were considered to be ‘‘ non-sub.”’

4495
allow for  refuelling,, KENYA,
BEDOUIN and KUJAWIAK approached

Gibraltar without being visible on the night of
the roth June. KENYA only sailed to a lear
of land by dawn rith June.

Seven destroyers of the Gibraltar force sailed
by day on the 11th June and the eight remain-
ing destroyers from Home Waters reached
Gibraltar after dark 11th June, though probably
sighted from the African coast approaching
Spartel. LIVERPOOL should have entered
sufficiently late not to be sighted from the shore
on the night of rrth June.

Passage from the Straits of Gibraltar to the
Point of Separation of Forces W and
X.

(Times Zone —3 (suffix C) )
Friday, rath June.

6. The convoy having passed through the
Straits during darkness r1th/zath June was
joined by the following units:—

Convoy—
S.S. KENTUCKY (Tanker).
Force T—
MALAYA, EAGLE, ARGUS, CAIRO,

CHARYBDIS, Destroyers (who _ sailed
rrth_ June) WISHART, WESTCOTT,
WRESTLER, VIDETTE, ANTELOPE,

ITHURIEL, PARTRIDGE.

HEBE, SPEEDY, RYE, HYTHE.

I2I, 134, 135, 168, 459, 462.
Temporarily Attached—
WELSHMAN.
Separately Routed—

Force Y—BROWN RANGER, GERAN-
IUM, COLTSFOOT.

7. 1703.—The Spanish M.V. CABO PRIOR
must have seen the convoy.

Saturday, 13th June.

8. Delay in starting the refuelling programme
was caused by navigational errors. The same
happened on Operation “‘ Halberd ’’ and it is
recommended that if possible the refuelling
force should be sailed with the remainder.
Nevertheless, by using LIVERPOOL and con-
tinuing till well after dark CAIRO and 14
destroyers were refuelled.

g. In spite of maintaining a section of Hur-
ticanes in the air from 0845 till dark, and an
A/S patrol of Swordfish, the convoy was kept
under observation by enemy aircraft and re-
ported at 1045, ISI, 1405 and at 1292 by
a U-Boat bearing ogo°. Hurricanes made con-
tact with one JU.88, probably killing the rear
gunner, and destroyed one Cant Z.1007.

Io. 2245.—Report of cruisers and destroyers
leaving Cagliari was received.
Sunday, 14th June

II. 0242,The convoy was probably re-
ported by an Italian U-boat.

12. 0650.—Snoopers were again in company,
reporting Force T at 0650 and 0750. Force Y
was also reported at 1810.

13. 0730.—Paravanes were streamed. -
