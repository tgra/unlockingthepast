for inshore work off the beaches. Very lew
of such inshore craft could be available during
the day and the main effort was concentrated on
maintaining the flow of Personnel Vessels to
Dunkirk at the rate of 2 every 34 hours. After
a good start during the night 26th/27th the
effect of enemy action against these transports
was felt. Between sailings timed 0300/27 and
1500/27, no less than 5 transports were shelled
and retirned to United Kingdom without
making the trip. In addition MONA ISLE was
damaged by shell fire and QUEEN OF THE
CHANNEL was bombed and sank during the
early hours of the 28th. As a result the Vice-
Admiral, Dover, reported to the Admiralty that
the normal channel, Dover to Dunkirk, was
impracticable in daylight owing to fire from
shore batteries extending from Les Hemmes to
Gravelines. Zuydecoote Pass had to be used
instead and consequently the distance run for
the round trip increased from 80 miles to 172
resulting in a general slowing up of traffic. This
route had to be used before it could be swept.
Work was also commenced to sweep a channel
from the North Goodwin to the Ruytingen Pass
and thence into the Dunkirk Roads, thus
shortening the round trip from 172 miles to 108.

4. The S.N.O. Dunkirk, with naval beach
and pier party of 12 officers and 160 ratings,
plus communication staff, left Dover in WOLF-
HOUND at 1345, and were attacked by dive
bombers at half-hour intervals between 1600 and
x8oo0, on the voyage to Dunkirk.

5. During the day preparations were
advanced for embarkation from beaches in the
La Panne-Dunkirk area, as such matters as
crews, fuel and general organisation were taken
in hand. Five Personnel Vessels routed to start
in daylight completed the round trip during the
,27th and lifted a total of 3,952. In addition 17
“drifters of the Dover Command sailed from
Dover for the Malo Beach, and during the night
lifted 2,000 troops from the beach by ships’
dinghies. During the day destroyer patrols
had been established to the Northward to cover
the passage of merchant ships between Dunkirk
and the Downs, and the Admiralty asked
Western Approaches to reinforce the Dover
destroyers.

6. Commander-in-Chief, Nore, sailed 6 small
skoots for the South Downs to co-operate in
Dunkirk, and sailed 4 skoots loaded with Army
stores direct to Dunkirk. In the evening
Naval Officer-in-Charge, Ramsgate, was asked
to take over the fuelling and despatching of all
small power boats with the attendant pulling
boats forming the inshore flotilla. Some un-
necessary delays occurred at this stage as the
majority of Naval Authorities were directing
the small craft for Dunkirk to be routed to
Dover, although the Vice Admiral, Dover, had
asked for the Downs to be their destination.
Once despatched by the Authorities no com-
munication with these vessels was possible until
they arrived at their destination, and so the
requirements of assembling these craft at the
Downs or Ramsgate were in many cases delayed
by as much as 24 hours or more since during
the night misfortune befell many tows that
came adrif* tue to moderate weather or colli-
sions and tne business of rounding them up
could not be effected until daylight.

7, The Vice Admiral had intended to main-
sain a destroyer at Dunkirk as a ‘W/T link, but

SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 17 JULY, 1947

the S.N.O., on arrival, decided that conditions
at Dunkirk made this impossible.

8. At 2025 -the Vice Admiral, Dover, re-
ceived a Most Immediate message from the
S.N.0., Dunkirk, who had just reached his
station, as follows: ‘‘ Port consistently bombed
all day, and on fire. Embarkation possible only
from beaches East of harbour A.B.C.D. Send
all ships and passenger ships there to anchor.
Am ordering WOLFHOUND to load there and
sail. 1T.0.0.* 2005/27."" | Meanwhile Vice °
Admiral, Dover, had asked the Commander-
in-Chief, Nore, to send evéry available shallow
draught power boat, capable of ferrying from
beaches to ships lying off the beaches Eastward
of Dunkirk, stocked with fuel and provisions
for two days; this move ‘being made with a
view to saving time by cutting out the passage
to, and subsequent reorganisation, at Rams-
gate, prior to proceeding to the French Coast.
Tt should be noted at this time (2000/27) there
were no pulling boats, cutters or whalers
immediately available for attendance on
Power Boats. A further signal: ‘‘ Please send
every available craft to beaches East of Dun-
kirk immediately. Evacuation tomorrow
night is problematical. T.0.0. 1958/27”
was received from S.N.O. Dunkirk.

Later that evening a report was received
from 2 Military Officers from G.H.Q.
which suggested that the situation of the
B.E.F. was precarious and it was possible that
the enemy might succeed in cutting off this
force from Dunkirk. This report appeared to
confirm the results of air reconnaissance, which
indicated that German armoured units were
operating to the south of Dunkirk. Since it
appeared that evacuation might well be strictly
limited, both in regard to numbers and time
available for the operation, it was decided to
concentrate every effort in sending over as
many craft as possible to the beaches without
delay. Had the situation appeared to be less
critical, an organised flow of large and small
craft working in reliefs would have been
arranged.

g. On receipt of these signals from S.N.O.
Dunkirk, all available forces were diverted to
the beaches, the Personnel Ships to the beach,
code letters A.B.C. and D., the destroyers on
patrol ‘being diverted to La Panne. Destroyers
that were working off Dunkirk were ordered to
divert the Personnel Ships going into Dunkirk
to lay off the beaches and the smaller craft
such as drifters and motor boats were ordered
to be used for ferrying troops from the beach
to the larger ships. Two important strings of
boats being towed by a tug were lost in the
night through the tows ‘being run down and
cut in half, the boats being scattered.

ro. As a result of the above action there
were assembling off the beaches 2 transports,
9 destroyers, 4 minesweepers, CALCUTTA,
17 drifters and a few skoots, and all the
ships were ordered to use their own,boats for
ferrying as none of the inshore flotilla had
arrived. From signals received it appeared
that the situation was desperate, that little
could be lifted direct from the Port of Dunkirk
and that the maximum effort must be made
from the beaches. Commander-in-Chief, Nore,
at this stage provided additional reinforcements
of minesweepers and paddlers, During the
