            "description": "in May, 1941, when\u2019 the greater part,,of the German, air forces were transferred to the Russian front. After May there were a few major raids (e.g., on Birmirigham on 4-5th June, Southampton on 21-22nd June, and Hull on 17-18th July). The scale of attack, how- ever, gradually decreased, and for the:rest of - the year, apart from occasional attacks on other targets, the remaining German forces in the West were thrown mainly into the Battle of the Atlantic by attacks on ports and shipping and by heavy minelaying: \u2018The position in the Atlantic was still most precarious and the ,attacks made were designed to increase our \"shipping difficulties,"

Also, after detailed discussion with G.O.C.-in-C., Eastern Army, I had to accept his view that an advance into ad Burma could not begin before the rst March."

            "description": "The Germans, having now made us. deploy and fight hard for the two ports and Arezzo, initiated a programme \u2018of gradual withdrawal to the Arno based on a series of phase lines known by girls names in alphabetical order.* Their forces were now well balanced and there was little chance of seriously disrupting this programme. On 16th July Arezzo fell, on the 18th IV Corps reached the Arno east of Pisa, on the same day the Poles captured Ancona and on the roth the Americans entered Leghorn. The Poles had had heavy fighting at Loretto and Filottrano; it took six days of fluctuating attack and counter-attack to clear the latter and the main attack was delayed thereby till the morning of the 17th. IV Conps had to beat off a final counter-attack on Resignano on roth July, and for the next two days progress to the east of the town was still slow. From the 13th to the 15th the advance was more rapid as the Germans fell back to their next delaying posi- tions. gi Division was the first unit in IV Corps to reach the Arno, capturing Pontedera on 18th July, but on the\u2019 left 34 Division was held further south in th\u00e9 hills behind Leg- horn and first entered the city at oz00 hours on the rgth. The Germans had devoted greater efforts than ever to render the port unusable. The dock area was heavily mined and booby- trapped, all the quays had been cratered and the harbour entrance was almost wholly blocked by sunken ships. By 23rd July 34 Divi- sion had captured the southern part of Pisa. All bridges over the Arno had been destroyed and the enemy was firmly posted on the north bank all along the Corps front. Leghorn har- bour remained under fire from long-range artillery."

As a\u2019result of these breaches, diversions of traffic had to be made.

He sented to me that the telief of the Australian portion of the Garrison was particularly desirable in view of the grow- ing feeling in Australia that the time had come to fulfil the agreement made between their own and the British Government that the Australian troops should be concentrated under one com- mand and serve as one force. He suggested that the lull in operations presented an oppor- tunity which should not be missed. This letter was followed on the 23rd July by a telegram from the War Office repeating a message to the same effect from the Australian Government and urging me to give full and sympathetic consideration to the views of the Australian Government."
