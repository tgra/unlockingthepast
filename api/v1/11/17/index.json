But since only cer- tain items, such as rations and a limited range of ammunition and stores, were available from these dumps, they were, by agreement with the Turkish Government, supplemented by stores {mainly supplies, petrol and oil) railed from Syria through Turkey to Kusadasi. Despatch started on 21st October, the first wagons crossed the frontier on 2gth, and stores \u2018crossed the frontier at a daily average of 7o tons, until flow was stopped on 17th November after the fall of Leros. By this time a total of 1,400 tons had been sent into Turkey."

On 25th October, the Chiefs of Staff \u2014 directed that my \u2018forces should not be reduced below the minimum required for the main- tenance of internal security and for the fulfil- ment of the condition, which was now accepted, that Middle East Base would ultimately ibe required to support operations in South-east Asia. This decision was clarified on 17th November, when the Chiefs of Staff decided that the primary function of Middle East Base was to support operations in the Mediterranean; units and personnel not re- quired for that commitment must be released. We should eventually b\u00e9 required as a sub- sidiary base for South-east Asia Command, but this should not be allowed to influence the drafting away of units and personnel for Italy and 2x Army Group, since we should only be involved gradually in the commitment for Asia, and additional troops would be returned las the commitment \u2018became heavier. Neverthe- less, no base installation or organisation was to be completely closed, but they were to be kept on a care and maintenance basis, and the army base was not to be reduced so as to prejudice present or future requirements of the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force, or Merchant Navy. On the basis of this directive, Middle East continued until the end of my period in command."

            "description": "The decision to make a dash for Tunis, though bold, was undoubtedly correct. The advance was pressed by land, sea and air; Bougie was occupied by 11th November, Bone on 12th November, by a British parachute battalion, and by 18th November our advanced forces were operating east of:Gebel Abiud on the coast road and B\u00e9ja on the inland road, about sixty miles from Bizerta and Tunis re- spectively. At both points we were in contact with German troops. These had begun to arrive, in the first place by air, on oth November, meeting no resistance from the French authorities in Tunisia. On 15th November a United States parachute battalion occupied Youks Les Bains and Tebessa, in south-eastern iAlgeria, and co-operated with the French detachments at Gafsa in southern Tunisia. Between 17th November and 25th December two main attempts were made to capture Tunis. The first succeeded in ad- vancing, on 28th November, as far as Djedeida, on the road between Tunis and Bizerta and only twelve miles from the former. At this point the enemy counter-attacked strongly with tanks and dive-bombers; the latter were able to operate from good airfieldss only a short distance in rear and our own air forces were ungble to give cover, since the rain had put all their temporary landing grounds out of action. Our forces on the inland road were therefore obliged to withdraw to Medjez el Bab. This town, as its name \u2018\u2018 the Ford of the Pass \u201d shows, is of great strategic importance. It lies"

I further directed that these forces should proceed, with- out delay, to prepare for operations in support of two British and two American Field Armies in an assault on the Continent. I also issued a Directive to the Air Marshal Commanding, Air Defence of Great Britain, setting out the func- tions and organisation of the Air Defence of Great Britain, following on its conversion from Royal Air Force Fighter Command."

To enable more effective control of the Aegean to be exercised by the Navy, it was decided to establish a naval base at Suda Bay at the north-western end of Crete. With the full approval of the Greek Government, the British forces in the Middle East assumed responsibility for the defence of Crete. The 1st battalion York and Lancaster Regiment, some A.A. artillery and a Field Company were despatched on 31st October to Suda Bay. On 17th November another battalion, 2nd The Black Watch, was sent."

My real task, then, was that set out in articles (a), (b), (c) and (e) of the directive, and as much of article (d) as related to opera- tions by formations under my own command. In short, it was primarily a defensive one. Although squadrons of A.D.G.B. were to play their part in operations over France during the assault phase of the European operations, the Overall Air Plan issued by the Air Commander- in-Chief showed that my most significant responsibility even in that phase would be to stand guard over the base. Obviously, we were approaching a stage at which the needs of the offensive must have priority. The direc- tive of the 17th November emphasized the need for economy in defence \u201c\u2018 in order to make greater provision for offence \u2019\u2019, and called upon me to suggest changes in organisation with this need in mind. My problem, in fact, was to en- sure, with limited resources, that the United Kingdom was securely defended from air attack as a base for the great operations by land, sea, and air which were being planned."

I pointed out that armed reconnaissance was clearly not an adequate method of limiting the German offensive unless supplemented by other measures. Yet no bombing attack on any rocket target at the Hague had been made for two months, Since the Tactical and Strategic Air Forces were not, at the moment, in a posi- tion to undertake such tasks, I should have to rely on my own resources. Now, the Spitfire aircraft which I was using for armed recon- naissance had recently begun to carry bombs; but their pilots were precluded from dropping their bombs in circumstances which involved any risk at all to Dutch civilian life or property. I suggested that this injunction should be re- laxed to the extent of permitting pilots to bomb such targets as could be accurately located and were situated in areas from which the in- habitants were known to have been removed. In these circumstances the risk to civilian life, at least, would be small; and what we had to do was to balance the off chance of injury to life and property at the Hague against its certainty in London. I asked that this question should be carefully considered, in consultation with the Dutch civil authorities if this were \u2018thought fit. Such a conc\u00e9ssion would also apply, of course, to any attacks that the Mosquito aircraft of No. 2 Group might make."

The French Command had agreed that they would, to the best of their ability, cover the concen- tration of 78 Division and the right flank of their subsequent advance, and it seemed pos- sible that French troops would also actively assist in the northern sector. Further south the attitude of the French forces was very uncertain."
