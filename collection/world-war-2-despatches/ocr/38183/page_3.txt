SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 22 JANUARY, 1948

This sickness was largely attributed by the
medical authorities to the effects of overwork.
In addition, Wing-Commander Yarde had to
be sent away sick, other officers were in hos-
pital for shorter periods, and when war with
Japan broke out Colonel Scott, whe had taken
Colonel Faweett’s place as the Army G.S.O4,
was in India on sick leave, having been serit
there from hospital.

Intelligence.

8. For intelligence I relied almost entirely
on the Far Eastern Combined Bureau, known
for short as| F.E.C.B. This consisted of
branches of Naval, Army and Air Force in-
telligence, and was under the administrative
control of the Admiralty, the officer in charge
of the Naval Section acting as head of the
Bureau. At the date of the formation of my
headquarters, F.E.C.B. was somewhat un-
balanced in that attention was mostly concen-
trated on Naval intelligence, while Army and
Air intelligence took a minor place, the latter
especially being quite inadequate. This, how-
‘ever, was steadily corrected, and I consider
that F.E.C.B. fulfilled its functions and showed
that a combined intelligence staff of the three
Services is a workable proposition. ‘What was
needed, however, was a real chief of F.E.C.B.,
and not merely one whose main duty was acting
as head of his own branch. The difficulty was
in finding a really suitable individual, and this
we had not succeeded in doing at the time war
with Japan broke out.

Aitachments to General Headquarters Staff.

g. A branch of the Ministry of Economic
Warfare known as the O.M. Section, was started
on the arrival of Mr. Killery at Singapore in
May, 1941. He and his staff were keen and
capable, but they had no experience and v
little knowledge of how to set about their
work. Further, as in the case of intelligence,
this is work that requires a great deal of pre-
aration. In consequence of this, but through
no fault of Mr. Killery or his staff, the O.M.
activities really never got functioning properly
by the time that war with Japan broke out.
There was also a curious reluctance on the part
of many people to have anything to do with
these activities, or to help on the work. This
was particularly noticeable in the case of in-
tended activities in Siam.

xo. Colonel] ‘Warren arrived in Singapore
early in 194 to assist in starting Independent
‘Companies. The obvious disadvantage of
these Companies is that they form a drain on
infantry units, which were already depleted of
many of their best non-commissioned officers
and officers owing to the expansion and de-
mands of other organisations. As a result, it
was finally decided to limit these Independent
Companies to two—one for Burma and one for
Malaya.

In Malaya, as in Burma and Hong Kong,
there was a ‘War Committee, which sat under
the Governor. ©

- The main reason for the defence of Malaya
was to preserve the facilities of the Naval
Base at Singapore. The port and rubber and
tin production were also important, but on a
different plane from the Naval Base. It was,,
of course, not sufficient to have a close defence:
of the area round the Naval Base itself. It’
was of great importance to keep enemy aircraft
as far away from the Base as possible, on
account of the danger of bombing; this meant.
extending the defence right up to the Northerm
end of Malaya. It may be noted that this was.

“not dependent upon the policy of defending

Malaya by means of air power. Had the
policy been to defend Malaya by means of Army
forces, the dispositions might have been
different, but it would still have been essential
gteater part of Malaya in order
to deny aerodromes or their possible sites to
the enemy. Singapore Island was to be pro-
visioned for 180 days. : :
Communications.

. 12. The main roads in Malaya are well-
metalled, and the railways are single-track
metre-gauge. Down the centre of Malaya runs
a range of hills rising to some 7,000 feet, and
there are no east-to-west communications north
of latitude 4, i.e., about the latitude of Kuantan,
The central backbone of hills dies away soon
after crossing the frontier with Siam, and good
lateral communications were available in the
neighbourhood of Singora, where, also, there
were suitable sites for aerodromes. Generally
speaking, communications in the west are good
and on the east poor.

The defence of the east coast was simplified
by the lack of communications, since it was
only necessary to hold those places from which
roads ran into the interior, This meant that
the key points to hold were Mersing and
Kuantan. Kota Bharu in Kelantan was held
because of the aerodrome at that place and two
others a few miles further south, these being
necessary in order to enable us to strike, with
aircraft, as far as possible into the Gulf of
Siam and into IndoChina. (See para. 52
below.) ~ — ,

The only existing land communication
between Kelantan and the rest of Malaya is the
railway, there ‘being no through road.

. Attempts were made to use the railway for

motor transport, but as the rails were spiked
and no chairs were available the damage
caused to tyres was so excessive that the pro-
ject was given up as impracticable: This meant
that communications with any force at Kota
Bharu were precarious, since everything had to
move by the single line of railway, which in -
many parts was highly vulnerable to bombing..
I laid down that the road policy in Kelantar
should be not to develop any road on or near
the coast, but as soon as practicable to con-
struct an internal road running north and south,
following more or less the line of the railway.

The only communication overland with
Kuantan was a single road, also very vulner-
able in places to air bombing.
Co-operation between the services and with the

civil authorities. :

the relations between the Army and the Air
Force were not happy; there was some jealousy
