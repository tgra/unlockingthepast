            "description": "By the end of the month the rest of Tripolitania had been cleared. In this task we were aided by a column of Fighting French from the Chad Territory which, while Eighth Army was advancing along the coast, invaded the country from the south and conquered the Saharan province of the Fezzan. This represented a great feat of endurance and skill, for they started from Fort Lamy, fifteen hundred miles by air line south of Tripoli. The commander was General Leclerc,* later famous as the commander of 2 French Armoured Division, which liberated Paris: The Fezzan was held by numerous Italian garrisons, each disposed to cover a water source, so that failure at any one point would have meant the risk of complete lack of water for the force. The first garrison to be overwhelmed was that of Umm el Araneb which surrendered on 4th January. The northern garrisons heeded the warning and began to withdraw before the end of the year. The southern garrisons had greater difficulty in getting away, mainly because of shortage of transport and fuel and the low morale of their native troops. Gatrun, Murzuk and Sciuref surrendered in swift succession. Ghadames, the most westerly, was attacked on roth January. By the 15th the remnants of the Sahara Command, reduced by desertion and surrender to two thirds of its original strength of about three thousand five hundred, were gathered at Mizda and Garian and it was they who constituted the garrison of the latter place until the zand. Next day Mizda surrendered to an attack. With the fall of Ghadames on 29th January the conquest of the Fezzan was completed.",

The aircraft used proved unsuitable for this form of attack. The crews were determined, achieved co-ordination and, flying low, penetrated the inner, carrier, ring; but a plan of attack appeared to be lacking and the aircraft offered easier targets than ever I have seen.",

            "description": "176. It had become evident that the enemy defences protecting the road were stronger than originally anticipated. It was, therefore, decided to abandon further attacks on the hill features north of the road and concentrate our forces on the right flank, where, by securing Kangaw Village and the hills to the east of it, the object of effectively blocking the road could be achieved. A strong enemy counterattack on the night 28th-29th January was tepulsed with loss. On the 29th, we drove the enemy from Kangaw Village and captured the small hill which dominated it, and from which any movement on the road could be prevented by fire. On the early morning of the 31st January, the Japanese launched the most desperate attack of the whole Arakan campaign, but gained no ground and received. severe punishment. It was now eleven days since the initial assault on Kangaw had been made, a period in which our field, medium and Naval artillery, together with the Thunderbolts and Spitfires of the R.A.F, had hammered the enemy without intermission. The capture of Kangaw and of an important hill to the east of it which had followed on the Ist February, marked the turning point of the battle; the enemy's escape road from Myohaung and Minbya had been finally cut. 51 Brigade then secured a dominating position north of the road, which effectively prevented any possibility of a break-through from the north. As will be seen later, 82 (West African) Division had already begun their task of driving the Japanese up against this block. This result could not have been achieved without the work of Naval craft and beach parties, which continued to land supplies under heavy fire.",
