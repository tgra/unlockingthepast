EGYPT.
31. In Egypt certain problems vitally
affected the security of our base. These arose

in part directly out of the war and in part
out of the circumstance that Egypt herself
is not a belligerent.

Apart from politicai difficulties, the problem
of telephonic communications has been pres-
sing. The Egyptian State Telegraphs and Tele-
Phones Departments have always given us
excellent eet ar et ae use of the civilian
system, mann civilian personnel is -
judicial to security. Holding the view ie 0
long as the country is not at war, military con-
siderations cannot override civilian require-
ments, the Departments have consistently re-
fused to hand’ over any part of the system to
British Control. Nor will they allow the infiltra-
tion of British Military personnel to handle our
own traffic and become ‘used to the system so as
to be able to take over in an emergency; such
might arise if heavy bombing attacks occurred.
The difficulty became particularly acute in
connection with the projected -effensive in
Cyrenaica; but in October I was able to arrange
to take over the working of the lines in the
forward area.

32. There has also been an agitation for
the declaration of Cairo, as well as. other
Egyptian cities, as an ‘‘ open city.” As the
bean of Alexandria increased, so did the

airo ‘‘ open city ’’ movement gain impetus.
in mid-September the Egyptian Prime Minister
was handed a Memorandum stating that it was
entirely out of the question to move British
troops and military depots from Cairo: an
end should, therefore, be put to the agitation.
The recent diminution of enemy air raids
on Egyptian towns has automatically put this
question into the background; but if is bound
to reappear with its attendant dangers to in-
ternal security as soon as heavy scale bombing
is resumed. Against that day an elaborate air
taid precautions scheme has been prepared,
to which His Majesty’s Government have given
considerable financial assistance,

33. The worst result of the air raids was
that they seriously threatened shipping in the
Suez Canal and in the Gulf of Suez. Inci-
dentally they also caused a reduction in the
amount of Egyptian casual labour; but this
was speedily remedied by improving the

threat to shipping demanded that immediate
and ‘effective measures be taken, and they
were the more urgent in that air raids coincided
with the arrival of important convoys carry-
ing large numbers of men and vehicles. More-
over it was essential to give adequate protec-
tion to American ships which had just begun
to arrive. I therefore took every possible pre-
caution. Several anti-aircraft batteries were
moved from other areas to Suez during moon-
light periods, and anti-aircraft crews were
placed aboard American ships, while the Royal
Navy stationed an anti-aircraft cruiser in Suez
Roads. In addition it was decided to provide
two defended anchorages in the Gulf of Suez,
at Abu Zenima and at Ras Ghemsa, for use
in the event of Port Tewfik becoming unuse-
able.

34. The help given us by the Egyptian’
Army is an earnest of the friendly intentions of
the Government. In addition to finding
internal security guards in the Delta and on the .
land, they found a garrison for Siwa at a
time when it was necessary for us to leave
as few of our own troops as possible in the
Western Desert. The services of the Egyptian
Army have been particularly valuable. Pro-
viding as they have a complete and efficient
observer system as well as searchlight and
anti-aircraft units at Cairo, Alexandria and. in
the Canal area, they have relieved the strain
on our resources to a very great extent.

PART II—ADMINISTRATION,

35. During this period I was chiefly con-
cerned with the problems of administration.
The comparatively peaceful conditions pre-
vailing gave me the opportunity of carrying
out the large amount of reorganisation and
development rendered necessary by the in-
creasing strength of the Middle East Forces.

GENERAL ORGANISATION.
Formation of Eighth and Ninth Armies.

36. The conclusion of the Balkan and East
African Campaigns caused our forces to be
concentrated in Egypt, Palestine and Syria,
and narrowed the potential theatres of opera-
tions. It was therefore certain that in future
the strength of the forces engaged in operations
could be reckoned, not in Brigades and
Divisions as heretofore but in Corps. The
existing small headquarters were obviously in-
adequate to control operations on this scale.
I therefore determined that the basic organisa-
tion should comprise two Army Headquarters
to command all the troops in the two prin-
cipal theatres of operations, with two Base
and Line of Communication Areas directly ad-
ministered by G.H.Q. relieving the armies of
the administration of these areas.

Accordingly on the 26th September the
Headquarters of the Eighth Army, commanded
by Lieutenant-General Sir Alan Cunningham,
assumed command of all troops in the Western
Desert forward of Bahig, with the exception
of those in Tobruk who came under command
on the 3oth October. Headquarters, British
Troops in Egypt, became in effect a large Base
and Lines of Communication Area Command
operationally responsible only for the internal
security and anti-aircraft defence of the
Egyptian base.
