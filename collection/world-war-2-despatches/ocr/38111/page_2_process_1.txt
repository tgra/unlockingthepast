16 Group. -  

 (i) To hunt and destroy E-Boats and destroyers in the Southern North Sea.

(ii) To provide anti-E-Boat and destroyer reconnaissance in conjunction with Naval Surface Forces operating in the Southern North Sea.

Form of Operations. : az. It was correctly appreciated that antiship operations would take place mostly at night and at dawn and dusk, and these were to take the following forms:   At night. : (i) Operation of Albacore and Swordfish. under G.C.I. control of 10 and 11 Groups. (ii) Reconnaissance by Wellington flaredropping A.S.V. aircraft operating under 16 and 19 Groups, and the subsequent direction of Naval Surface Craft and/or Coastal Command Reaufighters to the target.  ~ . At.dusk and dawn. . Beaufighter sweeps with the object of destroying enemy Light Surface Craft when leaving harbour at dusk or returning from patrol at dawn.

rz. As in the case of anti-U-Boat measures, I was prepared to implement these plans as a result of enemy reaction to exercises such as  * Fabius  , or to any other event which might have led him  to believe that the assault was

imminent.

Main Battle Zone. :

13. In agreement with the Admiralty and the Air Commander-in-Chief, A.E.A.F., I demarcated an area between the lines Portland to Jersey on the West and North Foreland to

Calais on the East, as the main battle zone. .

 Coastal Command aircraft were. to operate

primarily on the flanks of this area and only ,

to a limited extent within it. This was an important point. I expected such a concentration of shipping of all sorts in this zone that even by day I considered it would be difficult to distinguish friend from foe, and at night almost impossible. As it turned out, however, it became possible, by special briefing at Area Combined Headquarters, for my anti-shipping aircraft to operate within the Battle Zone outside the central area containing the cross- -channel shipping lanes. .

Order of Battle. : 2 14. The Order of Battle, as it stood on 4th June, 1944, shows that, in order to make the - flooded urea in the S.W. Approaches effective, I deployed no less than 21 of my A/U squadrons : together with 4 Fleet Air: Arm squadrons in this area. My anti-shipping striking force consisted of seven Beaufighter squadrons, of which I allotted initially five to the east of the main battle zone where the threat of .E-Boats was considered greater, and two to the west.

ConpuUCcT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  U-Boat Operations in the North.

15. Intensive operations for Coastal Com-

mand began in mid-May, although only the Anti-U-Boat squadrons in the North were involved. At  this time .the enemy decided hurriedly to reinforce his U-Boat flotillas in the Bay of Biscay by moving a number of his Norwegian-based  boats into the Atlantic and

were being conducted at no less than 850 miles

from the aircraft's bases. At the end of June, however, I had moved the whole of the VLR* Liberator squadron from Iceland to Tain, and this squadron bore the brunt of the operations conducted in these very far Northern regions.

16. During June perhaps three or four boats in all got through to the Bay of Biscay. The rest were either destroyed or damaged and forced to put back to Norway. In those Northern latitudes at that time of year there  was no darkness, and, at the beginning of the battle at any rate, few of the Northern U-Boats had been fitted with   schnorkel  . These two factors were largely responsible for the opportunities for so many attacks.

17. During the period mid-May to the end of July, we sighted seventy-five U-Boats in Northern Waters and attacked fifty-one. Of these sixteen were sunk or probably sunk and twelve damaged. These successes were not achieved without cost. 162 Canadian Squadron sank four U-Boats and lost three Catalinas in June- alone. Two Victoria Crosses. were awarded to officers taking part in these operations, one posthumously to the Captain of a Catalina of the afore-mentioned 162 (R.C.A.F.) Squadron, and a second to the Captain of a Catalina of 210 Squadron. F   U-Boat Operations in the South.   .

18. Despite the importance of these far away operations, it was inevitable that the. main attention should be concentrated on the beaches of Normandy and the English Channel. The

Preparations for the assault and the large scale 

exercises during the last few days of May and

 the beginning of Jane did not produce any re-

actions from the enemy, and on 6th June the majority of the enemy's operational U-Boats were still assembled in the Biscay ports. They were not offensively deployed on that date, so there can be no doubt that the enemy had been unable to discover the date of our landing. On D-Day however, he reacted swiftly. It soon became clear -that the U-Boats were making for the assault area with the utmost speed that is, on the surface whenever possible. The air patrols which had  been planned to counter this move were already being flown and successes soon materialised. Off the Brest Peninsula and in the mouth of the
