Bardu Foss, another in the neighbourhood

of Harstad and probably a third further

south possibly at Bodo, with the necessary
complement of anti-aircraft artillery.

(8) The protection of the naval anchorage
which could be defended economically
against surface, under water and land attack,
and around which ground anti-aircraft
defences could be installed.

(c) The selection and occupation of an
area which could be adequately defended
against sea, Jand and air attack and within
which suitable base installations could be
developed to supply a force of approximately
three divisions through the port of Narvik
and the railway to Lulea.

I estimated that this area would have to
include not only an area South of Narvik at
least as far as the Tysfjord (40 miles South ot
Narvik) but also an area East of Narvik along
the frontier. Further, that the Northern por-
tion of the area would have to include Hatten
which lies 80 miles North of Narvik at the head
of the Lyngen Fjord and covers the approaches
to Tromso.

6. I submitted also to the C.I.G.S. a pro-
visional estimate of the forces which I con-
sidered would be required. These in general,
apart from air forces and troops required for
administrative purposes, amounted to twelve
infantry battalions, one or two machine gun
battalions, a divisional cavalry regiment
(mechanised) with a due proportion of artillery
and engineer units.

In conjunction with the technical experts
available in the War Office, I estimated the
requirements in anti-aircraft artillery at 144 3.7
guns and 112 Bofors Light Guns.

Departure for and arrival in Norway.

7. T embarked with an advanced headquarters
staff at Leith in the Polish liner Chrobry
on the 7th May and landed, after an uneventfui
voyage at Harstad on the r1th May.

8. Lord Cork was away in his flagship at
Skaanland when I landed, but I met Major-
General Mackesy and his General Staff Officer,
Colonel Dowler, at once, and learned the situa-
tion from them. Hearing that a landing opera-
tion by the French contingent was about to
take place near Bjerkvik at the head of Herjangs
Fjord, and that Lord Cork was to direct the
operation in person, I at once went to Skaanland
with my Brigadier General Staff, Brigadier
Gammell, and met Lord Cork.

I explained my position to Lord Cork, and
with his approval, remained in H.M.S.
Effingham with him. Neither General Mackesy
nor any member of his staff was present on the
Flagship, though General Bethouart, Command-
ing the French Contingent and his staff
embarked just after myself and remained
aboard throughout the operation.

9. The landing took place under a heavy
bombardment from the guns of the Fleet in cold
and cloudy weather in the early hours of the
13th May, and, in spite of the fact that there
was now continuous daylight throughout the
twenty-four hours and appreciable opposition
from enemy machine guns on shore, was com-
pletely successful. The enemy was ejected from
the area North and East of Herjangs Fjord and
the French landing parties not only effected a
junction with their own troops advancing from

the North from the direction of Gratangen but
also cleared the country down to Oijord imme-
diately across the Rombaks Fjord from Narvik.

Although I was present inghe capacity of a
spectator only, I am constrained to express my
admiration for the way in which the whole
operation was conceived and effected by all
concerned. I was particularly struck by the
business like efficiency of the French Foreign
Legion which carried out the landing. That
the landing was not interfered with by enemy
aircraft was almost certainly due to the for-
tunate weather conditions prevailing at the
time. At this period, there were no land based
aircraft available in Norway with which to
counter enemy air attacks and a bombing raid
might well have turned the operation from a
success into a failure.

xo. I returned with Lord Cork to Harstad in
HM.S. Effingham, arriving on the afternoon
of the 13th May.

Assumption of Command. :

11. Immediately H.M.S. Effingham reached
Harstad, Brigadier Fraser, Commander of the
24th Guards Brigade, came on board with
Colonel Dowler of the General Staff, to discuss
plans for operations in the Mo and Bodo areas
with Lord Cork. Owing to ill health, Major-
General Mackesy was not present.

12. With the concurrence of Lord Cork I
listened to the ensuing discussion which centred
round the question whether reinforcements
already embarked at Skaanland should be sent
to Bodo or to Mo, where an advanced detach-
ment consisting of ist Battalion Scots Guards
and some ‘‘ Independent Companies” had
already been landed under heavy enemy air
attack. At this conference I told Lord Cork
that, in accordance with my instructions from
the War Office, I proposed to assume com--
mand of all military forces forthwith.

13. I then gave verbal orders to Brigadier
Fraser that he was to proceed at once with
Ist Battalion Irish Guards and other troops to
Bodo and not to Mo, and that he was to hold
Bodo permanently, and Mo, for as long as he
could. These orders were subsequently con-
firmed in writing.

14. On landing from H.M.S Effingham I at
once informed Major-General Mackesy that I
had assumed command. Throughout my deal-
ings with Major-General Mackesy I found him
uniformly helpful and informative. In fact,
many of my subsequent actions were based on
information and advice received from him.

Situation on 13th May, 1940.

15. Briefly the dispositions, on the r3th-rqth
