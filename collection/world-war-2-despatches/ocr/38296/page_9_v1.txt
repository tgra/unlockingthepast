-57- In Crete, the enemy changed his tactics in the western secfor and made a very heavy bombing attack on Canea. The Army force

- headquarters had to be withdrawn to the naval headquarters at Suda. Jn the Heraklion area, our troops were still holding out but the Greeks in this sector were getting short of ammuni-

tion. The A.A. defences of Suda were by this ime seriously reduced by enemy air attacks nd casualties in the port to small craft had

n heavy.

58. In reply to a request from the Chiefs of

Staff (Number 113) for an appreciation, the ander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, said that the scale of air attack now made it no longer  possible for the Navy to operate in the Aegean or vicinity of Crete by day. The Navy could not guarantee to prevent seaborne landings without suffering losses, which, added.to those already sustained, would very seriously prejudice our coinmand of the Eastern Mediterranean (MIDEAST to TROOPERS 0/67119 of 24th May time of origin 1815 of 24th May). The Chiefs of Staff (Number 116) replied that unless more drastic naval action was taken than that suggested in the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean's appreciation the enemy would be able to reinforce the island to a considerable extent. The Chiefs of Staff added that it was essential that the Commanders-in-Chief should  concert measures for clearing up the situation  without delay. In so doing the Fleet and t Royal Air Force were to accept whatever risk : was entailed in preventing any considerable enemy reinforcement reaching Crete. If enemy convoys were reported north of Crete the fleet would, have to cperate in that area by day although considerable losses might be expected. Experience would show for how long that situa-

tion could be maintained. To this the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, replied ( n

26th May) that the determining factor in operat-

aU atonal

ing in the Aegean was not the fear of sustaining -

losses but the need to avoid crippling the fleet < without commensurate advantage to ourselves. y He pointed. out that so far the enemy had apparently not succeeded in landing any-considerable reinforcements by sea. With regard

to the last part of the Chiefs of Staff message,  

he pointed out that in three days, two cruisers and four destroyers had been sunk, one battleship had been put out of action for several - months, whilst two cruisers and four destroyers had ibeen considerably damaged. Since startving to write this message  he had heard that RMIDABLE | and NUBIAN had_ been damaged, The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, also referred to the strain, both to personnel and machinery, in the light craft, who had been operating to the limits of their ,_ endurance since the end of February (the ComMander-in-Chief, Mediterranean's message: to the Admiralty timed 1834C of 26th May, 1941).

aerodrome was being  extensively used by the enemy in his operations against Crete. It was, therefore, decided to attack the aerodrome with Fleet Air Arm aircraft* from FORMIDABLE who had now built up her fighter strength to 12 Fulmars, though some of them were of doubtful reliability. Vice Admiral 1st Battle Squadron was given charge of the operation: which was to be known as M.A.Q.3. At 1200 on 25th May, Vice Admiral 1st Battle Squadron in QUEEN ELIZABETH, with BARHAM, FORMIDABLE, JERVIS, JANUS, KANDAHAR, NUBIAN, HASTY, HEREWARD, VOYAGER and VENDETTA (Force A) left Alexandria to carry out.M.A.Q.3.

and if time allowed, bombard Maleme.

NAPIER, KELVIN and JACKAL left Alexandria to relieve the destroyers with AJAX.

 63. ISIS, HERO and NIZAM had been un-

- able to land their troops on the south coast of

Crete owing to bad weather. On arrival back in Alexandria, the troops in ISIS and HERO were transferred to ABDIEL, who sailed early - on 26th May with HERO and NIZAM for Suda Bay. In addition to these troops, ABDIEL took about 150 tons of ammunition and stores for the Army.   ,
