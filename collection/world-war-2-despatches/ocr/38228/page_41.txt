SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948

command I should have hked to take his
Division with me to India but in the circum-
stances this was impossible.

69. Description of Route.—The problem now
facing my force cannot be appreciated without
some knowledge of the road conditions between
Ye-U-and Kalewa. -This road was nothing more
than a sandy track running from Ye-U via
Kaduma, Pyingyaing and Thetkegyin to
Shwegyin, eight miles south of Kalewa. It had
been the intention to contmue the road from
Thetkegyin to a point opposite Kalewa but,
owing to the difficulties of the last part of this
route, which required a lot of rock blasting, this
had not been possible and it was the lack of
this last twelve miles of road, over which there
was nothing more than a footpath, which caused
the abandonment of the major portion of the
M.T. and all tanks. The track from Ye-U
passed through innumerable chaungs or nullahs,
some of which were dry and sandy and some
of which were wet. Between Pyingyaing and
Thetkegyin there was a difficult hill section with
many rickety bridges constructed only of brush-
wood or bamboo. Anyone seeurig this ‘track for
the first time would find it difficult to umagine
how a fully mechanised force could possibly
move over it. The casualties to M.T. were
heavy and the difficulties were much accen-
tuated by the need to return empty lorries from
Shwegyin in order to ferry back more’ troops
and wounded. As the operations. progressed,
the road was organised into sections'for two-way
and one-way traffic and the work of the Field
Engineering units very much improved condi-
tions in the later stages of the withdrawal to
Shwegyin.

70. From Shwegyin all troops, motor vehicles
and guns had to be transported to Kalewa by
steamer. There were six steamers, the capacity
of each being 600 to 700 men but only two
lorries and two Jeeps. A special flat had to be
constructed for taking vehicles, but owing to
difficulties of embarkation from the beach at
Shwegyin, full use could not ibe made of this
method of transport. As a result of the low
vehicle capacity of the ships, the transport
problem, when units reached Kalewa, was
acute. There was barely enough transport to
carry essential unit equipment and ammunition
and to evacuate the wounded. Fortunately the
establishment of a system of staging camps
stocked with supplies eliminated the necessity
for units to carry rations. The track to a point
opposite Kalewa was quite passable for infantry
and pack animals and, in the early stages of
the withdrawal, all refugees moved by this
route, crossing the Chindwin to Kalewa in
country boats.

71. As will have been seen from previous
paragraphs, the withdrawal to Kalewa was
forced on me before the stocking of the Ye-U
road was finished. Nevertheless, the heroic
efforts of the Administrative Staff and the
drastic action which was taken to make trans-
port available, enabled the distribution of stocks
to be completed after- the withdrawal had
commenced, Supplies were back-loaded to the
fullest possible extent and, although the force

was placed on half rations on the 4th May, -

there was never any real shortage of supplies.

72. The road northwards from Kalemyo to
Tamu was no more than a dirt track through
the jungle and once the rains sét in, which

might take place at any time about the 15th
May, this track would become impassable to
M.T. <I felt, therefore, that my operations
were now as much a race with the weather as
with the Japanese and as much a fight against
nature as against the enemy.,

Nevertheless, I had other problems to con-
side: -THere was a large number of refugees
on the road west of Ye-U and I was not pre-
pared to abandon them either to the enemy or
to possible molestation by the local population.
There was also the problem of clearing from
Shwegyin a large number of Army Troops and
followers before the fighting formations, and I
therefore ordered the Commander x Burcorps
to delay at this stage the withdrawal of his
rear guard Fortunately, the enemy did not
follow up closely on the road from Ye-U and,
following a brush between the 7 Armoured
Brigade and some enemy tanks north of
Budalin on the 5th May, there was no further
contact for some days.

73. On the 4th May, Commander 1 Burcorps
proposed to withdraw one infantry brigade by
the route Pyingyaing- pindaw:Fantha for the
protection of his left flank.

As this would reduce the ditopng problem at
Shwegyin I agreed to the proposal and arranged
for necessary supplies to be moved by steamer
to Pantha.

A few days later, Commander 1 Burcorps
also arranged that when the 48 Infantry-
Brigade, forming the rear guard, reached.
Shwegyin it would proceed thence by steamer
to Sittaung. This plan eased the transport
problem on the road from Kalewa to Tamu.

74. The Fight at Shwegysm. The threat of
enemy air attack on river craft reduced the
capacity of the steamer service between
Shwegyin and Kalewa during the hours of day-
light. The crews were nervous and guards were
placed on all ships to prevent any attempt at
voluntary evacuation. Fortunately, however,-
the steamer service was singularly free from air
attack. Except for bombing raids on the boom
on the 5th May, and at Shwegyin on the
evening of 7th May, no air attacks of any-
importance took place

On the morning of the roth May an enemy
force of approximately one battalion with
mortars, attacked the covering force at
Shwegyim. lt subsequently transpired that
this force had moved upstream in landing craft
as soon as the detachment at Maukkadaw had
withdrawn and had landed at Kywe just south
of Shwegyin. There was fighting all day but,
in spite of this, embarkation continued. During
the late afternoon, the rear guard, the 48
Infantry Brigade, counter attacked, driving off
the Japanese. Contact was then lost. Com-
mander 1 Burcorps now decided that ferrying
by steamer from Shwegyin was no longer prac-
ticable. There rémained in Shwegyin at this’
time: — .
