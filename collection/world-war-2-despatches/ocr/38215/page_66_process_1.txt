in the foreseeable future. A working target was subsequently approved by the War Office.

48. Further Re-inforcements. On the 15th August 1941, the second contingent of the Austrahan Impenal Force arrived in Malaya. It consisted of the 27 Australian Infaniry Brigade with attached troops. As the commander of this Brigade had been prevented on medical grounds from accompanying it, Lt.- Col, Maxwell was, on the recommendation of the Commander, AI.F., appointed by the Australian authorities to command it. The Brigade Group had had the advantage of a period of training in Australia but had had no experience of bush warfare. It was accommodated temporarily on Singapore Island pending the completion of hutted accommodation in West Johore and Malacca,

In September the 28 Indian Infantry Brigade disembarked at Port Swettenham. It was composed of three Gurkha battalions which, hke other Indian units, had lost a large proportion of their leaders and trained personnel under the expansion scheme. It joined the 3 Indian Corps and was accommodated in the Ipoh area, being earmarked for operations under 11 Indian Division.

In November-December 1941 two field regiments and one anti-tank regiment arrived from the U.K. and one field regiment and one recon-

naissance regiment (3 Cavalry) from India.

These were all placed under orders of 3 Indian Corps. The artillery regiments consisted of excellent material but were lacking in experience and had had no training in bush warfare. The Indian reconnaissance unit had only recently been mechanised and arrived without its armoured vehicles. It was so untrained that drivers had to be borrowed for some of the trucks which were issued to it.

49. Re-adjustment of the Defence Plan. On arrival of the 2nd Contingent of the A.I.F. I decided to make certain alterations in the Plan of Defence. responsibility for Johore and Malacca and brought into Command Reserve for operational purposes the 12 Indian Brigade Group, leaving it under the Commander Singapore Fortress for training and administration. My reasons for this step were as under:

(a) 1 considered the dual task amposed upon the Commander Singapore Fortress of defending both Singapore Fortress and East Johore to be unsound as he might well be attacked simultaneously in both areas. Similarly some of the Fortress troops had alternative roles in the two areas.

(b) I was anxious to give the 22 Australian Brigade Group, which had now had six months training in Malaya, a r le which involved responsibility.

(c) There was a greater probability under

the new arrangement that the A.I.F. would be able to operate as a formation under its own commanders instead of being split up.

The advantages of this need no explanation.

In this connection I had enquired on taking over command whether there were any special instructions with regard to the

status and the handling of the AIF. I

had been informed that there were none. The responsibility for the defence of Johore and Malacca passed to the Commander _ A.LF, at 1200 hrs. onthe 2gth August, 1941.

1 ordered the A.I.F. to take over

In September the Kelantan garrison was strengthened by the addition of the infantry battalion which ,had previously been held in 3 Corps Reserve, an Indian State Forces battalion from the South for aerodrome defence, and some supporting units.

50. Dispositions on Outbreak of War with jJapan. As a result of the above changes the disposition of troops in the Malaya Command (Lt.-Gen. A. E. Percival) on the outbreak of war with Japan was as under:
