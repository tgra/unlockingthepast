Tue following note was addressed to the Japanese Charg  d Affaires on the 8th December:   . .

Sir, .

On the evening of the 7th December His  Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom learnt that Japanese forces, without previous warming either in the form of a-declaration of war or of an ultimatum with  a conditional declaration of war, had attempted a landing on the coast of Malaya and bombed Singapore and Hong Kong.

2. In view of these wanton acts of unprovoked aggression, committed in flagrant violation of international law, and particularly of Article 1 of the Third Hague Convention, relative to the opening of hostilities, to which both japan and the United Kingdom are parties, His Majesty's Ambassador at Tokyo has been instructed to inform the Imperial Japanese Government in the name of His Majesty's Government in the Uriited Kingdom that a state of war exists between the two  countries.

T have, &c. WINSTON CHURCHILL. Mr. Shinichi Kamimura, : &c., &e., &., Japanese Charg  d  Affaires.
