            "description": "35. The position early on 15th August was as follows. Observation Hill, which was vital to the defence of the whole position, was dominated by artillery from Round Hill at Many of the defences had been destroyed; and the garrison, which had gallantly resisted for four days, was becoming tired. Attempts to dislodge the enemy from the Mirgo Pass and from the low ground south of Castle Hill had failed. There was also a threat from the enemy detachment advancing along the coast road from Zeilah, though this advance, which had been shelled by the Navy from the sea and bombed by the R.A.F., was not being pressed with any great energy. Enemy air attacks on troops and transport in the open had been constant. They were not very dangerous but had a considerable nuisance effect. In these circumstances General Godwin Austen came to the conclusion that a retreat on Berbera and evacuation was the only course to save the force from a dangerous defeat and possible annihilation. He accordingly telegraphed G.H.Q., Middle East, giving the two aliernatives, immediate evacuation or continuation of the action with probable loss of a very large proportion of the force.",

Black Hill was not directly attacked but the enemy infiltrated round this position and endeavoured to dig in a pack battery in a position behind the post. They were dispersed by gun fire and then shelled Black Hill heavily. Castle Hill was also shelled. The brunt of the enemy's effort was, however, made on Observation Hill which was subjected to a very heavy bombardment for two hours. This was followed by a fierce infantry attack at 1700 hours, under which the garrison at last gave way. I regret that the 3-pdr. gun of H.M.A.S. Hobart was here lost together with the detachment. Their presence and conduct had been of the utmost value to the morale of the garrison.",

By this measure, which came into effect on 15th August, 1942, the control of the general administration of the ports, depots and communications behind the Tenth Army was vested in a senior Staff Officer of General Headquarters Mideast, designated the Inspector General of Communications (1.G.C.); while there was created an area Command, known as Pibase, to deal with the internal security and local administration of the Base and Lines of Communication area. At the same time the zone of responsibility of the Commander Tenth Army was to have been further reduced by transferring Northern Iraq from the Tenth to the Ninth Army.",

I selected as my Chief of General Staff Lieut.-General McCreery who had been my GSO 1 when I commanded r Division -at Aldershot and in France in 1939 and 1940. His scientific grasp of the whole sphere of military matters made him of the greatest assistance to me throughout my period of command in Africa. My,General Headquarters continued to be located in Cairo, but I established an advanced Tactical Headquarters at Burg el Arab,{ adjoining the Headquarters of  the Eighth Army. My predecessor had, as a temporary measure, assumed personal command of Eighth Army but it was intended that he should be succeeded in that capacity by Lieut.-General Gott, previously General Officer Commanding 13 Corps. Before he could assume command the aircraft in which he was flying to Cairo was shot down by enemy fighters over its airfield  and he was killed by machine-gun fire on the ground while assisting the rescue of the other occupants. General Gott had been in every battle in the desert since the beginning; he had commanded 7 Support Group in the first campaign, 7 Armoured Division in 194% and 13 Corps since February, 1942. It was particularly tragic that, having survived the early days of triumph and disaster when skill and endurance alone could be thrown into the balance against the inadequacy of our resources he should now be robbed of the chance of the high command he had so well deserved at a",

It is a thickly inhabited narrow strip, confined between the mountains and the coast, and the cultivation, especially the walls of the vineyards and olive groves, makes it excellent defensive terrain. 5 and 50 Divisions could make only slow progress, although the enemy had by now decided to evacuate and was seeking only to impose the maximum delay. Thanks to the difficulties of the terrain which I have already mentioned, he was able to extricate a high proportion of his troops, though not, of course, their heavy equipment. The Messina area was very heavily defended; anti-aircraft fire, for instance, was described by our pilots as worse than over the Ruhr. General Montgomery was anxious to bring a Corps into reserve to prepare for the invasion of Italy and on 13th August he pulled out 5 Division and 13 Corps Headquarters to join the Canadian Division in preparation for the new assault, 50 and 51 Divisions continued the pursuit. An attempted landing in rear of the enemy on the night of 15th August, in the style of those carried out on the north coast, was very nearly successful but the enemy were retreating too fast for any to be cut off.",

            "description": "It will be noted that no decision had been taken, at the time this directive was issued, whether ANVIL should be mounted or not; on the other hand the forces to be provided for it from Italy had now risen to seven divisions. This uncertainty was a very great handicap to our planning, and its psychological effect on the troops expecting to be withdrawn, especially on the French, was undoubtedly serious. It is hard to expect troops to give of their best when they are continuously  ' looking over their shoulder   to a new objective, particularly when it is so attractive an objective as the liberation of their own country. This situation lasted throughout June. On the 14th I was instructed that VI Corps Headquarters was to be withdrawn at once, 3 Division on 17th June and the 36th on 27th June. On the 24th a French division was to be withdrawn to the Naples area, followed by a second in the first week of July. On the same day  the Combined Chiefs of Staff signalled   the destruction of the German armed forces in Italy, south of the Pisa-Rimini line, must be completed. There should be no withdrawal from the battle of any Allied forces that are necessary for this purpose  . Nevertheless I was informed on the 16th that, in order to preserve the possibility of mounting ANVIL, it was necessary to proceed with the programme of withdrawal of forces already laid down. We could still hope that we might get these troops back again later but this became more unlikely after it was known that General Eisenhower had strongly recommended the operation in a signal of 23rd June. The final decision in its favour was communicated to me on 5th July. ANVIL* was eventually launched on 15th August.",

After some ugly bickering between Roatta and Jodl over the question of German troops being used for the   protection  of the Brenner route the two p for the defence of the country were produced. The Italians wished for twelve German divisions of which nine were to be in Southern and Central Italy, one in Corsica, and only two in Northern Italy and Liguria; this figure excluded the four divisions from Sicily. This plan might reasonably cepa ii is - a i re desire to ve the defence of the whole pensinsula provided for; but after the capitulation it was Late by Hitler as the basis of a charge that Badoglio had schemed to draw the German forces far down into Italy, as far as possible from their bases, and dispersed in small groups which could be easily dealt with by the Italian troops in the same areas. The German plan for the disposition of their sixteen divisions (ie. including the four from Sicily) put eight in Northern Italy under Rommel, two near Rome and six in Southern Italy; the latter two forces were to be under Kesselring. This plan was the one adopted in the event. Proposals for the employment of Kesselring's forces, as reported to us by General Castellano, were still fluid and would be based on the Germans  own strength when the invasion came and their appreciation of the Allies  strength. In principle they intended to defend the line of the Apennines from Massa Carrara to Pesaro, the later   Gothic   line, though if the Allies were to attack this in great strength they would withdraw to the Po. If, however, the Allies showed little strength the Germans would attempt to hold a line from Grosseto, through Monte Amiata to Perugia and thence to Ancona.j Finally, if the circumstances and relative strengths were particularly favourable, an attempt would be made to stand south of Rome on the line Gaeta, Isernia, Vasto. This was a line which the Italians had already surveyed, and defences were already being prepared at certain points.} There is no need to detail the various stages of the German reinforcement of Italy and I will pass on to the situation as it presented itself on 3rd September.  For the immediate purpose dispositions in South Italy are the most important, and they were the best known at the time. Four divisions had been evacuated from Sicily; of these 29 Panzer Grenadier Division remained in Calabria, 15 Panzer Grenadier and Hermann Goering Divisions moved to the Naples area to refit and 1 Parachute Division, less certain elements, moved to Altamura in Apulia. In addition to these there were two newly formed armoured divisions south of Naples: 26 Panzer Division|| in Calabria, based on the isthmus of Catanzaro and 16 Panzer Division covering the Gulf of Salerno. * The minutes of the meeting were found among the -+ This was, roughly, the Trasimene line on which ey offered delaying resistance in June 1944 on their withdrawal from Rome to the   Gothic   line. } It tormed the basis for the German   Winter   line",

Morale is irresistibly high as a result of recent successes and the whole forms one closely articulated machine, capable of carrying out assaults and rapid exploitation in the most difficult terrain. Neither the Apennines nor even the Alps should prove a serious obstacle to their enthusiasm and skil! . I proposed, therefore, to give the enemy no breathing space but to continue to press the pursuit up the centre of the peninsula to the line Bibbiena-Florence-Pistoia-Pisa and then over the Apennines; if they were held in force I would mount a full-scale attack on Bologna not later than 15th August. I would then establish a firm base in the area of Bologna and Modena for the development of further operations either westwards into France or north-eastwards into Austria according to the requirements of Allied stategy at that time. At the same time I would secure and protect any airfield areas in the Po valley considered ne for the operation of the Allied Air Forces.

The final decisions as to the manner of the invasion of the Italian mainland in Calabria and at Salerno had been taken and the planning of the operation was in an advanced stage. On the next day we received the news that the political situation had once more undergone a sudden change. On 15th August a General Castellano, of the Italian Commando Supremo,* presented himself at the British Embassy in Madrid; he was travelling under an assumed name as a civil servant and had no written credentials but he claimed to be an accredited representative of Marshal Badoglio and bearer of a message on the latter's behalf. The Marshal stated that when the Allies invaded Italy the Italian Government was- prepared to order the immediate cessation of hostilities against the Allies and to join them forthwith, with all available forces, in the fight against Germany. This was the news we had been awaiting since 25th July, when Mussolini fell. The delay had been caused, not by any reluctance to accept the formula of   unconditional surrender,   but because Badoglio was anxious to establish himself firmly in power and also because this was the first good opportunity which had presented itself to get in touch with the Allies unknown to the Germans. The cover employed was that Castellano was going to Lisbon as one of the party sent to meet the Italian ambassador returning from Chile. However, the date was well chosen since Mr. Churchill and Mr. Roosevelt were at that moment conferring in Quebec, accompanied by the Combined Chiefs of Staff. They were able, therefore, immediately they were notified from Madrid of this new development, to direct General Eisenhower, in a signal received on 17th August, to send two representatives to Lisbon where a further meeting with Castellano had been arranged at the British Embassy. The two emissaries, Generals Smith and Strong, Chief of Staff and Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2,f of Allied Force Headquarters, left on 18th August and returned to Algiers on the zoth.",
