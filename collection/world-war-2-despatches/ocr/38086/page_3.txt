SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 OCTOBER, 10947.

4. We all hoped to get well in undetected and
‘to bluff the enemy for just sufficient time to
achieve our object. We had to realise, however,
that though we might get in unseen and by bluff,
there was no question of doing so on the way
out. For this purpose we hoped that smoke
would help.

5. The accompanying narrative will I hope
show that all ranks and ratings under my orders
endeavoured to their utmost to carry the plan
through.

6. As far as can be ascertained the principal
objective which was allotted to the CAMPBEL-
TOWN and the troops she carried, was entirely
successful. The landing carried out at the Old
Entrance may have been partially successful
but our assault on the Old Mole was repulsed
with heavy loss, and it was not possible to re-
embark the troops we had landed.

NARRATIVE REPORT ON OPERATION ‘‘ CHARIOT ’’.

In accordance with the Operational Orders
for ‘‘ Chariot,’’ the roth A/S Striking Force,
consisting of M.G.B.314 (Headquarters Boat),
M.L.s 192, 262, 267, 268, 156, 177, 270 and
160 constituting the 1st Flotilla, M.L.s 447, 341,
457, 307, 443, 306, 446 and 298 constituting
the 2nd Flotilla, M.T.B. 74, H.M.S. CAMPBEL-
TOWN (Block ship) and H.M.S.s TYNEDALE
and ATHERSTONE (Escorting Destroyers),
sailed from Falmouth at 1400/26/3/42. M.L.s
were sailed in advance so as to form up outside.

2. The Naval Force Commander took passage
in H.M.S. ATHERSTONE with M.G.B. 314
(Flotilla No. O) in tow and left in company with
H.M.S. CAMPBELTOWN towing M.T.B.74
(Flotilla No. 17) and H.M.S. TYNEDALE.

3. The force formed up in Cruising Order
No. 2 off D buoy and proceeded down the
outward track as laid down by the Commander-
in-Chief, Plymouth, at 13 knots. Wind—east
north east force 4* with considerable haze.

"4, At about 0230 on 27th March the haze
cleared and surface visibility was extreme when
dawn broke. At dawn German ensigns were
hoisted in the destroyers, and White Ensigns

‘ hauled down in the ships.

5. At 0700, in position C, course was
altered to 172°, and as we had time in hand
speed was reduced to 8 knots. This, it was
hoped, would reduce our chances of being
spotted from the air. .

6. At 0720, in position 46° 34’ North 05° 41’
West, TYNEDALE reported an object bearing
002° which appeared to be either a submarine
conning tower or a trawler. TYNEDALE was
ordered to investigate and reported a few
minutes later that it was a submarine. It

“appeared to be steering 070°.

At 0736 CAMPBELTOWN was ordered to
take charge of the M.L.s in my absence, and
ATHERSTONE, slipping M.G.B. 314, pro-
ceeded to join TYNEDALE. At 0740, 2
trawlers were sighted to starboard of the sub-
marine. It was my intention to close the
trawlers while TYNEDALE dealt with.the sub-
marine as it appeared probable that the sub-
marine had a rendezvous with the trawlers,
and that we.would be reported by W/T. When

TYNEDALE was about 5 miles from the sub-

. marine the latter fired a recognition signal of

a sort of Very light which ‘burst into 5 or 6
silver stars and spread out in an umbrella
shape. - After this the submarine continued on
the surface, and apparently on the same course:
When TYNEDALE had closed to about 4,000
yards she hoisted the White Ensign and opened
fire. The submarine crash dived. TYNEDALE
subsequently fired a pattern of depth charges.
After the first charge the submarine’s conning
tower broke surface and was immediately
engaged by the short-range weapons of
TYNEDALE. The conning tower was not
visible for more than 20 seconds, but TYNE-
DALE states that one of his charges
exploded within 70 feet of the conning tower.
and that shé was also possibly hit by gunfire.

7. By this time it seemed clear that the
trawlers were merely French fishing trawlers
without any ‘armament. In any case, it
appeared more important to hunt for the sub-
marine with TYNEDALE so I altered towards
the position in which she had last been seen.
Contact was obtained with a good echo in about
the correct position but this faded out at about.
1,000 yards. TYNEDALE’s asdics were then
reported as being out of action and I agreed to
a search around the position of last sighting
the conning tower, but without obtaining any,
echoes that could be contacted. : .

8. At 0920 we broke. off the hunt and pro-
ceeded to regain the force by an indirect route,
steering southwest for 7 miles. Thesky became
covered with low cloud -greatly reducing the
‘prospect of detection from the air. In break-
ing off the hunt for this U-boat I took into
account that within two hours she might sur-
face and make an enemy report. I considered,
however, that the U-boat had not sighted the
M.L.s and that we would simply be reported
as two destroyers steering southwest. I decided
therefore to continue.

g. At 1135 TYNEDALE was ordered to in-
vestigate a trawler which appeared to be coming
across our track from the northward. . This
trawler was boarded by TYNEDALE, the crew °
taken off and the ship sunk. The trawler was
French, flying a French flag superior to a
white iat adler flag and carried a German
fishing licence, . .

to. At about 1200 another trawler was
sighted fine on our starboard bow. This one I
considered my bird; and slipped M.G.B. 314,
ordering her to take off all the crew, all the
papers, charts, etc., that they could find. I
then sank this trawler, which like the other,
was French. The whole crew appeared friendly
and professed to be keen to come to England.
The Captain seemed particularly friendly and
quite a good-sort. He stated, amongst other
things, that they always fished in groups of
three just inside the roo fathom line in about
latitude 47°. The Captain also stated that he-
had swept up some mines, some of which,
exploded, in position 47° 05’ North, 07° 30° ~
West. “It seemed quite clear from these two-
trawlers that none of them carried radio, so
I did not consider it necessary to investigate
any of the large number that were subsequently
seen.

” gz. At 1240 I received Commander-in-Chief,
Plymouth’s signal timed 1111/27 stating that
