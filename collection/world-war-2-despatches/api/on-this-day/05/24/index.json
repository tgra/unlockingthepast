Brigade of the rath (A) Division could concentrate in the Dalle-Soddu area soon and could relieve rrth (A) Division of all ison duties, and protect its rear, This would release the two South African battalions to proceed to Berbera for embarkation, and would free the whole of gand E.A. Brigade for the further advance. In order to enable an advance also to be made on the Addis Abeba-Gimma road, where the enemy were holding a position at Abalti southwest of the Omo, I arranged to transfer the Nigerian Brigade to this front. To do this I relieved the 1st Nigeria Regiment in Addis Abeba by garrison troops and moved up 1/1 K.A.R. which had in the meantime been similarly relieved. As time was all important so",

Owing to the fact that the ship conveying certain of the special combined operations  signal stores from the United Kingdom broke down, many of them did not arrive until the expedition was due to sail. This involved a considerable amount of improvisation. As a consequence none of the special stores were issued until 24th May, one week before the last day on which units could accept delivery, which severely handicapped the training of operators in these new types of equipment. A certain amount of difficulty was also caused by the arrival of battle  batteries in unserviceable condition. Fortunately a second consignment arrived, which eased the situation.",

            "date": "24th May",
            "description": "267. Mine-laying operations were planned as an essential part of the anti-shipping campaign, to be executed concurrently with the more directly offensive anti-shipping strikes programme. Initially, it was planned to lay mines during the hours of darkness in the shipping Janes of Northern Sumatra and Northern Malaya, and 160 Squadron (Liberators Mk.V.) underwent an intensive period of training in long range flying and the technique of minelaying to implement these plans. They commenced these operations on 21st January, 1945 and continued until 24th May a period of 124 days during which 196 sorties were flown. After operational experience had been gained, the mining commitments were increased to include drops in the areas of Sonchkla, Chumborn, Port Swettenham and _ Singapore. Mine-laying operations were discontinued after 24th May, 1945, because the stage was then being finally set for Operation   Zipper , and to have continued mine-laying beyond that date might have had serious repercussions when Allied landings took place on the west coast of Malaya.",
