SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948 1381

368. By the 30th January, owing to the
transfer of units to the N.E.I., the A.O.C. de-
cided to make preparations for establishing of
a rear A.H.Q., in the N.E.I. Air Commodore
Silly was sent to Sumatra as Deputy A.O.C.
in order to select its site and begin its organi-
sation

NARRATIVE—30TH JANUARY UNTIL THE FALL OF
SINGAPORE.

Situation of the Army.

369. It will be remembered that the Army
withdrew into Singapore Island on a’ pro-
gramme to be completed on 31st January. This
was successfully carried out.

Early in February a reinforcing convoy
arrived in Singapore It brought the few re-
maining units of the 18th Division.

370. But the position of the Army, now in-
vested on the Island, was jeopardised by the
presence of four aircraft landing strips which
were being constructed to augment the airfields
of the Island (para. 344). There was real dan-
ger that ‘the Japanese might use them for
establishing airborne troops behind the frontal
defences of the Island in order to accelerate
the reduction of the garrison, a danger which
could only be averted so long as they remained
serviceable, by means of large detachments of
troops who could not be spared for the pur-
pose. On 30th January it was therefore de-
cided to blow them, and also to accelerate the
obstruction of other open spaces.

Reduction of the Fighter Force in Siheapones

371. This action restricted our fighters to
the four main aerodromes of the Island, and
negatived any possibility of their further dis-
persal. These aerodromes were under constant
bombing, and considerable difficulty was being
experienced in maintaining serviceable strips
upon them Further, three of them—Tengah,
Sembawang and Seletar—were sited on the
northern side of the Island and were therefore
sont to be usable for a short time only (para.
360)

372. On the 30th January, therefore, Sir
Archibald Wavell approved A.H.Q. plans to
maintain in Singapore only a fighter strength
of 8 Hurricanes reinforced by the remaining
Buffaloes. It was agreed that the further re-
inforcing Hurricanes now arriving in H.M.S.
“‘ Indomitable ’’ should be based on Sumatra,
and from there not only maintain the strength
at Singapore but also reinforce it as opportunity
permitted.

373. To implement this policy A.H.Q.:—

(a) decided to retain in Singapore for the
maintenance of the Fighter Force—an, Air
Stores Park, a Repair and Salvage Unit and
an Ammunition Park.

(b) formed No. 226 (F) Group with H.Q.
in Palembang and appointed Air Commodore
Vincent the Group Commander. The staff
for this Group H.Q. was to be provided
partly from the reductions now possible in
the Staff of the existing Fighter Group in
Singapore and the remainder from H.Q.
No. 266 (F) Wing, known to be arriving by
sea in the N.E.I.

(c) issued orders for the move to Java of
No. 15r M.U.' less the repair and salvage
party referred to m | para, 358{a).

374. Concurrently with this reduction in
strength, General Wavell approved the A.O.C.’s
propos” that, consequent on the transfer of
the bulk of the strength of the Command to
the N.E.I., he should proceed himself with the
main body of A.H.Q. to ihe N.E.I, whence it
would be possible to control more effectively
the conduct of further air operations. It was
intended to leave in Singapore a small ad-
vanced A.H.Q. to maintain liaison with
H Q.M.C. H Q. No. 224 (F) Group was also to
remain to control fighter operations.

375. A.H Q. was reduced in accordance with
this plan, personnel being despatched to Palem-
bang in Sumatra for attachment to H.Q. No.
225 (B) Group pending the decision about the
site for the rear A.H.Q. which Air Commodore
Silly had been instructed to find.:

376. On 5th February Abdair expressed dis-
approval of the transfer of A.H.Q. to the
N.E.1., being of opinion that A.H Q. should
remain in close contact with the G.O.C.
Malaya, to ensure that future air operations
were planned in relation to the best means for
the defence of Singapore. The A.O.C., after
an exchange of signals with Abdair on the
subject, cancelled the transfer on 6th February.
He decided to remain himself with A.H.Q. in
Singapore, despite another signal he had re-
ceived on 5th February which instructed him
to proceed temporarily to Java when it was
convenient for him to do so: he was badly in
need of a rest. But circumstances moved fast,
and he declined to go until the last of his sub-
ordinates had been evacuated (para. 394).

377. By the 5th February it had become
clear that no suitable site for a Rear H.Q.
existed in Sumatra, and so Air Commodore
Silly was instructed to proceed to Batavia and
take administrative charge there.

_ 378. Not only were personnel and equip-
ment from Singapore now arriving at that port,
but also the ground personnel of the reinforcing
squadrons. It was also anticipated that the
site for a Rear A.H.Q. would best be located
in the Batavia area.

Dislocation at Singapore Docks.

379. There was a scarcity of suitable ship-
ping for conveying equipment, particularly
M.T., to the N.E.I.: a difficulty aggravated
‘because some vessels had to be loaded at their
moorings by means of lighters. Those which
did come alongside, of which there were many,
deserve great credit. Owing to enemy air
bombardment, ships had to be dispersed, which
further delayed loading. Air bombardment
also caused dock labour to disappear; its re-
placement: by Service personnel could not be
‘on a scale adequate to meet requirements. Con-
ditions at the docks became confused as the
scale and intensity of air attack increased.
Plans made for the embarkation of personnel
and stores were disorganised. Units became
spht up and personnel became ‘separated from
their equipment. Much equipment, urgently
required by the Bomber Force in Sumatra,
could not be loaded at all. In some instances,
owing to air attack, ships sailed before being
fully loaded.

Severe losses were inflicted by the Japanese
air attacks on ships en route from. Singapore
