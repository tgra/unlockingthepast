            "description": "55. There was a strong suspicion at this time that the German raiders were using two pro- minent landmarks\u2014the Isle of Dogs and Hyde Park\u2014over which they turned to their various objectives. Two geographical barrages, de- signed to explode over these two points, were, therefore, worked out and were fired for the first time on the night 26th/27th September, 1940. There was no marked improvement in the number of raiders destroyed but the plan had the advantage of controlling the ammu- nition expenditure. ;"

Heavy pressure was kept up till the 27th September, \u2018but, by the endsiof the month, it became apparent that the Germans could no longer face the Bomber wastage which they had sustained, and the operations entered upon their fourth phase, in which a proportion of enemy Fighters themselves acted as Bombers."

A large mock dump was started in the southern sector on 7th October and this too increased at a rate to suggest completion on*5th November. ro Armoured Division used as an intermediate staging area a position right down on the southern flank from where it might be expected to move forward to 13 Corps sector. The westward move to this area was made openly in daylight and when the division moved due north after dusk it was represented in the staging area by the measures I have already described. A wireless network of Io Corps, with all its brigades, was represented as operating in the southern sector up to D-day and from D mirfis 1 onwards occa- sional false messages were sent suggesting a move forward into 13 Corps\u2019 area."

They saw signs of military activity at two points in and adjoining the Speulder Bosch and a third point just south of the neighbouring railway; but there was no proof that this activity had anything to do with rockets. However, on the same day and the two following days six more rockets fell near Norwich and one off the Norfolk coast. In four of these seven cases the information fur- nished by radar suggested or was consistent with firing from the area between Amersfoort and Apeldoorn. Whether our suspicions of the Speulder Bosch were justified or not evidently"
