SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

profitable training in bush warfare conditions.
Some units of the latter were still in the Port
Dickson training area when war with Japan
broke out.

Towards the end of September, the defences
having made good progress, I directed that an
increased proportion of time should be allotted
to training.

55. An exercise with troops arranged by the
Commander 3 Indian Corps to study the prob-
lems of a withdrawal from Kedah southwards
was scheduled to take place early in December,
but had to be cancelled when war appeared
imminent. .

56. During the tenure of office of my pre-
decessor a handbook on bush warfare had been
issued by Headquarters Malaya Command. A
similar manual had been received from India,
while all the War Office training manuals were
available in limited numbers. Directives were
issued to supplement these manuals as neces-
sary.

57. As regards Courses, Schools of Instruc-
tion etc. a balance had to be struck between the
requirements of co-ordinating instruction and
the desirability of leaving officers and N.C.Os.
as far as possible with their umits to lay the
foundations of field training. Accordingly, I
decided as a policy that Command Courses
would be held for those subjects in which tech-
nical knowledge was required, while courses in
other subjects would be held under formation
or unit arrangements. In accordance with this
policy Command Courses were held in Physical
Training, Chemical Warfare, Intelligence and
Camouflage. In addition, there was an Officers
Cadet Training Unit at Singapore where men
from al] parts of the Far East were trained for
commissions.

58. Profiting by the lessons of Crete, a great
deal of attention was paid to the defence of
aerodromes, special exercises being held in
several areas to study this problem.

Exercises were also held to study the move-
ment of troops by M.T. and the handling of
mechanized columns. As in other theatres, a
tendency on the part of the troops to become
road-minded was apparent. The effects of this
were perhaps more serious in Malaya, where
the essence of success is familianty with the
jungle, than elsewhere.

During this period both the Fixed and Anti-
Aircraft Defences of Singapore Fortress reached
a high standard of training.

59. To summarize, the troops in North
Malaya were, for reasons given, less well trained
when war broke out than those in the South.
Had we been allowed a few more months for
training, there 1s reason to suppose that great
progress would have been made. Throughout
the Army there was a serious lack of experi-
enced leaders, the effect of which was accen-
tuated by the inexperience of the troops.

Section VIIJ.—Tue INTELLIGENCE
ORGANISATION.

60. In Malaya were a number of Intelligence
Organizations all of which had an interest in
varying degrees in the local Malayan scene and
in the affairs of other countries in the Far East
which had an influence on it.

In 1941 the Far East Combined Bureau
(F.E.C.B.) was primarily responsible for the
collection and collation of intelligence from the
Far East outside Malaya. This bureau was

1259

located at the Naval Base and was under the
control of the Commander-in-Chief China. It
was staffed by officers of the three Services, the
senior of whom was a naval officer. It held
daily meetings, which were attended by a staff
officer of Headquarters Malaya Command, and
published weekly summaries. It also interested
itself in Malayan matters and demanded the
closest co-operation of the Malayan Civil
organization.

61. At Headquarters Malaya Command there
was an Intelligence Branch of the General Staff,
which dealt with operational intelligence imme-
diately affecting Malaya and British Borneo.
Its establishment was small and much of its
time was taken up with matters affecting the
Press, censorship, distinguished visitors, police
liaison, the map production programme etc.
So heavy were these day to day requirements
that they absorbed much time that would have
been better spent on broader issues more directly
affecting operations. In 1941 I recommended a
considerable increase in the establishment of
the Intelligence Branch but this had not taken
place when war broke out.

62, For Intelligence within Malaya the Ser-
vices were naturally dependent to a great extent
on the Civil Police Intelligence Branch. The
Inspector General of Police was Chairman of
the Defence Security Committee, of which repre-
sentatives of the Services and of the Civil Police
were members. This Committee examined and

-made recommendations upon all matters affect-

ing security in Malaya in whatever form.

63. The constitutional organization of Malaya
necessitated multiple separate Police Forces and
Police Intelligence Services, but the Inspector
General of Police Straits Settlements was also
Civil Security Officer for the whole of Malaya.
Shortly before the outbreak of war the Malayan
Security Service was set up to co-ordinate the
work of the various Police organizations in the
Pemnsula, to establish a central control and uni-
form legislation for aliens, to provide security
control of the northern border and pan-Malayan
direction from a central office in all police civil
security affairs, which covered a very wide
field. Malayan Security was in its infancy but
showed promising results and did much to over-
come the difficulties inherent in the excessively
complicated lay-out of the Peninsula.

64. It must be recorded that Headquarters
Malava Command was not well supplied with
information either as to the intentions of the
Japanese or as to the efficiency of their Fighting
Services. At a Senior Miltary Commanders’
Conference held at my Headquarters as late as
the end of October 1941 to survey the defence
arrangements and to consider the Far East
situation as it affected Malaya at that time, a
representative of the F.E.C.B. painted a very
indecisive picture of the Japanese intentions.
Fhghts of Japanese aircraft over Malayan terr-
tory, orders to their nationals to leave Malaya
and other indications, however, gave us suffi-
cient warning of the coming attack. As regards
the Japanese Fighting Services, it was known
that their troops were intrepid fighters and that
they were experts in Combined Operations, but
their efficiency in night operations, their ability
to overcome difficulties, and the efficiency of
their Air Force had all been underestimated.

65. Information of Thailand’s attitude was
similarly lacking even up to within a few days
