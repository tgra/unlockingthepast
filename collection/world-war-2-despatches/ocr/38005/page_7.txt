SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON

at the head of which lies Djupvik. Her bows
pointed to the eastward, and her torpedo arma-
ment bore across the fiord. She was hidden
from the approaching destroyers.

20. The warning conveyed by the aircraft
was therefore invaluable. The leading destroyers
tured their guns and torpedo armament on
the starboard ‘bow, and before the enemy could
fire more than one salvo, she was heavily
engaged. Two torpedoes, one from BEDOUIN
and one from ESKIMO struck the ship and in
three minutes she was on fire forward and aft.
A report was received, however, that a figure
was seen standing by the torpedo tubes and her
destruction was completed by salvos from
WARSPITE’S main armament. Torpedoes
fired by the enemy but passed clear of our
destroyers. ‘

21. Meanwhile more enemy destroyers had
appeared in Ofot Fiord. In the smoke and
haze the targets were not clear, but at least
four ships were cbserved. The enemy steamed
to and fro across the Fiord bringing guns and
torpedoes to bear and turning as the limit of
the run was reached. Our destroyers, with the
exception of those sweeping, adopted a loose
formation from one to three miles ahead of
WARSPITE altering course as necessary to
bring armament to bear and avoid shell fire.
From this point Force ‘‘ B ’’ advanced up Ofot
Fiord at a mean speed of ro knots.

2z. At 1318 WARSPITE’S aircraft sighted
five torpedo tracks approaching from ahead.
These passed clear to port and subsequently
an explosion was observed at the water’s edge
on the port beam.

23. WARSPITE’S main armament engaged
the enemy when a target presented itself. But
owing to the smoke of the destroyer engagement
fire was jntermittent. Speed was adjusted to
taaintain support of the destroyers but to keep
WARSPITE clear of the torpedo danger as far
as possible,

24. At 1341 FURIOUS’S aircraft were sighted
on the port quarter approaching to the attack.

25. A further torpedo exploded on the fore-
shore bearing Red 20°.*

26. At 1345 sweeping destroyers hauled their
sweeps and subsequently proceeded in support
of the Destroyers of the Striking Force.

27. At 1350 COSSACK reported yet another
torpedo approaching. WARSPITE was
manoeuvred to present the smallest target but
the track was not seen.

28. At 1352 WARSPITE’S aircraft reported
no destroyers in Skjomen Fiord.

29. Meanwhile the engagement with the
enemy manoeuvring to the North of Narvik
_ had become closer and another destroyer was
seen leaving the harbour distant 12,000 yards
from WARSPITE. She was engaged by
destroyers on the starboard wing and by WAR-
SPITE’S main armament and was soon severely
damaged, The enemy’s fire was becoming
ae and shots were falling round WAR-

30. Gunfire was then observed in Narvik
Harbour and was thought to be from a shore
battery. At 1402 I ordered the destroyers to
engage enemy destroyers while WARSPITE
engaged the shore battery.

31. At 1417 PUNJABI passed WARSPITE
withdrawing from the action owing to hits which
had put the main steam pipe and all guns
temporarily out of action.

32. At the same time a heavy explosion shook
WARSPITE: the cause was not ascertained.

33. At 1421 WARSPITE ceased fire on the
target in Narvik Bay owing to our own
destroyers fouling the range. This target had
proved to be a destroyer alongside the quay
and not a shore battery.

34. The situation then developed as follows : —

One enemy destroyer badly on fire, ran
ashore at Herjangen (68° 33’ North 17° 333’
East) and was struck by a torpedo from
ESKIMO.

The destroyer, which had just left Narvik
Harbour, broke out in flames forward and
aft, and was abandoned by her crew close
to the shore northwest of Narvik.

An unknown number of destroyers retired
up Rombaks Fiord, under cover of smoke
from funnels and floats and were followed b
ESKIMO, FORESTER, HERO, ICARU!
and later BEDOUIN.

The destroyer alongside in Narvik Harbour
continued to fire. COSSACK and FOX-
HOUND entered the harbour supported by
KIMBERLEY, and under their combined
attack the enemy caught fire. FOXHOUND
approached to board but was received with
Machine gun fire from the shore. Then the
destroyer blew up and resistance in.the har-
bour ceased.

While carrying out this attack COSSACK
drifted on to a submerged wreck.

35. Until defensive action in Narvik ceased
WARSPITE lay off the entrance and at 1450
I signalled to the Commander-in-Chief :—

‘ Three enemy destroyers still up Rombaks
Fiord. No enemy opposition in Narvik Bay.
Four enemy destroyers destroyed. Am
investigating possibility of occupying the
‘own.”’

36. At 1500 I proceeded up Rombaks Fiord
to clear up the situation there. Two enemy
destroyers were reported at the head of the
Fiord by the aircraft and ESKIMO was leading
five destroyers to the attack,

ESKIMO passed through the narrow neck
in Rombaks Fiord followed closely by
FORESTER and HERO and engaged two
enemy ships in sight. The enemy replied with
gun and torpedo fire and at 1450 ESKIMO was
struck by a torpedo which removed the bow
of the ship. Of the two enemy ships, one,
after firing torpedoes, ran aground at Sildvika
where she was destroyed by gunfire and aban-
doned, The other retired under cover of smoke
to the top of the fiord.

37. Difficulty was then experienced owing to
the congestion in the narrow neck of this fiord.
ESKIMO was trying to get clear stern first
assisted by FORESTER, the remaining
destroyers were endeavouring to enter and con-
tinue the chase.

38. At 1520 I ordered all available destroyers
to concentrate in Rombaks Fiord.

At 1530 a report on the situation was received
from BEDOUIN as follows: —

‘© One aground out of action (this was at

Sildvika). Two more round the corner out
