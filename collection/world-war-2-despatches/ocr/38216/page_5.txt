SUPPLEMENT to Taz LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1048

2g. Dispersal areas and splinter-proof pens at
aerodromes in Malaya wete arranged on what
was then thought to be an adequate scale based
on:—

. (@) The scale of attack in accordance with
the information then available about the
Japanese Air Services,

(6) The ultimate scale of A.A. defences to
be provided at each aerodrome. ~*

(c) The development of a fighter defensive
system.
By the rst December, 1941, however, neither

time nor resources had permitted satisfactory

development of the fighter system, and few anti-
aircraft weapons were available. The Com-
mander-in-Chief, Far East, had laid down that
each aerodrome was to be protected by eight
heavy and eight light A.A. guns. At no aero-
drome in Malaya was this scale approached; on
the outbreak ‘of war, some aerodromes had no
A.A. guns at all (for details see Appendix A,
Column 5 (d)).

30. Each base was provided with a supply of
road metalling and labour for the repair of aero-
drome surfaces in the event of damage by
enemy attack.. The reason for mentioning this
apparéntly trivial point will become clear later.

Ancillary Construction

31. In addition to aerodromes the following
important, works were either completed or in
hand on.the ist December, IQ4I:— ~*~
~ @ Combined * Army / Air “Operations

‘ Room: This was completed and occupied by

“HO. R.A.F. Far East Command (A.H.Q.)

and H.Q. Malaya Command (H Q.M.C.) at

Sime Road, Singapore.

(5) Alternative- . Combined Army/ Air
Operations Room: Provided because of the
above-ground vulnerable position of the main
Combined Operations Room.

(c) Fighter Control H.Q. in Singapore:

’ This was ready for occupationi® It had an
- operations room, a filter room, a W.T.

- station, etc.

'  (d@) AM.E. Stations: The ultimate in-
‘tention was to. have 20- Radar ‘Stations
throughout’Malaya. Six stations only, all in
the vicinity of Singapore Island, were com-
pleted -by-the rst December, r941.

“_(e) Radio Installation and Maintenance

Unit: -This . was- partially completed at
-*Ponggol, Singaporé) « .

(f) Ammunition Park: Comristniction at
Batak Quarry, Singapore; it was occupied
_ although extensions were in Progress.

(g) Storage of Petrol: ~ =a tales

-.@):Reserve stotage . accommodation i
6. 500 tons of aviation petrol was under
construction at Woodlands North, Singa-
pore. .

(ii) Reserve storage. sceomranaattan for
7,500° tons of aviation petrol at Port
Dickson was more than 50 per cent. com-
plete.

(aii) Réserve storage accommodation for
- 930 tons at Kuantan was completed.

(A) ‘Universal “ : Holdin Unit: -
completed’ and was ‘occupied by 152 M.U.
_at Bukit Panjang, Singapore; extensions were
“in progress. This reduced the congestion and
“concentration of storés held at Seletar.

a

\This was.

‘I35L

() Engine Repair Depot and Universal
Holding Unit: This depot was completed at
Kuala Lumpur, provided with its own_rail-

+. way siding and occupied by No. 153 M.U.

It was designed to service squadrons based
in North Malaya and so to reduce further the
congestion and concentration which had
hitherto persisted at Seletar.

Allied Reinforcement Arrangements

U.S.A. Reinforcements from the Philippines

32. The actual number of aircraft that might
be expected in Malaya, should the evacuation
of the Philippines occur, was of necessity in-
definite; so was the amount of equipment
peculiar to the U.S. Naval and Army Air
Services which might accompany them.

33. Reconnaissances were .carried out and
dispersed moorings planned for a total of 20
reinforcing Catalinas of the United States Naval
Air Service. A provisional plan for maintain-
ing them was also prepared.

-34. The Commander-in-Chief ruled, in
September, 1941, that four bases were to be
prepared for accommodating B.17’s of the
United States Army Air Corps; two in the North
and two in the South of Malaya. Gong Kedah
and Butterworth m the North, Tebrau and
Yong Peng in the South, were selected Ex-
tensions of the runways to 2,000 yards at each
were put in hand but only those at Gong Kedah
were completed by the time war came.

Dutch Retmforcements from N.E.1.

35. In the mutual reinforcement programme
arranged with the Dutch Army Air Servite, -it
was assumed that:—

(a) Three Bomber Squadrons (27 Glenn

Martins would-be based at Sembawang:

(b) One Dutch Fighter Squadron (9

‘Buffaloes) would be based at Kallong:
and plans were made accordingly.

36. Thé Dutch Squadron and Flight Com-
manders concerned visited these stations, toured
Malaya and wefe* given a short course in R.A. F,
operational methods. Appropriate stocks of
Dutch bombs Were procuréd. =~

-37. The Dutch Naval Air Service had been
allotted, in the initial seaward reconnaissance
plan, responsibility for the area Kuantan-Great
Natunas-Kuching (B. Borneo). To execute
this task, it faa to base a Group (3 Catalinas)
of Flying Boats at Seletar. Provision was made
for this; and stocks of petrol and moorings were
alsé laid down at: Kuantan... The Group re-
mained. under Dutch operational command.

38. Liaison Officers of the Dutch Army Air
Service and the Royal Air Force were ier
chahged and were attached to A.H.Q.
Sifgapore.and at Diitch’ Army Air H.Q. in jsve
respectively. ‘:

“39. In July, 1941, a memotandum was circu- -
lated outlining the role of squadrons in war,
and training syllabi were wssued: Strict super-
vision was imposed to en§ure that fhe fullest
training value was obtained in all exercises and
that. the maximum number of’ practices of
different kinds was arranged whenever a, train-
