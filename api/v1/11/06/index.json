Contingent. 7._In response to an urgent appeal for help, the British Government decided to send a contingent of the Royal Air Force to Greece from the Middle East. The force decided upon was to consist of two medium bomber squadrons, one mixed medium bomber and two-seater fighter squadron\u2014all armed with Blenheim aircraft, and two single-seater fighter squadrons armed with Gladiator aircraft.
