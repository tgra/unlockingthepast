SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 1948

affects the building up of reserves for an offen-
sive. We are nearer our bases. Our limitation
is the rate that men and material can reach
Egypt from overseas. His limitation is the
rate at which it can reach his troops when it
arrivés. This indicates the necessity of block-
ing Tobruk and Matruh and attacking his road
and rail. transport and his shipping.

10. Political Factors—Hardly enter into this
appreciation, except inasmuch as pressure may
be put on the Axis command to press on to
Egypt before their army is ready or has suffi-
cient margin of force. Our danger lies in a
politically unstable Egypt in our rear. So far
this danger has not developed. ‘

11. The Russian Front.—The operations of
Eighth Army are linked to the fate of Russia.
Should the Axis penetrate the Caucasus, Eighth
Army might be reduced to the lowest margin
to provide reinforcements for the new front.
Moreover a considerable Axis success in Rus-
sid would release air and land forces and equip-
ment for the reinforcement of the Western
Desert.

12, Maintenance.—The enemy is experienc-
ing great difficulty in maintaining his present
forces at El Alamein. This condition may im-
prove gradually when more heavy transport
vehicles come from Italy. It is not likely to
improve so much that he can maintain an
appreciably larger force than that envisaged
in Appendix A*. Our maintenance presents no
real difficulties, except that our stocks of
25-pounder shells are not inexhaustible, and
we could certainly maintain forces of double
the present size of Eighth Army in this area if
they existed:

Courses open to ourselves and the enemy.

13. Ourselves.—A. To continue to attack the
enemy in the hope that he will crack before
his army is reinforced by fresh troops. The
pros and cons of attacking are:—

_ In the northern and central sectors we

have made two attempts to break the enemy’s

front without success. Failure has been due

to lack of trained troops, rigidity of organisa-’

tion and limited resources in armour and
infantry and it seems that the enemy’s posi-
tions are now too strongly held to be
attacked with success with the resources
available. .

We ‘have also attacked in the-southern
sector, but weakly and largely as a diver-
sion. Our attack failed, but the enemy
though strongly posted is not numerous here,
and this front might go if suddenly attacked.
Tf it did go, it offers access for our mobile
troops to the enemy’s flanks and rear.

The problems of attack on this front are,
firstly, how to find the supporting fire -with-

out unduly weakening the northern and cen--

tral sectors. Secondly, how to find the
troops. The only formation which might be
used is the-weak N.Z, Division supported
by its own artillery, the artillery of -7th
Armoured Division and some of 5th Indian
Division’s artillery. This would have to be
“deployed in secret and developed as a com-
plete surprise. Failure would probably make
-.the N.Z. Division -unfit for further opera-
tions for a considerable time. Having in
mind the weakness in numbers and training
co *. Not reproduced.

397
of this division the chances of success can
only be rated as 60—40. Failure would seri-
ously deplete our present resources. On the
whole this attack hardly seems advisable
at present.

B. To adopt the tactical defensive until we
are strong enough to attack, which, unless the
enemy’s position deteriorates, will, not be till
mid-September at the earliest. The obvious
objection is that we give the initiative to the
enemy if he is able to use it. It is very doubt-
ful if he will be able to take the initiative till
late in August with any hope of success. In
fact if he attacks before, provided we have a
reserve in hand including up to roo Grant
tanks, we have a good chance of defeating
him seriously in the area El Alamein—Ham-
mam. Moreover the critical period for the
preparation and manning of the Delta and
Cairo defences is now over. - There is little
danger of the enemy getting any value out of
by-passing the Eighth Army on its present
ground. There may be a critical period late
in August before the new divisions (two of
armour, two of infantry) are ready, but this
might ibe tided over by preparing their artillery
battle groups in advance of the rest of the
divisions and so reinforcing Eighth Army.
(This project requires further examination.)
This defensive could also be mitigated by
enterprises against Siwa and the southern sector
of his front and by seaborne attacks.

14. Courses open to the enemy.—The enemy
must resume the offensive without delay, but
he is unlikely to be able to do so before mid-
August and even then no real margin of
superiority except in A.F.Vs. is apparent. He
will certainly try to attack before the end of
August and as Eighth Army defences gain in
strength and depth he will be more than ever
tempted to avoid them and seek success in
manceuvre. This may well land him into
serious difficulties in the soft desert.

Alternatively, he may have to adopt the
strategical defensive because our forces are too
strong and too well placed for attack. If he
does, he may either stand his ground or with-
draw to an intermediate position covering
Matruh, which will eventually be to our advan-
tage for he will still be in striking distance when
we are again fit to attack. If he goes back to
the Egyptian frontier, it is questionable whether
he should not be left undisturbed.

15. Course recommended.Seeing that we
are hardly fit at present to do any more attacks,
our best course is the defensive combined with
offensive gestures from time to time, including
raiding. The cover plan should be such as
would induce the enemy to strike prematurely,
i.e., mid-August, say, between roth and 2oth
August. Meanwhile the Army front should be
strengthened, and so held that at least one
formation could come into reserve and train.
At the same time the command of Eighth Army
should be put on a permanent footing.
