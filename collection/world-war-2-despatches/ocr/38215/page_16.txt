of war. It is difficult to say whether the Thai
officers "who came on official visits to Malaya
‘were sent with the intention of misleading us or
not, but there can be no doubt that there was
at least an advanced degree of co-operation be-
tween some of the most responsible authorities
in Thailand and the Japanese, and that the pre-
parations made in South Thailand by the
Japanese for ther landing there and for their
attack on Malaya were made with the conniv-
ance, if not with the actual assistance, of those
Thai authorities.

Section IX.—ADMINISTRATION.

66. The scale of reserve ‘stocks to be held
in Malaya was based on the “‘ Period before
Relief ’’ which, as has been stated, stood in
1941 at 180 days. Initially these reserve stocks
had been held entirely on Singapore Island,
where special bomb-proof magazines had been
constructed for the ammunition. With the in-
crease in the garrison, however, and the exten-
sion of the defence to cover the whole of
Malaya new problems were presented. These
problems were akin to those connected with
the defence of the United Kingdom in 1940 i.e.
the base at Singapore, except that it was more
heavily defended, was equally as exposed to
attack as were the more forward areas else-
where in Malaya. It was therefore necessary
to distribute some of the reserve stocks through-
out the country instead of holding them all in
one area. In this way transportation problems
would during active operations be reduced and
all areas would be to some extent self-contained.
Operation MATADOR was another factor
in the problem. To meet the requirements of
this, should it be put into effect, it was neces-
sary to hold certain reserves well forward. I
therefore decided that the main reserve
stocks should be held on Singapore Island, that
reserves on a scale to be fixed in each case
should be held in the forward areas and that
the balance should be held in advanced depots
in ‘Central Malaya. In accordance with this
policy it was decided: —

(a) That the full 180 days for the garrisons
of Singapore and Penang should be kept in
those islands.

(8) That 60 days for all the troops, except
the Penang garrison, north of Singapore
should be kept in Singapore.
™ (c) That on the west coast 60 days should
be kept north of the Perak River, and on the
east coast go days in Kelantan and 60 days
in Kuantan.

(d) That the balance of the 180 days for
the troops in 3 Indian Corps area should
be kept in the Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh and
Jerantut areas,

In the Singapore Island area a policy of
dispersal was adopted. This was due partly
to the congestion in the Town area where depot
space was difficult to obtain and partly to the
desire to avoid heavy loss from air attack.

The administrative situation at the outset of
hostilities was approximately as under: —

67. Weapons.—Early in ro4r the scale of
armament had been dangerously low. In
particular all Indian formations and units
arrived in Malaya with a very low scale of
weapons. After March, however,’ a steady and
increasing flow came in Malaya, but it was not
until November that formations received the
higher scale of weapons and were issued with

25-pounder guns for the artillery. Even then
many units, ie. Artillery, Signals, R.A.S.C.,
were below establishment in light automatics
and rifles and there were never more than a
few of these weapons in reserve. Requests for
weapons from the Sarawak Rangers, the British
North Borneo Volunteers and other units had
to be refused either in whole or in part, while
the lack of weapons also rendered: the further
expansion of local forces impossible.

68. Ammumtion —It had been difficult to
keep pace with the increase in the ‘‘ Period
before Relief ’’ and the great increase in the
garrison. Nevertheless, when hostilities started,
the situation in most categories was satisfactory
though in some, such as those for Light Anti-
Aircrait and 25-pounders, there were shortages.

69. Petvol.With an almost unlimited
supply in the Netherlands East Indies it had
been possible to build up large reserve stocks.
The Army stocks were held chiefly in large 60-
gallon drums. The Air Force stocks were held
dispersed as in the case of the Army, but the
main Air Force petrol reserve was held in
specially constructed underground tanks at
Woodlands on Singapore Island a little south
of the Causeway.

The Asiatic Petroleum, Company held large
reserve stocks for civil use both on Singapore
Island and at certain places on the west coast.

70. Food.—The food problem was compli-
cated with the Australian ration differing from
the British ration and with the Indian and other
Asiatic troops having their own specialized
rations. Nevertheless, approximately 180 days
reserve stocks of all types had been accumu-
lated before hostilities broke out. Cold storage
accommodation for frozen meat existed at
Singapore and Penang and a few vans were
available for distribution to troops on the main-
land.

Tn order to build up reserves the meat ration
of British troops (though not of the Australian
troops) was reduced in the autumn of r94r and
replaced by other commodities, the full meat
ration not being so necessary in the climate of
Malaya as it is elsewhere.

The food supply for the civil population of
Malaya was a complicated problem. It had
been studied for some years by a sub-committee
of’ the Defence Committee, Malaya, and, on
the outbreak of World War II, a Food Con-
troller was appointed. In peace-time only the
tice-growing areas of Malaya are self-support-
ing. To all other areas, and especially to Singa-
pore Island, rice has to be imported. Malaya
had to import annually from Thailand and
Burma two tons of rice for every ton grown.
The annual consumption was about 900,000
tons, In Singapore and other large cities stocks
for both European and Asiatics were held, while
in each State rice stocks were accumulated
under State arrangements. In addition, a num-
ber of cattle on the hoof were brought from Bali
in the Netherlands East Indies. It is probable
that, when hostilities broke out, a minimum of
180 days reserves were held in the more import-
ant commodities, though in some of the others
the reserves were on a smaller scale.

The question of a rationing scheme had been
under consideration by the Civil Government
for some years but by the summer of 1941 no
result had been achieved. Committees
appointed to examine the problem reported that
the difficulties in producing a rationing scheme
