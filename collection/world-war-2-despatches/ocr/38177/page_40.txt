attack convinced General Schmitt command-
ing the garrison, however, of the futility of
further resistance and early on the 2nd January
the garrison surrendered unconditionally.

Our casualties in this successful operation were
slight and did not exceed 450 all told, of which
the majority belonged to the 2nd South African
Division. In addition to prisoners and material
captured from the enemy, the fall of Bardia
released over 1,100 of our own men, who had
been kept in the fortress as prisoners of war,
in conditions of great privation. Much enemy
ammunition fell into our hands.

Preparations were at once put in hand for
the reduction of Halfaya, and it was hoped
that the fall of Bardia would intensify the lack
of food and water from which the place was
already suffering, if prisoners’ stories were to
be believed. On the r1th January the Trans-
vaal Scottish attacked Sollum and completed
its capture early the next day, with nearly 350
prisoners. On the 13th the South Africans
finally denied to the enemy access to his last
source of water supply, and his surrender be-
came inevitable. Plans were made for the final
attack, in which the 1st Free French Brigade
Group were to take the main part; but early

on the 17th January General de Giorgis, the .

‘commander of the garrison, surrendered un-
conditionally. Some 5,500 prisoners were
taken, of whom 2,000 were Germans. Few
serviceable weapons fell into our hands and
no stores of any value. The prisoners were
exhausted from lack of nourishment.

The Enemy retires to El Agheila. .

In Western Cyrenaica early January was a
period of acute administrative difficulty. The
expenditure of artillery ammunition, except by
troops actually attacked by the enemy, was
limited to twenty-five rounds a a day, in
order to allow reserves to be accumulated for
the projected assault on the enemy holding
Agedabia, which was to be launched when the
Ist Armoured Division arrived. The move of
this division had been delayed owing to the
lack of transport to bring forward petrol, but
it eventually reached Antelat on the 6th
January. On the morning of the 7th our
patrols reported that Agedabia had been
evacuated. F

Columns of the 22nd Guards Brigade
followed up, but were delayed by the mine-
fields round Agedabia and by bad going; and
it was not until the evening of the 8th January
that they came up against the enemy in strong
positions sixteen miles further south. The
enemy withdrew from these positions two days
later, and on the r1th January the Guards
Brigade were in contact with the forward posi-
tions of the enemy’s final line running south-
wards from Marsa Brega.

The country round El Agheila offers one of
the most easily defensible positions in Libya.
A broad belt of salt pans, sand dunes and
innumerable small cliffs stretches southwards
for fifty miles, its southern flank resting on the
Libyan Sand Sea, a vast expanse of shifting
sand. Apart from the main road from Bengasi
to Tripoli only a few tracks cross this in-
hospitable country, so that the thirty-five
thousand enemy now left out of the original
hundred thousand sufficed to hold it. Accord-
ingly Rommel set his infantry to guard the
approaches at Marsa Brega, Bir el Ginn, Bir

es Suera, Bir el Cleibat and Marada, and with-
drew ‘his armoured force to re-equip.

I was as anxious to secure this area as
Rommel was to hold it. Apart from the need
to traverse it to invade Tripolitania, which was
my ultimate intention, I considered it essential
to control this region in order to hold Cyrenaica.
Otherwise, I feared, we should have to retire to
the frontier, if the enemy were, at some later
date, again to become strong enough to launch
an offensive in force.*

Before we could approach the task of throw-
ing the enemy out of E] Agheila, however, we
were obliged to wait for reserves to be accumu-
lated and the administrative situation to im-
prove, so that we might concentrate sufficient
troops for this difficult undertaking. Until
that time came, which I judged would be about
the middle of February, we must content our-
selves with leaving only light forces to watch
the enemy. It seemed highly unlikely that he
would be in a position to attack us before then,
but the Eighth Army and the 13th Corps
issued instructions against this contingency.
On the 21st January the improbable occurred,
and without warning the Axis forces began to
advance.

CONSOLIDATION AT GAZALA.
Dispositions and Plans of the Opposing Forces.

Prior to the a2rst January, the enemy
appeared to have three weak Italian divisions
of the 21st Corps, Pavia, Sabrata and Brescia,
in Agheila itself and to the east of it. The
Trieste, Ariete and Trento Divisions seemed to
be round Maaten Giofer about twenty miles to
the south, watching the gap between the Wadi
el Faregh and the marshes to the west, through
which runs the track from Agheila to Marada.
At Marada itself were thought to be some of
the German goth Light Division, the Burck-
hardt battle group and some Italian troops.
The bulk of the goth Light Division was
probably in the dangerous sector immediately
south of Marsa el Brega on the coast, while
the two Panzer Divisions were believed to be
between the minefields which covered the goth
Light Division’s positions and the north bank
of the Wadi el Faregh. Elements of the goth
Light Division were also thought to be watch-
ree coast west of El Agheila towards Ras el

About the middle of January the enemy’s
strength was estimated at some 17,000 German
and 18,000 Italian troops with about seventy
medium tanks altogether, of which twenty-five
were “German. Another twenty German
medium tanks might be available at short
notice.

It was not thought possible for Rommel to
receive any new German formations for some
time, though the arrival of a fresh Italian
armoured division with some hundred and
forty tanks might be expected within a month
orso. Even the arrival of these reinforcements,
would probably not enable the enemy to take
the offensive, as his supply problem appeared
to be acute. He was expected to stand on the
Agheila—Marada line until forced to withdraw
from it by our pressure, or because of difficulties
of supply. *
