activities. The ‘‘ Operational centre ’’ con-
sisted of a British Officer and four or more
B N.C.Os., who formed the nucleus, and to
which were attached up to 70 selected
Ethiopians. They were well armed, carried
explosives and money, and, when possible,
W/T sets.

Owing to the rapidity of the enemy with-
drawal in the Gojjam, and commitments in con-
nection with the raising of units for the
Emperor’s entry into Addis Abeba, only a few
centres had been formed. The general policy
decided upon, therefore, was for each Division
to direct Patriot activities in their own areas,
a special Staff Officer being attached to each
Division for that purpose, and I arranged with
the Emperor that he would instruct selected
Ethiopian leaders to provide the desired
numbers of Ethiopian soldiery. Officers to lead
the Patriots were found from various sources
as, by experience, it had been’ found that
patriot activities proved most successful under
the general direction, and in some cases,, the
personal leadership, of selected British Officers,
though the men remained under the immediate
control of their own leaders. With the progress
of the campaign, certain patriot leaders dis-
played, more than once, powers of leadership
which may well be employed in the future
Ethiopian army. ye

This policy proved successful in the north
and central Abyssinia, but was not so satis-
factory in the area north of Neghelli and
Tavello owing to the generally disturbed state
of this district, the Amhara-Galla problem, and
the lack of outstanding leaders.

Io. The Patriots proved most successful in
harassing enemy lines of communication and
in besieging isolated enemy garrisons, By
carrying out these tasks, these Ethiopian forces
caused the Italians considerable alarm and
anxiety and lowered their morale. By this
means they contained large numbers of the
enemy away from the main scene of the
operations.

Patriots have also excelled in following up
an enemy withdrawal. This was very evident
in the final phase after the crossing of the
Omo, when Patriot forces operated ahead of
our regular forces. In this respect their
familiarity with, and speed across, country was
used to the best advantage.

It was found that Patriots would fight with
great courage and take great risks in certain
circumstances, especially when following up a
beaten enemy, but, as a rule, they were un-
successful in direct attacks on fortified positions
and disliked such actions. They were apt to be
unreliable and difficult to control at night, and
it was best to leave it to them to conduct such
operations themselves. Finally, it was never
safe to assume that a force of Patriots would
take the field on two consecutive days at the
same strength owing to food difficulties internal
feuds and rivalries.

Administration.

rz. Up to the capture of Addis Abeba the
troops in the northern sector were being main-
tained by road from Berbera, a distance of
550 miles, and in the southern sector from
Mogadiscio. The roads in the south were how-
ever rapidly deteriorating by reason of the
rain, and the bridges at Dolo and Lugh
Ferrandi were precarious on account of floods.
It was therefore decided to maintain the

3579

western portion of the Southera Sector from a
railhead at Nanyuki in Kenya, in spite of the
very long road L of C.

All the roads north from Mogadiscio were in
a very bad way through wash-outs and mud,
but it was still just possible to get a few wheeled
vehicles through from Kenya.

12. In the Northern Sector every effort was
made to get the railway from Diredaua into
action. There were plenty of rolling stock and
engines in Addis Abeba, but with the blowing of
the Auasc Bridge these were cut off from the
Diredaua section. The Auasc Railway Bridge
had been of special girder construction borne on
high piers, the track being 120 ft. above the
water. Its replacement was impossible for a
very long time. Work on a low level diversion
was commenced though it was not expected to
be ready until roth July. Between Addis Abeba
and Diredaua there were no other major demo-
litions on the railway. Six engines had been left
in Diredaua but all had parts taken away or
some other form of demolition carried out on
them. Furthermore the machinery in the well
fitted machine-shops had been treated in the
same way. Nothing daunted, 38 Railway Con-
struction Company set to work, and on 7th
April had the first train running from Diredaua
to the Auasc with roo tons of supplies and
stores. By getting spares from Addis Abeba and
making others, by the end of May they had all
six engines running at Diredaua and were able
to run two trains a day to the Auasc. Here a
road link had to be introduced to transport the
stores to the other side of the river.

13. The disabilities of Berbera as a port were
a cause of constant concern, and it was not
before the end of May that a start could be
made to build up a reserve. Up to that time
the forces in the Northern Sector had been
living hand to mouth. Meanwhile their ration
strength had been steadily increasing, as had
their petrol consumption. The latter had risen
by the end of June to 45,000 gallons a day.

14. By the beginning of July some 30,000
prisoners had been evacuated, a matter of con-
siderable intricacy in view of the slender trans-
portation resources.

This evacuation entailed the formation of four
staging camps between Addis Abeba and Ber-
bera whence they were evacuated by sea to
Mombasa as shipping became available.

In this connection the AOC at Aden ren-
dered great assistance by forming a camp for
2,500 prisoners there. This camp was kept
filled from Berbera and emptied by sea to
Mombasa as shipping became available at Aden.

This enabled the camp at Berbera periodi-
cally to receive additional prisoners and per-
mitted continuous evacuation to take place
from the forward areas.
