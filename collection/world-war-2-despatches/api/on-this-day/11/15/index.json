In the defence of Iraq he was to act throughout in the closest co-operation with the Commander Ninth Army (Palestine and Transjordan).",

The advance was pressed by land, sea and air; Bougie was occupied by 11th November, Bone on 12th November, by a British parachute battalion, and by 18th November our advanced forces were operating east of:Gebel Abiud on the coast road and B ja on the inland road, about sixty miles from Bizerta and Tunis respectively. At both points we were in contact with German troops. These had begun to arrive, in the first place by air, on oth November, meeting no resistance from the French authorities in Tunisia. On 15th November a United States parachute battalion occupied Youks Les Bains and Tebessa, in south-eastern iAlgeria, and co-operated with the French detachments at Gafsa in southern Tunisia. Between 17th November and 25th December two main attempts were made to capture Tunis. The first succeeded in advancing, on 28th November, as far as Djedeida, on the road between Tunis and Bizerta and only twelve miles from the former. At this point the enemy counter-attacked strongly with tanks and dive-bombers; the latter were able to operate from good airfieldss only a short distance in rear and our own air forces were ungble to give cover, since the rain had put all their temporary landing grounds out of action. Our forces on the inland road were therefore obliged to withdraw to Medjez el Bab. This town, as its name   the Ford of the Pass   shows, is of great strategic importance. It lies",

PENN and her force were ordered to remain at immediate readiness and to act on enemy reports, hoping thereby that enemy forces would be committed to a landing and that we would be able to intercept them. Owing to breakdown of W/T in Leros, reports of enemy landing craft, relayed through Alexandria, arrived in H.M.S. PENN too late for action to be taken on them, and the dawn sweep ordered by Commander-in-Chief, Levant produced no enemy sighting. In point of fact, had the Commanding Officer of H.M.S.

In this, operations in Jugoslavia were brought more into the foreground for the major r le in the proposed spring offensive and the question of when to halt the offensive in Italy was more closely studied. Between roth and 23rd October the fiercest fighting on Fifth Army front had left us still short of Bologna, the exhaustion of our troops had increased and the lack of replacements, both British and American, had made itself felt. In this second paper, therefore, it was assumed that we were unlikely to have driven, the enemy back to the line of the Adige by the time that it became necessary to halt the offensive; instead our immediate objectives were limited to the capture of Bologna and Ravenna. The plan proposed was that Eighth Army should continue their offensive with all available forces at least until 15th November in order to capture Ravenna and, to draw off the enemy from Fifth Army. The latter was to go on to the defensive forthwith (this was ordered on 27th October), withdraw forces from the line to rest and prepare them for one more offensive effort and then launch them as secretly as. possible in a final attack on Bologna. If this plan was unsuccessful, then -we should have to accept the best winter position that could be managed; Eighth Army must endeavour, however, to capture Forli and open Route 67 to improve lateral communications between the two Armies. I held a conference at my Headquarters to discuss this plan on 2gth October.

These were originally promised in May, but first shipments were not received till September and October. Indeed fifty per cent. of valves and pumping stations had still not arrived by the 15th November.",

In mid-November, a reorganization of the chain of command took place, which had been planned by General Giffard with the object of freeing the Commander, Fourteenth Army, from the control of operations in Arakan, and from the responsibility of administering the long and difficult lines of communication in Assam. In this way he would be enabled to concentrate his full attention on the coming offensive across the Chindwin River into Central Burma. Accordingly on the 15th November, Lines of Communication Command was formed under Major-General G. W. Symes, with its H.Q. at Comilla. It comprised 202 L. of C. Area (H.Q., Gauhati), consisting of four sub-areas and the Fort Hertz Area, and 404 L. of C. Area of four sub-areas; it included a very great number of Base and L. of C. units. The policy was to be that the rear boundaries of Fourteenth Army and 15 Corps would be adjusted as the progress of operations allowed, in order to free them from rearward responsibilities. On the 16th November, 15 Corps was separated from Fourteenth Army and came direct under my command. I thus had under my command three major formations im contact with the enemy, 15 Corps, Fourteenth Army and Northern Combat Area Command, with the L. of C. Command in the rear up",

Although flying was certain to be intermittent and hazardous, air supply became often the only practicable means, but it was entirely dependent on allweather airfields. Al] administrative planning had to include provision for the continuance of adequate maintenance under monsoon conditions. The absolute importance of completing the construction of all-weather airfields for supply aircraft before the monsoon was therefore obvious.",
