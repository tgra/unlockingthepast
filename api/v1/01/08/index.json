            "description": "Columns of the 22nd Guards Brigade followed up, but were delayed by the mine- fields round Agedabia and by bad going; and it was not until the evening of the 8th January that they came up against the enemy in strong positions sixteen miles further south. The enemy withdrew from these positions two days later, and on the r1th January the Guards Brigade were in contact with the forward posi- tions of the enemy\u2019s final line running south- wards from Marsa Brega."

            "description": ".. The bad weather prevailing at the time of the Greeks\u2019 capture of Kelcyre on the 8th January prevented our aircraft from operating in close support of their troops during their advance; in fact, until the middle of February opera- tions were of necessity of a sporadic nature, the weather and state of aerodromes on occasions preventing our aircraft from operating for several days at a time. Subsequently, on the xoth January, as the Greeks continued to make slow progress towards Tepelene, Blenheims attacked enemy troops retiring from Kelcyre towards\u2019 Berat. Otherwise: support to the Greek forces at this time was confined to Blenheim attacks on the bases at Berat, West of the Central Sector and Elbasan, beyond the Northern Sector."

            "description": "30. The Greek advance had \u2018st its impetus by the beginning of the year as the result of increased enemy resistance, lengthened lines of communication and severe winter conditions. The Greeks still retained the initiative, how- ever, and after operations had apparently become static, they made a further advance, capturing Kelcyre on the 8th January, 1941, and thereafter making slow progress along the Northern side of the Kelcyre-Tepelene gorge. There was little activity in other sectors."

            "description": "250. On the 8th January a Director of Army Labour was appointed. He took over control both of \u2018the existing labour companies and of the labour supplied by contractors. Many of the latter were of a very poor quality and it had become apparent that the only satisfactory solution was to recruit as many labourers as possible into the labour companies; also that it was essential that they should be handled by officers and N.C.Os. who understood them and that accommodation should be provided as near as possible to their work. By arrangement the Governor cabled to the Colonial Office request- ing that the Services should be given authority to accept decisions by the D.G.C.D. as regards conditions of service reached after consultation with interested departments. No authority was received, but the War Office was informed that in view of the urgency the labour scheme agreed upon locally was accepted."

General Mont- gomery was succeeded, on rst January, 1944, by General Leese,t who had commanded 30 Corps in the desert and in Sicily, In the new organisation in the Mediterranean, Allied Force Headquarters now had a wider authority, in- cluding those areas which had previously come under General Headquarters Middle East. To a large extent, therefore, its preoccupations were political and logistical; I was accordingly instructed that for the conduct of the campaign in Italy I was given a free hand. For this Teason the title of my headquarters was changed from Fifteenth Army Group to Headquarters Allied. Armies in Italy} and my administrative staff was reorganised and put on a proper level with the operations staff. At the same time I was relieved of the duties of Deputy Allied Commander-in-Chief, being succeeded in the appointment by Lieutenant-General J. L. : Devers of the United States Army."
