            "description": "In Western Cyrenaica early January was a period of acute administrative difficulty. The expenditure of artillery ammunition, except by troops actually attacked by the enemy, was limited to twenty-five rounds a a day, in order to allow reserves to be accumulated for the projected assault on the enemy holding Agedabia, which was to be launched when the Ist Armoured Division arrived. The move of this division had been delayed owing to the lack of transport to bring forward petrol, but it eventually reached Antelat on the 6th January. On the morning of the 7th our patrols reported that Agedabia had been evacuated. F"

They also occupied El Adem aerodrome on that date, capturing 40 unserviceable aircraft which had been abandoned by the Italians on the landing ground there. A further 35 burnt out aircraft were found by armoured patrols at Gazala a few days later."

On the afternoon of the 3rd January a number of small craft were sighted off Kuala Selangor but out of artillery range. About midday on the 4th, however, patrols of 3 Indian Cavalry made contact with an enemy force moving south down the road from 8th Mile Village north of Kuala Selangor. This enemy force, driving back the cavalry patrols, advanced eastwards along the River Selangor, exercising a direct threat to the main road communications at Rawang. A sharp engagement took place at the bridge east of Batang Berjuntai. To meet this threat the 6/15 Brigade Group, recently withdrawn from the Kampar position, was moved to Rawang and thence to the Batang Berjuntai area which it reached on the 6th January. It took up a defensive position south of the River Selangor. Orders were given for the Denial Scheme to be put into force at the Batu Arang coal mines the only coal mines in Malaya which are situated in this district: ;"

            "date": "6th January",
            "description": "It proved impossible to launch thet offensive in December. The requisite precondition on which I insisted, an. adequate spell of good weather, was never fulfilled. Had we undertaken an offensive in the weather that prevailed it would almost certainly have fallen short of success and the resulting expenditure of ammunition would have meant the postponement of the, offensive of next spring. Eighth Army took advantage of some fitful spells of clear weather to improve its positions; Ravenna fell on 4th December and Faenza on the 16th and by 6th January our line was on the river Senio and touching the southern shore of the Valli di Comacchio. Here the advance was halted and both sides settled down to an uneasy lull. It is surprising to note that, up to this time, the Germans had shown clearly their intention to maintain their strength in Italy. Two infantry divisions were hastily despatched in November to meet a crisis in Hungary but were immediately replaced; one of the new formations was a division from Norway which had travelled all the way through western Germany at the time when Rundstedt's Ardennes offensive was raging without being drawn into it. At the end of the year,. therefore, Kesselring still had twenty-seven* German divisions, four Italian divisions and a Cossack cavalry division. Though we had failed to break through the Apengines we had succeeded in our mission. The Germans found themselves obliged by the very measure of their success in the winter fighting to await our attack in the following spring on an extended and uneconomical line and I was able to accomplish what I had feared impossible the previous autumn, the effective destruction of the enemy armies south of the Po."

            "description": "Having made the outflanking force as strong as possible it was now essential to give the maximum strength to the frontal attack, which must have sufficient momentum to carry it well up the Liri valley. I therefore decided to withdraw the New Zealand Division from Eighth Army, to be concentrated in the Naples area by 26th January, D plus 4 for SHINGLE. This division, of good fighting quality, well motorised and with an armoured component, was the  most suitable readily available for such exploitation. It gave me an Army Group reserve under my hand, for the first time, with which to influence the battle; as the events of the following May were to show, operations in the Liri valley and from Anzio must be treated as an Army Group battle. It was the third division taken from Eighth Army to increase our concentration at the vital point; I intended to put it at the disposal of Fifth Army when a suitable opportunity for its employment in an exploiting r le could be foreseen."

It was a strongly contested advance; the Germans had reinforced their front here in December with 44 Infantry and 5 Mountain Divisions and 71 Infantry Division was on the way. San Vittore was captured on 6th January and Monte Porchia on the same day; Monte Trocchio, the Jast hill before the Rapido, was abandoned by the enemy on the 15th. Meanwhile the French Expeditionary Corps, of 2 Moroccan and 3 Algerian Divisions, had also made contact with the   Gustav   line further north where they had captured Monte Santa Croce; across the upper Rapido, and Monte Pile, west of Viticuso. This represented an advance of about ten miles by the northern arm of my pincers aiming at Cassino and caused considerable alarm to the Germans; the newly arrived 5 Mountain Division made a poor showing in its first battle in Italy and had to be reinforced with detachments from the 3 Panzer Grenadier Division which had been intended for the Adriatic."

Attacks on aerodromes were catried out by escorted bombers, and, under their cover, low flying fighters slipped in and attacked Sembawang and Seletar. At Seletar, 2 Catalinas  at their moorings were burned out and another 2 damaged. Six Blenheims at Tengah were damaged to a varying degree, whilst at Sembawang 3 Buffaloes on the ground were destroyed and 4 damaged. Attacks were carried out by some 80 bombers, of which 2 were brought down and another 4 damaged. The attack was repeated on the 18th against the naval base and the docks, and again 2 were brought down and possibly 6 damaged for the loss of 8 Buffaloes."
