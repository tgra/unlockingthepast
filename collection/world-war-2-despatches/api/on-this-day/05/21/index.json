On arrival at the Anti Kithera Channel, KIPLING developed a steering defect and D.5 ordered her to join C.S.7. Continuing into Canea Bay, KELLY and KASHMIR encountered a troopcarrying caique, which they damaged badly by gunfire. These two ships then carried out a short bombardment of Maleme.   Whilst withdrawing they encountered another caique which they engaged and set on fire.

Since the enemy had reacted most energetically so far to the  Circus,;  against a target near Bethune on 17th June and another against a target in that area on 21st May, we  concluded that the industrial area which included Bethune, Lens and Lille was probably his most sensitive spot. By attacking this area it was hoped to induce him to concentrate in North-East France such fighter units-as he still had in the West.  Bombers without escort might then  hope to reach  West and North/West Germany in daylight round the flank of the defences, and this in turn might force the enemy to bring back fighters from the Eastern Front in order to defend the Fatherland."

He said that nothing but a large force could attempt the occupation of Syria. Meanwhile I had been receiving telegrams from General d  Gaulle in West Africa, couched in imperative language, enquiring why the Free French troops were not already on the march to Damascus. This incident illustrates the difficulties there sometimes were in dealing with the Free French."
