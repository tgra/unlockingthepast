Infantry, had already been brought down into
the line from North Italy. The operation,
which led to the capture both of Monte Massico
and Monte Santa Croce to the north, began on
28th October and was successfully completed
by 4th November, at which date 46 and 7
Armoured Divisions reached the lower
Garigliano between the bend opposite Monte
Tuga and the sea, The enemy had intendea
to offer delay on this line, thé southern
extremity of the ‘‘ Barbara’ line, as shown
by his reinforcing; but the dangers inherent
in standing for long with a broad river
immediately in rear, coupled no doubt with
apprehensions of a seaborne outflanking move,
decided him to pull: back his right, when
pressed, behind the Garigliano. In the mean-
time VI Corps had pushed forward up, and
then across, the Volturno and driven the left
wing of XIV Panzer Corps back to the
“ Bernhardt ’’ line based on Monte Camino,
Monte Maggiore and the hills on the north
. side of the Mignano defile from above Venafro
(captured on 4th November) to above
Tsernia.

The idea of an amphibious landing continued
to be entertained. On 23rd October General
Clark signalled to me (I was then at the Com-
manders-in-Chief conference in Carthage) that
he was contemplating a landing near Formia
in the Gulf of Gaeta in the strength of a regi-
mental combat team and two Ranger battalions,
in connection with the attack of ro and VI
Corps. Naval opinion, however, condemned
this as impracticable owing to the strength of
the coast defences and minefields. The only
apparent alternative, a landing between Gaeta
and Sperlonga, was clearly impossible as yet,
and unti] the forces advancing oyerland were
within supporting distance.
Attack on the Winter Line.

On 8th November I received a new directive
from General Eisenhower. It began by re-
affirming the objectives given on 25th Sep-
tember, the capture of Rome and the mainten-
ance, subsequently, of maximum pressure on
the enemy. Rome, of course, ‘had great politi-
cal value but we did not regard it primarily
as a prize to be won but rather as something
which we knew the enemy intended to defend
and for which we could make him fight his
hardest. To draw him into battle and destroy
his forces was our real object. The directive
Tecognised that the enemy “‘intends to resist
our occupation of Southern Italy to a greater
degree than hitherto contemplated.’
was therefore given, in the first phase, to the
build-up of our land forces and of such air
forces as were specifically required to assist
them in their task. However, six heavy bom-
bardment groups of the Strategic Air Force
must ‘be in Italy and operating by the end of
the year for use in the bombing programme
. against Germany. Finally I was directed, after
the capture of Rome, to secure possession by
occupying a general line to cover Civitavecchia
and Terni, the former being taken into use as
a port.

On the same day I also issued a directive
intended in particular for the guidance of Fifth
Army in the operations to secure their objec-
tives. My directive must be read against the
background of the severe exhaustion of Fifth
Army. The winter rains had started at the end

of September and were steadily increasing,
making roads and by-passes extremely difficult
and turning the open country into a sea of
mud, The mountains in front were the most
formidable we had yet encountered and the
enemy, who had already reinforced his flanks
with two fresh infantry divisions, was now
bringing over part of 26 Panzer Division from
Eighth Army’s front. This meant that there
were five enemy divisions opposing our five,
and the Fifth:Army troops were more tired
than the enemy. The Germans were showing
a stubborn spirit of resistance at all parts of
the front and it was clear that a co-ordinated
effort would be required to drive them from
their positions. I therefore directed Fifth Army,
on the completion of its present operations, to
pause and regroup, allowing Eighth Army to
strike first. The latter was to get astride Route
5 from Pescara to Popoli and Collarmele and
be prepared to threaten the enemy lines of
communication via Avezzano. Then Fifth
Army would attack up the valley of the Liri
and Sacco to reach Frosinone. This is the
classical route for an army marching on Rome
from the south and the only practicable one for
a large force; the Via Appia, Route 7, becomes
too involved with the Aurunci Mountains and
the Pontine Marshes. Our troops, I think, got
a little tired of hearing the Liri Valley described
as “The gateway to Rome ”’ during the long
months when the gate was shut so firmly in’
their faces, but the description is true neverthe-
less. Finally, when the main body reached
Frosinone, a seaborne landing would be made
south of Rome, directed on the Alban Hills.*
All available air support would go to Eighth
Army in the first phase and to Fifth Army in
the succeeding phase.

Between 5th and 15th November Fifth Army
continued their attempts to break into the
Winter Line in their sector. This enemy posi-
tion, as J have already explained, was not so
much a line as a belt of terrain about nine
miles wide; its forward edge, in front of which
our troops now stood, was the “* Bernhardt ’”
line, its rear, based on the high ground behind
the Garigliano and Rapido, was the ‘‘ Gustav "’
line, with the key fortress of Cassino. On the
south the two lines coincided and the German
defences utilised the plain forward of the Garig-
liano, the river, swift-flowing and deep, and the
Aurunci Mountains to the west of it which com-
mand every part of the plain. To the north
are the mountains commanding the Mignano
Gap through which Route 6 passes, dominated
by Monte Camino to the south and Monte Sam-
mucro to the north; in the gap itself there are
three isolated masses of high ground, Monte
Lungo, Monte Porchia and Monte Trocchio,
rising abruptly like rocks in a fairway. North
of Monte Sammucro the mountains rise even
higher to the central ridges of the Apennines,
impossible country for large-scale operations.

The first objective was the Monte Camino
massif, including the two subsidiary peaks of
Monte La Difensa and Monte Maggiore, and the
task of the assault was given to 56 British and
3 American Divisions under 10 and VI Corps
respectively. From 5th to 12th November the
attack was pressed against rock-hewn defences,
steep slopes up which all supplies had to be
man-handled, constant enemy counter-attacks
