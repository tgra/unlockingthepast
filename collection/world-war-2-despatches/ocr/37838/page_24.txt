(d) Operations subsequent to D-Day.
Plan of Presentation

234. .As in the previous sections of the narra-
tive part of this Despatch, I propose to deal
with the operations in the period D-Day to 30th
September, 1944, under types of operations,
rather than on a time basis. For this purpose
the following headings have been adopted:—

Attacks on Enemy Communications.
Close Support Operations.

Attacks on Coastal Garrisons.

Fighter Cover to the Assault and the Ship-
ping Lanes.

Enemy Air Reaction and the Allied Attacks
on the G.A.F. and its bases.

Defence against Flying Bombs and Attacks
on “‘ Crossbow ”’ targets.

Operations of First Allied Airborne Army.

Attacks on Naval Targets.

Strategical Bombing—“‘ Pointblank.””
