206. It was necessary also to take into .con-
sideration the condition of the troops of 11
Indian Division. Though their morale was not
broken, it could not be regarded as being as
high as one would have wished. They were
undoubtedly very exhausted by almost con-
tinuous fighting and movement both by day and
night. Moreover, the superiority which the
Japanese possessed in the air coupled with the
complete absence of tanks on our side could
mot byt have the most adverse effect upon the
trust reposed by the Indian troops in the might
«of the British Empire. It is not too much to
say that the Indian troops were dismayed to
find the British so outclassed in these two
essentials of modern war.

201. As regards the enemy’s course of action,
it was now clear that he intended to continue
his advance down the west coast with a view
to attacking Singapore from the North. Com-
bined with this, his forces in Kelantan might
move southward by the coastal route or he
might delver sea-borne attacks against the
Kuantan and/or East Johore areas with a view
to cutting our communications with our forces
in the North, or he might deliver a sea-borne
attack against Singapore direct. There re-
mained also the possibility of an air-borne
attack directed against our aerodromes.

202. I was informed by the C.-in-C. Far
East that the policy was to keep the enemy
as far north in Malaya as possible in order to
prevent him acquiring territory and particularly
aerodromes which would threaten the arrival of
reinforcements.

203. I considered the possibility of moving
up all or part of the A.I.F. in relief of troops
of 11 Indian Division but rejected the idea for
the following reasons: —

(a) The relief could not be carried out with-
out temporarily leaving the Johore defences
very weak; .

(6) It was undesirable to break up the
A.I.F. organization;

(c) On the other hand, if the whole of the
A.I.F. was sent, the relief would necessarily
take a long time and ultimately the vital
Johore area would be held by tired troops
with no previous experience of that part of
Malaya.

204: I decided to go to Ipoh to discuss the
situation with the Commander 3 Indian Corps
and left Singapore late on the 17th December.

After a reconnaissance of the area and a
visit to some of the forward troops on the
r8th December the following decisions were
made: —

“(a) While adhering to the general policy of
withdrawal behind the River Perak, the
enemy would be held west of the river as
long as possible without permitting our forces
to become inextricably committed.

(6) The Commander 3 Indian Corps would
select and have prepared a series of posi-
tions between Ipoh and Tanjong Malim.

(c) The immediate role of 9 Indian Division
would be (i) to continue to deny the Kuan-
tan aerodrome to the enemy; (ii) to secure
the rr Indian Division and its communica-
tions against attack from the east coast.

(d) As soon as the withdrawal across the
River Perak had taken place, the best area
for the operations of the sea-borne raiding
_ force (to be known as ‘‘ Rose Force ’’) would

SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

be that part of the state of Perak which hes

west of the river and south of the railway.

(e) Arrangements were to be made for land
raiding parties and for “‘ Jeft behind ’’ parties
to harass the enemy’s communications.

(f) A liaison officer was appointed to co-
ordinate the action of the military and civil
authorities in the west coast theatre of
operations.

(g} The 6 and 15 Indian Infantry Brigades
were to be amalgamated and to be known as
the 6/15 Indian Infantry Brigade. Certain
units were to be amalgamated, notably the East
Surreys and Leicesters which became known
as the British Battalion. The 12 Indian
Brigade Group was to be incorporated into
the 1z Indian Division. ,

(4) The Commander 3 Indian Corps was
to consider the question of the command of
rr Indian Division. It was felt that an officer
with the widest possible experience of bush
warfare was required. A few days later
Brigadier Paris, the Commander 12 Indian
Infantry Brigade, who had been in Malaya

.for 24 years, was appointed to succeed

Major-General Murray Lyon.

As all the infantry brigade commanders of
the division had become casualties, Lt.-Col.
Moorhead was appointed to command the 6/15
Brigade, Lt.-Col. Stewart the 12 Brigade and
Lt.-Col. Selby the 28 Brigade.

(7) All troops were to be given a minimum
period of’48 hours rest as soon as this could
be arranged. Defence in depth astride the
main road after crossing the River Perak
seemed to be the only way to make this
possible.

(Rk) It was now clear that we were faced by
an enemy who had made a special study
of bush warfare on a grand scale and whose
troops had been specially trained in those
tactics. He relied in the main on outflank-
ing movements and on infiltration by small
parties into and behind our lines,

For support of his forward troops he relied
on the mortar and the infantry gun rather than
on longer range weapons. His snipers operated
from trees. He exploited the use of fireworks.
For mobility he made a wide use of civilian
bicycles seized in the country. His tanks he
had up to date operated mainly on the roads.
His infantry had displayed an ability to cross
obstacles—rivers, swamps, jungles, etc.—
more rapidly than had previously been thought
possible. Finally, speed was obviously of
vital importance to him and he was prepared
to press his attacks without elaborate
preparations.

To meet these tactics, it was agreed that
brigade groups should be echeloned in depth
astride the main arteries of communication and
that in selecting defensive positions special
regard should be had to tank obstacles and
cover from air, in both of which arms the
enemy were well equipped while we were
entirely deficient.

205. On return to Singapore I circulated an
Instruction on the tactics to be employed, the
main points of which were as follows: —

(i) Enemy outflanking and infiltration
tactics must not lead to withdrawals which
should take place only on order of higher
authority,
