This set of maps also\n\ncovers the operations described in the other Air and Army despatches of the Burma Campaign\nfrom the 16th November, 1943 to 12th September, 1945.\n\nThe following despatch was submitted to the\nSecretary of State for Air on 16th Novem-\nber, 1945, by AIR CHIEF MARSHAL SIR\nKEITH PARK, K.C.B., K.BE., MC.,\nD.F.C., Allied Air Commander-in-Chief, Air\nCommand, South East Asia.\n\n\u2018Part ONE.\n\nFOREWORD.\n\n1. This Despatch is a review primarily of air\noperations in Burma during the last year be-\nginning in June, 1944. During this period a\nfanatical and over-confident enemy has been\ndriven back from his foothold in India at\nImphal over 800 miles, which included the\ncomplete rout of the enemy\u2019s field army in the\nopen plains of Burma and culminated in the\noccupation of Rangoon by our forces on 3rd\nMay, 1945.\n\n2. The primary cause was the defeat of the\nJapanese Army. This achievement has been\nmade possible by air power, which not merely\ntook an intimate share in the ground attack,\nbut also isolated the enemy\u2019s forces in the field.\nConfronted by overwhelming air power, the\nenemy\u2019s air forces withered away, and this\nsame air power helped to undermine the\nstability of his land forces, so that after their\ndecisive defeat at Imphal, although they made\na tenacious stand on a number of occasions,\nthey were no match for our well-equipped field\n\u201carmy\u2014well equipped in large measure by the\nunstinted effort of air supply to provide their\ndaily needs. Though air supply did not and\ncould not supplant all other means which\n\nthemselves involved a great effort to maintain,\nwithout it the campaign could not have been\nsuccessfully fought. Regardless of weather,\nclimate, and distance, the air supply line was\nmaintained wnhindered by enemy air opposi-\ntion, which had been driven from the skies.\n\n3. The Burma campaign should make its\nmark in the annals of history as a triumph of\nair power and air supply and as a feat of :\nendurance of Allied land forces.\n\n(COMMAND.\n\nA. In June, 1944, the Allied Air Forces in\nSouth East Asia were under the command of\nAir Chief Marshal Sir Richard Peirse, K.C.B.,\nDS.O., AF.C. Upon his relinquishment of\nthe appointment on 26th November, temporary\ncommand was assumed by Air Marshal Sir\nGuy Garrod, K.C.B., O.B.E., M.C., D.F.C.,\nuntil my arrival on 23rd February, 1945.\n\nThe Position in June, 1944,\n\n5. Two events mark the beginning of the\nperiod. The major Japanese offensive against\nImphal had been blunted and was in process\nof being broken by means of air supply on a\nhitherto unprecedented scale to the forces cut\noff from land communications with their base ;\nand second, the south-west monsoon was reach-\ning its full intensity over the operational areas.\nIt remained to be seen whether air forces could\nmaterially influence the land battle in weather\nwhich had in preceding years prohibited their\neffective employment, and whether the exemy\ndefeat in Manipur was to prove the turning-\npoint in South East Asia strategy which would\n",

Throughout the period, the saving of\nlives, the morale of the fighting troops and the\nmobility of our ground forces has been\nmaterially assisted by the work of light air-\ncraft and Dakotas flying out sick and wounded\nfrom the battle areas. The total of men thus\nsaved from avoidable pain and suffering, from\nmany days\u2019 journey by sampan, mule and\nambulance, and from dying for lack of hospital\nfacilities was formidable.\n\n69. The flexibility of air power, by no means\nlessened when used in the interests of\nhumanity, was well illustrated by a unique\noperation carried out by Sunderlands of\nNo. 230 Squadron, which landed on Lake\nIndawgyi behind the enemy lines and flew out\n537 wounded men of Special Force, whom\nGeneral Wingate\u2019s columns would otherwise\nhave been forced to abandon to the mercy of\nthe Japanese.\n\n70. This operation was, however, exceptional.\nThe normal procedure was for light aircraft\nof the RAF. Communication squadrons and\nthe U.S.A.A.F. Liaison squadrons to bring in\nthe sick and wounded from extemporised land-\ning strips to grounds where Dakotas and Com-\nmandos were discharging their cargo, and\nwhence they would take them to base hospitals\non return journeys. it was proposed at one\ntime to attach light aircraft to the transport\nsquadrons, and form one co-ordinated flying\nunit to undertake the whole process of casualty\nevacuation, but such a scheme would either\nhave impaired the mobility of the light aircraft\ncomponents or would have left them continu-\nally detached from their parent squadrons with\nno administrative or domestic backing for the\ndifficult conditions under which they live and\noperate. Accordingly, as the American light\naircraft are withdrawn from this theatre and\nthe R.A-F. take on the whole of the work,\nit is proposed to form independent self-\nsufficient flying units to reinforce the Group\nCommunication Squadrons in casualty evacua-\ntion. The resultant organisation will be suf-\nficiently elastic to cover the whole front and yet\nbe capable of concentration where casualties\nare heavy.\n\n71. Casualty evacuation has been a regular\npart of the Air Forces\u2019 work in this theatre\nsince the middle of 1943. It is unfortunate that\nwith the increase in traffic which intensified\noperations have caused, there has been insuf-\nficient parallel growth of resources. Nursing\nOrderlies are 11 per cent. below establishment,\nand the buildings and accommodation for the\nreception of wounded at base airfields are not\nof the standard which good hygiene and\nhumanity demand. If the Royal Air Force is\nto maintain the high reputation it has built in\nthis sphere, far more generous scales of equip-\nment and personnel must be authorised.\n\n= * * =\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nConclusions on Air Transport.\n\n72. The first essential for air supply is good\nground organisation. One weak link in the\nchain can vitiate the work of the aircrews and\nmaintenance personnel, the estimates of the\nplanners and the efforts of the fighting troops.\nIt is worth outlining some of the faults that\nhave occurred in order that they may be avoided\nin the future.\n\n{i) Dropping Zones should always be located ,\nwhere a drop is feasible. This might sound a\nplatitude to anyone who has not flown on\nsupply-dropping operations in Burma and\nfound dropping areas continually located in\nnarrow valleys whose negotiation after each\ntun is a major hazard.\n\n(ii) The system of communicating informa-\ntion on dropping areas, on the composition\nof loads, on changes of location, on enemy\ninterference and all other aspects of air\nsupply must be such that the one small and\nvital item of knowledge which might make\nthe difference between a successful or an\nabortive sortie is available at all links in the\nchain.\n\n(iii) The British Army-Air* supply system\nin South-East Asia has been continually\nmarred by the failure to provide for\nmeticulous organisation in a sphere where\ngreat efforts can be rendered nugatory by\ninaccuracy in minor details.\n\nThe following are some of the lessons\nlearnt: \u2014\n\n(a) Adequate distributing facilities must\nbe made available by the land forces at\nlanding grounds to ensure that perishable\ngoods are quickly distributed when un-\nloaded from aircraft.\n\n(6) Aircraft should not be detailed to\nconvey food to areas in which the same\ncommodities can easily be obtained by\nlocal purchase,\n\n(\u00a9) Packing of goods must be strong\nenough to ensure that containers do not\nburst in transit.\n\n(d) Adequate facilities must be provided\nfor feeding and resting aircrews engaged on\nthis arduous flying, as they are often absent\nfrom their bases for as long as ten hours\nat a time.\n\n{e) An efficient supply of re-fuellers and\nfacilities for night maintenance must be\narranged, otherwise aircraft which could\notherwise be making an effective contribu-\ntion to the battle will be grounded.\n\n(iv) Forward airfield commanders and fly-\ning control personnel took a long time to\nrealise that air supply traffic is as vital as any\nother, Cargo aircraft should not be kept\ncircling an airfield while tactical aircraft take\noff on a routine operation whose delay by\nhalf an hour is immaterial.\n\n(v) Each part of the planning and assess-\nment of air lift must be carried out by the\nService in whose province it lies. Much con-\nfusion has been caused here by the Army\nattempting to quote and work on flying hours\nper aircraft with no knowledge of the impli-\ncations of U.E. and I.E.*, aircraft serviceable\n\n* ULE, = Unit Equipment.\nLE. = Initial Equipment.\n",

Moreover it was con-\nsistent practice for the Army to require full\ndata on the performance of our aircraft and\nexplanations for any short-fall that might\noccur, while never giving equivalent informa-\ntion upon their own short-fall in overland\nor inland water transport.\n\n73. Air supply depends on so many agencies,\nand is affected by so many imponderables, that\nthe allocation of resources and good brains to\nensure efficiency, speed and good liaison can\nnever be too generous. The campaign in\nBurma would have been rendered easier had\nthe engineering resources that were poured into\nless profitable projects been directed towards\ntimely building of forward airfields, more effi-\ncient supply depots and stronger lines of com-\nmunication to the air haulage centres. The\nLedo Road, for example, is surely the longest\nwhite elephant in the world. Had the wealth\nof ability and material that went to its building\nbeen employed in strengthening the air supply\nsystem, the recapture of Burma could probably\nhave been advanced by an appreciable period.\n\n* * * *\n\nPart Five.\n\nTACTICAL SUPPORT OF THE\nGROUND FORCES.\n\nThe Organisation of Tactical Support.\n\n74. Air forces operating in tactical support\nof the Allied Land Forces in Burma comprised\nNos. 221 and 224 Groups R.A.F. and 10th\nU.S.A.A.F. all under the command of Head-\nquarters, Eastern Air Command. Each worked\nin close association with a corresponding army\nheadquarters\u2014the Tenth U.S.A.A-F. with the\nNorthern Combat Area Command, 224 Group\nwith 15 Corps and 221 Group with 33 Corps\nand 4 Corps, and finally from the beginning\nof December onwards with the Fourteenth\nArmy. 221 Group and Fourteenth Army\nremained together at Imphal only until the\nend of December, when the latter moved for-\nward to Kalemyo, being accompanied by the\nA.O.C. and his air staff.. The two headquarters\nwere again united fully at Monywa from 9th\nFebruary until the middle of April, when they\nmoved to Meiktila, their final staging post\nbefore Rangoon. The mobility of 221 Group\nheadquarters had a less active counterpart in\nthat of 224 Group, which remained with the\nheadquarters of 15 Corps first at Cox\u2019s Bazar\nand later at Akyab. In both cases the close\nrelationship of the headquarters of the two\nServices was an essential element in their\nsuccessful co-operation.\n\n75. In the campaign in central Burma, just\nas all the ground forces came under the\nFourteenth Army, so all the aircraft engaged\nin close, as distinct from tactical, support of\nthe former were controlled by Headquarters,\n221 Group. There were however two excep-\ntions. The two Air Commando Groups\noperated directly under Eastern Air Command,\nand the Mustangs of the Second Air Com-\nmando Group, which played so important a\nrole in the operations of 4 Corps which led\nto the seizure of Meiktila, were for the crucial\nperiod of these operations controlled by an\nadvanced headquarters of the Combat Cargo\nTask Force located with 4 Corps headquarters,\n\n1975\n\nThe second exception was provided by the\nThunderbolt squadrons of 905 Wing, for which,\nowing to administrative reasons, there was no\nroom east of the Lushai Hills and which were\ntherefore located in Arakan under 224 Group.\n\n76. In this connection the very difficult\nproblems of administration confronting 221\nGroup must be recalled. Its wings and squad-\nrons operated from bases covering a front of\nsome two hundred miles, and a depth which\nat the beginning of the campaigning season in\nNovember was no less, and which by the end\nof April had expanded to some six hundred\nmiles, from the Mosquito wing at Khumbigram\nto the fighter squadrons on forward strips near\nToungoo. Most were on a highly mobile basis,\nwith personnel reduced to the minimum ; the\nseparation of squadrons from servicing\nechelons which was generally effected towards\nthe end of 1944 contributed materially to the\nmobility of units in the group. Fighter squad-\nrons moved forward in pace with the advancing\nfront as quickly as the army were able to\nprepare landing grounds and forego air trans-\nport for them ; the squadrons of 906 Wing, for\ninstance, were operating from airfields near\nYe-U by the middle of January, a fortnight\nafter the occupation of the district by 33 Corps,\nand before the end of April no less than nine\nfighter squadrons were located at Toungoo,\nwhich had not been captured until the 22nd,\nand another four at Magwe, which fell on the\n18th, in preparation for the assault upon\nRangoon. These moves were effected with the\naid of transport aircraft, overland communica-\ntions being almost non-existent. There was,\nhowever, some feeling among the squadrons\nthat in the matter of motor transport and\nindeed of supplies generally the army was at\na distinct advantage.\n\n77. The enormous area over which the\nsquadrons of 221 Group were scattered, together\nwith the meagreness of communications by\nJand and telephone, also precluded the whole-\nsale adoption, for the operational control of\nfighter aircraft in close support, of the organiza-\ntion which had been evolved in the European\ntheatre of war for army-air co-operation. The\nformer system of Army Air Support Units\nwas replaced in the closing months of 1944\nby the establishment of Air Support Signals\nUnits with Visual Control Posts (V-C.Ps.), Air\nAdvisers being also provided for both corps\nand divisional headquarters. A Combined\nArmy /Air School for training V.C.P personnel\nwas set up at Ranchi, and it was soon found\nthat the greatest difficulty in the establishment\nof Visual Control Posts was the provision of\npersonnel, particularly of Controllers, who it\nwas agreed must be chosen from experienced\njunior officers of the General Duties branch.\nTen teams were however operating by the\nend of 1944 and by the beginning of May,\n1945, their number had risen to thirty-four.\nThe special value of the V.C.Ps lay in the\nextra flexibility and accuracy which they lent\nto air operations planned in conjunction with\nthe ground situation; the former device of\njndicating targets by smoke shells, always\nliable to inaccuracies in both place and time\nas well as to counterfeiting by the enemy,\nwas now needed only when the target lay\nin flat jungle country, invisible from the air\nand not determinable in relation to any obvious\nfeature of the landscape.\n",

It contributed\nmaterially to that close and efficient co-opera-\ntion of ground and air forces which was so\nmarked a feature of the campaign of 1944-45.\nIt led however to a tactic of less unquestion-\nable value in the employment of the \u201c cabrank \u201d\nmethod, by which aircraft patrolled con-\ntinuously over selected areas, maintaining touch\nall the time with the V.C.P., who as oppor-\ntunity offered would call them down to attack\nany fresh target revealed by the progress of\nthe battle. This tactic was very popular with\nour own troops, as the continued presence\noverhead of our own air support had excellent\nmorale effect. Furthermore, air support was\navailable to engage any target at a moment\u2019s\nnotice. It was however wasteful of flying\nhours and reduced petrol stocks, in that the\naircraft were liable to be kept waiting and\ntargets could not always be provided, while\nit diminished the weight of air attack, since\nin order to maintain a continuous patrol the\naircraft could seldom operate in more than\npairs. If the army requires direct air support\nto be available at such short notice, it is con-\nsidered that their desires could more\neconomically be satisfied by providing the air\nforces with airfields as close behind the front\nline as the reasonable security of the ground\ninstallations will warrant.\n\n* * a &\n\nClose support of the Fourteenth Army.\n\n79. The aircraft employed in close support\noperations were of various types. In June,\n1944, there were still four squadrons of\nVengeances operating, two on the Imphal and\ntwo on the Arakan front; they had done\nexcellent work in the 1943-44 campaign, but\nhad soon to be withdrawn. In September, the\nfirst R.A.F. Thunderbolts began operations ;\nThunderbolts had already been in use for some\ntime with the Tenth U.S.A.A.F. which had\nalso occasionally employed its Lightnings\n(P.38) in close support work. As the new cam-\npaign developed, and it became clear that the\nenemy was in no position seriously to chal-\nlenge the Allied air superiority, Spitfires were\nincreasingly diverted to the ground-attack role,\nparticularly in the Arakan sector.\n\n80. But the backbone of direct air support\nwas always provided by the Hurricane, with or\nwithout bombs. The \u201c Hurribomber \u201d had well\nproved its worth in the 1943-4 campaign, and\nsome in particular of the \u201c Hurribomber\u201d\nsquadrons enjoyed an immense reputation for\ntheir accurate pin-pointing of \u2018targets within a\ncomparatively few yards of our own positions.\nTheir value in this was particularly evident\nduring the period of mountain warfare that\nended at the beginning of December, 1944, and\nsubsequently in the interval of semi-static fight-\ning that was marked by the battle of the\nbridgeheads in late January and February,\n1945. In conjunction with fighter-bombers as\nwell as independently, ground-attack fighters\nalso frequently operated in close support, doing\nparticularly effective work in attacks upon gun\nsites and patrols over areas in which enemy\nartillery was suspected to be located.\n\n81. Heavier aircraft were also taken into\nservice in support of ground attacks. Mitchells\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\n(B.25) had already been employed for this pur-\npose in the 1943-4 campaign, but the four\nsquadrons of the Twelfth Bombardment Group\nwere now withdrawn ftom the Strategic Air\nForce and placed under the operational controk\nof first 224 Group and later 221 Group, so that\ntheir work might more simply be dovetailed.\ninto the general tactical pattern. They oper-\nated sometimes independently, but in close\nsupport more frequently in conjunction with\nfighter-bombers, and added greatly to the\nweight and effectiveness of large-scale close\nsupport operations; the term \u201c Earthquake \u201d\nwhich was ultimately taken into official use\nto describe these concerted attacks upon\nJapanese bunker positions originated among\nthese Mitchell squadrons, who earned for them-\nselves the name of \u201cthe Earthquakers.\u201d\n\n82. An outstanding \u201c earthquake \u201d operation,\nfor instance, was the air contribution to the\ncombined army and air attack directed on\n10th January against the enemy stronghold at\nGangaw in the Kabaw Valley, where an ex-\ntensive and well-defended system of bunkers\nand gun emplacements was holding up the\nadvance of 4 Corps southwards in its vital\nthrust against the Japanese left flank. Four\nMitchell squadrons participated in this opera-\ntion, as did some thirty-four \u201c Hurribombers,\u201d\ndefensive cover being supplied by Spitfires and.\nThunderbolts. It turned out to be a highly\nsuccessful day; the bombs were dropped at\napproximately 1430 hours and within ninety\nminutes five out of the six main Japanese posi-\ntions were in Allied hands. The subsequent\nwithdrawal of the enemy from the whole neigh-\nbourhood during the next few days was.\nattributed by 4 Corps to be due in great\nmeasure to a lowering of his morale as a result\nof this air attack. But the participation of so\nlarge a number of aircraft in a single operation\nwas not usual, and as the campaign wore on\nit was realised that Mitchells operating in num-\nbers as low as two or three could do effective\nwork in accurately winkling out small enemy\nparties from their lairs.\n\n83. Heavy bombers of the Strategic Air Force\nwere also employed on \u201cearthquake\u201d opera-\ntions from time to time, mainly in support\nof the Fourteenth Army during the battle for\nthe bridgeheads in January and February, 1944,\nthough they also intervened effectively in sup-\n\n\u201cport of 15 Corps during the struggle for the\n\npossession of the coastal road at Kangaw at\nthe end of January. But well-marked targets\nsuitable for their employment in direct co-\noperation with the ground forces were of\nnecessity few, owing to the Japanese skill in\ncamouflage, and the heavy bombers were there-\nfore of most assistance to land operations in\ntheir attacks upon targets not in the immediate\nbattle-zone.\n\n* * * *\n\nIndirect Support of the Fourteenth Army.\n\n84. On numerous occasions the ground\nforces requested the help of the Strategic Air\nForce, and nominated targets some distance\nbehind the battle area though still in the\ntactical zone of land operations. These\ntargets were, in the-main, supply centres or\nnodal communication points or built-up areas\nin which the enemy was believed to be living.\nA notable attack of this type was mounted on\n",

(Later in the month, heavy\nbomber targets included objectives designated\nby the Army at Myittha, Mablaing and\nMyingyan\u2014all towns lying on or close to the\npath being followed by the armoured columns\nof 4 Corps in their thrust towards Meiktila.\nTo take a final example, the climax of the air\nattacks upon the potential stronghold of\nToungoo, where the enemy was expected to\nmake a serious effort to stop the drive of\n4 Corps southwards towards Rangoon in the\nsecond half of April, was supplied by over 40\nLiberators, which bombed the garrison area\nthere on the 21st, when the nearest Allied\ntroops were already within striking distance,\nand indeed entered the town the following day.\n\n86. Very effective operations against targets\nin the immediate rear of the enemy were\ncarried out by ground-attack fighters through-\nout the period ; their most vulnerable objec-\ntives were to be found along the lines of\n\ncommunication, where animal and motor trans- .\n\nport units were carrying to his troops in the\nfield, and also along the waterways where mis-\ncellaneous rivercraft served the same purpose.\nIn these operations varied aircraft were em-\nployed, from Hurricanes and Spitfires to\nBeaufighters, Lightnings, Thunderbolts and\nMosquitos, while Mitchells also participated,\nparticularly by night. Armament included\nrocket projectiles and bombs, as well as 40 mm.\ncannon, also guns of lesser calibre.\n\n87. Some small foretaste of the weight and\npattern of this tactical support of the army\nwas given in July, when the enemy was\nendeavouring to withdraw from the perimeter\nof the Imphal plain, and good toll was taken\nof his transport forced to brave the open road\nto Tiddim and the other routes eastward to\nthe Chindwin. Direct attacks upon vehicles,\nmainly by Hurricanes, were varied by success-\nful efforts to block the Tiddim road by causing\nlandslides, and to break the bridges both along\nit and in the Kabaw Valley\u2014achievements for\n\n1977\n\nwhich Lightnings and Vengeances were respon-\nsible. In all, over 75 motor transport units\nwere successfully attacked in this area during\nthe month. These operations, though invisible\nto the army, were controlled with the military\nsituation always in view, and evidence was sub-\nsequently forthcoming in plenty from captured\ndiaries of enemy officers and men of their effec-\ntiveness in hindering the passage of supplies\nand the movement of personnel, and in aggra-\nvating the conditions of disease and under-\nnourishment under which the Japanese ground\nforces laboured.\n\n88. In August the tactical picture on the\nFourteenth Army front came to centre round\nthe Chindwin river, which for two or three\nweeks became of considerably enhanced im-\nportance as a supply route. It had long been\nin use by the Japanese as a line of communi-\ncation, and the riverine ports, particularly\nMonywa and Kalewa, were active points of\nsupply. The still worsening military situation\ncontinued to impose upon the enemy the neces-\nsity for emergency movements of men and sup-\nplies behind the Manipur sector of the front.\nSince the capacity of the Sagaing\u2014Ye-U rail-\nway had been greatly reduced by air action,\nand the other overland routes were more or\nless unusable owing to the monsoon, they were\nforced to have increased resort to the Chind-\nwin as a line of communication.\n\n89. Early in the month the toll of rivercraft\nsuccessfully attacked began to increase and it\nbecame apparent that something was afoot.\nThe Spitfires and Hurricanes which had hitherto\nbeen covering the river were reinforced by a\ndetachment of Beaufighters from 224 Group.\n\u201c Hurribombers \u201d were joined by Wellingtons,\nand later by Mitchells, in a series of attacks\nupon riverside targets. In addition, mines, both\nmagnetic and ordinary, were laid in the Chind-\nwin by Mitchells so as to catch traffic attempt-\ning to move under cover either of cloud or\ndarkness. The total number of rivercraft suc-\ncessfully attacked on the Chindwin during the\nmonth was not far short of five hundred, and\nincluded seven launches ; of this total the Beau-\nfighters accounted for slightly over half,\ntogether with five of the launches.\n\n90. Attacks upon road transport vehicles con-\ntinued throughout the campaign, their effective-\nness being increased with the advent of better\nweather at the close of the monsoon. In par-\nticular, the periods during which a major Allied\nadvance was in progress and the battlefront was\ntherefore fluid, were marked by the presence\nof transport targets in otherwise unusual quan-\ntity. This was.so during the advance to the\nIrrawaddy in December, the thrust towards\nMeiktila during late February and early in\n\n\u00bb March, and above all during the final advance\n\nof 4 Corps towards Rangoon in the second half\nof April. Ox-carts belonging to the local popu-\nlation had long been habitually pressed into\nservice by the Japanese, and were attacked at\nall times. But lorries moved mainly under\ncover of darkness, and the Beaufighters which\nlit upon a convoy of forty to fifty vehicles\ntravelling westwards along the road from\nMeiktila to Kyaukpadaung on the afternoon of\nFebruary 5th and successfully strafed them made\nan exceptional discovery. But it was probably\nno coincidence that on the night of February\n15th/ 16th, just after the Fourteenth Army had\n",

A little later, on the night of the\n27th/28th, a Mitchell on intruder patrol dis-\ncovered a convoy of over a hundred vehicles,\ntogether with some armoured cars and six\ntanks, travelling northwards along the road\nfrom Taungdwingyi to Myothit, doubtless to\nbe thrown into the attempt to stem the advance\nof the Fourteenth Army. The aircraft delivered\nattacks by both bombing and strafing for the\nspace of an hour. It then attacked another\nsmaller group of vehicles some distance to the\nsouth-east, after which it returned to the large\nconvoy and was able to observe that some forty\nunits had been knocked out by its previous\nattacks ; finally it delivered one more strafing\nattack, setting three more vehicles on fire.\n\n92. In the second half of April, with the final\nstages of the advance southwards in progress,\nsuch targets became unprecedentedly plentiful.\nA Hurricane squadron, for instance, caught\nover forty vehicles on the 19th standing nose\nto tail, heavily loaded and camouflaged, off the\nroad a little south of Pyinmana, and was: sub-\nsequently able to count seventeen in fiames and\nmany more severely damaged. The same\nsquadron located an even larger number near\nthe site of the bridge over the Sittang at Mok-\npalin on the 30th, when a total of forty-three\nlorries finally was counted in flames. Both\nMustangs of the Second Air Commando Group\nand Beaufighters of 224 Group had each al-\nTeady made a haul similar in size and nature in\nthis escape corridor on the 26th. In all, during\nthis second half of the month, approximately\nthree hundred and fifty motor vehicles were\nsuccessfully attacked behind the enemy\u2019s lines\nthroughout Burma. The analogous figures for\nthe whole period covered by this despatch may\nconservatively be assessed, on the basis of vis-\nible evidence, at 3846 M.T. vehicles.\n\n93. One operation in tactical support of the\nFourteenth Army is worthy of special mention,\nnamely the achievement of a Hurricane IID\nsquadron, firing rocket projectiles, which on\nFebruary 19th\u2014in the course of a single day\u2014\nput out of action twelve tanks which the Japan-\nese were about to throw into the battle for the\nbridgehead opposite Myinmu. These belonged\nto the single tank regiment of which\nthe Japanese forces in Burma were known to\ndispose, and it was a measure of the importance\nattached by the enemy to the outcome of the\nstruggle in the Myinmu bridgehead that he now\nsought to commit them in the field for the first\ntime since they had been withdrawn from the\nImphal front in the previous June. They were,\n\nhowever, destroyed before they came within \u00a9\n\nrange of infantry weapons, their destruction\nbeing shortly afterwards verified by advancing\nAllied troops who inspected their remains,\n\n94. Somewhat different in character from the\nharassing of Japanese road communication was\nthe interdiction of the railways used by the\nenemy in supplying his troops in Burma.\nAlready, before the opening of the period cov-\nered by this despatch, the operation of ground-\nattack fighter aircraft over these lines had\nbecome a difficult and expensive undertaking.\nTrains had practically ceased to run by day,\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1931\n\ntheir component parts generally being camou-\nflaged and dispersed until sunset with the loco-\nmotives hidden in specially constructed shelters,\noften at the end of long sidings deep in the\njungle. All obvious railway targets were\nguarded by efficient anti-aircraft defences,\ndummy or derelict locomotives being placed to\ndecoy the aircraft into traps or at least to draw\ntheir fire. Nevertheless, some three hundred\nand ten locomotives were successfully attacked\nby day, Beaufighters accounting for one hun-\ndred and eighty-seven. Most of the remainder\nwere claimed by Mosquitos, Mustangs,\nLightnings and Thunderbolts.\n\n95. Of the number of rolling stock destroyed\nit would be unsafe to give any estimate, but\nin any case there were always more than\nenough waggons available in Burma to satisfy\nJapanese military needs\u2014in contrast to the\nposition in regard to locomotives, which, as a\nresult of past Allied air attacks were always\nin short supply, the Japanese going so far as to\nimport them from Siam and to use petrol-\ndriven cars to haul railway waggons. Water-\ntowers always presented a vulnerable target,\ndifficult to hide, and thirty-nine were holed\nduring the period. It should be noted that these\nday attacks by ground-attack fighters reached\nas far as the northern extremities of both the\nBurma-Siam and the Bangkok-Chiengmai rail-\nways.\n\n96. A further one hundred and twenty-two\nlocomotives were put out of commission as a\nresult of night attacks, thirty-seven being con-\ntributed by Mosquitos and thirty-seven by\nMitchells. These attacks were of course\ndelivered upon trains in full employment, and\nwere not infrequently accompanied by spectacu-\nlar results, with engine boilers exploding,\ntrucks aflame and a series of secondary ex-\nplosions. They may be reckoned as having\ninflicted greater material injury upon the enemy\nthan a numerical comparison between the\nnumbers of locomotives damaged by day and\nby night would suggest.\n\n97. Concurrently with attacks upon locomo-\ntives, key points in the Burmese railway system,\nsuch as the junctions at Thazi and Pyinmana,\nwere bombed, mainly by Mitchells and Light-\nnings. But the main weight of attack con-\n\u2018tinued ito be directed upon bridges, which\nwere so numerous that it was impossible to\nprovide anti-aircraft defences for more than the\nmost important. The enemy pursued his estab-\nlished policy of erecting by-pass trestle bridges\nto serve as temporary substitutes for the per-\nmanent structures wrecked or menaced by air\nattack.\n\n98. In all, about three hundred bridges were\nput out of commission by medium, light and\nfighter bombers ; of this total, one hundred and\ntwelve were railway bridges. So great, how-\never, was the success of the bridge destruction\npolicy, that in connection with the unexpectedly\nrapid advance of the Fourteenth Army it pro-\nvoked the query whether we were not destroy-\ning our own future land line of communication\nin advance, and agreement was reached by\nwhich, from February onwards, the indis-\ncriminate destruction of bridges was abandoned\nin favour of a policy of keeping specified\nmajor bridges unserviceable. When, in course\nof time, the sites were occupied by Allied\n",

Attacks on watercraft in Burma were\npressed home by ground-attack fighters of all\ntypes throughout the campaign, particularly\nalong the Irrawaddy, always an important\nJapanese line of communication, and also on\nthe Arakan coast and the waterways of south-\nwest Burma, though, as along the land routes\nso on the waterways, the enemy moved mainly\nby night. A rough estimate of the total number\nof inland or coastal watercraft in enemy use\nsuccessfully attacked is 11,822 of which 302\nwere power-driven units. Towards the end\nof the campaign, the Irrawaddy tended to\nbecome less a line of communication for the\nJapanese than a hindrance to their lateral\nmobility, so that boats collected for ferrying\nrather than supply craft provided the main\ntargets. At the same time, air reconnaissance\nand attack was maintained at a high rate over\nthe Bassein-Henzada district in order to dis-\ncourage the enemy division located there from\nmoving eastwards to reinforce the main battle-\nfront in central Burma. In the course of April,\nthe motor launches supplying this garrison\nformation were successfully attacked on a\nnumber of occasions, notably on the 25th,\nwhen their hiding-place south-west of Rangoon\nwas located and bombed and strafed with\nrocket projectiles by a mixed force of twenty-\nseven Beaufighters and Mosquitos.\n\n100. A word must be added in connexion\nwith the patrols flown by Beaufighters to inter-\ncept enemy shipping in the Gulf of Martaban.\nOwing to the reduction through air attack of the\ncarrying capacity of the overland routes of\nentry into Burma, the Japanese had increasing\nresort during 1944 to the shipment of goods\nnorthwards along the Tenasserim coast and\nthence westwards across the Gulf of Martaban\nto Rangoon, employing for this a number of\ncoasters of wooden construction eighty to one\nhundred and twenty feet in length. A daily\npatrol was maintained by Beaufighters, whose\nbase at Chiringa lay not far short of five\nhundred miles distant from the Gulf at its\nnearest point, and resulted in the sinking of\ntwenty-eight coasters, many of which were\ndestroyed at dawn or dusk soon before ships\nreached or after they had left the nooks in\nwhich they hid during the day.\n\n101. Attacks by all types of aircraft likewise\ncontinued, throughout the campaign, to be\ndirected against enemy bivouac and barrack\nareas and against stofage points from small\nstacks of petrol drums near the front line to\nthe great dumps north of Rangoon mentioned\nelsewhere in this despatch. Despite the un-\ndoubted accuracy of operations against this\ntype of target, more particularly by Lightnings,\nMosquitos and Mitchells, difficulties of terrain\noften forbade the assessment of results, even\nwith the aid of photographs, and in default of\nthe subsequent occupation of the target area\nby our own troops it has often only been a\nreference in a Japanese diary or an intelligence\nreport which has arrived weeks or even months\nlater which served to clinch the evidence of\nsuccess. To take one instance out of many,\nit was not until several weeks after the event\nthat the full success of the heavy raids of\n8th February on targets at Yenangyaung was\n\n1979\n\nconfirmed, when two prisoners of war agreed\nthat they had been most terrifying, and stated\nthat one bomb had destroyed thirty-four motor\nvehicles parked under shelter, and that another\nhad landed in a trench in which some thirty\nJapanese were sheltering, killing all the\noccupants.\n\n* * * *\n\nTactical Support of 15 Corps.\n\n102. Tactical support of 15 Corps followed\nlines closely parallel to those on which air\nsupport was furnished to the Fourteenth Army.\nThere were, however, certain special charac-\nteristics which deserve mention. After the\ninitial advance down the Kaladan Valley, the\nmajor forward moves of the ground forces\nwere marked not by overland offensives leading\nto a break-through by mechanised formations,\nbut by a series of amphibious landings at half-\na-dozen points on the coast. Of the three\nisland landings, those on Akyab and Cheduba\nwere completely unopposed, while that on\nRamree met only with slight opposition; few\nor no targets presented themselves and the air\nsupport on these occasions was therefore akin\nto a peace-time exercise. The mainland land-\nings each achieved tactical surprise, but were\nall followed shortly by bitter fighting when the\nenemy entrenched himself in characteristic\nfashion and attempted to prevent the exploita-\ntion of the initial landing. Fierce battles then\ndeveloped on the same general pattern as those\nfor the Irrawaddy bridgeheads.\n\n103. Two developments confined to opera-\ntions by 224 Group deserve mention. The first\nwas the use of Spitfires in the fighter-bomber\nrole. The second was the employment ,from\nFebruary onwards, of airborne Visual Control\nPosts, whose success was undoubted. From a\nlight aircraft they were able to discern targets\nin the coastal jungle that were well concealed\nfrom ground observation, and so to pass\ndirections to the aircraft waiting to attack.\nTwo of these teams were operating by the end\nof the campaign.\n\n104. Indirect support of 15 Corps centred\nlargely around the maintenance of air attacks\nupon the long supply line on which the\nJapanese depended for the existence of their\ntroops in Arakan. Its forward end among the\ncoastal waterways and along the parallel road\nsouthwards to Taungup was covered by ground-\nattack fighters of all types, while the eastward\ntrack from An to Minbu\u2014whose existence had\nbeen established by Beaufighters on recon-\nnaissance\u2014and the mountain road from\nTaungup to the railhead at Prome, also yielded\nvaluable targets, Stress was laid by the army\nin March and April, 1945, upon the need for\nmaintaining a continuous interdiction of the\nlatter road by cratering its surface or pre-\ncipitating landslides by bombing, even at the\ncost of denying ourselves the future use of\na much needed supplementary land line of\ncommunication to the Irrawaddy valley, and\nfighter-bombers and also heavy bombers of\nthe Strategic Air Force were accordingly\ndiverted to this purpose. Targets along the\nProme-Rangoon railway were attacked as\nelsewhere in central Burma; in this, the\ndestruction of its bridges by Lightnings of the\n459th Squadron in February was especially\n",

On the north-eastern sector of the front,\ndirect air support to Special Force and later to\nThirty-six Division together with the Chinese\ndivisions and the American Mars Task Force\nfurther to the east, was provided by the P.47s.,\nP.38s. and also by the B.25s. of the Tenth\nU.S.A.A.F. The general principles of army/\nair force co-operation were as on other sectors\nof the front, the Visual Control Post being\nknown as the \u201cair party\u201d. There were, how-\never, two directions in which the technique\nof close air support as practised by the Tenth\nUS.A.A.F. was more advanced than on the\n221 and 224 Group sectors. The first was in\nthe more highly developed signals methods\nused in R/T communications between the \u201c air\nparty\u201d on the one hand and the attacking\naircraft and also the light aircraft\u2014-L.5s.\u2014\nused for observation on the other.\n\n106. The second lay in the special use made\nin\u2019 the N.C.A.C. area of photography for\ntactical operations. Photographs of all sorts\nwere used\u2014low level verticals, reconnaissance\nstrips, obliques and pin point shots. A simple\nmethod was worked out by which a common\nphotograph grid was accepted by both ground\nand air forces for marking photographs; this\nwas all the more necessary in that the country\nthrough which the N.C.A-C. forces were\nadvancing consisted of an expanse of jungle-\nclad hills with few natural features by\nteference to which a target could be simply\nidentified. The effectiveness of close | air\nsupport was acknowledged by the ground forces\nin this sector no less than elsewhere, despite\nthe considerable obstacles offered by the wild\nterrain to an exact collaboration.\n\n107. It was no doubt in part the very suc-\ncess of air support operations in the N.C.A.C.\narea that Jed to their comparatively early\ncessation. The country through which the\nland forces advanced with a continually grow-\ning momentum offered few or no sites for the\nconstruction of forward landing-grounds, and\nthe leading army units tended more and more\nto draw away from the available air bases\nas a consequence. Enemy opposition also\ndwindled, and, from the end of March onwards,\ncontact was lost with the Japanese. Thence-\nforward, the air effort was thus inevitably\nrestricted to long-range attacks upon the\ntransport routes, supply centres and bivouac\npoints along the enemy line of retreat through\nthe Shan States southwards into Siam.\n\n= = * *\n\nPart Six.\n\nSTRATEGIC AIR FORCE.\n\n108. Operations by heavy bombers in this\ntheatre were conditioned by the restricted\nnature of the targets available and by the\nvulnerability of the all-important Japanese lines\nof communication. To understand the pattern\nof attack, and to assess its results, demands\nsome knowledge of these circumstances, which\nare discussed in some detail hereunder.\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\n109. The factors of climate, topography and\nthe occupation of large areas of China com-\nbined to make the Japanese grip on Burma\none which, it was early realised, the Allies\nwould have great difficulty in prising loose.\nNotwithstanding his seemingly inviolable front,\nthe enemy possessed an Achilles\u2019 heel in his\npoverty of natural resources and his consequent\ndependence on seas that he has never actually\ncontrolled. A high percentage of everything\nupon which his industry thrives must cross the\nsea in crude form to be processed in the home-\nland ; thence it must recross the seas to arrive\nat the fighting line. From Japan to Burma\nthe sea lanes stretch for some 4,000 miles, of\nwhich more and more were open to attack by\nAllied bombers as strength, experience and air\nbases developed. The railways which carried\nhis supplies thence to the front were at the\nmercy of Allied bombers to an even greater\ndegree.\n\n110. Communications by sea were not dis-\nputed during 1942 and much of 1943. dt was\nsimple to follow the normal channels of com-\nmerce to the ports of Siam and Malaya in the\neast, Singapore in the south, and Mergui,\nTavoy, Ye, Moulmein and Rangoon in the\nwest. But Japan herself had proved by the\nsinking of the \u201cPrince of Wales\u201d and\n\u201cRepulse\u201d that control of the sea demands\ncontrol of the air above the sea. In her early\nvictory lay the seeds of her own defeat, for\nAllied aircraft disputed with her, and won,\ncontrol of the air over all her lines of com-\nmunication in Burma and Siam.\n\n111. From the nodal ports, the railways of\nBurma and Siam constitute a system of strate-\ngically connected lines with a total length of\napproximately 5,000 miles. From Phnom\nPenh, north-west of Saigon, the railway goes\nwest and north-west through Bangkok, Pegu\nand Mandalay, where it forks into two lines\nterminating at Lashio and Myitkyina with\nbranches to Rangoon, Bassein, Kyauk-\npadaung, Myingyan and Ye-U. The tactical\nimportance of all these railheads was reinforced\nby their strategic positioning on the lines of\nsupply. Their function was not only to feed\nforward material from Japan, but to shuttle\nwithin the occupied territories the natural re-\nsources whose employment would ease the load\non Japanese shipping\u2014rice, tungsten, oil, tin\naid rubber. It has been estimated that at\nleast 50 per cent. of the Japanese Army\u2019s\nrequirements in Burma were produced locally.\n\n* * * *\n\n112. In June, 1944, the Strategic Air Force\nunderwent changes in organisation and com-\nposition that materially reduced its strength\nand effectiveness during the monsoon months.\nThe Twelfth Bombardment Group, comprising\nfour squadrons of Mitchells, was transferred\nto Third Tactical Air Force, a step for which.\nAir Marshal Baldwin had long pressed, and\nthe Seventh Bombardment Group of four\nsquadrons of Liberators was diverted to haul\npetrol to China. This was considered more\nremunerative employment for them than the\nconduct of bomber operations under active\nmonsoon conditions. Strategic Air Force\ntherefore retained only its British component,\ntotalling three Liberator and two Wellington\nsquadrons, excluding the Special Duty and Air\nSea Rescue element. dn consequence of the\n",

With\none more accession to its strength (No. 358\nSquadron formed within the Command and\noperating by January), Strategic Air Force\nreached its full power for the vital six months\nto follow. Its operational function was accord-\ningly expanded from October onwards to in-\nclude all the duties of strategic bombers,\nincluding mining, and the Force was ready for\nthe decisive campaign which lay ahead.\n\n* * * *\n\n114. Operations fell into well-defined cate-\ngories, the first of which was the effort against\nshipping and harbour installations ; the second,\nand most important, was the interdiction of the\noverland supply routes into Southern Burma ;\nand the third the destruction of the enemy\u2019s\npowers of resistance in Burma by disorganising\nhis internal communications, razing his dumps,\nand denying him the use of his airfields and\ntmnilitary installations.\n\n@ Attacks against Shipping and Harbours.\n\n415. Although the main weight of attack\nfell upon railways, some effort was directed\ntowards the furtive and well-camoufiaged ship-\nping which plied the coasts, seldom moving\nby day and never venturing far within the\nradius of action of strike aircraft. Such opera-\ntions were carried out with the purpose of\ndeterring the enemy from committing his sup-\nplies to the perils of the sea rather than of\ninking the ships en route. It was a policy\nof denial rather than of destruction. This\nchoice was necessary since shipping was never\nfrequent enough to justify intensive search for\nit, and the most remunerative targets were\ntherefore harbours, docks and port facilities. Of\nthese Mergui, Martaban, the new port of Khao\nHuagang, and Bangkok were most often\nattacked, and considerable destruction achieved.\nA typical intelligence report on a raid against\nBangkok in March, for example, was\u2014\u201c Con-\ncentrated and successful attack causing destruc-\ntion of forty per cent. of the storage units ;\nsixty Japs killed \u201d.\n\n116. Accepting that enemy shipping was hard\nto search out, Strategic Air Force had resort\nto the policy of hindering what it could not\ndestroy. Mining was already proved by photo-\ngraphic reconnaissance as being a profitable\nmethod of delaying the passage of supplies, for\nin harbours already mined there had been a\nserious curtailment of Japanese shipping, and\nsuch craft as continued to approach the har-\npours anchored outside so that cargoes had to\nbe lightered ashore.\n\n117. Thus from August onwards plans and\ntechnique for very long-range mining were\ndeveloped and soon bore fruit. In September\n\n(68741)\n\n1981\n\nthe Pakchan river, housing the newly con-\nstructed port of Khao Huagang, was heavily\nmined and the flow of coastal traffic seriously\ndisrupted. Similar operations against Bangkok,\nGoh Sichang and Tavoy followed. In October\na remarkably successful flight was carried out\nto the inner approaches of Penang harbour.\nFifteen Liberators each laid four 1,000 Ib. mines\n\u201cprecisely in the positions ordered\u201d, with no\nmishap or failure although the round trip was\nover three thousand miles. Such operations\ncontinued throughout the campaign against all\nports and anchorages along the Tenasserim\nCoast and from March onwards against those\nin the Gulf of Siam. Mining was the special\nand exclusive province of No. 159 Squadron\nR.A.F. who throughout the period laid the im-\npressive total of 1,953 mines at ranges which a\nyear before would have been considered im-\npossible, The following results were observed\nfrom reconnaissance:\n\n{i) Jap launch and passenger steamer sunk\nnear Victoria Point (February).\n\nGi) 3,000 ton tanker Kuisho Maru sunk at\nBangkok (January),\n\nGii) 200 ft. M.V.\n(March).\n\n(II) The Interdiction of the Southern Burma\nSupply Routes. .\n\n118. If the anti-shipping effort was intangible\nin effect, that against railways was spectacular,\nand its results immediately apparent. By far\nthe greatest attention was paid to the Bangkok-\nMoulmein railway on which an overall total of\n2,700 tons of bombs were dropped. With the\ninterdiction of nearly all alternative routes, this\nrailway was of paramount importance to the\nJapanese to supply and maintain their forces\nin Burma. Approximately two-thirds of the\nrailway pursues a winding course in jungle hill-\ncovered country, and it is not suitable for low-\nlevel attack, in addition to providing first-rate\nconcealment. But as the strength and efficacy\nof the bomber force grew and the Burma\u2014Siam\nrailway became more vital, techniques were\ndeveloped for its neutralisation. No precise\ndate can be given for the introduction of these\nmethods. A modus operandi was hammered\nout and in use before it became a doctrine, but\nits broad principles were as follows :\u2014\n\n(i) Bridges were the best targets because\nthey were the most vulnerable and the most\ndifficult to repair.\n\n(ii) The underlying motive was to isolate\nsegments of the line, and then to destroy at\ngreater leisure the rolling stock and locomo-\ntives stranded thereon.\n\n_  Gii) Diversity of attack was necessary to\nconfuse the enemy.\n\n(iv) Close photographic reconnaissance was\nmaintained to detect any abnormal build-up\nat sidings or stations which would repay\nattack,\n\n119. These principles were followed to such\ngood effect that between January and April the\naverage number of bridges unserviceable at one\ntime was 9.2 over the stretch of railway from\nPegu to Bangkok. It has been estimated that\nthis reduced the traffic from 700-800 tons to\n100-200 tons a day, \u2018The value of the attacks\nneeds no further emphasis.\n\nsunk at Bangkok\n\n",

Operations similar in concept but less\nin intensity were maintained against the\nBangkok\u2014Chiengmai line, the Kra Isthmus\nrailway, and the Bangkok\u2014Singapore line. In\nall cases, the enemy reacted by placing the\nstrongest A.A. defences he could muster along\nsuch a dispersed network of lines, by rebuilding\nand repairing bridges with beaver-like zeal, and\nby constructing as many as four by-pass struc-\ntures at one crossing to counter or anticipate\nour attack.\n\n(ID) Destruction of the Enemy\u2019s Powers of\nResistance within Burma.\n\n121. To sever the external supply routes was\nnot enough, for the enemy held at least six\nmonths\u2019 reserves of supplies that were contained\nin vast dumps, mainly dispersed in the Rangoon\narea. Therefore, during March and April,\nsystematic destruction was initiated on the\nRangoon Dumps in conjunction with XXth\nBomber Command. Their destruction was vital,\nsince with the stores contained therein the\nenemy might have been able to delay our ad-\nvance and even halt it above Toungoo. The\nDumps contained about 1,700 storage units well\ndispersed in revetments, and of these, photo-\ngraphic evidence alone showed 524 destroyed,\nand ground observers reported that well over\n50 per cent. destruction was achieved.\n\n122. The attacks on Japanese Headquarters\nand concentration areas can be illustrated by\na strike on 29th March against the Japanese\nBurma Area Army Headquarters located in\nRangoon. Reports indicate that four hundred\nJapanese, with a high proportion of officers,\nwere killed. News of the attack spread to the\nAllied prisoners in Rangoon, and was the\ncause of considerable encouragement to them.\nThe enemy\u2019s evacuation of the city a month\nlater is much more understandable in the light\nof these attacks, which made Rangoon such\na dangerous area even before ground forces\nwere within striking distance. Mandalay had\nalready suffered such attacks, notably one in\nJanuary when it was reported by agents that\nsix hundred Japanese were killed. The part\nplayed by such air blows in persuading the\nenemy to abandon his strategic positions earlier\nthan anticipated must surely have been great.\n\n* = \u00ae *\n\n\u201c Special Operations.\u201d\n\n123. Air operations in connection with\nintelligence and guerilla raising activities in\nthis theatre have increased greatly during the\npast year. From a strength of two squadrons\ntotalling 15 ULE. aircraft in June, 1944,\nresources were increased by the end of April,\n1945, to three squadrons and one flight totalling\n61 UE. aircraft. The dividend that has been\npaid definitely justified the effort involved.\nFrom a handful of informants supplying skimpy\ninformation at great risk, the organisations\ngrew, by the end of the campaign, into a\npowerful force capable of exerting a consider-\nable influence on the course of the battle,\nand the air effort to support them reached\na total of 372 sorties in the lunar month\n18th April to 17th May. Between November,\n1944, and May, 1945, over 1,350 sorties were\nflown, in which 2,100 tons of stores and 1,000\nliaison officers were dropped behind the enemy\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nlines. The effort for the preceding comparable\nperiod resulted in 34 tons of stores and 35\nbodies being parachuted in.\n\n124. One of the major results of the great\neffort involved was the prevention of the\nJapanese Fifteenth Army from taking any part\nin the defence of Toungoo during our advance,\nand rendering unnecessary the major battle\nwhich Fourteenth Army anticipated in front\nof the town. Other guerillas killed up to\nseven hundred Japanese, including a General,\nin the Toungoo-Rangoon area alone.\n\n125. From the Air Force point of view,\nthe great value of the Special Duty effort flown\nby Strategic Air Force was the provision of\ntargets for the tactical Groups. During the\nfinal fortnight of April almost the whole of.\nthe long-range Fighter-Bomber resources of\nNo. 224 Group were employed on Force 136\ntargets. Troop trains were caught at rest and\na pagoda reported as a petrol/ammunition\ndump blew up with a huge explosion.\n\n126. Special Duty operations in this theatre\nare of vital interest to the Air Forces in view\nof the difficulty of locating targets without\nthe help of informants. Thus the diversion of\neffort to secret work has not been grudged,\nand current developments, foreshadowed in\nthe RAF. Airborne Commando, will make\nthe information supplied by operators\nbehind the lines of even greater value.\nIt is emphasised that parties should\nbe thoroughly briefed in the limitations\nand potentialities of air strikes and that\nthey should develop a speedy and accurate\nmethod of reporting if a full harvest is to be\nteaped from the information whose garner-\n\ning d ids so much upon the operations\nof our S.D, squadrons. \u2018\n* * * *\nPart SEVEN.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHIC RECONNAISSANCE.\n\n127. At the opening of the period, photo-\ngraphic reconnaissance was carried out mainly\nby the aircraft of the Photographic Recon-\nnaissance Force commanded by Group Captain\nS. G. Wise, D.F.C. These included the Spit-\nfires, Mosquitos and Mitchells of 681 and 684\nSquadrons, R.A.F., operating from Alipore,\nand the Mustangs, Mitchells and Liberators of\nthree U.S.A.A.F. squadrons, the last of which\nspecialised in mapping. A fourth U.S.A.A.F.\nsquadron flying Lightnings, began to operate\nin September.\n\n128. The dense cloud banks habitually\nshrouding the operational area of South East\nAsia during the period of the monsoon inter-\nfered greatly with photographic reconnaissance,\nbut advantage was taken of the northward\npassage of the monsoon in August to procure\nthe first large-scale and survey cover of\nnorthern Sumatra by Mosquitos detached to\nOperate from Ceylon. \u2018Other detachments were\nlater sent eastwards to operate with the for-\nward tactical air force headquarters from\nTingawk Sakan (where at the beginning of\nSeptember an American tactical reconnaissance\nsquadron was placed under the P.R. Force),\nImphal, Comilla and Chittagong in preparation\nfor the forthcoming campaign, and these were\nlater reinforced and moved forward in step\n",

With the return of fair-weather con-\nditions in October, the effort of the photo-\ngraphic reconnaissance squadrons rose to its\nformer level, and during this month the daily\naverage of sorties represented over a third of\nthe total aircraft available in the whole force.\n\nThe methodical cover of enemy airfields, com-'\n\nmunications and other targets was resumed,\nsurvey photographs being supplied as required\nby Headquarters Air Command, and Head-\nquarters Allied Land Forces, South East Asia.\nIn proportion with the increased flying, the\nphotographic work of the photo sections of the\nP.R. Force was expanded, nearly 354,000\nprints being produced during January, 1945,\nthe peak month. Technical photographic\ndevelopments included the introduction of the\nmoving film camera on operational sorties, and\nthe fitting into Mosquito aircraft of forward\nfacing oblique cameras. The latter were first\nused on 14th February, when a set of stereo-\nscopic pairs covering the Burma-Siam railway\nwas thereby secured.\n\n130. An exceptionally | valuable photographic\nTeconnaissance of the Burma rice areas was\ncarried out by Squadron Leader C. Fox during\n1944. The results shown by an analysis of\nthe pictures were subsequently checked up on\nthe ground, and were found to be correct\nwithin 5 per cent.\n\n131. The main hindrances to the operations\nof the P.R. Force continued, even in the\ncampaigning season, to be factors inseparable\nfrom flying in the tropics rather than the oppo-\nsition of the enemy, which remained slighter\nthan was usual in other theatres of war.\nSuccessful cover of the waterfront at Akyab,\nfor instance, was secured in November, 1944,\nby two Spitfires flying at from 50 to 200 feet,\nat neither of which a shot was fired. But\nthe lengthening range of Mosquito sorties\nmonth by month bore witness to the mastery\nof climate and terrain. Jt was in December,\n1944, that the first cover of Puket Island was\nobtained, in the course of a flight involving\na round trip of 2,100 miles, which marked the\nfurthest penetration to be made in this area.\nThis record was, however, eclipsed by another\naircraft which in January flew 2,431 air miles\nin eight hours and 20 minutes to cover\nMoulmein and the railway from Bangkok to\nPhnom Penh. Finally on 22nd March a\nMosquito XVI broke the long distance record\nfor this type of aircraft in any theatre of war\nwith a flight of 2,493 air miles in eight hours\nforty-five minutes, covering the Bangkok-\nSingapore railway to a point south of the\nMalayan frontier. It was thus that the\nMosquito made amends for the structural\ndefect which had seriously curtailed its use\nduring November and December, 1944.\n\n132. The work of the P.R. Force was co-\nordinated at one end with the short-range\nphotography of the tactical reconnaissance\nsquadrons, while at the other end, long dis-\ntance survey work over Malaya was undertaken\nby the Superfortresses of XXth Bomber\nCommiand, U.S.A.AF The P.R. Force was\n\n1983\n\nresponsible, for instance, for all the workaday\nsurvey and mapping required by the Fourteenth\nArmy. As the Officer Commanding, No. 11\nIndian Air Survey Liaison Section, R.E.,\n\nTeported in February, 1945, 684 Squadron,\nR.A-F. alone had achieved, in twelve months,\nthree-quarters of the basic cover for the whole\ncampaign and 1/30,000 cover for maps, photo-\nmaps and artillery block plots over the battle\nlines from Dimapur nearly to Rangoon and\nMoulmein. The work of photographic recon-\nnaissance in general in this theatre has, of\ncourse, been of all the greater importance owing\nto the comparatively meagre intelligence avail-\nable from ground sources ; for air force pur-\nposes alone it provided an indispensable factor\nin the maintenance of Allied air superiority by\nproviding speedy evidence of the location of\nenemy aircraft, while the work of the Strategic\nAir Force would have been unprofitable with-\nout the coverage of targets it furnished.\n\n* * * *\n\nPart EIGHT.\n\nGENERAL RECONNAISSANCE.\n\n133. As the period under review opened, a\ndeal of uncertainty existed as to whether the\nIndian Ocean U-boat warfare would be inten-\nsified by the arrival of long-range German\nU-boats. Such a possibility was not im-\nprobable, and had the contemplated threat\nmaterialised then, all General Reconnaissance\nair power in this theatre would have been\nharnessed under the co-ordinating and super-\nvising control of IOGROPS.*\n\n134. The period from June to August wit-\nnessed a decided increase in enemy U-boat\nwarfare, although at no time can it be said\nthat the threat reached alarming proportions.\nDuring these three months the enemy (operat-\ning with considerable wariness) sank thirteen\nships of the medium-sized merchant vessel\nclass, and, ii turn, suffered the loss of one\nsubmarine as a result of a combined attack by\naircraft and Naval Force 66.\n\n135. In July, a concentration of enemy units\nin and around the shipping lanes to the east\nof the Maldives\u2014resulting in the loss of five\nships\u2014portended a possible menace. In this\nconnection it is worthy of comment that\nCatalina aircraft employed on rescue searches\nco-operated in the location and eventual rescue\nof 244 survivors.\n\n136. Having regard to the amount of ship-\nping in the Indian Ocean, and the fact that\nduring August there were possibly five German\nunits operating in these waters, the enemy\u2019s\nachievements might be considered singularly\npaltry. This is a tribute to the constant vigi-\nlance of General Reconnaissance aircraft in\nthe flying of anti-U-boat sweeps and patrols.\nSuch a policy might not have produced many\nsightings and kills\u2014a consideration of the\nimmense expanses of ocean to be guarded will\nclearly show the difficulty of locating enemy\nunits\u2014but it kept U-boats submerged and out\nof range of our shipping.\n\n137. With September came a falling-off in\nU-boat operations, and this\u2019 was continued\nduring October and November. A slight in-\n\n* Indian Ocean G.R. Operations.\n",

The plans that were prepared to this end\nduring the monsoon of 1944 envisaged an\nelaborate series of airborne assaults that did\nnot appreciate the reliability and self-sufficiency\nof an army supplied unstintingly from the air.\nIndeed, had it then been suggested that\nRangoon could be reached by an army travel-\nling overland and supplied largely by air, the\nproposal would not have received serious con-\nsideration. The overall strategy can best be\njudged from the four main plans which were\nformulated during the 1944 monsoon :\u2014\n\n(i) Plan \u201cX\u201d involved an overland\nadvance from the Mogaung-Myitkyina area\nto Katha and Bhamo, co-ordinated with\n\n\u2018\n\nSUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nanother advance from Imphal to the Chind-\nwin and an airborne operation in the\nvicinity of Wuntho. The furthest penetra-\ntion that was envisaged was the occupation\nof territory north of a line stretching between\nKalewa and Lashio.\n\nGi) Plan \u201cY\u201d intended to employ air-\nborne troops in the seizure of Kalewa, and\na second air landing at the point of debouch-\nment into the Mandalay plain to exploit the\nconfusion that would be caused.\n\nii) Plan \u201cZ\u201d entailed an airborne\niassault in strength with all transport aircraft\nin the theatre immediately north of Rangoon,\nto capture the city.\n\n{iv) General Stilwell\u2019s plan was for British\nforces to press forward towards Shwebo-\nMandalay, while N.C.A.C.* profited by the\ndiversion to occupy Bhamo, whence they\ncould mount an airborne operation to\ncapture Lashio.\n\n10. The part that the Air Forces were to\nplay in these operations was given in an Opera-\ntional Directive in which the order of priorities\nwas interesting, putting as it did close support\nand transport operations very low in the scale.\nIn the event, a reorientation of tasks took place\nwhich gave greater emphasis to the work of\nclose support and air supply. The results of\nsuch a shift in the centre of gravity to a machine\ngeared to the classical form of air warfare in-\nvolved changes in organisation, control, supply\nand maintenance which are discussed at more\nlength in the appropriate context.\n\n11. Plans \u201c Y\u201d and \u201cZ\u201d were approved in\nprinciple by the Chiefs of Staff in July and\nAugust, and called \u201c Capital\u201d and \u201c Dracula \u201d\nTespectively. In point of fact, however, opera-\ntions in Central Burma progressed more\nquickly than anticipated. \u2018Continually out-\nfianked by Allied forces, to whom the manna\nof air supply gave an unprecedented degree\nof mobility, and continually harried by our\nclose support aircraft, the enemy was never\nallowed to consolidate the new positions that\nhe occupied along the line of his retreat. Thus\nby January, the airborne aspect of \u201c Capital\u201d\nhad been rendered unnecessary, a fact which\ncaused great relief to the Allied Commanders,\nfor it was increasingly evident that the trans-\nport aircraft to train for and launch the opera-\ntion, scheduled for mid-February, would be\ndifficult to find from, existing resources.\n\n12. Operation \u201cDracula\u201d was to be the\ngreatest airborne operation yet conceived, in-\nvolving a fly-in over a distance of 480 miles\nby some 900 transport aircraft and 650 gliders.\nThe necessity for retaining these forces in\nEurope, and their high attrition rate in opera-\ntions there, precluded their re-deployment in\nthis theatre as planned, and in October\n\u201cDracula\u201d was postponed with the prospect\nof not being mounted until the winter of\n1945-46.\n\n13. The emphasis now lay on Central Burma.\nOperations. An advance to the Monywa-\nMandalay area was considered to be the\nfurthest point that could be reached before the\n1945 monsoon. Exploitation further south\nwas not thought to be practicable in view of\nthe difficulties of supply. In the event, the\n\n* Northern Combat Area Command.\n",

As an explanation of this it is reasonable\nto assume that American aggressiveness in the\nChina Seas and the Pacific was absorbing the\nattention of Japan, as was the European war\nthe attention of Germany. Thus the expected\nthreat did not develop but rather declined, and\nas a consequence the need for an over-all\ncentralised control as vested in the organisation\nof IOGROPS diminished with the declining U-\nboat threat.\n\n* %* * *\n\nOffensive General Reconnaissance.\n\n138.

But it was be-\ncoming apparent that the U-boat threat no\nlonger existed. Therefore, in the due con-\nsideration of alternative employment was con-\nceived the undertaking of an offensive role.

The success of these operations, although\nnot immediately apparent, will be revealed with\nthe broadening of the operational scene in this\ntheatre.\n\n140.

A second Liberator squadron\u2014No. 203\u2014\nbegan to augment the anti-shipping effort in\nMarch.

The last four months had seen General\nReconnaissance changing the nature of its\noperational function with deftness and adapt-\nability, The reinforcement and development of\nthis new offensive role was envisaged during\nMarch, when No. 346 Wing was formed at\nAkyab, to provide escort for \u201cforward area\u201d\nconvoys and to make easily available a strik-\ning force against enemy shipping off the Arakan\nand Burmese Coasts.\n\n142.

If this situation did not develop,\nthen the inherent mobility of such a unit could\nbe usefully adapted to the requirements of Air\nSea Rescue and Transport operations, where,\nas always, the lack of immediate land-bases\nestablishes a major problem.\n\n143. The period closed on an encouraging\nnote. General Reconnaissance had already\nstruck a worthwhile blow at enemy shipping,\nand plans were in hand for an intensifying\nof these operations in the months to come. In\nconsidering the strategic plan of anti-shipping\nsorties, mention should be made of the invalu-\nable contribution of those General Recon-\nnaissance Liberator and Mosquito aircraft\nbased on Ceylon, in their day and night photo-\ngraphic reconnaissance over the Andamans,\nNicobar Islands, Northern Sumatra and parts of\nMalaya.

Administrative development of Air\nCommand, South East Asia, during the year\nwas dictated by the following factors :\u2014\n\n(@ The move of Command Headquarters\nto Kandy.\n\nGi) The need for identifying group ad-\nministrative areas inside India with the\ngeographical boundaries of the Indian Army\nCommand.\n\n(iii) The traditional problem of adminis-\ntering units spread over vast areas with in-\nsufficient resources.\n\n(iv) The desirability of removing from\noperational formations extraneous adminis-\ntrative burdens.\n\n{v) The necessity for providing operational\nunits with greater mobility. .\n\n(vi) The planning of the administrative\nnetwork to sustain and control units advan-\ncing into Burma.\n\n(vii) The formation of new units in antici-\npation of future operations, while hardly\nmeeting present commitments with existing\nresources in manpower and material.\n\n(viii) The development on an unpre-\ncedented scale of air supply for the Allied\nforces advancing into Burma.\n\n145. The primary British interests in South\nEast Asia were the re-conquest of Burma, the\nFederated Malay States and Singapore, the\nNetherland East Indies, Thailand and French\nIndo-China. British air responsibilities in South\nEast Asia also included the air defence of\nIndia and of Allied shipping in the Indian\n\u2018Ocean, the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Ben-\ngal.

The extensive re-organizations which\ntook place during 1944-45 were effected against\na background of strict and cumbrous control of\nexpenditure by the Government of India, and\nof dependence upon India through the organiza-\ntion known as the War Projects Co-ordination\nand Administrative Committee for the provi-\nsion of resources. There was, too, a crippling\nshortage of manpower in precisely those trades\nwhich make for good administration\u2014non-fly-\ning officers (notably signals and maintenance\nstaffs), clerks G/D., equipment assistants, cooks\nand the like. Moreover, the growing body of\nAir Command continually bumped its head\nagainst the Command manpower ceiling. It\nis not intended to infer that the RAF. in\nSouth East Asia was badly served in relation\nto other commands, for it was well under-\nstood that the allocation of manpower had to\nbe assessed in relation to theatre requirements.\nNevertheless, it was considered that perhaps\nthe incidence of and the remedies for the grow-\ning pains experienced were not fully recognised\nat home. \u2018\n\n* * * *\n\nThe Move of Headquarters, Air Command, to\nCeylon.\n\n147. The move of the Command Head-\nquarters to Kandy was compelled by the in-\nsistence of the Supreme Allied Commander that\nhis Commanders-in-Chief should work beside\nhim. It was, however, rendered the more\nacceptable to Air Command on account of the\ngrowing need for divorcing operational and\nhigher administrative control from the exten-\nsive and complicated negotiations necessary\nwith the Government of India and with G.H.Q.,\nIndia, relative to administrative services, which\nhad tended to hamper the primary tasks of the\nAllied Air Commander-in-Chief.\n\n148. The institution of H.Q. Base Air Forces\nat New Delhi, had, therefore, many advantages.\nIt liberated the Air Commander-in-Chief and\nhis staff from direct day to day responsibilities\nfor developing India as a base, and thus\nenabled him to address his attention more\nclosely to the general problems of planning\nand policy control.\n\n149. Before Base Air Forces was established\nand re-organisation was under consideration, it\nwas generally supposed that a vertical split\nbetween the Air Staff and Administrative\nBranches offered the best solution to a com-\nplex problem. This meant that operations\nsections of the staff would move with the Air\nCommander-in-Chief to Kandy while the\nadministrative sections remained at New Delhi.\nIt was intended that administrative representa-\ntion at Kandy should be effected by the pro-\nvision of small cells or projections of the\nadministrative \u2018branches concerned, which\nwould work in an advisory and liaison capacity.\nThis at the time, was broadly the view of Air\nChief Marshal Sir Richard Peirse.\n\n150. Difficulties ahead if such an administra-\ntive set-up was adopted at New Delhi as\nsuggested, were foreseen by Air Vice-Marshal\nGoddard. The reins of higher administrative\n\n(68741)\n\n1985\n\ncontrol and policy, he considered, must in the\nfirst instance, be held firmly at Air Command\nin order to effect perfect co-ordination with the\nAir Commander-in-Chief and the operational\nbranches at Kandy. Beside, the geographic\nfactor was an important consideration, for Delhi\nwas fifteen hundred miles from Kandy.\n\n151. A new scheme which would more effec-\ntively meet the situation once re-organisation\nwas established and yet ensure the retention\nof higher administrative control at Air Com-\nmand, was brought up for consideration during\nthe visit of Air Vice-Marshal Goddard to\nLondon in July, 1944. This revised project\nwas, in the main, largely adopted when, at the\nbeginning of October, Headquarters Air Com-\nmand moved to Kandy and Headquarters Base\nAir Forces was formed at New Delhi.\n\n152. The essence of the new arrangement\nlay in the retention at New Delhi of an admin-\nistrative staff competent to deal with all ques-\ntions, save the important policy matters, direct\nwith the analogous departments of General\nHeadquarters, India, and the Government of\nIndia. This ensured adequate Air Force\nrepresentation at the centre of political power\nin India and, at the same time, avoided the\ncreation of a duplicate headquarters under Air\nCommand for which neither the men nor the\nmeans were to hand. The administrative ser-\nvices, whose heads remained in Delhi were,\nnevertheless, represented at Kandy by re-\nsponsible and independent skeleton staffs under\na senior officer competent to inform and advise\non his own specialist topic as required, so that\nbroad policy might properly be formulated at\nthe Headquarters of Air Command.\n\n153. During October and November, 1944,\nthere persisted a considerable amount of uncer-\ntainty as to the basis on which the administra-\ntive machi would ultimately rest. For\ninstance, as matters of high policy were decided\nat Kandy, it was decided by the Air\nCommander-in-Chief that he must have by his\nside the head of the service primarily con-\ncerned. This applied successively to the\nPrincipal Medical Officer, Command\nAccountant, the Command Welfare Officer and\nthe Command Catering Officer, and finally to\nthe Air Officer in charge of Training.\n\n154. The situation was finally crystallised\nand clarified in October, when a revised\u2019 direc-\ntive was issued to the Air Marshal Command-\ning Base Air Forces. For all day to day\nmatters affecting administrative services, the\nheads of those services were solely responsible\nto the Air Marshal Commanding Base Air\nForces. But when matters of administrative\npolicy affecting the Command as a whole arose,\nthen the heads of the administrative services\nwere responsible to the Allied Air Commander-\nin-Chief through the Air Officer (Administra-\ntion) (A.O.A.), Headquarters, Air Command.\nSimilarly, when matters of new Command\npolicy came under discussion and the agree-\nment of the Government of India was required,\nthe heads of the administrative services con-\ncerned were empowered by the Air Com-\nmander-in-Chief, through the A.O.A. Air Com-\nmand, to deal with their opposite numbers in\nG.H.Q. India, on behalf of the Air C.-in-C.\n\n155. As a corollary to this arrangement, the\nstaff officers under the A.O.A., Air Command at\nKandy were not established as mere liaison\n\n\u00a2c\n",

But the separa-\ntion of the Supreme Allied Commander and the\nHeadquarters of his Commanders-in-Chief from\n- the seat of the Government of India and duality\nof channels to the United Kingdom Govern-\nment\u2014either through the Government of India\nor direct\u2014constituted an abnormal situation.\n\n156. The value and effectiveness of the base\norganisation thus created was endorsed by the\nAir Member for Supply and Organisation\n(A.MS.O.) during his visit in February, 1945.\nAir Chief Marshal Sir Christopher Courtney\nwas impressed by the extent of the negotiations\nwhich were necessary in New Delhi with the\nmumerous organisations concerned with the\nconduct of the war from India. He counselled\na progressive decentralisation of functions to\nBase Air Forces and its gradual endowment\nwith a greater measure of autonomy ; this was\nof course in keeping with the original scheme\nand was accordingly pursued.\n\n* * * *\n\nDisbandment of Third Tactical Air Force and\nFormation of H.Q., R.A.F., Bengal-Burma,\n157. Eastern Air Command, from its forma-\ntion in December, 1943, onwards, was an ex-\nclusively operational Headquarters with no\nadministrative responsibilities. When its Head-\nquarters moved to Calcutta in March, 1944,\nadministrative services for the area of Eastern\n(Army) Command were being provided by\nHeadquarters No. 231 Group, and this Head-\nquarters also administered the R.A.F. element\nof Eastern Air Command. But it was clearly\nanomalous that a Bomber Group engaged in\nactive operations should continue to be saddled\nwith the wide responsibilities for administra-\ntion which were of no concern to the Strategic\nAir Force,\n\n158. This, and other considerations pointing\ntowards a re-organisation of the groups in\nIndia, was discussed with the A.M.S.O. in\nAugust, 1944. The logical course would have\nbeen to confer administrative responsibilities\nupon the R.AF. Element of Eastern Air Com-\nmand and to form a new Group Headquarters\nunder it to exercise them. But owing to the\nmanpower shortage it was impossible to create\na new headquarters altogether distinct from\nHeadquarters, Eastern Air Command, and it\nwas therefore agreed that H.Q. No. 231 Group\nshould give up its extraneous administrative\nresponsibilities, and that the administrative staff\nso released should be reconstituted as Air\nHeadquarters, Bengal. At the same time, the\nDeputy Air Commander, Eastern Air Com-\nmand, was to become Air Officer Commanding,\nBengal, with administrative responsibilities\nextending eastwards as far as the Brabmaputra.\nThey could not be further extended, since this\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nwould have meant that the Air Marshal Com-\nmanding, Third Tactical Air Force, would\nhave been administratively subordinated to the\nthe Air Vice-Marshal, A.O.C. Bengal.\n\n159. It was therefore decided to propose\nthe disbandment of Headquarters, Third\nTactical Air Force. For such a course\nthere were other good reasons outside\nthe administrative sphere\u2014operationally, the\ntitle was now a misnomer, since in June, 1944,\nthe Tenth U.S.A.AF, had been reconstituted\nas an independent formation under Eastern\nAir Command, and the Headquarters of the\nFourteenth Army was due after the opening\nof the new campaign to move forward to\nImphal, where Headquarters, No. 221 Group\nhad long been established, leaving XV Corps\nin the Arakan to operate independently under\nthe G.O.C.-in-C., Allied Land Forces.\nAuthority for the disbandment of Head-\nquarters, Third Tactical Air Force was given\nin October, 1944.\n\n160. The disbandment of Third T.AF.\ninvolved also the expansion of Headquarters,\nNo. 221 Group and the allotment to Eastem\nAir Command of direct operational control of\nall its subordinate operational formations. The\ndate of this further re-organisation was timed\nto synchronize with the move of Headquarters,\nFourteenth Army to Imphal beside Head-\nquarters, No. 221 Group, and the establish-\nment of Advanced Headquarters, Allied Land\nForces, alongside Eastern Air Command at\nCalcutta. This move took place on 4th\nDecember when the Air Marshal Commanding,\nThird Tactical Air Force, became Deputy Air\nCommander, Easter Air Command and Air\nMarshal Commanding, R.A.F., Bengal-Burma.\n\n161. Headquarters, R.A.F., Bengal-Burma\nwas the name given to the administrative\nformation now brought into existence to com-\nbine the functions of R.A.F. Bengal and the\nadministrative responsibilities \u2014_ previously\nwielded by Third T.A.F. Geographically, its\ntesponsibilities covered both the base area of\nBengal and the more easterly marches, bit by\ndit being extended into Burma with the\nadvance of the Fourteenth Army. The military\nsuzerain of the former was G.H.Q., India, and\nof the latter, Headquarters Allied Land Forces.\nHeadquarters, Bengal-Burma was accordingly\nbuilt up on a dual basis commensurate with\nthe existence of two sets of army authorities\nwith which it would have to deal, and also\nwith an eye to future development whenever\nthe reconquest of Burma should compel it.\nThis stage was reached in. February, 1945,\nwhen it became possible to carry out the\nanticipated divorce between Bengal and Burma\ncomponents of the Air Marshal Commanding\u2019s\nprovince. R.A.F. Bengal was then expanded\ninto Headquarters, No. 228 Group and\nreturned to Base Air Forces, though the filling\nof its establishments proved a slow process.\n\n* * * =\n\nAdministrative and Training Groups.\n\n162. In order to ensure better co-ordina-\ntion of administrative services, to facilitate\ncombined training, and to ensure close liaison\non internal security measures, the groups in\nIndia underwent a rationalization of their areas\n\u2018to coincide with those of the army formations.\n",

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT To Taz LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nThis measure was brought to its logical con-\nclusion by the formation of No. 228 Group\nin February, 1945, to provide functional and/\nor administrative control of ail units of Base\nAir Forces within the area of Eastern (Army)\nCommand, and to provide R.A.F. administrative\nservices within that area. As Eastern (Army)\nCommand extends its boundaries to the Burma\nfrontier, the area of responsibility of No. 228\nGroup will expand. R.A-F. India is thus split\nup between four administrative and training\ngroups.\n\n* * * *\n\nIntroduction of Wing H.Q. and Servicing\nEchelon Organisation.\n\n163. In the Far East more than in the\nmetropolitan air force, the administrative\nproblems confronting junior operational com-\nmanders are such as to hinder them in the\nperformance of their primary tasks. In recog-\nnition of this and to improve the mobility and\nflexibility of the wing organisation, it was\ndecided to introduce the principle of wing\nheadquarters and servicing echelons for single-\nengined and light twin-engined aircraft. The\nscheme came into effect by the end of Sep-\ntember, 1944, with the wing headquarters based\non certain major airfields, and the servicing\nechelons became responsible for the upkeep\nof the squadron aircraft. The squadrons were\nthereby relieved of the responsibility for their\nown administration and most of their first-line\nmaintenance.\n\n164. In anticipation of a more mobile kind\nof warfare, it became necessary in December,\n1944, to remove the geographical restriction\nimplied by naming the wing according to its\ncurrent location. The wings were accordingly\ngiven numbers, and their attitude to mobility\nthus greatly enhanced, as evidenced by the\nadvance of No. 906 Wing from Imphal to\nRangoon in six months, in a series of well-\norganized moves. The scheme has been\nsuccessful, and its principle has been extended\nto other squadrons in order to centralize control\nof resources and administration and to\neconomise in overheads.\n\n165. Perhaps one factor has marred full\nadvantage being taken of the inherent mobility\nand flexibility which the organisation would\nafford. The provision of more servicing\nechelons than squadrons would allow of peak\nperiods of operational effort at very short\nnotice from advance airfields, for an additional\nservicing echelon could be flown in to supple-\nment the existing maintenance personnel. This\nlesson was learned at Akyab where the provi-\ndential presence of a servicing commando\nallowed of a much higher rate of effort from\nthe island during the early days of the occupa-\ntion than would otherwise have been possible.\n\n* * * *\n\nThe Manpower Situation.\n\n166. The Command has been continually\nhampered by an ill-balanced allotment of man-\npower, whereby shortages have been concen-\ntrated in certain vital trades, rendering the\nadministrative machine extremely difficult to\noperate efficiently.\n\n1987\n\n167. In June, 1944, the establishment and\nstrength of the Command for ground British\npersonnel were as follows:\u2014\n\nEstablish- Strength Shortage\n\nment\nOfficers 6,277 5,170 1,107\nOther 1anks ... 88,636 80,967 7,669\n94,913 86,137 8,776\n\nThe deficiency of 18 per cent. in ground\nofficers was concentrated principally in such\nimportant branches as Admin. G., Tech. (E),\nCode and Cypher and the like. The airman\ndeficiency of 9 per cent. more seriously affected\nthe clerical trades.\n\n168. By May, 1945, the position had\nchanged, but not improved, as the following\nfigures and illustrations will show:\u2014 .\n\nEstablish- Strength Shortage\n\nment or\n\nSurplus\n\nOfficers 8,103 7,573 530\nShortage\n\nOther ranks ... 105,470 110,459 = 4,989\nSurplus\n\nTotal 113,573 118,032 4,459\nSurplus\n\n169. The 64 per cent. deficiency in ground\nofficers affects principally the following\nbranches, Admin., Code and Cyphers, Tech.\n@), Catering, etc. The shortages in the\nTechnical Branch have caused particular\ndifficulty. The overall 5 per cent. surplus in\nairmen does not give a true picture of the\nsituation, for there are very serious deficiencies\nin clerical and domestic personnel which are\nhampering the development of the Command.\u201d\nClerks G/D are below establishment by no\nJess than 36 per cent., Equipment Assistants by\n29 per cent. and Cooks by 28 per cent. The\nsurplus was concentrated in the technical\ntrades and amounted to 7,100. Such a surplus\nwas more of a liability than an asset, since it\ncreated additional work for the already over-\nburdened administrative and domestic per-\nsonnel and could not be used to offset the\nshortages elsewhere.\n\n170. Since February, 1945, very strenuous\nefforts have been made to disband redundant\nunits and prune such establishments as can\nconceivably be reduced. The diminishing air\nthreat to the east coast of India and Ceylon\nhas made it possible to thin out the early warn-\ning Radar system, and considerable economies\nhave been effected. Much has been done to\ndistribute the shortages where they could more\neasily be borne, and it was Command policy\nto make the strongest where it was most\neffective, that was nearest to the enemy.\n\n* * * .\n\nConclusion.\n\n171. The administrative network covering\nthe vastness of India is now as complete and\nrational as present resources allow. It cannot\nbe said, however, that the administrative\nproblems of the Command are now solved. As\nthe armies advance, the area to be controlled\ngrows, and the net is in many places thin.\n",

It was realised at an early\nstage that it was impossible to have the same\nmaintenance system operating throughout the\nCommand, since the extensive topographical\ndiversities encountered necessitated that the\nultimate systems adopted be dictated by the\ngeography of the country. Broadly speaking,\ntherefore, one system applies in Ceylon and\nIndia as far eastwards as the Brahmaputra,\nand an entirely different one was evolved to\noperate throughout Assam and Burma. In\nthe former area conditions are more or less\nstatic, the ground communications, although\ngreatly inferior to those of Europe, are reason-\nably good with no considerable land or water\nbarriers. \u2018Here, a large and efficient base\nmaintenance organisation has been built up\nwhich provides adequate backing for the air\nforces far beyond the Brahmaputra ; it is in\nthis base area that the Base Repair Depots,\nEquipment Depots and Aircraft Storage Units\nare to be found. In Assam and Burma, how-\never, the situation bears a vastly different\nappearance, patsimonious communications\nfrom Calcutta to the railhead at Dimapur and\nthence by road over the Naga and Chin Hills\nto Central Burma prohibited the use of a main-\ntenance organisation which was possible in\nEngland and which, to a limited degree, has\nalso been found possible in India.\n\n173. From the time of the siege of Imphal\nto the capture of Rangoon, air lift, the prin-\ncipal means of supply to our combat Army and\nAir Force formations, was restricted to essen-\ntial needs and could not be provided to support\navoidable maintenance at forward airfields.\nAs a result, a policy was agreed of flying air-\ncraft back to India for comparatively simple\nservicing requirements such as periodical\ninspections and engine changes. This obviated\nthe necessity for flying spare engines and to\nsome extent, equipment and spares, into the\nforward areas; at the same time it increased\nthe mobility of squadrons and reduced their\nmaintenance personnel requirements. Aircraft\nwhich crashed away from airfields had\nnormally to be written off charge, while those\nwhich crashed on airfields, provided the\ndamage was not too great, were repaired on\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nthe site. Surface movement back to India\nwas restricted to a minimum, since damage to\nan aircraft during transit in this part of the\nworld is normally so great that it is beyond\neconomical repair on arrival at its destination.\nOn occasions, damaged fighter aircraft were\ndismantled and flown back to India, the\nservicing personnel becoming so expert that\nthey were able to pack the whole of a fighter\naircraft and its components into one Dakota\nfuselage.\n\n174. Owing to the speed and intensity at\nwhich the campaign was being fought, and the\nvital need to capture the strategic base of\nRangoon before the onset of the monsoon, I\ndecided that all the normal rates of effort must\nGe exceeded, and all our Air Force resources\nwere thrown into the battle. During one\nmonth of 1945, no less than 700 aircraft passed\nthrough the Aircraft Storage Units and\nReserve Aircraft Pools in order to provide\nreplacements for the 75 squadrons operating\neast of Calcutta. During the early stages of\nthe campaign, the small number of combat\nlosses introduced a major maintenance com-\nplication, since low wastage rates, giving air-\ncraft a long life, placed upon the repair\norganisation a storage commitment which had\nnot been foreseen. A further strain was\ncaused by severe deterioration owing to\nclimatic conditions, such as to subject aircraft\nto monsoon rains accompanied by sudden\nbursts of sunshine. This had an adverse effect\nupon the timber, fabric, rubber and electrical\nparts of aircraft. In the autumn of 1944, for\ninstance, Mosquito aircraft had to be grounded\nas a result of such defects, until extensive re-\npairs had been effected.\n\n175. The maintenance organisation in the\nforward areas consisted of the Repair and Sal-\nvage Units (R. and S.U.) supporting squadrons\nat their airfields, and taking on all work which\nthe flying units could not complete within forty-\neight hours. Air Stores Parks held sufficient\nstocks of spares and equipment for three\nmonths supply, and the Forward Repair Depots\nwhich were located far enough forward to\nundertake major inspections and repairs beyond\nR. & S.U. capacity. In addition Motor Trans-\nport Light Repair Depots were deployed in\nthe forward areas, and the importance of their\nwork can be measured by the fact that in traver-\nsing the tortuous line of communication from\nCalcutta through Dimapur and Imphal to\ncentral Burma, mechanical transport vehicles\nhad expended the major part of their useful\nlives before reaching their destination. Thus\na great deal of ingenuity and inventiveness on\nthe part of M/T servicing personnel was neces-\nsary in order to keep vehicles running, vehicles\nwhich in base areas would have been scrapped.\n\n176. The maintenance effort in Burma can\nbest be summarized as a triumph of improvisa-\ntion to overcome bad climate and worse ter-\nrain, the paucity of spares, tools and equipment\nwhich was designed for the European theatre\nof war and not designed to be flown over,\ndriven through or manhandled in the cruel\ncountry of Assam and Burma. The overload-\ning of home production, and the overriding\nneed to finish off the western war first, were\nadequate reasons for this situation, and the\nmaintenance effort during the period which cul-\nminated in the capture of Rangoon was very\n",

That\nthis was achieved speaks volumes for the\u2018tena-\ncity, skill and loyalty of the maintenance\npersonnel.\n\n* * * *\n\n(ID) Internal Air Lines.\n\n177. The growth of air routes during the past\nyear is best illustrated by the following\nfigures :\u2014\n\nFreight Mail\n\nMay, 1944 2,103 166,313 Ibs. 99,435 Ibs.\nApril, 1945 11,514 1,579,119 Ibs. 777,944 Ibs.\n\n(178. This rapid increase was attributable to\na greater intensity of operations, and better\nplanning followed somewhat tardily by a\ngrowth of resources. At the beginning of the\ncampaign, one squadron (No. 353) shouldered\nthe whole burden while still largely equipped\nwith Hudsons. In July, 1944, No. 52 Squad-\nron was formed, and by flying 19,000 hours\nwithout an accident, speedily gained an excel-\nlent reputation for its high standard of operat-\ning and freedom from accidents over routes\nthat include the hazardous flight over the Hump\nto China. In April, 1945, a flight of No. 232\nSquadron, equipped with Liberator C-87 air-\ncraft, began to operate on the Jonger routes,\nforming the most recent addition to a force\nthe strength of which has grown to two and a\nhalf squadrons.\n\n179. Parallel action to build up a ground\norganisation to handle greater traffic and more\ncomplex problems was necessary. To this end,\nstatic transport wings have been established at\nDethi, Karachi and Calcutta; that at Delhi\nwas intended eventually to move to Rangoon.\nLocated at nodal points on the trunk routes,\nthese wings also gave advice on all matters\naffecting air transport and ferrying to the group\nin whose area they were located. When their\nestablishments were fully implemented, 229\nGroup Headquarters was relieved of a great\ndeal of day to day work in administering some\nsixty units spread over India.\n\n180. Even now, internal air communications\nwithin the theatre are not adequate. This fact\ncannot be fully realised by anyone who has not\nappreciated the vastness of India from a rail-\nway cattiage or travelled over roads on which\nthe twentieth century has barely left its mark.\nMoreover, in a sub-continent whose urban\ncentres are so distant from one another, it is\noften necessary to plan an operation eight\nhundred miles from its mounting base, while\nthe allocation of resources may be effected from\nanother centre which may be fifteen hundred\nmiles from the controlling headquarters.\nFurthermore, the major base for the prosecu-\ntion of a campaign in southern Burma, Malaya\nor Java, is still India, and the need for swift\ncommunication between base and combat area\nis another continually growing commitment for\nsquadrons who serve an area ranging from\nKarachi to Kunming and from Peshawar to\nCeylon.\n\n181. At times, local operational tasks have\nmade the diversion of aircraft from internal\nroutes to air supply a tempting solution to a\npressing problem. This temptation has always\nb\u00e9en resisted, and it is a first principle that the\n\nPassengers\n\n\u00b0\n\n1989\n\nvital arteries of South-East Asia Command\nshall remain open. The mobility of the staffs,\nthe despatch of urgent freight, close contact\nwith the battle areas, and the building up of\nIndia as a base, must always be a prime con-\nsideration when assessing priorities for air\ntransport resources in this theatre. Not only\nis the work of all three services dependent upon\nspeedy communication over long distances ; it\nis on the air routes that the Air Force can\nTeap a dividend from the transport aircraft\nwhich are so frequently operated for the benefit\nof others. The R.A.F. should also use the speed\nand flexibility of its transport squadrons to\nimprove the efficiency of its own organisation.\n\n182. Air Command has derived great benefit\nfrom the Transport Groups allotted to this\ntheatre, which has made possible a closer study\nof transport problems and a more effective\nsupervision of this specialised type of flying.\nThe improvement in operating standards is well\nillustrated by the accident rate. In October,\n1943, there were 49 accidents per 10,000 hours\nof transport and ferry flights. By April, 1945,\nthe rate had been reduced to 9 per 10,000\nhours. Such an improvement reflects the\ngreatest credit on all concerned and demon-\nstrates the close co-operation which has been\nachieved: between South-East Asia and Trans-\nport Command. :\n\n* * * *\n\n(IV) The R.A.F. Regiment.\n\n183. Until mid-1944 the strength of' the\nR.A.F. Regiment was deployed to the extent\nof rather more than two-thirds in machine gun\nanti-aircraft units, and the remainder in field\nsquadrons designed for an infantry role. Events\nthen forced a fundamental revision of the part\nfor which the R.A.F. Regiment in South East\nAsia was cast. It had become apparent that\nadvanced airfields, radar sites and other air\nforce installations would not necessarily be\nguarded if their locations did not happen to\nfit into the tactical schemes adopted by the\nlocal army formations, and that unless the air\nforces were to withdraw everything to a safe\ndistance behind the front lines they would\nthemselves have to provide the necessary de-\nfence force. For this purpose the R.AF. Regi-\nment during the later months of 1944 was\nexpanded and re-organised into ten wing head-\nquarters, twenty field squadrons, three\narmoured (holding) squadrons and ten anti-\naircraft squadrons, so as to provide tactical\ndefence for air force units as required. The\nbalance of functions in the Regiment as\nbetween air and ground defence was thus com-\npletely reversed.\n\n184. The wisdom of this re-organisation was\nabundantly proved in the course of the 1944-45\ncampaign. As has already been explained, the\nessence of the tactics by which the re-conquest\nof Burma was achieved lay in the rapid ad-\nvance of mechanised units thrusting through or\naround enemy positions, the strength of which\nhad been weakened by air bombardment. The\nfighter bombers which provided the backbone\nof the latter, and also the fighters required for\nair defence, could only operate effectively from\nairfields close behind the advanced army units.\nThe supplies on whose delivery the mainten-\nance of the Army\u2019s advance depended were\n",

Operations.\n\n186. One of the major difficulties under which\nan Air Force works, is the impracticability of\never drawing up a full balance-sheet which will\ngive in detail the full results of air action. Un-\nless a detailed examination of enemy records is\nmade, air forces must rely upon the dis-\njointed accounts of the ground forces, the re-\nports of informants, and photographic recon-\nnaissance, for an assessment of their results.\nThis has been particularly the case in Burma,\nwhere so much of the effort has been expended\nupon fleeting targets, reported troop concentra-\ntions, or objectives obscured by thick jungle.\nNotwithstanding the vagueness of the informa-\ntion, it is certain that the number of casualties\ninflicted upon the enemy as a direct result of\nair action has undoubtedly been large, the\nisolation of the battlefield by the interdiction of\nthe supply lines has been almost complete,\nand prevented the enemy from deploying his\nfull strength in every major engagement that\nhas taken place, while the new mobility given\nto armies by the unstinting use of air transport\nhas undoubtedly been the major factor in the\nexpulsion of the enemy from Burma.\n\n187. There have at times been grounds for a\nbelief that the effort of our close support\nsquadrons has not been used to full advantage\nbecause of a lack of experience on the part of\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nArmy commanders of the relative efficacy of\ncertain types of air attack against the varied\nobjectives. A more scientific application of\nthe fire-power afforded by ground-attack air-\ncraft might have led to an economy of effort\nthus made available to apply to other targets.\nWhether the attack by twelve fighter-bombers\nagainst a well-camouflaged single machine-gun\nig justifiable, must always be a moot point\nuntil machinery is devised to assess the debit\nand credit side of the picture. It is not diffi-\ncult in a staff study to deduce that the effort\nis unprofitable, but the same point of view\nmay not be held by the troops making the\nactual assault. The results of the air bombard-\nment may be just what was needed to make the\naction successful. It is certain that the high\nstandard of accuracy developed in our tactical\nsquadrons during 1944-45 has had an enormous\neffect upon enemy resistance.\n\n188. The low incidence of casualties during\nassaults by our own troops also bears this\nout, as do the unvarying tributes paid by\nbattalions and divisions to the work of the\nsquadrons who supported them. Recently,\nfurther evidence has come to light from\ninformants on the efficacy of attacks. With\nthe co-ordination of Visual Control Post teams\nand other sources, an even more efficient direc-\ntion of fire-power on to targets and better\nobservation of results will be possible. If\nanalysed, the plans\u2018compiled from these sources\nwould provide valuable proof of the decisive\npart that can be played by close support\nsquadrons properly trained and handled.\n\nIl. Planning.\n\n189. The amount of planning that has been\nnecessary to bring the campaign to a close has\nbeen large, due in part to some misappreciation\nof Japanese intentions and to frustration im-\nposed by non-arrival of resources. There was\na tendency also on the part of ground forces\nto formulate a plan of operations without\nconsulting the Air Commander in the early\nstages of planning. In consequence, much\neffort was expended in the recasting of opera-\ntional plans to take advantage of the striking\npower of air forces,\n\n190. Much of this could have been avoided\nhad the Army Commander been able to re-\nmain alongside the Supreme Commander and\nthe Allied Air Commander-in-Chief instead\nof having to base himself at an Advanced\nHeadquarters in Calcutta. Not only was\nproper liaison at C.-in-C. level impossible, but\nthe full flow of information and views between\nthe staffs was rendered difficult. The Burma\ncampaign proved that no plan of operations\nis complete unless it represents the views of\nthe air as well as of the ground forces at all\nstages.\n\n* * * *\n\nIII. Maintenance.\n\n191. South East Asia Air Forces have a\nbackground of three years\u2019 development under\ntrying conditions with insufficient resources.\nThe organisation became vast and was spread\nover a wide area.

A more fluid and\neconomical base organisation should be pos-\nsible as the war progresses.\n\n192. Energetic action has been taken, now\nthat the pipe line is secure, to reduce the reserve\nholdings of aircraft and equipment which clog\nthe machinery of supply and absorb so much\nof the Command resources in manpower and\nStorage space in India. An extensive re-\norganisation to undertake more maintenance\nin the field is contemplated, and, it is hoped,\nwill do much to avoid the bottlenecks to which\ncentralised maintenance is prone. Such a\nreorganisation is only possible if the scales\nof ground equipment, hand tools and other\nservicing facilities are adequate and fully main-\ntained. For an Air Force working in the field\na generous scale of equipment is essential, and\nthe lack of it was largely responsible for the\nuneconomical base maintenance organisation\nwhich events forced upon South East Asia in\nits early stages. The saving in man-hours that\nresults from a generous scale of \u2018ground equip-\nment is vast. This should always be taken\ninto account in campaigns in tropical countries\nwhere sickness and lack of communications\nmilitate against units possessing their full\nestablishment.\n\n* * * *\n\nIV. Administration.\n\n193. The standard of unit administration in\nthe operational areas was not high. With\nformations spread over wide areas, and\ndeficiencies in ground officers also in the\nmajority of vital trades, notably among clerical\n\nsignals personnel, much of this has been\ninevitable. Nevertheless a very real need\nexists for the indoctrination of service per-\nsonnel in overseas theatres of war with the\nprinciples of self-reliance and better improvisa-\ntion.\n\n194, The principles of mobility and self-help\n\nhave only resulted from the perception of\nthose on the spot to train personnel in the\n\n1991\n\nrudiments of active campaigning. In so doing\nthey have made the best use of local resources\nto achieve that standard of morale and well-\nbeing which are the prerequisite of good dis-\ncipline. The posting of a squadron com-\nmander from a well-established bomber base\nat home to an overseas appointment with no\npreliminary training in his changed circum-\nStances cannot but have an adverse effect upon\nthe well-being of the Unit. The setting-up of\nJunior Commanders\u2019 Courses within the\ntheatre is the best immediate remedy, but the\nproblems of accommodation, and the time\nabsent from units, rendered it little more than\na palliative in this theatre.\n\n* * + *\n\nV. Air Transport.\n\n195. Finally, the Air Forces, having given a\nnew-found mobility to land warfare, must also\ntake advantage of it. \u2018When assessing bids\nfor air transport and air supply, the highest\npriority should be given to the rapid movement\nof spares, personnel, and indeed whole R.A.F.\nunits, in order to keep the force working at\nmaximum efficiency. It is bad economy to\nkeep the 15 serviceable ont of 20 available air-\ncraft supplying the ground forces when the\ndiversion of one aeroplane to collect A.O.G.*\nspares would raise the serviceability rate to 18.\nIf full advantage is taken of air transport, the\nstriking radius of the Air Force can be still\nfurther extended, and the application of air\npower to any situation made more rapid and\nmore decisive than hitherto.\n\nK.

This can be attributed to the following\nmain causes :\u2014\n\ni) The magnitude of the Japanese defeat\nat Imphal, which was not realised until much\nater.\n\nGi) The virtual elimination of enemy air\nopposition resulting in complete pre-\ndominance and liberty of action of our\noffensive and air transport forces.\n\nii) The steady growth of air supply re-\nsources and improvements in their organisa-\nition.\n\n(iv) The occupation of Akyab and\nRamree, which had been decided upon to\nprovide advanced air supply bases. This\nenabled us to reorient and shorten the supply\nlines in relation to the advance southward\nof Fourteenth Army.\n\n4. By February, 1945, the possibilities of\na more ambitious plan were becoming evident,\nand Fourteenth Army and 221 Group sub-\nmitted a plan for vigorous exploitation of the\nfavourable set of circumstances then obtaining.\nG.O.C. Fourteenth Army considered that if the\nenemy elected to stand and fight around\nMandalay, there was every hope of destroying\nthe Japanese Army in the open plains of\nCentral Burma, thereby opening the route for\na swift advance upon Rangoon by highly\nmobile columns. The plan aimed at encircle-\nment of the enemy forces on the Mandalay\nPlain to be completed by air attack on such\nlines of communication as remained open to\nhim. In conjunction with a direct thrust by\n33 Corps towards Mandalay, 4 Corps were to\ncarry out a wide encircling movement directed\ntowards Meiktila which would cut the main\nline of communication southwards. M\u00e9eiktila\nitself was to be secured by a small air trans-\nported force who would consolidate our\nposition athwart this vital route.\n\n15. This bold plan was highly successful,\nand as a result the Japanese Army in Burma\nsuffered heavy casualties in a costly and bloody\nkilling match to which the Air Forces contri-\nbuted in large measure. Notwithstanding its\nsuccess, the battle of extermination took longer\nthan had been contemplated, and the time-table\nfor the dash to Rangoon by 4 Corps was in\njeopardy. The prospect of a race against a\nreduced time limit caused considerable anxiety\nin the mind of C.-in-C. Allied Land Forces,\nSouth East Asia (ALFSE.A.). In_ his\nopinion the overland advance by highly\nmobile forces might not have the necessary\nimpetus to overcome opposition en route, to-\ngether with the final opposition estimated from\nthe defenders of Rangoon, reinforced by the\nremnants of field formations extricated from\nCentral Burma. (Upon his urgent recom-\nmendations, the capture of Rangoon before the\nmonsoon was made more certain by the mount-\ning of a modified \u201c Dracula\u201d by sea and air.\n\n16. To carry out this operation, it would be\nnecessary to utilise forces which were ear-\nmarked to seize concurrently with the capture\nof Rangoon a springboard on the Malay Penin-\nsula. In the event, this modified \u201c Dracula\u201d\nproved to have been unnecessary, as the\nfollowing pages will show. Nevertheless the\ncapture of Rangoon entailed such a large\nexpenditure of effort and resources that plan-\nning has had to be conducted since then on\n\n(68741)\n\n1967\n\nthe premise that large-scale refitting, re-\ndeployment and marshalling of forces is neces-\nsary before the next step is undertaken. The\noccupation of Rangoon therefore constitutes a\nmilestone in the history of South East Asia,.\nmarking the end of a well-defined period.\n\n* * * *\n\nPart Two.\n\nTHE OPERATIONAL BACKGROUND,\nJUNE, 1944\u2014MAY, 1945.\n\n17. When, on 22nd June, 1944, an overland\njunction was effected on the Imphal-Kohima\ntoad between the garrison of the Imphal plain\nand the relieving ground forces which had.\nadvanced from the north, a major crisis had\nbeen resolved, and our land forces, despite the:\nmonsoon, were able gradually to turn more and\nmore both tactically and strategically to the\noffensive.\n\n18. The Fourteenth Army, with its head--\nquarters beside those of the Third Tactical.\nAir Force at Comilla, controlled the Allied\nunits on the southern two-thirds of the front.\nOn its coastal section, 15 Corps held the port\nof Maungdaw and a monsoon line along the\nMaungdaw-Buthidaung road; its left flank\nwas thinly covered by the Lushai Brigade whick\noperated in guerilla fashion over the desolate:\nhill country as far north as Haka and the valley\u2019\nof the Manipur River. In the Imphal Valley,\nalthough 4 Corps had linked up with 33 Corps:\nadvancing from Assam, the Japanese were stilf\nholding tenaciously to their positions among\nthe hills east of Palel overlooking the plain ;\nfurther to the north-east, however, the position\nwas more favourable, and elements of 33 Corps\nwere pressing forward towards Ukhrul.\n\n19, Beyond the operational area of the Four-\nteenth Army, Special Force, which had beer\nboldly launched into the heart of enemy held:\nterritory in March, was fighting both the\nweather and the enemy in the general area of\nthe railway corridor east and south-east of Lake\nIndawgyi. It was controlled by the Northern\nCombat Area Command under General Stilwell,\nand had effected a junction with the Chinese\nand Amer\u2018can forces now investing the\nJapanese garrison of Myitkyina, where the\nmain airfield had passed into their hands.\nFurther still to the north-east, a Chinese army\nbased on Yunnan was fighting in the upper\nSalween valley.\n\n20. The front remained static, dur\u2018ng the\nperiod of the monsoon, only in the coastal area.\nOn the Imphal sector, 33 Corps\u2014which took\nover from 4 Corps when the latter was with-\ndrawn from the line for four months\u2014remained\non the offensive. In the course of July the\nenemy was finally driven by combined air and\nground bombardment from his tenac\u2018ously held\npositions, on the perimeter of the Imphal plain,\nand with the capture of Tamu in early August\nthe Allied forces had re-established a foothold:\nin the Kabaw Valley and were ready to push\nsouthwards towards Yazagyo and Kalemyo and\neastwards to the Chindwin.\n\n21. On the right flank, a series of Japanese\ndelaying positions on what was euphemistically\ncalled the Tiddim Road, was overcome during\n\nA2\n",

Tiddim itself\nfell on 18th October, and the way was now\nopen for a double thrust towards Kalemyo from\nthe west and north. Japanese resistance in the\nKennedy Peak area, albeit grim, proved no\nmatch for the experienced Allied troops and the\naccompanying air bombardment, and Kalemyo\nfell on 15th November. With the capture of\nKalewa on 2nd December the chapter of moun-\ntain warfare was closed and the Fourteenth\nArmy was ready to debouch upon \u2018the plains of\nCentral Burma.\n\n22. Comparable progress had also been made\nin the Northern Combat Area Command sector,\nwhere the enemy garrison at Myitkyina had\nbeen reduced early in August. In the railway\ncorridor, 36 Division, which had replaced\nSpecial Force, made steady progress; it cap-\ntured Hopin on 7th September and by 10th\nDecember had reached the junction at Indaw.\nA drive southwards from Myitkyina carried\nChinese units to Bhamo at approximately the\nsame time. Thus by the end of the monsoon\nperiod the forces of the Northern Combat\nArea Command were in a position seriously\nto threaten the right flank of the enemy ele-\nments facing the Fourteenth Army.\n\n23. Before the opening of the campaigning\n\u2018season proper, a certain number of changes\nhad been made in the organisation of the\n\u2018ground forces facing the Japanese in Burma.\nSince with the converging advances of both\nthe Fourteenth Army and the Northern Combat\nArea Command the opening of a continuous\nfront in Central Burma seemed probable in\nthe near future, Lieut.-General Sir Oliver Leese,\nBart. K.C.B., CBE. D.S.O., was allotted\ncommand of all the Allied Land Forces in\nBurma. This Headquarters absorbed that of\n1l Army Corps, and was set up at Barrack-\npore outside Calcutta, while an off-shoot was\nmaintained at Kandy. 15 Corps, operating in\nArakan, was removed from the control of\nFourteenth Army and placed directly under\nhis command\u2014a step which enabled Head-\nquarters, Fourteenth Army, to move forward\nand establish itself beside 221 Group on the\nImphal plain. With the return of 4 Corps\nto the field in early November it thus retained\ncommand of two army corps, for 33 Corps\nremained in control of the operations develop-\ning against Kalemyo. Such was the general\norganisation of the ground forces when the\nnew campaign fairly opened in November,\n1944.\n\n24. In the coastal sector, 15 Corps had begun\nthe preliminaries to its offensive at an early\nhour and before the end of October, 81 (West\nAfrican) Division, supplied entirely by air,\nhad crossed into the Kaladan valley from\nits monsoon quarters at Chiringa and was\nbeginning to advance southwards against some\nopposition. The main offensive was opened\nwest of the Mayu Hills in mid-December ;\nits purpose was to secure air bases on Akyab\nand Ramree Islands, from which support could\nbe mounted for future operations in southern\nBurma, and also by driving the Japanese from\nthe coastal strip west of the Arakan Yomas\nto liberate the considerable Allied forces they\nhad contained there. It met with even less\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nresistance than had been anticipated. Forward\nunits of 15 Corps reached Foul Point before\nChristmas, and an Allied landing on Akyab\nIsland on 3rd January was unopposed.\nA further landing on Ramree Island\non the 2ist met with only slight opposi-\ntion. The core of Japanese resistance was,\nhowever, met along the coastal road from\nMyohaung to Taungup, and a number of\namphibious landings which were effected in\nJanuary and February at various points along\nthe coast provoked fierce fighting (whose\nissue was beyond doubt due to the heavy and\naccurate air support that was given), and\ngradually the enemy was driven towards the\ntwo routes leading eastwards from An and\nTaungup towards the Irrawaddy valley. With\nthe capture of Taungup in the middle of April\nthe coastal campaign was virtually over.\n\n25. The climax of the main battle in central\nBurma was meanwhile not long delayed.\nDuring December the Fourteenth Army struck\neastwards, and with the occupation of Wuntho\nby 4 Corps on the 20th, secured its left\nflank by laying the basis for a continuous\nfront with the Northern Combat Area Com-\nmand. The railhead at Ye-U was occupied\nby 33 Corps on New Year\u2019s Day, and the\nJapanese stronghold \u2018at Monywa was finally\nteduced on the 21st, by when 33 Corps had\nreached the general line of the Irrawaddy,\non which it was evident that the enemy had\nresolved to make a stand. Bridgeheads had\nhowever been secured by 20 Division on the\nleft bank of the river at Thabeikkyin and\nSingu, and in the great bend of the Irrawaddy\nthe Japanese stoutly defended the approaches\nto Sagaing on the right bank. In these two\nsectors, where the contending forces were not\nseparated by the river, bitter fighting continued\nthroughout the second half of January and\nthe first half of February. To the north-\neast, the Northern Combat Area Command\nforces were moving southwards across the\nShweli valley and towards Lashio ; Hsenwi was\nfaken on 19th February, and Namtu on the\n\nrd.\n\n26. While these events were taking place in\nthe Irrawaddy valley and to the north-east, the\nmain strategy of the campaign was beginning\nto take shape. 4 Corps was removed from\nthe left flank of the Fourteenth Army as soon\nas the junction with the Northern Combat\nArea Command was assured, and with two\ndivisions was given the task of pushing south-\nwards from Kalemyo along the Gangaw valley\ntowards Tilin and Pauk. The natural obstacles\non this wild route were every bit as great as\nthose prepared by the enemy, who did not\nappreciate the threat to his left flank that was\nthus being unfolded. His ignorance of the\nsituation was due to the fact that his recon-\nnaissance aircraft dared not cover the area, and\nto his tardy realisation of the new mobility\nof the Allied armies with which air supply\nendowed them. His defences at Gangaw were\noverwhelmed on 10th January after an air\nbombardment to which the Army paid full\ntribute, and by the 27th the forward units of\n4 Corps had reached Pauk. Early in February\nthey established themselves on the right bank\nof the Irrawaddy below Pakokku. The stage\nwas now set for the crowning blow of the\ncampaign.\n",

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\n27. After a few days\u2019 pause, a series of con-\ncerted crossings at various points of the Irra-\nwaddy below Mandalay began on the night\nof 12th-13th February. A new bridgehead was\nestablished by 33 Corps opposite Myinmu, in\nthe teeth of determined opposition on the part\nof the Japanese, who took it to be part of a\nmajor encircling movement against Mandalay\nin conjunction with the forces in the Singu\nbridgehead to the north. They accordingly\nthrew in most of their available reserves to\ncombat it. A feint crossing was made far to\nthe south, opposite Seikpyu, while the main\nthrust was made a little upstream, opposite\nMyitche, where 4 Corps was able to establish\na foothold against comparatively light opposi-\ntion from the enemy, who still underestimated\nthe threat to his left flank. When this bridge-\nhead had been consolidated, a motorised\nbrigade was concentrated behind its lines.\n\n28. On the 23rd, this Brigade moved swiftly\neastwards, reaching the railway at Taungtha the\nnext day. It then turned south-east along the\nline towards the junction of Meiktila, a nodal\ncentre in the communications of central Burma,\nin the neighbourhood of which there were also\nseveral good airfields. The enemy was com-\npletely taken aback by this thrust into his rear\nareas, and although his line of communication\ntroops fought hard, they were unable to do\nmore than delay slightly our advance. By the\nafternoon of 3rd March, the garrison of\nMeiktila had been annihilated and 4 Corps had\nthus placed a brigade, which our air transport\nspeedily built up into a division, squarely\nathwart the main enemy line of communication\nfrom his base at Rangoon to the fighting zone.\n\n29. It was in March that the battle which\nwas to decide the fate of most of Burma north\nof the Gulf of Martaban was fought. The\nJapanese reacted speedily to the major strategic\nthrust whose significance they had grasped too\nlate, and hastily moved southwards all their\navailable forces, in an effort, first, to break\nour stranglehold on their communications, and,\nwhen this failed, to withdraw to safety as many\nas they could of their troops in the Mandalay-\nMeiktila noose. Mandalay itself fell to our\ntroops advancing from the north by the middle\nof the month.\n\n30. Meanwhile the whole area Mandalay-\nMyingyan-Meiktila had been transformed into\na vast battlefield, in which the Fourteenth\nArmy and No. 221 Group attacked from three\ndirections the disorganized forces of the\nenemy, whose casualties were heavy. A num-\nber of scattered units made their escape, but\nby the beginning of April it might fairly be\nestimated that Japanese military power in\nBurma had been shattered. In the Northern\nCombat Area Command sector, the course of\nevents in central Burma had helped to quicken\nthe pace of the Japanese withdrawal ; Lashio\nwas captured by a Chinese division on 8th\nMarch, and the enemy soon broke contact,\nretreating southwards into the Shan States.\n\n31. The Fourteenth Army resumed its large-\nscale offensive on 12th April, after a short\nperiod for regrouping its forces. 4 Corps,\nsupplied by air, struck along the main\nMandalay-Rangoon axis; by the end of the\nmonth it had covered some 250 miles and had\nreached the outskirts of Pegu, less than 50\nmiles from Rangoon, which the Japanese were\n\n1969\n\nknown to have evacuated two or three days.\nearlier. 33 Corps had moved south-west to\nMagwe, which was captured on the 18th, and\nthence advanced down the Irrawaddy valley ;\nits forward elements reached the railhead at\nProme on Ist May. Nowhere was the enemy\nable to bar the advance by a frontal stand.\nSuch were the circumstances when the com-\nbined operation for the capture of Rangoon\nfrom the south was put into execution at the\nexpress wish of C.-in-C. A.L-FS.E.A.\n\n32. As already explained, Operation\n\u201cDracula\u201d met with little or no opposition.\nIt was a copy-book operation, and the troops\nadvancing into the city from the south partook\nmore of the nature of a triumphal procession\nthan an assault force. They were met by the\ncommanding officer of No. 110 Squadron\nR.AF., Wing Commander Saunders, who on\nthe previous day, perceiving no signs of the\nenemy at Mingaladon airfield, had decided to\nland and reconnoitre the city. He took formal\npossession of Rangoon on behalf of the Allied\nforces. Jt was fitting.that the vital part the\nAir Forces had played in the campaign should\nbe symbolically rounded off by the occupation\nof Rangoon by the Royal Air Force.\n\n* * * *\n\nPART THREE.\n\nALLIED AIR DOMINANCE.\n\n33. Until October, 1944, when the enemy\nbegan to withdraw aircraft from this theatre\nto reinforce his garrison in the Philippines, the\noverall strength of the Japanese Air Force in\nthis theatre remained at some 450 aircraft in\noperational units. Normally about 150 air-\ncraft, 70 per cent. of which were fighters, were\ndisposed in Burma and Thailand for imme-\ndiate use. The majority of the remainder were\nretained in Malaya and Sumatra, and com-\nprised bombers and floatplanes for shipping\nescorts and anti-submarine duties, fighters for\nthe defence of the Sumatra oilfields, and\noperational echelons refitting or training. With\nGeneral MacArthur\u2019s invasion of the Philip-\npines, when up to 100 aircraft left SE.A.C.,\na steady decline in strength set in, aggravated\nby the constant attrition caused by our fighters,\nfor which full replacement was not forth-\ncoming, until in May, 1945, the enemy could\nmuster but 250 aircraft in the S.E.A.C. area,\nof which over 100, stationed in Malaya and\nSumatra, were for most purposes ineffective\nby reason of their distance from the battle\nareas,\n\n34. Following the sharp lessons he received\nbetween March and May, 1944, the enemy\u2019s\nwarning system became somewhat less\nembryonic, so that it was difficult to achieve\ncomplete surprise in any part of the theatre.\nBy listening to Allied W/T and R/T, and by\nsupplementing a skimpy radar system with\nobservation posts and sound locators, a com-\nprehensive albeit somewhat thin warning-\nsystem had been established around the whole\nof the Western Perimeter, and it was only a\nquestion of time before growing technical pro-\nficiency rendered the task of Allied aircraft in\nsearch of all too rare targets, even more\ndifficult.\n",

Spitfires, Lightnings, and latterly\nThunderbolts and Mustangs, completely trans-\nformed the situation which had obtained until\nNovember, 1943, when our Hurricanes were\noutclassed and out-manoeuvred by the enemy.\nBacked by a warning and control system of\nhigh standard, Allied fighters had without fail\nrendered the enemy\u2019s incursions into our de-\nfended areas costly and ineffectual. During the\neleven months covered by this despatch 165\nenemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground\nor in the air, together with 47 probables and\n152 damaged. This destruction was achieved\nagainst a total enemy effort, offensive and\ndefensive, of 1,845 sorties. One enemy air-\ncraft was destroyed for every eleven sighted ;\nthat the air superiority established before the\nperiod of this narrative was well maintained\nover the year, needs no further proof.\n\n36. This virtual dominance of the air over\nBurma. was the result of hard work with small\ndividends upon the part of our fighter organ-\nisation. Freed from the necessity of estab-\nlishing superiority, the majcr problems remain-\ning to Allied fighters by the time this despatch\nopens were the interception of sneak raids,\nusually undertaken by the Japanese Air Force\nunder the protection of cloud-cover, and the\nsearching-out and destruction of a meagre\nenemy air force dispersed upon a generous net-\nwork of rear airfields. Initially, the greatest\ndanger was to the stream of transports hauling\nsupplies to the Imphal Plain, which offered the\nbest prey ever presented to any air force.\nSome one hundred unarmed aircraft flew daily\nin and out of the area, and fighter patrols\nJaboured under the handicaps of extensive cloud\nconditions and a shortage of P.O.L.* at their\n\nASES.\n\n37. Moreover, the mountainous terrain to the\neast precluded efficient early air raid warning,\nand the enemy could at will come un-\nannounced through the valleys. To minimise\nthe danger, traffic was routed along a corridor\nfrom the Khopum Valley to Palel under a\nfighter umbrella. Ground signs were displayed\nen route to indicate the presence of enemy\naircraft which was also broadcast by R/T.\nThe sight of a stream of transports flying into\nthe Imphal Valley with a screen of Spitfires\ncircling overhead was a most heartening sight\nto the garrison, who thereby received con-\nstant assurance that their aerial life-line was\nunbroken. The precautions taken and the im-\npotence of the enemy resulted in only two\ntransports being destroyed by enemy action\nduring the whole of the siege, a remarkable\nachievement.\n\n_ 38. The danger to transport aircraft per-\nsisted during the whole of the advance, since\nthey were continually operating in front of the\nwarning screen, and fighter bases were not\nalways established as far forward as was tac-\ntically desirable. For this there were two main\nTeasons; in the early stages of the advance\nthrough hilly jungle no airstrips could be con-\nstructed near the front, and second, having\ndebouched on to the plains, the Army were not\nwilling to devote supplies and resources to\n\n* Petrol, Oil, Lubricants.\n\nSUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nestablish fighter bases in the area of dropping\noperations.\n\n39. On two occasions, therefore, our trans-\nport aircraft were victims of enemy sneak\nraids ; on one day in November while dropping\nalong the Tiddim Road, five aircraft were de-\nstroyed by the enemy, and on the 12th Janu-\nary four were shot down while supply dropping\nnear Onbauk, an airfield recently recaptured\nfrom the enemy which, however, had not by\nthat time been prepared for defensive fighters.\nEven when during the temporary halt around\n(Mandalay, and Spitfires were able to occupy\nthe Shwebo and Monywa airfield groups, air\nsupply was proceeding over a hundred and\nthirty mile front which the four available\nsquadrons of Spitfires were hard pressed to\ncover in conjunction with their other defensive\ncommitments. It is a lesson of the campaign\nthat the air supply of ground forces depends\non the immediate deployment as far forward\nas possible of fighter squadrons to patrol the\nLines of Communication. Had the enemy used\nhis fighters effectively instead of frittering away\ntheir effort on infrequent low-level attacks\nagainst forward troops, he would have been\nable to do great execution among our Dakotas\nand Commandos, thus seriously impeding the\nadvance.\n\n* * * *\n\n40. Since it was not always possible to engage\nthe enemy in the air, it was necessary to search\nout his aircraft on the ground. To this end,\nintruder raids were undertaken at frequent\nintervals, and paid a dividend of 80 destroyed,\n25 probably destroyed and 78 damaged aircraft\non enemy airfields. In October, a series of\nraids were undertaken against the Rangoon\nairfields with the additional motive of hinder-\ning the transfer of units to the Philippines.\nIn this operation, many types of aircraft were\nemployed, including Beaufighters, but, as air-\ncraft resources became more suited to opera-\ntional requirements, intrusion was progressively\nleft to the Mustang squadrons of the Air\nCommandos, who on more than one occasion\nin the spring of 1945, made the 1,500 mile\nround trip to the Japanese base airfields in\nSiam with good results totalling 38 destroyed,\n10 probably destroyed and 21 damaged aircraft.\n\n41. The problem of destroying an enemy\nintent on conserving his forces and possessing\na wide choice of airfields containing many\nrevetments (Meiktila airfield disposes of over\na hundred) is not an easy one. In addition,\nthe enemy\u2019s skill with light anti-aircraft and\nmachine-gun fire is well-known, and low-level\n\u201c strafing\u201d runs are apt to be costly. It was\nfound uneconomical to make a preliminary\nreconnaissance run to discover which revet-\nments were occupied, and often only a quick\nsnap-shot at a target seen late in the \u201c strafe \u201d\nwas possible. In view of these factors it will\nbe seen that the result achieved is more than\ncreditable.\n\n42. Early attempts to ground or destroy the\nenemy by bombing his airfields were ineffective\nand were discontinued in favour of more worth-\nwhile targets.\n\n* * * *\n43. The enemy\u2019s offensive effort was so\n\nineffectual as to be hardly worth mentioning\nexcept to recount the losses he sustained. In\n",

Cover was attempted of the Manipur\nRoad, Silchar, Chittagong and battle areas.\nFour Dinahs were destroyed during this brief\nspell and since then no reconnaissance over\nthe India border has been attempted. On\nChristmas night three bombers attempted to\npenetrate to the Calcutta area; of these, two\nwere destroyed by Beaufighters and the third\nreturned in a damaged condition. Enemy\nattempts to interfere with shipping off Akyab\nin January were decisively dealt with by the\nSpitfire squadrons who moved in five days\nafter its occupation, No. 67 Squadron destroy-\ning five out of six attacking Oscars in one\nlay.\n\n44. Thereafter, the enemy effort degenerated\ninto a series of sporadic and infrequent attempts\nto disrupt our forward columns. The\nineffectual nature of these attacks was evident\nto all who flew over the battlefield and noted,\non the enemy side no signs of activity, but,\nbehind the British lines, long lines of trans-\nport moving in uncamouflaged safety, supply-\ndropping parachutes in use as tents, and all\nthe apparatus of war left in full view by\ntroops whose immunity from air attack was\nscarcely ever violated even by fast-flying\nfighters, for the enemy dared not send a\nbomber over the Allied lines by daylight.\n\n* * * *\n\n45. It is unnecessary to recount in detail\nthe enormous advantages accruing to both\nground and air forces when the enemy air\narm is small and misemployed, and when our\nown squadrons are superior in performance,\ntraining and control. It is, however, worth\npausing to consider the results had enemy air-\ncraft been allowed unrestricted use of the sky.\nThe air supply on which the whole land cam-\npaign hinged would have been impossible, the\nattrition rate of our close support squadrons,\nwhich worked with accuracy and effect, would\nhave been prohibitive, and the disuption caused\nby our strategic bombers to the enemy\u2019s com-\nmunications far to the rear could not have\nbeen such as to have materially influenced\nthe battle.\n\n* * * *\n\nPart Four.\n\nTRANSPORT SUPPORT OPERATIONS\nAND DEVELOPMENT.\n\n46. The Burma campaign has proved beyond\nall doubt that once air superiority has been\nachieved, the air maintenance and supply of\nforces in the field is governed primarily by the\navailability of airfields and of transport air-\ncraft. The supply and maintenance of the\nArmy, in the field and engaged in intensive\noperations together with a tactical air force in\nsupport, is a major problem under most favour-\nable conditions. It should be borne in mind,\nhowever, that supply bases were some 250 miles\ndistant, and that the intervening country com-\nprised vast stretches of impenetrable jungle and\na formidable mountain barrier rising up to\n10,000 feet. In addition, weather conditions\nwere by no means favourable, and experience\nhas shown that monsoon cloud develops a\n\n1971\n\ndegree of turbulence which has been the cause\nof a number of fatal accidents.\n\n47. Despite these many difficulties, the success\nof the air supply operations in the Burma\ncampaign has been fully testified, It is fair to\nsay that without air supply the Burma campaign\ncould never have been fought on its present\nlines. It was in fact a decisive factor of the\nland campaign. Admittedly mistakes occurred,\nsometimes due to miscalculation but more often\ndue to unforeseen contingencies, Even so the\nair supply operations in Burma will probably\nrank as one of the greatest, if not the greatest,\nof air supply achievements in this war.\n\n48. The organisation and operation of air\nsupply is a problem which calls for mutual\nunderstanding of each other\u2019s difficulties by the\nrespective Services. In this respect it cannot\nbe too strongly emphasised that it is the opera-\ntors and not the consumers who determine the\nmost efficient method of delivering the goods.\nMoreover, it is up to the consumers to state\nprecisely what is required, in a given order of\npriority. It is their responsibility also to\ndeliver these goods in the required quantities\nand at the right time to the air supply heads.\nThe swift and unco-ordinated growth of the\nair transport organization did not allow of a\nfull appreciation, by either the Army or the Air\nForce, of the importance of the ancillary ser-\nvices necessary to promote the full effectiveness\nof the machine. As the campaign advanced,\nthis tendency has been progressively eliminated,\nand the situation is now that only a lack of\nresources prevents the air transport organisa-\ntion from incorporating all the lessons that have\nbeen learnt, and giving it the full effectiveness\nwith which experience can endow it. From this\nobservation, the air supply organization that has\ndeveloped within the area of Northern Combat\nArea Command and Tenth Air Force is\nexcepted. There, a realisation of the import:\nance of firm backing to the supply system was\nevident from the outset, and resulted in a very\nhigh standard of operating efficiency,\n\n* * * *\n\n49. In June, 1944, there were in Air Com-\nmand eleven transport squadrons engaged on\n\n- air supply, four British and seven American. By\n\nMay, 1945, these figures bad risen to nine and\nsixteen respectively, an increase which still left\nthe air supply force with little or no margin\nof reserve. The growth of air supply during the\nperiod can well be imagined.\n\n50, At the beginning of the period, attention\nwas still centred upon the critical position of\n4 Corps besieged in and around the ancient\ncapital of Manipur. There were still twenty-\nthree days of June to go before the road to\nImphal was to be re-opened. Working to\nsupply the garrison and to build a stockpile to\nexploit the anticipated Japanese retreat, as\nmuch as 700 tons were being flown in on a\nsingle day under monsoon conditions. When\nthe road was re-opened, effort was not allowed\nto drop and for the remaining days of June the\nsquadrons flew at maximum effort in order to\nbuild up stocks and ascertain the peak air lift\nthat could be achieved. The wisdom of this\nwas doubtful ; all concerned were already ex-\nhausted, and experience has illustrated the value\nof retaining a margin of effort in reserve, and\nof not over-straining a complicated machine\nwithout urgent necessity.\n",

The\nthreat to India and to the China life-line had\nbeen removed, and a grim defence, sustained\nsolely by air supply, was becoming a vigorous\noffensive, whose progress was also fed from\nthe air. From July until November, 33 Corps\nfought its way eastwards to the Chindwin,\nsouthwards along the Kabaw valley and down\nthe Tiddim Road, provided entirely with\nmunitions and food by our transport squadrons.\nUntil the end of the monsoon, supply was\ncarried out under conditions of unbelievable\ndifficulty. In July the commander of 33 Corps\nsent the following signal to No. 194 Squadron:\n\u201cYour unflagging efforts and determination\nto complete your task in spite of appalling\nflying conditions are worthy of the highest\npraise.\u201d In August, another squadron sum-\nmarised its efforts as follows: It has taken\non occasion six to seven days of battling\nthrough torrential rain, strong winds and\n10/10ths cloud down to 200 feet to achieve\none mission, but it has been done.\u201d\n\n52. In August and September it was becom-\ning clear that the planning and day-to-day\ncontrol of air supply operations required an\norganisation separate from Third Tactical Air\nForce, whose responsibility air supply opera-\ntions had been since the dissolution of Troop\nCarrier Command. This was rendered all the\nmore necessary by the large part that it was\nproposed airborne operations should play in\nthe coming dry season. Thus, in October,\nCombat Cargo Task Force (C.C.T.F.), an inte-\ngrated U.S.A./British Headquarters, was\nformed and became responsible for the day-to-\nday control and the planning of air transport\noperations in support of Fourteenth Army and\n15 Corps.\n\n53. One of the first measures undertaken by\nH.Q.C.C.T.F. was the reorganisation of the\nallocation of tasks, whose importance when\ndemand is always outrunning supply cannot be\nstressed too strongly. The original procedure\nhad been that, prior to the beginning of each\nmonth, Fourteenth Army submitted to Third\n\nTactical Air Force its planned air supply re- \u00a9\n\nquirements, which were based on the assump-\ntion that the Army\u2019s advance in the various\nsectors would invariably be strongly opposed.\nConsequently, demands were always high and\nsupplies were occasionally fifty per cent. below\nthe planned figure but withal more than suffi-\ncient for current requirements. The Rear Air-\nfield Maintenance Organisation (R.A.M.O.)\nreceived its day\u2019s tasks direct from the head-\nquarters of the Corps which it was supplying,\nand at the same time asked the Air Forces for\nthe requisite number of aircraft. If, as often\nhappened, the Army\u2019s daily requirements ex-\nceeded the air resources available, considerable\nconfusion resulted, since no proper system of\nallocating priorities had been evolved.\n\n54, This problem was solved by forming, along-\nside C.C.T.F., the Combined Army-Air Trans-\nport Organisation (C.A.A.T.O.) which received\nand collated daily requests, assessed their urgency\nand, having a full knowledge of aircraft states,\nallotted the tasks accordingly. The organisa-\ntion was thus more in line with current Euro-\npean practice, with two notable exceptions, the\nlack of signals and telephone communications\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nwas such as to clog any air supply machinery\nno matter how well-planned, and second,\nthere were crippling deficiencies of el in\nsuch ancillary bodies as Staging Posts and\nCasualty Air Evacuation Units.\n\n55. On December 20th, the first strip for\nlanding-on of supplies was opened at Indaing-\ngale. Others followed in quick succession,\nTaukkyan near Kalemyo, Kawlin and Indaw\ntrans-Chindwin as soon as the river had been\ncrossed, and Kan in the Myittha Valley where\n4 Corps had returned to the line, replacing\nthe Lushai Brigade and representing another\nand growing commitment to our transport\nforces.\n\n56. Thus, by January, the increasing de-\nmands of mobile warfare, which did not accord\nwith the plans on which resources had been\nallotted and organisation developed, and the\nengagement of larger forces, witnessed a\ngradual and sustained rise in the demands of\nFourteenth Army for air supply. Many un-\nforeseen difficulties were now coming to light,\nand when the Supreme Commander visited the\nforward areas he was informed that the Air\nForces were not carrying enough supplies.\nC.-in-C. A.L.F.S.E.A. circulated a memoran-\ndum calling for more resources in transport\naircraft, without which, he stated, not only\nwould the advance to Mandalay and beyond\nbe arrested, but due to the impossibility of\nsupplying forces in front of the roadhead he\nmight be forced to withdraw beyond the Chind-\nwin for the monsoon. This view of the situa-\ntion (which in my opinion was unduly\npessimistic) caused an urgent request to the\nChiefs of Staff for additional transport squad-\nrons, and as a result Nos. 238 and 267 Squad-\nrons arrived in March. Actually a better organi-\nsation of existing ground transport resources\nwould have met every commitment, and for\nthis reason Air Marshal Garrod undertook a\ntour to investigate the working of the system.\n\n57. It is as well here to outline, for the sake\nof comparison, the working of air supply in the\nN.C.AC. area, to which but little reference has\nso far been made.\n\nAir Supply in the Northern Combat Area Com-\nmand.\n\n58. The most striking feature of this organi-\nsation was the high standard of co-operation\nachieved by all agencies con\u00a2erned\u2014N.C.A.C.,\nService of Supply, Tenth Air Force, Air Ser-\nvice Command and ail ancillary formations.\nCollective responsibility for the task of aid\nsupply was rated higher than service allegiance ;\neach body trusted the ability of the others to\ncarry out their part of the work and did not\nattempt to dictate on matters outside its own\nsphere. The second great advantage was the\nabundance of good signal communications ;\nevery link in the chain, organisational, supply.\nsquadrons, co-ordinators, being linked by a\n\n- teletype and telephone network which allowed\n\nof a quick dissemination of the next day\u2019s tasks\nand priorities as allotted by the collating agency\nin N.C.A.C., and of speedy re-adjustment if\nnecessary.. A last-minute change in location\nof a Dropping Zone could be signalled back\nby a Division and retransmitted to an aircraft\nalready airborne for another objective. More-\nover, the packing and loading processes were\norganised on a moving-belt principle whose\n",

A comparison between the American\npacking loading agencies at Dinjan and the\nR.LAS.C. Air Supply Companies at Hat i\nreflected no credit on the British ground organi-\n\nsation. Here it should be emphasised that no .\n\nreflection is intended on the personnel in-\nvolved; British Officers and Indian Other\nRanks were strained to breaking-point, and\noften had to work seventy-two hours at a\nstretch to complete their tasks; the fault lay\nin the fact that the importance and nature of\nthe work demanded a much more generous\nscale of personnel, facilities, and organising\nability than could be allotted by the Army.\n\n* e - * *\n\n60. An examination of the data gathered on\nAir Marshal Garrod\u2019s tour brought to light the\ndifferences of organisation and procedure\nbetween the two air supply systems, and re-\nvealed a crying need for improvement in the\norganisation operated by C.A.A.T.O. and\nC.C.T.F. Too numerous to recount here, these\npoints did have the effect of initiating action to\nimprove the operating procedure. Meanwhile,\nAir Command was pressing for the speedy\ndevelopment of the recaptured bases along the\nArakan Coast at Akyab and Ramree whose\nemployment would shorten the haul into Cen-\ntral Burma. Journeys from the established\nbases at Chittagong, Comilla and Tulihal were\nnow becoming so long that in order to com-\nplete three trips in a day, aircraft had to take\noff at first light and perhaps not finish until\nafter dark. The strain on technical mainten-\nance, flying and loading personnel can well be\nimagined.\n\n61. It was in February that an overland\nadvance to Rangoon supplied entirely by air\nwas first put forward as a_ serious proposal.\nFourteenth Army prepared a plan which\nenvisaged two parallel drives southwards along\nthe axes of the River Irrawaddy and of the\nMandalay-Rangoon railway, while a large force\nfrom 33 Corps, of up to three and a half divi-\nsions, struck east to Takaw with the object of\ncontaining and destroying all enemy forces cut\noff north of Meiktila.\n\n62. Air Command reactions to the plan were\n\nG) a re-orientation of supply lines, using\nAkyab and Ramree as advanced air supply\nheads which would result in substantial re-\nduction in length of the air supply line as\nthe force advanced south of Mandalay.\n\nGi) We doubted the soundness of the plan\nwhich aimed at a total destruction of the\nenemy in addition to the capture of Rangoon\nif the former necessitated a drive eastwards\nto cut off and destroy the enemy in the hills.\nThis would inevitably involve a_ supply\nproblem in that direction in addition to\nsustaining a main advance southwards.\n\n63. A study of the situation after the fall of\nRangoon shows that these reactions were fully\njustified. Apart from this, the plan had many\nadvantages, and at a major conference in\nCalcutta on 23rd February which heralded my\narrival as Allied Air Commander-in-Chief, it\nwas approved in principle and the target for\n\n1973\n\ntonnage to be hauled in its execution decided.\nThe maximum lift was assessed at 1,887 tons\nper day between 20th March and Ist April and\n2,075 tons per day between Ist May and 15th\nMay. I emphasised that these figures would\nentail a very high rate of effort from the\nsquadrons involved, and would entail consider-\nable retrenchment during the monsoon to pay\noff the mortgage in maintenance and overstrain\nwe would have contracted in its achievement.\n\n64, Meanwhile, the air lift was still increas-\ning. In February, C.C.T-F. hauled 51,210 short\ntons of supplies into the operational area. In\naddition, at the end of the month, a small\nthough vital airborne operation took place to\nconsolidate the capture of Meiktila, which had\nbeen seized following an armoured dash from\ntheir bridgehead on the Irrawaddy by 17 Divi-\nsion.\n\n65. Troops were landed to reinforce the fly-\ning column which had seized the airfield and\nwas now being fiercely attacked on all sides by\nthe enemy. Transport aircraft landed and dis-\ncharged their loads under fire, many suffering\ndamage while so doing. One aircraft taking\non wounded for its return journey had a shell\nexplode inside it, causing further injuries to\nthe casualties who were already emplaned.\nThus, within very few days, landing became\nimpossible, and it was necessary to resort to\nthe less economical practice of dropping, which\nstill further increased the load on our transport\nsquadrons.\n\n66. The Meiktila operation was a success,\nand a captured Japanese Staff officer assessed\nit as the turning point in the battle for Burma.\nIt was not accomplished without mistakes, how-\never, which rendered it far more hazardous\nthan it might otherwise have been. It should\nbe established that aircraft will not land until\nthe possibility of the airfield being subjected\nto heavy fire is ruled out. Planning should be\ncarried out on this premise. Secondly, the\nR.A.M.O. that was established on the airfield\nwas pitifully inadequate, the officer in charge\nhaving to guide aircraft to unloading points\ninstead of being free to organise their quick\nturn-around under fire. In a critical opera-\ntion, such points might make all the difference\nbetween success and dismal failure. They\nmerit much greater consideration in combined\nplanning than has hitherto been accorded them.\n\n* * * *\n\n67. By the beginning of April, Meiktila was\nagain safe for landing, although shells were\nstill bursting less than 200 yards from the\nstrips. Preparations were immediately com-\nmenced to build up stocks to maintain Four-\nteenth Army in the final dash which was to\ncarry them 250 miles southward in the second\nhalf of the month. On the 20th, the main\nairfield at Lewe was captured and speedily\nprepared for light aircraft and gliders, which\nbegan landing on the morning of the 2l1st.\nToungoo, 50 miles further south, was occupied\non the 22nd and, in spite of bad weather, over\n100 Dakotas and Commandos landed on the\n24th. Within five days, Pyuntaza, another\nairstrip 70 miles further south, was also receiv-\ning supplies, and a battalion group was flown\nin to cut the enemy escape route eastwards\nfrom Pegu. The enemy was still active on\nboth sides of the narrow strip along the\nMandalay-Pegu railway which had formed our\n",
