            "description": "Our hopes of reaching Bengasi in time were soon dashed. The recent rains had been unusually heavy and many parts of the southern slopes of the Gebel Akhdar, which the Support Group had to traverse, were under water. Their own progress was greatly retarded, and that of their supply echelons was rendered even more difficult, with the result that in a short while they were held up for lack of petrol. On the 21st December, therefore, General Gott decided to abandon the attempt and ordered the Support Group to advance on Antelat instead, leaving only a small column to press on to Bengasi.",

The plans for a fully opposed landing were, nevertheless, very carefully examined.
