The weakness of this arrangement was showa when a German attack on the French in the Ousseltia valley, at the northern hinge of the two Dor- sale ranges, made dangerous progress and had to be halted by the hasty diversion of British and American troops from First Army and II Corps. As a result General Anderson was appointed by General Eisenhower on ist January to \u201c\u2018 co-ordinate \u2019\u2019 the whole front and on 24th January both XIX and II Corps were placed directly under his command. At the same time General Kuter, of the United States Army Air Corps, was appointed to co-ordinate all Allied air support under command of General Spaatz then Deputy Commander-in- Chief Allied Air: Forces."

It then turned due east along the main road to Mongmit."
