            "description": "My intention now was to establish bridgeheads over the Meuse and Rhine in readiness for the time when it would be possible to advance eastwards to occupy the Ruhr. I ordered the resumption of the Second Army advance from the Antwerp—Brussels area for 6th September, and by 11th September a bridgehead was established over the Meuse—Escaut Canal. It was already noticeable that the enemy was beginning to recover his balance, so that the urgency of launching the thrust to the Rhine was underlined.",

Resistance in this sector had been very heavy on the beaches but considerably lighter when the first beach-head had been consolidated. The enemy resisted much more strongly on 10 Corps’ front, both on the beaches and further inland; Salerno was captured on the morning of the roth and Montecorvino airfield, one of the Corps’ most important objectives, on the evening of the 11th, but it could not be brought into operation as yet since it was still under artillery fire, Very heavy fighting raged on the xoth and x1th around Battipaglia, the most important road junction in the plain; by the night we had a battalion in the town, fiercely engaged by the enemy.",
