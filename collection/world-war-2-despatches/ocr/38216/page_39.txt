SUPPLEMENT to tuE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

405. There was a single line telephone lnking
each aerodrome with Group H.Q’s., but instru-
ments and wire were not available for develop-
ing an internal telephone system on either
aerodrome. '

For point to point communication a W/T
set was improvised which was able to link up
with A.H.Q., and with Sabang and Lho’nga
on the air rernforcement route.

406. A civil Dutch Observer system existed at
Palembang, consisting of two concentric circles
of posts round Palembang, at 50 and 100 kilo-
meters radius. There were a few posts still
further out—one on the north end of Banka
Island, one at the mouth of the Palembang
river and one on Tanjong Pinang Island, just
south of Singapore. Posts on the outer circle
were unavoidably somewhat widely spaced:
most warnings came from the 50 kilometre
circle only. Communication between posts and
the centre was by W/T or telephone. No
radar was available to supplement the observer
system, whose volunteer operators were most
enthusiastic but unfortunately had had little
experience in aircraft recognition. Warnings
were consequently erratic.

407. With the most willing and energetic co-
operation of the head of the Observer Corps,
steps were immediately taken to improve the
system. Additional posts were selected, manu-
facture of W/T sets began and additional per-
sonnel were trained. But events moved too
fast for these measures to take effect. The
original system only was available during the
actual events which followed.

408. The Dutch army in the N E.I. had no
A.A artillery, having been unable to obtain guns
from the belligerents in Europe or from the
USA. Thus the aerodromes in Sumatra had
no A.A. defences. The Dutch had already
had aircraft destroyed on the ground at Medan
and Pakenbaroe by Japanese low flying
fighters.

409. By the end of January, however,
Abdacom was able to allot A.A. defences to
PI. and P.JI., 6 heavy and 6 Bofors guns to
each aerodrome, and 4 of each type to the oil
tefinery at Palembang. Ships carrying ammu-
nition for these guns were unfortunately sunk
and there was little ultimately available. There
were two Dutch armoured cars and 150 native
Dutch troops allotted to the defence of each
aerodrome. With the arrival of R.A.F. ground
personnel, aerodrome defence parties were
organised to reinforce them.

410. There was one Dutch native regiment
for the defence of the whole Palembang area,
but there were no defences on the river leading
to the town. On the 23rd January representa-
tions were made both to the Dutch naval and
military authorities, and to Abdacom, on the
inadequacy of the defences in the Palembang
area, but no reinforcements were available. It
is thought that plans were in hand to strengthen
the defences, as General Sir John Laverack,
Commanding 1st Australian Corps, visited
Palembang about 25th January and indicated
that an Australian division might be expected
invthe near future. Presumably, owing to the
general situation in the Far East, the move was
cancelled. ;

411. In short, the aerodrome defences were
very weak and few troops were available for the
defence of the area against invasion.

Arrival of R.A.F. Units from Singapore.

4121, However, Japanese progress in Malaya
was' @licker than “had been anticipated. The
transfer from Singapore had to be accelerated
and expanded beyond what had first been
contemplated. In the event, all aircraft had
to be based on P.I and P.II, although the per-
sonnel of one bomber squadron moved to
Lahat on roth February, Group Captain Noble
being appointed Station Commander But
events moved too quickly for that aerodrome
to come into use.

413. This Report has already narrated the
plans made by A.H.Q. in Singapore for trans-
ferring and re-organising in Sumatra and Java,
and how these plans were largely frustrated
by the speed of the Japanese advance in Malaya
and by the dislocation caused at the docks in
Singapore by air attack, These plans were
further frustrated by Japanese action against
shipping at sea en route to the N.E.I. Many
ships were sunk and others re-routed at sea
to other ports. The cumulative effect was dis-
astrous. Practically all equipment destined for
Sumatra went ‘astray. In particular no M.T.
arrived except some light motor cars about the
8th February and a few bomb trailers. There
were only three refuellers available. Most im-
portant of all on the domestic side, few rations
arrived and no tentage and field equipment
On aerodromes which were practically without
accommodation, the last was a serious loss
during the prevailing monsoon weather.

Aircraft spares were also scarce, particularly
those for Blenheims, with which type the two
reinforcing squadrons, Nos. 84 and ‘2r11(B)
Squadrons, were also equipped. ;

Three month’s anticipated requirements in
petrol, oil and lubricants had arrived at each
aerodrome. A limited number of bombs also
came across and these were distributed to
P.I. and P.II.

414. Local buses were requisitioned and
gradually came into service An organisation
for the local purchase of supplies was set up
and contracts already placed for the manu-
facture of domestic equipment were expedited
and expanded.

415. By the end of the first week of February
personnel were reasonably fed and accommo-
dated. But later when large numbers arrived,
many unexpectedly, from Singapore, accommo-
dation had to be found at short notice. Thus
1,500 were provided for in P.II, where pro-
vision was ready for only 250, whilst 2,500
were housed in schools and cinemas in Palem-
bang town.

Throughout, however, operational and main-
tenance facilities remained primitive in the
extreme. The aerodromes in Sumatra were
virtually landing grounds ‘‘ in the blue ’’.

All the problems which faced the staff and
umts were tackled with energy and spirit,
and the praiseworthy results which were
achieved in the face of every handicap are a
great credit to both.

The Dutch gave magnificent assistance in
all these local preparations, headed by the
Resident Palembang, who personally inspired
and directed the civil authorities in their
efforts.

416. From the 22nd January onwards, per-
sonnel and aircraft started streaming in. The
former were in some disorder owing to loss of
