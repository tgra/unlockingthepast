On 23rd July formations of enemy aircraft were intercepted on three occasions. On the first occasion, two were shot down for certain and another two probably destroyed, whilst the suryivors which reached the fleet were in no state to carry out an accurate attack. On the second occasion, as the Fulmars were about to intercept, the bombers released their bombs on the destroyer screen and immediately withdrew. Finally an attempted T/B attack was completely broken up and driven off, leaving two aircraft shot down with another damaged and possibly lost.",

On 16th July Arezzo fell, on the 18th IV Corps reached the Arno east of Pisa, on the same day the Poles captured Ancona and on the roth the Americans entered Leghorn. The Poles had had heavy fighting at Loretto and Filottrano; it took six days of fluctuating attack and counter-attack to clear the latter and the main attack was delayed thereby till the morning of the 17th. IV Conps had to beat off a final counter-attack on Resignano on roth July, and for the next two days progress to the east of the town was still slow. From the 13th to the 15th the advance was more rapid as the Germans fell back to their next delaying positions. gi Division was the first unit in IV Corps to reach the Arno, capturing Pontedera on 18th July, but on the  left 34 Division was held further south in th  hills behind Leghorn and first entered the city at oz00 hours on the rgth. The Germans had devoted greater efforts than ever to render the port unusable. The dock area was heavily mined and boobytrapped, all the quays had been cratered and the harbour entrance was almost wholly blocked by sunken ships. By 23rd July 34 Division had captured the southern part of Pisa. All bridges over the Arno had been destroyed and the enemy was firmly posted on the north bank all along the Corps front. Leghorn harbour remained under fire from long-range artillery.",

On the 18th July I received from Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey, commanding the Australian Imperial Forces, a letter, written at the instance of the Australian Government, urging me to consider the relief* of the whole garrison as the health of all the troops composing it showed signs of marked deterioration. He sented to me that the telief of the Australian portion of the Garrison was particularly desirable in view of the growing feeling in Australia that the time had come to fulfil the agreement made between their own and the British Government that the Australian troops should be concentrated under one command and serve as one force. He suggested that the lull in operations presented an opportunity which should not be missed. This letter was followed on the 23rd July by a telegram from the War Office repeating a message to the same effect from the Australian Government and urging me to give full and sympathetic consideration to the views of the Australian Government.",
