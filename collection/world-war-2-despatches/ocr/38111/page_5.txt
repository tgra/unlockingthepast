SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 30 OCTOBER," 1947.

number of heavy destroyers and about twenty
torpedo boats available in the Baltic. It is
probable that he realised our combined sea
-and air defences made the Southern North Sea
and the English Channel a very unpleasant area
for operations by the German Navy. In any
case, it is certain that, despite the few positive
Tesults of our night attacks, the enemy was
so charassed by them that he was unable
seriously to interfere with our ‘‘ Overlord”

2g. This-success meant that, from the end of
June, my anti-shipping aircraft were able to
devote-more of their time to the second of their
two tasks—the interruption of German coastal
shipping. In June, I directed the greater part
of my effort to the naval targets in the Channel,
and only a few attacks were made on convoys.
These, however, included some very successful
engagements, the most important of which
occurred on r5th June north of the Dutch
island of Schiermonnikoog, when Beaufighters
sank a merchantman of 8,000 tons, a naval
auxiliary of 4,000 tons and a minesweeper,
besides damaging four more of the escort vessels.

30. In July I kept up the Channel pro-
tection, but diverted all but one of the Beau-
fighter Squadrons to convoy strikes off the
coasts of Southern Norway and the Low
Countries. There is no doubt that these strikes
proved most harassing to the enemy, and he
was obliged to divert to this purely defensive
task numbers of minesweepers and naval escort
craft which he urgently required elsewhere. ~

- 31. The beginning of August saw a new
phase open in the shipping war. As our tanks
swept through North-Western France, enemy
coastal craft broke for the comparative safety
of the North Sea ports; one night alone saw
70 of them attacked from the air. Moreover,
the enemy in the Brest Peninsula was cut off
by land. He was therefore obliged to squeeze
yet more work from his seaborne supply ser-
vices. Every available ship in Western France
from Brest to Bordeaux was pressed into ser-
vice to keep the beleaguered garrisons sup-
plied. Coastal Command made the best of
‘his opportunity. Mosquitoes based in Corn-
wall, Halifaxes, previously operating in an
Anti-U-Boat role, and a Wing of Beaufighters

which I transferred from the East Coast convoy .

routes, operated all along the Biscay coast.
- Merchant ships, sperrbrechers, minesweepers
and coasters of all kinds were sunk, and a
fitting climax was reached on 24th August when
the last of the larger ‘German warships in: this
area, a Seetier and an Elbing class destroyer,
were sunk in the Gironde by the rockets of
the Beaufighter Wing.

32. At the beginning of September, the area

of anti-shipping activity had moved eastward ©

in the wake of the Allied armies. There were
no more attacks in the Bay of Biscay or in the

5129

Channel. As the enemy-occupied ports fell into
our hands, the night patrols of the Beaufighters,
Avengers and Wellingtons moved eastwards
along the coast. This happened so quickly that
there were no attacks off the Belgian Coast after
7th September, and our attention was turned
completely to the intensification of the offensive
against the enemy’s shipping operating off the
Dutch and Norwegian coasts.

33- Thus concluded three months of intensive
operations in which the German naval units and

* merchant shipping in Western Europe had been

hammered cunmercifully.

CONCLUSION.

34. I wish to end this despatch by paying
tribute to all personnel in Coastal “Command
who by their tireless endeavour and concerted.
efforts helped to bring about the victory over
the enemy sea opposition to the liberation of
Europe. In addition to the operations of my
Anti-U-Boat and Anti-Shipping aircraft, whose
activities have been recounted, the photographic
reconnaissance squadrons, the meteorological
squadrons and the air/sea rescue air and sur-
face craft all carried out their arduous . tasks
with skill and resolution.

35- I would like to mention particularly the
Fleet Air Arm Squadrons which were incor-
porated in my Command for operation ‘‘ Over-
lord’. They performed their varied duties
with outstanding keenness and precision.

36. A tribute must also be paid to the
Liberator Squadrons of the U.S. Navy, under
Commodore Hamilton, U.S.N., which, work-
ing under the operational control of 19 Group,
did invaluable work, particularly during the
“* cork in the bottle ’’ operations.

37. Two Norwegian Squadrons, a Czech and
a Polish Squadron were also distinguished for
their gallantry and enthusiasm in the com-
bined team.

38. Finally, it will not be’ forgotten that the
successes of our operations could not have come
about but for the: skill in planning and organi-
sation of the Command and Group Staffs who
~—with the invaluable and enthusiastic co- .
operation of the Staffs of the Naval Commands
—worked long and hard to perfect our pre-
parations; ahd but for the ceaseless energies of
the ground personnel at Stations who provided
our aircrews with the means to reap their
victories.

I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient Servant,
SHoLTo Dovuctas,
Air Chief Marshal,
Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,
’ Coastal Command, Royal Air Force.
