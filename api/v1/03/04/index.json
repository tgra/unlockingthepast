He no doubt calculated that he had time enough before our threat to the ‘‘ Gustav '” line became serious and experience had given him a justified confidence in the strength of his defences there. His renewed attack could not be made in the same force as the first; there were large gaps in his divisions and morale had suffered the inevitable depression that follows the failure of an offensive of which much had been hoped. Mackensen therefore planned an attack on a smaller scale, using LXXVI Corps only; it was designed to narrow down the bridgehead by driving a wedge into the eastern flank to cut off the troops defending the Mussolini canal. If this were successful a further process of attrition might reduce the bridgehead to dimensions too small for safety, Four divisions, including two panzer divisions, were to make the assault, with a mobile division in reserve: it was to be com~bined with diversionary attacks on both flanks, VI Corps was prepared for the attack on 2oth February and it was a complete failure: artillery fire and the firm defence of 3 Division broke up most of the attacks, a small penetration was made but was soon ironed out and by the afternoon of ist March the enemy had acknowledged defeat.t He never again resumed the offensive and I now could consider the Anzio bridgehead secure, especially after we had captured Fourteenth Army’s order of 4th March directing the assumption of the",
