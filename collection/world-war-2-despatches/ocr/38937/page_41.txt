SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

The directive on which Kesselring was act-
ing, dating from the previous October but still
in force, was to hold the Allies as far south of
Rome as possible. He had been successful,
at great strain and risk, in achieving this object
during the winter months, but this very success
had made his task more difficult. For the very
reason that he had kept the Allies out of Rome
for seven months the retention of Rome had
acquired a still greater value for prestige, a
consideration which might overrule the require-
ments of sound strategy; indeed for the same
Teason, ge acting here with ‘slightly lesser
force, the Cassino position had acquired a
semi-sacred character which would dictate a
special effort to hold it. However, there was no
reason for Kesselring to suppose that the task
laid on him would be beyond his powers. He
‘had twenty-three divisions to our twenty-eight,
two of them Panzer and four Panzer Grenadier
divisions. He had been receiving very strong
drafts all through the winter, amounting on the
average to fifteen thousand men a month, and
his formations were therefore well up to
strength.* New equipment, particularly an
increased divisional allotment of assault guns,
had arrived and the April lull had been used
to good advantage in training. Morale was
high and the troops could be relied on to
give a good account of themselves.

Of the twenty-three German divisions in the
country eighteen were in the two armies
actively engaged; as the battle developed all
but one were drawn in, together with five more
from other theatres. One of the two Panzer
divisions, the Hermann Goering Division, was
earmarked for France and was already half-
way there, as it was re-forming around Leg-
horn, but in the event it too was drawn into
the battle in Italy. 162 Infantry Division, a
formation of Soviet subjects, mainly Turko-
mans, had been brought in from Slovenia to
take over responsibility for the Tuscan coast.
During the lull in April the mobile divisions
in Tenth and Fourteenth Armies were pulled
out of the line into reserve. The infantry
divisions in the line also thinned out wherever
possible; in the Adriatic sector Russian troops
were employed in the line to relieve Germans
and even west of the Apennines battalions were
occupying sectors formerly held by regiments.
The enemy, therefore, was theoretically in a
good position to meet our offensive owing to the
presence of strong mobile reserves. It was
our prime object to see that these reserves
should be directed to the wrong sectors.

One thing was clear to the enemy: the Allies
would have to make an attack up the Liri
valley whatever else they did, and here the
German plan of defence rested on three forti-
fied positions known as the ‘‘ Gustav’’, ‘‘ Adolf
Hitler’ and ‘‘Caesar”’ lines. The first of
these was the present main line of resistance
which represented the rear line of the old
‘‘ winter position”, dented and endangered in
some parts by the Allied offensives from
January to March, but in principle the same
as planned. It had stood the test of many
furious attacks, which had revealed as nothing

* A good example is 15 Panzer Grenadier Division.
This was one of the hardest worked formations in
Tenth Army: and only came out of the line at the
beginning of May but its strength on 6 May was"13,984
plus 915 Italians employed mainly in the divisional
services,

else could have done its strength and its weak-
nesses, and during the April lull these lessons
had been applied in the form of much work
on the improvement of the defences. How-
ever even before this, in December 1943, work
had been started on a second line in rear
which was given the name of ‘‘ Adolf Hitler ’’
until its fall seemed imminent, when it was
changed to the colourless ‘‘ Dora ’’; we usually
called it the ‘‘ Piedimonte—Pontecorvo
line’. Its function was to bar the
advance up the Liri valley to a force which
had succeeded in forcing the Rapido, and for
this its left rested on Monte Cairo, descending
to the valley through Piedimonte, and its right -
on the Liri at Pontecorvo; south of the Liri

“there were few permanent defences on this line

for the country was very difficult. In the plain
the defences were by May very strong; they
included extensive belts of wire, anti-tank
ditches, minefields and steel pillboxs. many of
the latter formed by ‘‘ Panther ” tank turrets
sunk in the ground. Against a frontal assault,
therefore, the line was most formidable but it
had one serious weakness: the presence of a
strong Allied Corps many miles behind it at
Anzio. A break-out from there, cutting
Route 6, would make the ‘‘ Adolf Hitler ’’ line
useless, The Germans therefore began to con-
struct; in March, a third line of defences known
as the ‘‘Caesar’’ line. This was a position
to which Tenth and Fourteenth Armies would
withdraw when, and if, the Allies forced a
junction with the Anzio bridgehead; it might
be called the last-ditch defence of Rome
though, if it could be held, it gave reasonable
depth forward of the city. Its main purpose
was to block the gap between the Alban Hills
and the Prenestini mountains through which run
both Route 6 and the Alatri—Palestrina—
Tivoli road. To the west of this gap the line
continued across the Alban Hills to the left
flank of the bridgehead, and to the east of it
it ran via Avezzano and Celano to positions
on the Saline river west of Pescara. Only the
tight flank of the line, where it actually covered
Rome, had had much work done on it but the
positions here were naturally strong.

This was, in brief outline, the problem which
faced me in planning the battle for Rome.
The solution eventually adopted was first given
expression in an appreciation of 22nd February
and the plan there proposed was agreed on at
an Army Commanders’ conference at Caserta
on 28th February. In essence it involved
making Fifth Army responsible for the sea
flank, including Anzio and the Aurunci Moun-
tains south of the Liri, and bringing the weight
of Eighth Army into an attack up the Liri
valley. It would mean a great effort of
regrouping and would take a considerable time.
This would in any case be inevitable, for all
troops in both Fifth and Eighth Anmies were
exhausted and time was necessary, not only for
them to be rested, but also for the arrival of
reinforcements.

Two main problems faced the administrative
staff: the maximum number of divisions which
could be maintained in Italy by the existing
port facilities and the practicability of main-
taining the bulk of these on an axis west of
the Apennines. The agreed figure for the first
was twenty-eight divisions, which coincided well
enough with the maximum number we actually
had available. The second problem was made
easier by the fact that the original plan for a
