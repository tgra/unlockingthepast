SUPPLEMENT to tas LONDON GAZETTE, 30 OCTOBER, 1047

16 Group. - °

‘(i) To hunt and destroy E-Boats and
destroyers in the Southern North Sea.

(ii) To provide anti-E-Boat and destroyer
reconnaissance in conjunction with Naval
Surface Forces operating in the Southern
North Sea.

Form of Operations. :
az. It was correctly appreciated that anti-
ship operations would take place mostly at
night and at dawn and dusk, and these were
to take the following forms: —
At night. :
(i) Operation of Albacore and Swordfish.
under G.C.I. control of 10 and 11 Groups.
(ii) Reconnaissance by Wellington flare-
dropping A.S.V. aircraft operating under 16
and 19 Groups, and the subsequent direction
of Naval Surface Craft and/or Coastal Com-
mand Reaufighters to the target. —~
. At.dusk and dawn. .
Beaufighter sweeps with the object of de-
stroying enemy Light Surface Craft when
leaving harbour at dusk or returning from
patrol at dawn.

rz. As in the case of anti-U-Boat measures,
I was prepared to implement these plans as a
result of enemy reaction to exercises such as
‘* Fabius ’’, or to any other event which might
have led him ‘to believe that the assault was

imminent.

Main Battle Zone. :

13. In agreement with the Admiralty and the
Air Commander-in-Chief, A.E.A.F., I demar-
cated an area between the lines Portland to
Jersey on the West and North Foreland to

Calais on the East, as the main battle zone. .

‘Coastal Command aircraft were. to operate

primarily on the flanks of this area and only ,

to a limited extent within it. This was an
important point. I expected such a concentra-
tion of shipping of all sorts in this zone that
even by day I considered it would be difficult
to distinguish friend from foe, and at night
almost impossible. As it turned out, however,
it became possible, by special briefing at Area
Combined Headquarters, for my anti-shipping
aircraft to operate within the Battle Zone out-
side the central area containing the cross-
-channel shipping lanes. .

Order of Battle. : 2
14. The Order of Battle, as it stood on 4th
June, 1944, shows that, in order to make the
- flooded urea in the S.W. Approaches effective, I
deployed no less than 21 of my A/U squadrons
: together with 4 Fleet Air: Arm squadrons in
this area. My anti-shipping striking force
consisted of seven Beaufighter squadrons, of
which I allotted initially five to the east of the
main battle zone where the threat of .E-Boats
was considered greater, and two to the west.

ConpuUCcT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
“U-Boat Operations in the North.

15. Intensive operations for Coastal Com-

mand began in mid-May, although only the
Anti-U-Boat squadrons in the North were in-
volved. At ‘this time .the enemy decided
hurriedly to reinforce his U-Boat flotillas in the
Bay of Biscay by moving a number of his
Norwegian-based ‘boats into the Atlantic and

thence southwards to the Channel and French
West Coast ports. The U-Boats were presum-
ably in too much ofa humy to proceed sub-
merged, and their Commanding Officers were
apparently confident in the efficiency of their
anti-aircraft defences, for they remdined ‘on
the surface and shot it out with the aircraft
to their own detriment. Every opportunity
was taken to bring to bear on the’ enemy the
fullest weight of attack without reducing the
forces preparing for the vital struggle which
was shortly to take place in the S.W.
Approaches, and I therefore moved detach-
ments of squadrons from Iceland and Northern
Ireland to airfields and flying boat bases in
northern Scotland and the Shetlands, to sup-
plement the aircraft at the disposal of the
A.O.C. 18 Group. All through June and July
these Northern operations went. on, and to-
wards the end of July they had extended into
Arctic waters, where the enemy seemed to be
trying to work round into the Atlantic out of
aircraft range. This meant that operations

were being conducted at no less than 850 miles

from the aircraft’s bases. At the end of June,
however, I had moved the whole of the VLR*
Liberator squadron from Iceland to Tain, and
this squadron bore the brunt of the operations
conducted in these very far Northern regions.

16. During June perhaps three or four boats
in all got through to the Bay of Biscay. The
rest were either destroyed or damaged and
forced to put back to Norway. In those
Northern latitudes at that time of year there
‘was no darkness, and, at the beginning of the
battle at any rate, few of the Northern U-Boats
had been fitted with ‘‘ schnorkel ’’. These two
factors were largely responsible for the oppor-
tunities for so many attacks.

17. During the period mid-May to the end
of July, we sighted seventy-five U-Boats in
Northern Waters and attacked fifty-one. Of
these sixteen were sunk or probably sunk and
twelve damaged. These successes were not
achieved without cost. 162 Canadian Squadron
sank four U-Boats and lost three Catalinas in
June- alone. Two Victoria Crosses. were
awarded to officers taking part in these opera-
tions, one posthumously to the Captain of a
Catalina of the afore-mentioned 162 (R.C.A.F.)
Squadron, and a second to the Captain of a
Catalina of 210 Squadron. F ‘
U-Boat Operations in the South. ¢ .

18. Despite the importance of these far away
operations, it was inevitable that the. main
attention should be concentrated on the beaches
of Normandy and the English Channel. The

Preparations for the assault and the large scale”

exercises during the last few days of May and

‘the beginning of Jane did not produce any re-

actions from the enemy, and on 6th June the
majority of the enemy’s operational U-Boats
were still assembled in the Biscay ports. They
were not offensively deployed on that date, so
there can be no doubt that the enemy had
been unable to discover the date of our land-
ing. On D-Day however, he reacted swiftly. It
soon became clear -that the U-Boats were
making for the assault area with the utmost
speed—that is, on the surface whenever
possible. The air patrols which had ‘been
planned to counter this move were already being
flown and successes soon materialised. Off the
Brest Peninsula and in the mouth of the
