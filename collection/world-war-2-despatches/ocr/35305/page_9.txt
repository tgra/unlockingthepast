SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1942 5907

28th March; 44th Division, on disembarkation,
moved into 3rd Corps reserve in the St. Pol area,
and 5oth Division into 2nd Corps reserve, south-
west of Lille ; 42nd Division, on arrival, moved
to the area south-west of Amiens, in G.H.Q.
reserve.

3. The German invasion of Denmark and
Norway on gth April created’a new situation ;
leave was stopped in the British and French
Armies on 1oth April, and 15th Infantry Brigade
of 5th Division was despatched to England,
en rowte for Norway, on 15th April; certain
units of 42nd Division were also retained at
home, but with a few exceptions despatched
later. The remainder of 5th Division was left
in France, but in War Office reserve, and was
accordingly relieved in 3rd Corps by 42nd
Division. Reports of enemy intentions to invade
Holland and Belgium were received from
different sources and at different times, and
between the 11th and 2and April certain troops
were placed under short notice to move. Intensi-
fied air reconnaissance was ordered in the zone
allotted to the Air Component which included
part of the Ruhr and the area to the west of it,
but apart from small bridging activity no
positive results were observed.

The Saar Front.

6. During this period the detachment of one
infantry brigade on the Saar front was main-
tained ; at the outset the severe cold interfered
considerably with the work of improving the
defences in the forward area. Much required to
be done, as increased protection, pro-
vision of alternative fire positions, covered
approaches and improved communications ; the
wire required thickening and its tactical lay-out
improving ; the thaw, when it set in, was rapid
and energetic steps had to be taken to maintain
a proper standard of sanitation,

The tour of duty of each infantry brigade was
raised in March to three weeks, and a pioneer
battalion was included in the detachment.

At the end of March it was decided to increase
the Saar force to a total of one division, with
attached troops, including cavalry, i
guns, and pioneers, 51st Division was selected.
The Division had concentrated in the Metz area
by 30th April and by 7th May had relieved
7th French Division, thus extending the
British front on the Saar on either side of the
front originally held to a total of 12,000 yards
from Guerstling exclusive to Remeling inclusive.

sist Division remained in the Saar area and
took no part in the operations in Northern
France. From roth May therefore, it ceased
to be under my effective command; the Saar
Force was later moved to the Rouen area,
where it took part in subsequent operations.

Patrolling, both by our own troops and by
the enemy, grew steadily more active during
this period ; early on the morming of the 5th
March, the enemy carried out a successful raid,
supported with a box barrage of a type familiar
in the war of 1914-18, on one of our front line
positions in a wood known as the Hartebusch,
then held by a battalion of the 4th Division
(and D.CLI.). In this and subsequent
encounters the enemy regularly suffered casual-
ties, many of them at the hands of battalions
of the 144th Infantry Brigade of the 48th
Division, the first Territorial Army formation
to meet the enemy in. this campaign.

The sub-machine gun was taken into experi-
mental use by patrols in the Saar front: its
value had already been recognised and I trust
that a weapon of this type will be permanently
included in the armament of the infantry.

Preparation for Further Expansion.

7. In the meantime I had been preparing for
the arrival of further troops, and, in particular,
for the formation of Army Headquarters which
were due to arrive in the latter part of June.
On the assumption that the positions held by
the B.E.F, were to remain the same, a lay-out
had been prepared involving a move of G.H.Q.
The construction of the new G.H.Q. and of
the two Army headquarters.was put in hand;
this involved the laying of about 150 route
miles of heavy armoured cable. Negotiations
were in progress regarding the extension of the
front of the B.E.F. on arrival of a fourth Corps,
the French being anxious that this should
be southwards rather than northwards.

Development of the Defensive Positions..

8. The development of the successive defen-
sive positions and switch lines behind the
Belgian frontier was continued steadily till
roth May. By this date over 400 concrete
“ pill-boxes”’ of varying size had been com-
pleted with over 100 more under construction,
while work on the improvement of field defences,
wire and other obstacles proceeded continuously
on the original front and in the sector north of
Armentiéres recently taken over from the
French,

Chiefly by the use of excavator machinery
over 40 miles of revetted anti-tank ditch had .
been added to that prepared by the French
army in time of peace. Machines had also been
used to assist the troops in constructing earth-
work defences, mixing concrete and burying
signal cables.

Training.

. Training areas were being prepared to
accommodate the Armoured Division and other’
formations; base reinforcement depdts were
rapidly taking shape in their new locations near
Rouen, and their training staffs had assembled.
Corps schools had been established, principally
for the training of junior leaders, and a sniping
school had been set up. Practice camps, both
for field and anti-aircraft artillery had been
developed with the help of the French and steps
taken to continue the weapon training of
selected units.

The practice undertaken with anti-tank
weapons, to which special attention was given,
was amply to prove its value when the time came.
The Equipment Situation.

xo. The situation as regards equipment,
though there was latterly some improvement in
certain directions, caused me serious misgivings,
even before men and material began to be
diverted by the needs of operations elsewhere.
I had on several occasions called the attention
of the War Office to the shortage of almost every
nature of ammunition of which the stocks in
France were not nearly large enough to permit
of the rates of expenditure laid down for sus-
tained operations before the War.

There was a shortage of guns in some of the
anti-tank regiments of the Royal Artillery,
while armour-piercing shells for field guns had
not, by roth May, been provided. ‘
