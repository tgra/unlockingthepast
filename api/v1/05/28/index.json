            "description": "6. At o600 on the 28th May, Force B, con- . sisting of C.S.7 in ORION with AJAX, DIDO, DECOY, JACKAL, IMPERIAL, HOTSPUR, KIMBERLEY and HEREWARD, left Alexandria to evacuate the Heraklion garrison. Force\u2019B was about go miles from Scarpanto at 1700 and from then until dark was subjected to a series of air attacks, consisting of high level bombing, dive bombing and torpedo, attack, At 1920 IMPERIAL was-near missed but at the time appeared to be undamaged. At 2100 AJAX had a close miss which started a small fire, seriously wounded twenty men and caused slight damage to the ship\u2019s side. In view of the need for ships to be fully efficient to carry out the night evdcuation and to cope with the almost certain air attacks on the following day, C.S.7, after receiving a report of the damage from AJAX, decided that she should return to Alexandria. Shortly. after zioo, C.S.7 gave orders accordingly."

The success of this plan depended upon reduc- ing Bir Hacheim or breaching our minefield further north and then: inflicting upon our armour a decisive blow. In all of these objects the enemy was thwarted. On the 28th May the enemy moved against Acroma but with- drew, and on the 29th his main armoured force"

After taking this decision the news of the intention of His Majesty\u2019s Government to evacuate Northern Norway was received, and it became necessary to consider whether the operation was to be proceeded with or not. After consulting General Bethouart, I recom- mended to Lord Cork that it should be carried out as intended on the night of 27/28th May. In doing so I considered that, apart from the desirability of making sure whether the facilities for shipping ore from Narvik had in fact been destroyed as thoroughly as had been teported, the chances that a successful attack would do imuch to conceal our intention to evacuate the country in the immediate future would outweigh the possible disadvantages in- volved in extending our commitments by establishing troops in close contact with the enemy on the Narvik Peninsula, where his main force was thought to be located."

This skoot stated that Dunkirk had already fallen into German hands and that the evacuation had ceased. Asa result of this ill-judged comment, the arrival of at least 6 skoots was delayed at over 24 hours, until this situation had been cleared up."

Two rivers, the Fornelli and the Maringo, cut across this line of advance and both formed serious obstacles. Pofi was captured that night after a heavy dive-bombing attack. Next day the armoured division made contact with the French in Ceccano and on the tight moved up to Route 6 at a point some five miles short of Frosinone. On the 30th 1 Canadian Infantry Division, which had re- lieved the armoured division, captured Frosi- none, which stands on a steep pment commanding the junction with the road leading north through Subiaco. On the same day 10 Corps captured Alvito and were threatening Sora on the Arce-Avezzano road. 13 Corps, between the Canadians and ro Corps, was advancing with difficulty on Alatri; in this sector also contested river crossings over the many tributories of the Liri were the principal enemy delaying tactics."

The following night (27th/28th May), main bodies were to withdraw behind the Lys, leaving rearguards on the Deule canal up to its junction with the Lys at Deulemont: these rearguards were to stay there until the next night (28th/2gth May). The immediate effect of these dispositions would be to shorten the total perimeter by some 58 miles, but on the other hand I had to face the possibility of having to occupy the front from Ypres to the sea, some 25 miles long, which was still the responsibility of the Belgian Army."
