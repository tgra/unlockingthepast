that neither party in Malaya knew much about
the technique of co-operating with the other
when war came.

Siting of Aerodromes in N. Malaya.

652. Unfortunately the selection of several
aerodrome sites in Malaya had been made with
insufficient regard to the needs of their tactical
defence. Until the middle of 1941, sites had
been chosen without sufficient consultation
between the army and air force authorities con-
cerned. Sited as they were, in positions tac-
tically difficult to defend, these aerodromes
‘imposed an unnecessary strain on the army in
the ultimate event. It is only fair to point out,
however, that they were strategically necessary
if the R.A.F. was to fulfil its allotted role in
the defence of Malaya.

Insecurity of Aerodromes.

653. Our aerodromes, particularly in N.
Malaya, were far from being the secure air
bases which could properly be occupied in the
face of a strong enemy. There were neither
the fighter aircraft, mor sufficient A.A.
defences, nor an effective warning system
to ensure reasonable defence against air
attack, The enemy could, and did, destroy
our aircraft on the ground in N. Malaya almost
at will, and our squadrons were driven out of
the aerodromes there within a matter of days.

654. These same aerodromes were invaluable
to the enemy. He had the necessary air forces
to occupy them as they were captured, and he
had the means of defending them from all forms
of attack.

655. From this emerges the lesson that aero-
dromes may be a liability rather than an asset
unless there are sufficient forces, both air and
ground, available to prevent the enemy captur-
ing and using them. In other words—provision
of defences must go hand in hand with aero-
drome construction.

WEAKNESSES IN AIR Force MATTERS.

Over-centrahsation nm A.H.O.

656. A.H.Q. had to deal directly with eight
superior and collateral authorities. The area
it controlled stretched from Durban to Hong
Kong. The majority of its units were located
in Malaya. (See Appendices A and C).

657. When war came in 1941 the formations
in Burma and the Indian Ocean were trans-
ferred to another Command. Nevertheless,
A.H.Q. still had to handle a large number of
units with many different functions, and to do
so simultaneously in a land battle, in seaward
operations and in air defence. It had to admini-
ster direct the operational units engaged in them
as well as a large number of administrative
units, many of which were unexpectedly in-
volved in mobile operations for which they
were not fully prepared. It had no intervening
bomber, coastal or administrative groups to
which to decentralise in Malaya.

658. Even if the staff had contained an
adequate number of experienced staff officers,
such a high degree of centralisation would have
been ditficult to exercise efficiently. But most
of the staff were inexperienced, although they
were willing and many were able men. The
load had consequently to be carried by a few
able and experienced officers whose numbers
were quite inadequate to cope with the situation
—either before war broke out or after. Here

again the war in Europe had its effect: its urgent
needs absorbed all but a few experienced
officers.

659. These faults demonstrated the weakness
of an over-centralised organisation and of a
Command which lacks a sufficient percentage
of trained staff officers. A Headquarters which
suffers from either fault cannot withstand the
strain of war.

Allied Aw Forces.

660. The British air striking force which was
available in the Far East was in numbers far
below that which the Chiefs of Staff considered
necessary to ensure a reasonable degree of
security, even against the calculated Japanese
strength which, as already shown, was under-
estimated.

661. In quality our aircraft were obsolescent

or obsolete. Squadrons had not been
modernised. Their signals and navigational aids
were primitive or out of date. Radar warning
was limited to the immediate vicinity of Singa-
pore. Their armament was in some respects
poor.
-' 662. Several fighter squadrons had formed
shortly before the war broke out and were not
adequately trained. Others had recently re-
armed and were still unfamiliar with their air-
craft. A high proportion of fighter pilots had
joined their squadrons straight from F.T.S.’s
without O.T.U, training. 8

All were troubles which would have been put
tight but for the war in Europe.

Change of Personnel.

663. A sweeping change of personnel by
posting and drafting occurred during the summer
and autumn of 1941. Those who were relieved
had been over-long in the Far East and it was
time they went. <A high proportion of those
who replaced them came straight from training
establishments without having had unit experi-
ence. No criticism of those responsible is
intended: it was assumed that there would be
time for them to settle down before war broke
out. When war unexpectedly came the Com-
mand contained a high percentage of personnel
who had much to learn about the application of
what they had been taught or about their new
duties in service units. Many were new to the
tropics. Much credit is due to them for the
manner in which they strove to play their part.
It is unfortunate that circumstances in Europe
had prevented the change being spread over a
longer period by being started sooner.

Inadequate Training.

664. Personnel were willing, but the means
for training them were inadequate because the
demands elsewhere had drained resources.
Many courses of instruction were improvised
locally, during the summer and autumn preced-
ing the war, to make good short-comings in
training of aircrews, administrative and other
personnel of all ranks, but they were too late
to produce the results required.

665. In particular there were Weaknésses in,
the training of fighter squadrons which had
been based on the assumption that the enemy
was of poor quality.

666. The imperative necessity for personnel
to be fully trained in their duties before they
have to face a trained enemy needs no further
emphasis.
