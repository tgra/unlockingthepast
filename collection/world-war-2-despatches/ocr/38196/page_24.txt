parties and race for safety through the gaps in
our deployment, losing a number of tanks and
guns but succeeding in getting the mam body
away. As soon as it was seen that by these
tactics the enemy was escaping 4 Light
Armoured Bngade was sent on to harass the
fugitives. But almost every one of the bridges
and culverts over the numerous wadis had been
blown up, afd the wadis sown with mines; in
addition the country on either side of the road
was exceedingly rough, so that the armoured
cars were unable to close with the enemy. In
spite of these difficulties the advance guard
covered the forty miles to Nofilia by the even-
ing of 16th December. For the next two days
the Light Armoured Brigade engaged round
Nofiha in skirmishes with the enemy rearguard,
which began to retire on the roth by stages to
Sirte. By 22nd December go Light and 21 Pan-
zer Divisions had joined the main body, which
was hastily preparing a fresh defensive
position at Buerat, leaving 15 Panzer Division
to cover Sirte.

Beyond Nofilia an advance in force was for
the moment impossible for administrative
reasons: Nofilia itself is two hundred and sixty
miles from Benghazi, the advanced base, and
Sirte eighty miles further still, An advance
was essential, however, for the sake of the
Rofal Air Force, since there were very few land-
ing grounds in the area in which we were
operating and it was vital to secure those at
Sirte, in order to give clgse support to the
attack on the Buerat line. An armoured car
regiment was therefore sent to work round to
the south of the village. Fearful for the loss
of half of his remaming tanks the enemy at
once withdrew and shortly after noon on Christ-
mas Day the village was entered without oppo-
sition. As the enemy had proved so sensitive
to an outflanking movement the manoeuvre
was continued until finally, by 30th December,
he had fallen back before our armoured car
patrols to the main position.

The Buerat position was not particularly
strong and could easily ibe outflanked. East of
the village was the broad and difficult Wadi
Bey el Kebir and west of it the Wadi Zem Zem;
it was on the latter that the enemy established
his main position, which was less than twenty-
five miles in length. It was a subject of con-
siderable conjecture at the trme why Rommel
should have decided on standing where he did
tather than further back, in particular on the
naturally very strong line from Tarhuna to
Homs. The reason, as it now appears, was
that the Axis had decided to evacuate the
whole of Tripolitania and concentrate all ther
resources on the defence of Tunisia. The de-
cision had been made by 31st December.
Strategically the intention was sound; the Ger-
man High Command believed that it would be
possible to hold a permanent bridgehead in
Tunisia which could tie down our forces there
and continue to maintain the barrier in the
Mediterranean communications at the Sicilian
narrows. Naturally the more time that could
be obtained for the purpose of evacuation the
better and the mobile rearguard would there-
fore await our attack as far forward as was
safe. The Italian infantry divisions began ‘to
move back in the first week in January and
shortly afterwards the Trieste Division, includ-
ing the remains of all the Italian divisions
destroyed at Alamein, and 21 Panzer Division

were detached from the Army and sent to
southern Tunisia. The rearguard therefore con-
sisted mainly of go Light and 15 Panzer
Divisions.

We were naturally unaware of the enemy in-
tention to withdraw right into Tunisia and to ”
all appearance the problem now facing us was
a most difficult one. It would be comparatively
simple to turn the Buerat line but before we
attempted that it was essential to be in a posi-
tion to advance direct on Tripoli without a pause
and seize the port. Just before we reached
it we should be six hundred miles from our
nearest base, at Benghazi, and to maintain any
appreciable force over that distance would
present insuperable difficulties. There was no
suitable port on the Gulf of Sirte and everything
had to come up ‘by the one road; it would re-
quire at least two weeks to build up the
reserves, especially the petrol, which would be
needed for the dash to Tripoli. In the mean-
time there was a good deal of reconnaissance
to be done. This country was quite unknown
to us, except from the not very reliable Italian
maps, and General Montgomery employed the
Long Range Desert Group, which I had put
under his command, for an extensive pro-
gramme of reconnoitring routes forward and
landing grounds. I cannot speak too highly of
the work of this very specialized orgamzation
both now and on previous occasions; its mem-
bers, all picked volunteers, had reduced the
problem of moving across the desert to some-,
thing between an exact science and a fine art.

General Montgomery’s plan was to attack up
the main road with 50 and 51 Divisions and
make a wide outflanking movement through
the desert to the left with 7 Armoured and 2
New Zealand Divisions, all under 30 Corps.
He was very anxious, however, not to scare
the enemy off his present ne prematurely, for
a withdrawal would multiply our problems.
Accordingly the main bodies of this force were
left right back and the enemy observed only
with an armoured car screen from 4 Light
Armoured Brigade. 7 Armoured Division was
forty-five nules further east, the New Zealand
Division a hundred miles and 51 Division, ex-
cept for 154 Brigade on the Wadi Bey el Kebir,
two hundred miles behind the front. This, of
course, had the additional advantage of eas-
ing the problem of maintenance. Advance
parties were brought forward to reconnoitre the
proposed routes of attack and some artillery
registration was carried out. The intention was
to attack on 15th January if the enemy showed
signs of withdrawing and on the 9th if he
was prepared io stand. It was soon clear that
the former was the more likely; the infantry
began moving off, Pistoia and Spezia on the
3rd and 4th and the Young Fascists shortly
afterwards. At this point, however, an unex-
pected difficulty arose. On 4th and 5th
January very heavy gales at Benghazi caused
severe damage; the outer mole was breached,
four ships, one containing over two thousand
tons of ammunition, were sunk and the capa-
city of the port was reduced by two-thirds. The
intake of stores had to be supplemented by
road from Tobruk. In order to make up for
this while still sticking to the proposed date
General Montgomery decided to drop 50 Divi-
sion from the attack and leave it and the rest
of 10 Corps, which he had intended to bring
forward to the Agheila area, back in Cyrenaica
