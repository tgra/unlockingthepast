reception: doubtful and transmission on aiy

some unreliability in naval ‘communications
which finally caused use to be made of an Army
Marconi W/T set working to Cairo. This was
‘subsequently proved to be unnecessary since my
immediate signals BS and 1151/26 were, in
fact, received by V.A.L.F. about 1400/26. -

On departure from Myli, ore W/T set and
books were embarked in the caique and subse-
quently in the destroyer HAVOCK, but due to
the darkness, confusion with Army personnel and
equipment, and the limited and varied means of
water transport, an essential box of spares was
lost overboard, and the set itself suffered some
damage.

33. At ogoo, news was received that the
Corinth Canal, together with the road and rail
bridge,. had been attacked and was probably
held by German’ parachute troops, following on
an intense aerial bombardment. This necessi-
tated a further alteration of plan, as it.was then
‘evident that the only place from which the rear-
guard could be withdrawn with reasonable safety
was from the embarkation points in the area
‘to the east of Athens. A fresh plan was made
and signalled, and ‘this was adhered fo for the
remainder of the evacuation. It was very for;
tunate that this signal could be passed to
Brigadiers Charrington and Puttock at this time.

34, At sunset we abandoned our H.Q. and the
whole ‘proceeded to Myli pier. On arrival
at the pier-it was found that -the flying boat had

atrived, but there was no sign of the destroyer. .

The more important passengers were embarked
in’ the fiying- ‘boat. My arrangements were
for my Chief Staff Officer, Commander Fearn,
to accompany General- Wilson to Suda that
night with the object of co-operation with
S.N.O. Suda Bay and V.A.L.F. in the direct-
ing of movements of escorts and. shipping at
Suda Bay, in case W/T communications from

the Morea should fail in the later stages. Com- -

mander Fearn was, of course, fully conversant
’ with the’ situation so far as it was known.
Genéral Wilson suggested that I should leave
with him that night, but I decided to remain
until the N.Z. Brigade under General Freyberg
had been evacuated, and to proceed to’ their

beaches at’Monemvasia myself, taking with me. .

my Signal staff, W/T set, “‘beachmasters, etc.
It appeared to me-at the time that if the
L.C.T, failed to arrive; this might be a difficult
operation’ and lengthy, and I preferred’ to be
on the spot myself.

35. The local situation in‘ the Morea was
that at midnight, our covering forces 15° miles
to the north of Myli were being withdrawn
‘through Myli to Tripolis, and it was. anticipated
that by next morning the énemy would be in
Myli and Nauplia, by which -time the large
_ embarkation, which was in the process of be-
ing carried out at the latter place, should’ be
completéd.’ The’ enemy air superiority made
it necessary for us to get to’ Monemvasia,- 56
miles distant, before daylight. Asan alter-
native method of proc Ain the event of
a destroyer not being available, the Crown
Prince of -Greece’s motor yacht’ had been
plecd at my: disposal, .with Lieut. Harrison,
R.N.R. in command, but'this yacht had been
“ bombed and put .out of action during the

course of the:afternoon. The only’ other alter-.

' 38, In the’ forenoon, Commander James, the

paration for the coming night’s embarkation. I
ordered him to ‘try to get into telephonic com-
munication with Kalamata, but this he was

4o. On the night’ bth 27th April, a total
of approximately 18,000 troops: were evacuatéd;
and all areas were used except. the Megara
area. Owing to a heavy ground swell off
Raphena . (Ce beach) difficulty was experienced
in transferring troops from landing craft along-
side the GLENGYLE: The Commanding Officer
therefore issued instructions that the last land-
ing craft were to be clear of the beach by ]
o215,.in order that craft could be hoisted in time (
for GLENGYLE to sail at 0300. About 700

men were left ashore and were brought off the '

‘next night.

41. The numbers embarked from Nauplia
were greatly reduced owing to the stranding of
ULSTER PRINCE preventing the use of
wharves by destro’ sate and also to the non-
arrival of .GLENEARN landing craft, due to
the ship having been disabled by bombing
attack on-26th April. The numbers actually

were approximately 5,500 instead of the. 8,009
planned.

42. On the night 27th/28th April, approxi- {
mately 4,700 embarked from the area to the °
east of Athens. This party included the rear- 4
