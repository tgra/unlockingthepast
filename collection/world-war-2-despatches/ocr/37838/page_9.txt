SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 JANUARY, 1947 45

French railway authorities indicated very clearly
that pre-D-Day attacks achieved the purpose
intended. The Nazi controlled transport system
was very badly disorganised. It had therefore,
become extremely vulnerable to the attention of
the medium and fighter bombers, which, in the
periods just before and after the assault, caused
great destruction to immobilised rolling stock.

74. Attacks on Locomotive Power.—Attack
on repair depots and facilities was the main
method of achieving the desired reduction in
traction power. It was accepted that these
attacks would, at the same time, damage and
destroy locomotives. For example, in one such
attack, about five per cent. of the locomotives
in the Region Nord were put out of service. In
addition, however, it was planned to attack
directly trains and locomotives on open lines.

75. I.first initiated special large scale fighter
sweeps against trains and locomotives in
Northern France and Belgium on 2st May,
1944. On this day, concentrated efforts were
made in certain areas in France, with some
attention to connections from Germany and Bel-
gium. Fighters of A.E.A.F. and the United
States Eighth Air Force swept over railway
tracks covering a very wide area and created
havoc among locomotives, passenger trains,
goods trains and oil wagons.

76. On this day, 21st May, 504 Thunderbolts,
233 Spitfires, 16 Typhoons and 10 Tempests
of A.E.A.F. operated throughout the day,
claiming 67 locomotives destroyed, 9 locomo-
tives damaged and six locomotives stopped.
Eleven other locomotives were attacked with
unknown results and numerous trains were
attacked and damage inflicted on trucks, car-
-Tiages, oil wagons, etc.

77-_On this same day, United States Eighth
Air Force Fighter Command sent out 131
Lightnings, 135 Thunderbolts and 287 Mustangs
against similar targets in Germany. They
claimed 9x locomotives destroyed and 134 loco-
motives damaged. In addition, one locomo-
tive tender, six goods wagons and three box
cars were destroyed, whilst seven goods wagons,
seven trains, three rail cars, four box cars and
thirteen trucks were damaged, and sixteen
trains set on fire.

78. From 22nd May to D-Day, A.E.AF.
flew 1,388 sorties with the primary purpose of
attacking locomotives. In this period they
claimed 157 locomotives destroyed and 82
damaged, as well as numerous tricks.

79. On 25th May, United States Eighth Air
Force Fighter Command flew 608 sorties over
France and Belgium, with the result that 41
locomotives, I troop train with approximately
300 men and 19 trucks were destroyed, and 25
locomotives and 50 trucks were damaged.
Though outside the ‘‘ Neptune ”* area, it is in-
teresting to record that on agth May, aircraft
of Eighth Air Force Fighter Command flew 571
sorties over Eastern Germany and Poland,
attacking 24 locomotives, 32 oil tank cars, ‘16
box cars and 3 freight trains with unobserved
results. In addition to these special attacks,
aircraft of Eighth Air Force Fighter Command
frequently attacked locomotives and trains
amongst other ground targets, when returning
from escorting heavy bombers.

80. The total effort by fighters against roll-
ing stock from 19th May to D-Day was as
under: —

AEAF. ... we ++» 2,201 sorties
U.S, Eighth Air Force ... 1,731 sorties
3-932 sorties

81. With the capacity and flexibility of the
enemy rail system destroyed, the enemy armies
in the field were denied the freedom of move-
ment necessary to mount decisive counter-
attacks. Further, the enemy armies and their
supplies were forced on to the roads, thus not
only slowing up their movement and making
them more vulnerable to air attack, but also
by compelling the enemy to use motor trans-
port making him draw more heavily on his
precious reserves of oi) and rubber. Air attacks
on these road movements eventually forced the
enemy to move mainly by night.

82. During the assault and post-assault
phases, this stranglehold on the enemy rail com-
munications was effectively maintained. De-
tails of the attacks involved and some evidence
of the delay produced in the enemy build-up
are given in Part III (c) of this Despatch.

83. Destruction of Bridges—As I have
already explained, complementary to the plan
to destroy, by air attack, the enemy’s rail
motive power, I planned also to endeavour to
destroy all the principal rail and road bridges
leading into the assault area. If these were
destroyed, not only would the enemy’s rate of
build-up in that area be further checked and
his flow of reinforcements and supplies be
further impeded, but also his ability to escape
rapidly from the assault area in the event of
his being forced to retreat would be very
seriously impaired. The implications of the
attacks on bridges were, therefore, somewhat
wider than those of the other attacks on his
communications system. In conjunction with
these other attacks, the attacks on bridges were
designed to seal off the assault area and so
force the enemy to stand and fight, and since
he could not easily retreat, any defeat would
be decisive.

84. A bridge is, by nature of its size, very
difficult to hit and, by nature of its construc-
tion, even more difficult to destroy completely.
Calculation suggested that approximately 600
tons of bombs per bridge would be needed if
the task were entrusted to heavy bombers. In
fact, it was found that an average of 640 tons
of bombs per bridge was needed. What was not
at first realised was how effectively, and rela-
tively cheaply, the task could be carried out by
fighter bombers. It was learnt from the attacks
on bridges by the aircraft of A.E.A.F. that a
bridge could be destroyed for the expenditure
of approximately Ioo sorties, that is between
Ioo and 200 tons of bombs.

85. In order not to betray a special interest
jn the “‘ Neptune’ area, attention was paid
in the preparatory phase principally to the
bridges over the Seine, with some others over
the Oise, Meuse and the Albert Canal, leaving
to the assault phase the task of attacking
bridges south of Paris to Orleans and west along
the Loire.

86. On 2ist April, 1944, the first of a series
of attacks against bridges was made by
Typhoons. Subsequent attacks were carried
