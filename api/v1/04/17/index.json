I met the en- voy myself and explained the situation to him verbally, namely that all the Rases who had worked with the Italians had submitted to the Emperor and Ethiopians everywhere were flocking to his standard; moreover the whole country was swarming with armed deserters from the Italian army who were turhing into marauding \u2018bands, which were attacking Italian civilians and property; if I were to answer all requests for protection which I was getting, military operations would be hampered, and that neither myself nor my Commanders would be fulfilling our military duty of waging war against the Italians to the utmost degree; only on one condition could we accept any msi~ \u2018bility for civilians not in our hands and that was the unconditional laying down of arms, when we would be in a position to undertake the pro- tection, feeding and evacuation of Italian nationals. The envoy asked me to confirm that we would look after the civilians already in our hands. I said I would to the best of my power, but took the opportunity of impress- ing upon him that incidents such as shooting of Abyssinians in Addis Abeba by Italian police made my task extremely difficult. I gave the envoy until rooo hours on 17th April to reply. On that day an aeroplane again landed at the same aerodrome with a message to the effect that, in view of the importance of the proposals and the grave responsibilities they carried, they would have to be referred to Rome. Furthermore they were required in writing. I thereupon sent the following"
