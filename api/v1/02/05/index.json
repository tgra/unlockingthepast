            "description": "112. General Wingate originally estimated that about twelve weeks would be the maximum period which troops would be able to with- stand the rigorous conditions under which they would be called upon to operate. His original plan, therefore, was (i) to march in 16 L.R.P. Brigade from Ledo, because the route was known to be practicable and this formation would be able to co-operate more closely with General Stilwell\u2019s forces advancing in the same area, and (ii) later to fly in 77 and 111 L.R.P. Brigades, retaining the other brigades as a \u201csecond wave\u201d which might, or might not, be used to operate during the monsoon, in relief of the three brigades sent in initially. This plan was later modified. however, as General Slim decided to fly in 14 and 3 (West African) Brigades early in April. On the 5th February 16 Brigade marched in from Ledo as planned, via Singkaling Hkamti, after a long march during which it had a few minor engagements, and began operations in the Indaw area in March. 23 L.R.P. Brigade was sent into Burma, but was subsequently employed by the Army Commander in the Naga Hills and Manipur area in co-operation with 33 Corps."

            "description": "Bomber and Fighter Commands as to the primary object of these attacks became ap- parent. The principal aim of my Command was to shoot down enemy aircraft, while Bomber Command, naturally enough, attached more im- portance to the bombing. It was, however, the view of the Chief of the Air Staff that the bombing of objectives in France with the re- sources available for operation \u2018\u2018 Circus \u2019\u2019 could have no decisive military effect at this stage of the War, and that it would be a pity to spoil the chances of the fighters by making them conform to the requirements of a bomber force bent exclusively on inflicting material damage by bombing, and prepared to linger over the target area for that purpose. On his instruc- tions, the Air Officer- Commanding-in-Chief, Bomber Command, and myself, held a confer- ence at my Headquarters on r5th February,"

Besides these \u2018\u2018 Circus\u2019\u2019 operations, fighter sweeps, and \u2018\u2018 Rhubarb \u201d\u2019 patrols, a series of bombing attacks on shipping and what were called \u2018\u2018 fringe targets \u2019\u2019 by aircraft of Bomber and Coastal Commands, with fighter escort, were made between 5th February and rzth June, z941z. These operations differed\u2019 from \u2018\u2018 Circus \u2019\u2019 operations inasmuch as the primary object was not to force enemy fighters to give battle, but to damage or destroy the target. The fighter force therefore conformed to the requirements of the bomber force and did not seek battle unless attacked."

There were additional reasons for this change. After the Yalta Conference, the Chiefs of Staff had sent the Supreme Allied Commander a new directive. This was not only influenced by the speed and success of our advance in Burma, and the opening of the Ledo/Burma Road, but also by the general quickening of the tempo of the American operations against Japan in the Pacific and in the Philippines. The new directive ordered South-East Asia Command to defeat the Japanese Army in Burma and capture Rangoon; thereafter to open the Straits of Malacca and to capture Singapore. After the Chiefs of Staffs\u2019 promise to give us the necessary transport aircraft, on the 5th February I received a directive from the Supreme Allied Commander ordering me to \u201cseoure the Ledo/Burma Road, capture Rangoon by ist June, 1945, and destroy the main Japanese forces in Burma excluding the Tenasserim.\u201d In furtherance of the second half of his directive from the Chiefs of Staff, Ad- miral Mountbatten decided to capture the island of Phuket, as an air base and a station for the assembly of naval landing craft, with a target date in June 1945. This proposal was put up to the Chiefs of Staff on the 26th Febru- ary, and received their general approval on the 2nd March."

            "description": "200. It was also decided to carry out a com- bined naval and artillery bombardment of Tamandu while the Ru-Ywa operation was be- ing mounted. This had the double object of riveting the Japanese commander\u2019s attention . to this area (since it was known that the enemy there expected attack), and of destroying im- portant installations. This \u2018bombardment, which wags cafried out by the NARBADA, KISTNA, JUMNA and FLAMINGO, began on the 5th February and lasted for ten days and nights. The area was utterly wrecked and, later, when the Ru-Ywa landing was made, it became apparent that, as a deception measure, this operation had achieved its object."

            "description": "which was only beaten off after severe hand- to-hand fighting. On the 20th, while the enemy were still attempting to dislodge our troops, the first flight of 2 (West African) Brigade arrived from Kangaw. By the 25th, this Brigade was four miles east of Ru-Ywa, having passed through 53 Brigade, On the 25th February also, 74 Brigade started to land. In spite of most difficult conditions the supply of the troops ashore was maintained by naval landing craft, and the sloops, motor launches and sup- port craft continued to afford fire support to the Army, especially in the Dalet\u2014Tamandu area."

My purpose was partly to meet the Generalissimo who, I had been informed, was passing through Rangoon on his way to India. He went, however, straight from Lashio to Calcutta, and I did not see him. General Hutton had a very cordial and satisfactory interview with him."
