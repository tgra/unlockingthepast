            "description": "18. Shortly before this it had’ become apparent that it was essential to get troops forward from Basra to gain control of the situation at Baghdad and also to open up communications between Basra and Habbaniya. To effect this, and Battalion 4th Ghurkha Rifles were moved from Basra to Habbbaniya by air and a column was despatched from Shaiba towards Baghdad by the Euphrates route. This column, which consisted of 20th Indian Infantry Brigade Group, advanced from Shaiba on 27th May along the line of the railway, brushing aside slight opposition encountered near Ur. The advance from Fallujah was slow owing to extensive inundations, and the Brigade was unable to reach Samawa until roth June and Baghdad on 12th June. The Iraqis had done considerable damage to the railway track, removing hundreds of sleepers and destroying essential installations at the stations. Reconstruction was carried out rapidly, and the line was re-opened to traffic on oth June, -o",

            "description": "231. The bombing of the “‘ ski sites ’’ and other factors led to a postponement of this programme. The landings in Normandy on the 6th June, 1944, took the Germans tactically by surprise and found them still not ready to use the flying bomb. Thereupon LXV Army Korps, apparently on Hitler’s instructions, peremptorily ordered Flakregiment 155 (W) to begin operations on the 12th June. The precise grounds of this decision are never likely to be known. The opportunity to use the long-range weapons to delay the Allied assault had gone, if indeed it had ever existed. But the Germans may still have hoped to gain time by exploiting the harassing effect of the bomb and hampering the flow of reinforcements and supplies. Moreover, it is improbable that we, need look very far for the motive that prompted such a natural reaction to events. At moments of crisis the impulse to retaliate against an England which had upset all Hitler’s plans by perversely refusing its allotted role was never far below the surface. The Germans quickly publicised the flying bomb as ‘‘ revenge weapon No. 1 ’’: and their propaganda may well have contained a hint of their real purpose. With the ‘‘ west wall ’’ in jeopardy and defeat on the horizon, Hitler may have seen no more than the need to strike back and hope for a miracle.",

            "description": "My tactical plans for the pursuit north of Rome envisaged two main lines of advance: along the west coast for Fifth Army and up the axis of the Tiber, both east and west of the river, for Eighth Army. Fifth Army’s first objective was the port of Civitavecchia, which was now vital for our maintenance; Eighth Army was directed on the area of Terni and Rieti, the capture of which would disrupt any German plans for forming a continuous front across the peninsula and would threaten with envelopment the left wing of Tenth Amny. From the point of view of terrain the former task was rather the easier, for the country is of an open, rolling nature while the route up the Tiber, though not difficult by comparison with the country between Naples and Rome, offered many opportunities for delaying actions, especially on the east bank of the river. Enemy opposition was also much weaker on our left, for most of Kesselring’s divisions had withdrawn northward east of the Tiber and, having rashly destroyed all the bridges from Rome as far as Todi, sixty miles to the north, were having great difficulty in getting across to the west to come to the support of the weaker forces retreating up the west coast. VI Corps therefore set the pace, with 34 Division on the coast and the 36th inland, both supported by armour from 1 Armoured Division. At 1030 hours on 7th June elements of 34 Division entered Civitavecchia, The speedy capture of this port, the most important between Naples and Leghorn, was a considerable gain and, although the Germans had carried out extensive demolitions, particularly fine efforts by the port reconstruction companies made it usable earlier than had been expected. The first Landing Ship, Tank berthed on 12th June and Liberty ships began unloading in the roads on the 14th. .",
