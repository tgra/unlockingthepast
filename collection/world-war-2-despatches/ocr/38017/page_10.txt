outside of the entrance. She remained in sole
occupation of the harbour until shortly after
midnight 2gth/30th, when her Captain rightly
decided to take the ship out of harbour before
she also was sunk, thus freeing the berth and
safeguarding the channel from being blocked.

Little information of these disasters filtered
through to Dover, except that it was known
that Dunkirk was under heavy air bombard-
ment and that the destroyers there were being
hit soon after 1600.

32. At 1906 the Vice Admiral promulgated
the plan for the night by signal as follows:
‘* Evacuation of British troops to continue at
maximum speed during the night. If adequate
supply of personnel vessels cannot be main-
tained to Dunkirk East Pier, destroyers will
be sent there as well. All other craft except
hospital carriers to embark from beach which
is extended from one mile East of Dunkirk
to one mile East of La Panne. Whole length
is divided into three equal parts referred to
as La Panne, Bray, Malo, from East to West
with a mile gap between each part. La Panne
and Bray have troop concentration points each
end and in middle, Malo at each end. These
points should be tended by inshore craft. Pass
the message by V/S to ships not equipped W/T
as opportunity offers.’

32. About 1900 a telephone message was
received from La Panne Military Headquarters
through the War Office and the Admiralty to
the effect that Dunkirk Harbour was blocked
by damaged ships, and that all evacuation
must therefore be effected from the beaches.

About the same time a corrupt message from
S.N.O. Dunkirk, was recejved stating con-
tinuous bombing, one destroyer sinking, one
transport with troops on board damaged and
impossible at present to embark- more troops,
though pier undamaged.

33. In this confused situation the Vice
Admiral, Dover, at 2128, ordered all ships
approaching Dunkirk not to close the harbour,
but instead to remain off the Eastern beach to
collect troops from the shore, and the drifters
and minesweepers which were about to be
despatched to Dunkirk Harbour were also
diverted to the beaches.

Jt appeared, therefore, at this time that the
use of Dunkirk Harbour would be denied to
us except possibly to the small ships.

Signals addressed to S.N.O. Dunkirk,
HEBE, VERITY, who were known to be in
the vicinity of Dunkirk,, were sent requiring
information as to the accessibility of the
Eastern pier for personnel vessels. Admiral
Nord was also informed that Dover was out
of touch with Captain Tennant, and asked
whether it was still possible for transports to
enter the harbour and berth alongside.

No reply to these enquiries could be expected
until after midnight.

34. In the event only four trawlers and a
yacht entered Dunkirk during the hours of
darkness, and as enemy activity was much re-
duced only two bombing attacks being made,
it subsequently transpired that a good oppor-
tunity had been missed. It is probable that
ships to lift some 8,000 to 10,000 troops could
have been made available for Dunkirk during
the night at little loss to embarkation from the
beaches,

SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 17 JULY, 1947

35. Rear Admiral 'Wake-Walker proceeded
from Dover in ESK at about 900 for passage
to HEBE off the coast where he was to carry
out the duties of S.N.O. Dunkirk in charge
of all embarkation arrangements, taking over
from Captain Bush who had been working in
HEBE under the orders of $.N.O., Dunkirk.
He expected to arrive at Dunkirk at 2330.

36. As a result of the heavy casualties and
losses amongst the destroyer fofce, particularly
the misfortunes which befell those of the larger
and more modern types, a consultation was held
between the Admiralty and the Vice Admiral
which led to a decision to withdraw destroyers
of the “‘H’’, ‘1’ and ‘‘ J ’’ Classes from
‘Dynamo '’. All destroyers of the ‘ G ”’ Class
were already out of action.

There remained available for ‘“‘ Dynamo ’”’
15 destroyers : —

ESK, WORCESTER
EXPRESS WINDSOR
ANTHONY VERITY
KEITH VANQUISHER
CODRINGTON SABRE
MALCOLM SCIMITAR
WHITEHALL SHIKARI
WINCHELSEA

Excluding any casualties, this number of
destroyers might be expected to maintain a
flow of one destroyer per hour to the coast
and would lift 17,000 troops in 24 hours.

37. The day closed with a formidable list of
ships lost or damaged, a marked reduction in
the number of destroyers available and with
failure to achieve the high rate of evacuation
hoped for. Some 38,000 were landed in Eng-
land during the 24 hours, but the effect of the
day’s occurrences was to be more marked next
day when instead of some 50,000 to 60,000
which had been calculated as the probable
achievement only 48,000 odd were in fact trans-
ported. ‘
Thursday, 30th May.

38. As an example of the difficulty of any
one man appreciating the situation at Dunkirk
and the beaches during the night, at 0300/30
the S.N.O. on the French Coast reported that
he had no destroyers. In fact, at that time,
all available destroyers, namely 10, in the
Daver Command, were either on, or on passage
to or from, the coast, and the remaining five
were at Dover discharging troops, embarking
ammunition, fuelling, etc. and were to sail
within the next four hours.

Simultaneously the V.C.1.G.S. reported that
the beaches were well organised, the troops in
good heart, and there had been no bombing
since dark, but that there was still a great
shortage of small craft, urgently required. This
last fact was well known to the Vice Admiral,
Dover.

39. Commander-in-Chief,. Nore, was re-
quested to send as much towing hawser as
possible to Ramsgate, as quickly as possible,
for supplying the skoots, to haul boats off
the beaches, thus speeding up the boat work to
compensate for the shortage of boats, which
would continue for at least another 24 hours.

4o. At 0500 the seven modern destroyers
remaining with Vice Admiral, Dover—
ICARUS, IMPULSIVE, INTREPID, IVAN-
HOE, HARVESTER, HAVANT and
JAVELIN—sailed to Sheerness in accordance
with Admiralty instructions. The MONTROSE
and MACKAY sailed for repairs.
