SUPPLEMENT To tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 29 MAY, 1946

. 1g. On 23rd April General Carton de Wiart
sent a signal to the War Office that evacuation
from Namsos might be advisable, since the scale
of enemy air attack was heavy and he had
Teceived no further information about the pro-
posed landing of an Allied force at Trondheim.

In reply General Carton de Wiart was in-
structed by Headquarters North Western Ex-
peditionary Force to keep his force in being and .
to remain on the defensive in the Namsos area.

- 20.,For the first time on 25th April British
aircraft appeared over Namsos. These belonged
to the Fleet Air Arm, but three were forced to
land owing to lack of petrol. Their interven-
tion, though temporary, had a beneficial effect
on the air situation, but since their effect could
not be sustained, enemy air activity was again
unhampered during the next few days.

On account of the deep snow, which pre-
vented movement off the roads, it was not until
26th April that a reconnaissance party of the
R.A.F. started to search for landing grounds
in the Namsos area.

21. On the following day the advanced party
of General Carton de Wiart’s staff arrived.
Until now he had made use of the services
of Captains Fleming and Lindsay (of the Mili-
tary Intelligence Directorate) and of one General
Staff Officer who had reported for duty on 23rd
April at Namsos. .

In the same ship as the advanced party of
the staff there arrived a Royal Marine Howitzer
battery, a field ambulance, a dock labour com-
pany, representatives of the base sub-area
organisation, rifles and ammunition for the
Norwegians, and many other natures of stores,
but owing to the fact that the quay side was
already piled high with French stores and that
a French ship was still alongside the one usable
jetty unloading transport and equipment, only
the party of headquarter staff, a portion of the
howitzer battery (but no ammunition) and some
dock labour could be got ashore.

22. Such was the situation at Namsos when
on 28th April General Carton de Wiart received
the message that the evacuation of Namsos had
been decided on in principle.

At a meeting with Admiral Vivian (Flag
Officer commanding 20 Cruiser Squadron),
General Audet and Brigadier Phillips, he
decided to plan for evacuation on two succes-
sive nights. In the meantime it was possible
to send away one French battalion on the night
28th/zoth April in an empty ship.

It was decided that the French contingent
should re-embark before the British, but that
the French would leave some ski troops to
operate with the British rearguard. The prob-
able dates for evacuation were the nights of
ist/and and and/3rd May.

On the night 28th/2oth April a battery of
Bofors guns was landed at Namsos. These
guns were unfortunately without predictors.

23. On the following day General Carton de
Wiart received the message instructing him to
send a detachment to Mosjoen by sea and to
post a rearguard at Grong which would delay
the enemy for as long as possible and then with-
draw Northwards overland to Mosjoen.

At first he appears to have been in some
doubt as to whether the rearguard at Grong
was intended to comprise his whole force, and
he referred the matter to this Headquarters.
The reply made it clear that the strength of

2601

the rearguard to remain at Grong was left
entirely to his discretion. I have referred in
Part I to the abandonment of this operation.

On the 30th April, a party of 100 French
Chasseurs and a British detachment with two
Bofors guns was sent by destroyer to Mosjoen.
Throughout that day, enemy aircraft were again
active and sank H.M.S. ** Bittern’ and two
trawlers.

24. On 1st May all arrangements were made
to evacuate. the French contingent, and by
2115 hours all were ready on the quayside. But
no transports or destroyers arrived owing to
thick fog in the Namsen Fiord, and the evacua-
tion had to be postponed for 24 hours.

25. On 2nd May General Carton de Wiart
was asked to carry out the evacuation in one
night if possible, instead of two, as the
Admiralty were anxious to complete the task
with all speed.

After consultation with Admiral Vivian it
was agreed that all troops could be got away
on the night 2nd/3rd May but that no stores
or equipment could be saved.

26. By ox50 hours on 3rd May all troops
except a small rear party were re-embarked
and the convoy sailed from Namsos.

At 0220 hours the destroyer ‘‘ Afridi ’’ took
off the rear party.

At 0430 hours the usual German air recon-
naissance came over Namsvus anc sighted the
convoy which was now well out to sea.

Between o800 hours and 1530 hours wave
after wave of enemy bombers attacked H.M.
Ships and the transports. No transport ship
was hit, but the French destroyer ‘ Bison ”
and H.M.S. ‘‘ Afridi ’’ were sunk fighting to
the end. The losses might well bave been far
heavier, for there were no air forces supporting
the convoy.

COMMENTS.

27. In view of the instructions assued to him
and the size of the force which according to
those instructions was eventually to be placea
at his disposal, General Carton de Wiart’s
action in pushing straight ahead towards Trond-
heim was justified. Had he been aware of the
limited forces which were actually to be placed
at his disposal and of the fact that the direct
attack on Trondheim was not to take place.
his advance would undoubtedly have been a
more methodical one, and his position at
Steinkjer would have been consolidated before
a further advance would have been considered.
The position of the 146th Infantry Brigade,
with its head at Verdalen and its right flank
open to attack from the Fiord by sea-borne
troops, was, as events proved, a somewhat
dangerous one.

The withdrawal of this Brigade when
attacked was cleverly planned and executed
and reflects great credit on Brigadier Phillips
and the troops under his command.

28. I have already commented in Part I,
paragraph 8, on the decision not to dispatch a
force by road to delay the enemy in his advance
on Mosjoen after the final evacuation tock
place. The importance of this operation was
strongly stressed in several telegrams from these
headquarters, its feasibility could only be left
to the judgment of the man on the spot.
this case an error of judgment was made.
