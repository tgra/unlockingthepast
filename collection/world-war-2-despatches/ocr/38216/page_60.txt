Outlook in Malaya Towards War.

631. A word on this subject is necessary be-
cause it had its effect upon preparation for war
in the Far East.

Considerable criticism, much of it -unjust,
has been levelled against the civil population of
Malaya, although, unfortunately, there was jus-
tification for much of it. But it must be re-
membered that Malaya had been enjoined to
spare no effort to raise business output to a
maximum in support of the war in Europe,
particularly of rubber, tin and of dollars for
financing foreign exchange. It was thus natural
that many in Malaya should have felt that
Malaya’s best contribution to the war in general
Jay in this direction—and no one will deny that
the response they gave was a great contribu-
tion to the war in Europe.

Nevertheless their efforts in this direction had
its effect on Malaya’s preparations for her own
defence, because the calls of the latter could
only be met by diverting effort from the former.
It must have been most difficult at times for
those in responsible positions, in administrative
and business circles alike, to hold the correct
balance between these diametrically opposed
interests.

In short, the calls of the war in Europe had
its effect upon the civilian side of preparation
for war in Malaya as it had on the fighting
services.

632. Despite these difficulties much was done
on the civil side towards preparing for war.
Yet much remained to be done when war came.
Shortages of equipment and, still more impor-
tant, lack of: thorough training resulted in
voluntary organisations not being ready, some
more some less, when war broke out. Credit is
due to those who volunteered to play their
part and who, when war overtook them, played
it despite many a handicap. But it is unfor-
‘tunate to have to state that there were appreci-
able sections of the community, particularly
amongst its Asiatic element, which might have
been more interested and might have done
more towards putting Malaya’s defences on a
sound footing.

In this respect a belief was widely held that
Singapore defences were in reasonably good
order, and that war was not imminent in any
case. More than one official pronouncement
on the subject had the unintentional effect of
fostering a false sense of security and of sup-
porting the view that business output came
first, despite other official pronouncements
which were made with the express object of
combating complacency. Again that state-
ment is made in no critical spirit. The former
pronouncements were made for very good
reasons, But they must be mentioned because
of their effect on civilian and service personnel
alike. The general atmosphere inevitably
affected the latter, who had to live in it from
day to day. Only the more informed and
imaginative of both communities could be ex-
pected to foresee the future with accuracy and
to remain unaffected. Nevertheless there were
many, amongst the civil community as well as
in the services, who foresaw the danger and who
strove to accelerate readiness for war. To them
the greatest credit is due. But despite their
efforts the general atmosphere militated against
the progress of which they aimed and had a
grave effect upon preparations for war.

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

633. Two lessons were learned :—

Firstly, the. most drastic and comprehen-
sive measures are necessary to shake up a
community which has long lived in peace into
a realisation of the dangers of war and of
the need to take timely action to prepare
for it. This is particularly true if a com-
munity is of such a complex political and
economic structure as that which existed in
Malaya.

Secondly, the success of the fighting ser-
vices is largely dependent upon the whole-
hearted, thoroughly organised and, where
necessary, trained support of the civil com-
munity.

Unity or CoMMAND.

634. In the Far East the Higher Direction
of War, and of preparation for it, was not uni-
fied until the formation, in January, 1942,
more than a month after war had broken out,
of H.Q. Supreme’ Command, $.W. Pacific,
under General Sir Archibald Wavell,

635. Before this date many and complicated
channels of control had existed between Minis-
tries and the Chiefs of Staff in the United
Kingdom on the one hand, and, on the other,
the Civil Government and Service Commanders
in Malaya. They varied in degree. G.H.Q.
had operational but not administrative respon-
sibility for the army and the air forces; while
in the case of the navy its responsibility was
limited to co-operation with the naval C.-in-C.
in the Far East. ‘G.H.Q. had no administrative
staff, which handicapped its operational staff
in appreciating in full detail the true state of
affairs in the subordinate commands (para.
103). The situation was further involved by
additional channels of communication with the
Australian and Dutch Governments, and by
varying control of the forces which they con-
tributed to the defence of Malaya.

636. Such complicated machinery is unlikely
to work efficiently during times of emergency
when speed in preparing for war is paramount.
It has even less chance of success in war itself.

637. From this emerges the lesson that respon-
sibility for the defence of any region which is
exposed to attack is better centralised in a
Higher Command, both during the preparatory
period before war and during war itself. This
Higher Command should have full operational
and administrative authority over the three
fighting services, and also strong representation
in all matters affecting the civil population.

638. In short, control should be comprehen-
sive, and, in particular, administrative respon-
sibility should not be divorced from opera-
‘tional responsibility. The outcome of war
is likely to be in proportion to the observance
of this lesson. Unity of Command enhances the
prospect of success: lack of it invites failure.

POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE OUTBREAK
OF War. ,
Handicap imposed on Air, Striking Force.

639. At the outbreak df“war, political circwm-
stances, which made it imperative for us to
avoid any action that might precipitate war,
or that might make us appear to be the aggres-
sors, were partly responsible (but only partly
—see paras. 641° and 671) for preventing the
small air striking force that was available in
Malaya being used in the role for which it had
