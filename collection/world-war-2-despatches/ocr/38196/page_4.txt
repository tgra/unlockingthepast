of equipment; there is nothing. so, sure to cause
lack of confidence. The soldier who has been
forced to retreat through no fault of his own
loses confidence in the higher command and the
effect of a retreat is cumulative; because he
has withdrawn already from several positions
in succession he tends to look upon retreat as
an undesirable but natural outcome of a battle.
It was in any case fairly generally known that,
in the last resort, the Army would retreat
again, in accordance with the theory that it
must be kept in being. My first step in restoring
morale, therefore, was to lay down the firm
principle, to be made known to all ranks, that
no further withdrawal was contemplated and
that we would fight the coming battle on the
ground on which we stood. General
Montgomery, on his arrival, fully concurred
in this policy and expressed his confidence in
being able to fight a successful defensive battle
in our present positions.

At the moment the five divisions which I
have already enumerated were the only battle-
worthy formations available and with the ex-
ception of g Australian and 2 New Zealand
Divisions they had all been engaged since the
battle of Gazala opened at the end of May.
We were, however, potentially stronger now
than then and in a few weeks I should be able
to increase my strength to more than twice that
number of formations. I had in reserve four
divisions which had not as yet seen action:
8 and ro Armoured and 44 and 51 Infantry,
and two veteran divisions refitting, 1 Armoured
and 50 Infantry. These were in the meantime
disposed for the defence of the Delta together
with other non-divisional forces, including
strong elemients of the Sudan Defence Force.

When I took over, the plan for the defence
of the Delta had been to hold the western
edge of cultivation. Along this line the Rosetta
Branch of the Nile and the Nubariya Canal,
which takes off from it midway between Cairo
and Alexandria, form in combination a con-
tinuous tank obstacle extending from Cairo
almost to Lake Maryut, which covers Alexandria
on the south. The defence consisted of denying
the three principal crossings at Alexandria,
Khatatba and Cairo with infantry and employ-
ing armour in the gaps. The Cairo defences
were complete and held by the equivalent of
six infantry brigades, while another infantry
brigade guarded the open southern flank with
patrols operating from Bahariya Oasis to give
warning of enemy approach to the south of
the Qattara Depression. An extensive position
was being prepared round the Wadi Natrun
to deny the water sources there to the enemy
and to act as an advanced position covering
the Khatatba crossing. This position had been
intended for the infantry of Eighth Army in
the event of a withdrawal. 1 and ro Armoured
Divisions were lying at Khatatba itself, engaged
in re-equipping, together with 44 Infantry Divi-
sion, now almost ready for action. The inner
‘defences of Alexandria were complete but the
‘outer defences, consisting of extensive field
works, were still unfinished. The equivalent
of six infantry brigades were deployed in this
area. Two more infantry brigades were held in
Teserve. 5

The original intention, based mainly as I
have mentioned, on the necessity of preserving
our forces to meet a possible threat from the
north, had been to withdraw in the last resort

in two directions: eastwards into Palestine with ©
the greater part of the-forces and southwards
up the Nile valley with the remainder. Com-
mand had accordingly been divided betweer
ro Corps, which was responsible for Alexandria
and the Delta, and Headquarters, Britist.
Troops in Egypt, which was responsible for
Cairo and the Nile valley. Since I had now
been relieved of responsibility for the north-
eastern front and was in any case determined
to stand on the Alamein position I altered thir
arrangement on 2zoth August to the extent of
making Lieut.-General Stone, commanding
British Troops in Egypt, responsible for the
defence of the whole of the Delta, and made 10
Corps Headquarters available for Eighth Army.
I cancelled the construction of defences at the
Wadi Natrun but instructed General Stone to
continue working on the outer defences of
Alexandria’and improving communications be-
tween the Nile valley and the Red Sea; I also
gave instructions for certain areas round
Alexandria, on the banks of the Rosetta Branch
and north of Cairo to be flooded. Cairo,
Khatatba and Alexandria were to be defended
by 5x, 1 Armoured and 50 Divisions respec-
tively. These troops would serve to protect
vital installations against raids which might
penetrate the Alamein position, or against air-
borne attack, for which the enemy had avail-
able both German and Italian parachute forma-
tions. They could not have been employed in
a more active role at that time: 51 Division
had only recently disembarked and was mobiliz-
ing and carrying out preliminary desert training
and the other two, both of whom had already
served over six months in the desert, were
engaged in vitally urgent re-equipping. 50
Division had had very heavy losses both at
Gazala and Matruh.

I had therefore available, but not all im-
mediately available, four armoured and seven
intantry divisions, As against this the Axis
forces in Egypt amounted to four armoured
and eight infantry divisions, plus five indepen-
dent regiments or regiment-sized groups. Com-
mand was exercised nominally by Mussolini
who acted through an Italian Headquarters
known as Superlibia, an advanced detachment

‘of the Commando Supremo, under Marshal

Bastico. Actual command, however, was exer-
cised by Field-Marshal Rommel. His head-
quarters bore the name of ‘‘ German-Italian
Armoured Army of Africa,’’* and under it came
all German and [talian troops in the forward
area, organized under four Corps Headquarters,
the German Africa Corps and the Italian X,
XX and XXI Corps. The former consisted of
15 and 2r Panzer Divisions, veterans of the
later desert battles. The second of these
divisions had come to Africa first, under the
name of 5 Light Division, in February, 1941,
and 15 Panzer Division followed in the spring
of the same year. The reconnaissance
battalions of these two divisions were
usually brigaded together as a ‘‘ Recon-
naissance Group ’’ under Corps command. go
Light Division, of motorized infantry, which
attained’ its final form in Africa in January,
1942, was usually employed directly under
Army command. 164 Infantry Division had
been flown over from Crete at the end of
