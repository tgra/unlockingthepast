Though India was still far from secure, the danger to Egypt was obviously far more threatening; and on the 30th June I cabled to General Auchinleck offering any assistance that India could afford. He asked for an anti-tank regi- ment, which I sent, together with too carriers and other aid."

            "description": "and the Tyrrhenian Sea, and the shortest routes lead due north from Florence. In the eastern halt there are only the two roads which lead to Forli and Cesena and both these run north- east instead of due north. Lateral communica- tion is infinitely better on the northern side of the mountains than on the southern. On the latter movement from east to west is limited to a few poor roads across the mountains but on the Germans\u2019 side the Via Emilia, Route g, runs along the whole length of the position. It is a broad, straight road on the flat, with numerous short roads leading\u2019 off it into the mountains, for the crest line is nearer the southern than thea northern edge and the secondary road system on the latter is therefore much more developed. This is an enormous advantage to the defender, for in the defence of a line it is vital to be able to move forces rapidly from one sector to another where the threat is greatest. \u00b0 The original German plan for Italy, as Hitler told Mussolini at the Feltre conference in July, 1943, was to hold nothing south of the line of the Northern Apennines so that the preliminary reconnaissances for the \u2018\u2018 Gothic \u2019\u2019 line were probably carried out about that time. \u2018Work appears to have begun in September, 1943. The first work was done at the two ends, in the coastal plain south of La Spezia and behind the Foglia river on the Adriatic, and in the centre, where elaborate defences were constructed on the Futa Pass. Italian forced labour and a Slovak Technical Brigade were used; but as the winter of 1943 progressed most of the labour force was diverted to work on the \u2018\u2018 Gustav\u2019\u2019, \u2018 Hitler\u2019? and \u201c Caesar \u2019\u2019 lines, and it was not until the fall of Rome that priority was restored to the \u201c* Gothic \u2019\u2019 line and the work was pushed ahead at the highest pressure. It was principally to gain more time to allow for the \u2018\u2018 Gothic \u2019\u2019 line to ber completed that Kesselring fought the battles of Lake Trasimene and Arezzo. At one time it was expected that it would be ready by 30th June but in fact our attack on the Adriatic on 25th August found many of the defences on the Foglia still unfinished while in some of the more inaccessible mountain sectors they were only in the early stages of development. The total length of the line of defences was about two hundred miles. In the west the . approaches to La Spezia and the valley of the Magra were barred by a system of anti-tank defences in depth with two artificial obstacles seven miles apart; this was the only example of defence in depth in the system. From the tegion of Carrara the line swung south-east"

This represents the stage to which Allied strategic thought and planning had deen brought before the actual experience of the in- vasion of Sicily alleen modification in a more optimistic direction. @ possibility of such a future modification is fully realised in the open- ing paragraph: experience alone would show the value of the Italian forces, the extent.to which Germany was prepared to reinforce Italy and what Allied resources, particularly in landing craft, would still be available and when. In the circumstances appreciation of Allied capa- bilities could scarcely be over sanguine. Exploitation into Calabria was estimated as likely to be slow, since the first assaulting force was not expected to be within striking dis- tance of Cotrone, only eighty air miles: from the original landing point, by the end of the first month and a subsidiary landing was there- fore planned to seize that port thirty days after the original Janding. Even if these two operations should be successful the terrain and the weather were likely to offer severe difficul- ties to our advance, while the number of land- ing craft available would be so diminished as"
