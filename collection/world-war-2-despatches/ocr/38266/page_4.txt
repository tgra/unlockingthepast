from maintenance difficulties, withdrew to the
Maungdaw-Buthidaung line which he ‘had held
at the beginning of operations. This ended
active operations in Arakan except for small
patro] enterprises.

On May zoth I decided to replace Lieut.-
Genera] N. M. S. Irwin, Commander of the
Eastern Army who had been for some time
suffering from ill-health, by General Sir George
Giffard. ‘

15. The result of these Arakan operations
was undoubtedly disappointing. But they
must be viewed in their proper perspective.
They were represented in some quarters as an
“invasion of Burma ’’. Actually, as already
stated, they had one objective only, Akyab
island, and I should not have committed
troops deeply into the unhealthy Arakan
jungles had I had available the naval and air
torces, landing craft and transports for'a sea-
borne assault on the island.* When :i became,
obvious that these would not be forthcoming,
I took the risk, soonet than keep my troops
standing idle, of trymg to reach Akyab by an
overland advance. _ I was well aware of the
difficulties and dangers, and that the troops I
was employing were not fully trained or

. equipped; they had been organised and trained
up to the autumn for the defence of Bengal.

16. When these operations were initiated, I
had been mformed by General Stilwell that the
Chinese Armies in Yunnan would advance into
Upper Burma in force early in 1943, and I
had intended that the IV Corps from Assam
should advance in co-operation with them. I
had therefore reason to suppose that the
Japanese in Upper Burma would be fully
occupied and unlikely to move reinforcements
to Arakan. Actually, the Chinese made no
move; and the IV Corps, owing to administra-
tive difficulties, was unable to be as active as
I had hoped. The Japanese were therefore
able to reinforce Akyab and Arakan from
Upper Burma.

17. That Japanese defences, skilfully pre-
pared and concealed, and held to the last, are
difficult to overcome without considerable
superiority of numbers and equipment and
good training has been abundantly shown in
the fighting in New Guinea and elsewhere in
the S.-W. Pacific, and in the actions which
have taken place this spring on the Burma
frontier. We had never the necessary
superiority in these respects to assault positions
such as Donbaik and Rathedaung; and our
tachcs were not always appropriate, owing to
inexperience. The enemy counter-offensive
was skilfully planned and executed; and their
mobility and infiltration tactics in the jungle
are undoubtedly difficult to counter. It was
not possible to feed by air troops which had
been cut off from their base by these tactics,
owing to the lack of transport aeroplanes.

18. In the initial advance the troops of the
14th Division fought boldly and well It was
only in the latter stages of the fighting, after
several months continuous engagement in an
unhealthy climate and under the discourage-
ment of failure that there was any deterioration
in the endurance and fighting capacity of the
troops.

* The landings in North Africa and later in Sicily
(November, 1942—July, 1943) took higher priority and
there were insufficient resources for both operations

19. Strategically, we failed to reach Akyab
and finished in the same positions from which
we had started, but the capture of Akyab by
an overland expedition was always in the
nature of a gamble. We suffered some 2,500
battle casualties and probably inflicted at least
as heavy losses on the enemy. The greatest
gain from the campaign was experience, of
the enemy’s methods and of our own defects
in training and organisation. The serious loss
was in prestige and morale.

On balance I shall certainly never regret that
I ordered the campaign to take place in spite
of lack of resources. :

‘Support By R.I.N. anp R.AF.

20. Launches and coastal craft of the Roya!
Indian Navy played a considerable part in
these operations, both along the coast and in
the Naf and Mayu mvers, and showed much
enterprise in a number of small ‘actions, of
which the following are examples. On January
27th a launch on patrol in the Mayu river
rammed and sank a large launch full of enemy
troops, at least fifty of whom were killed. On
the night of February 21st-22nd Coastal craft
landed a raiding party at Myebon, about sixty
miles south-east of Akyab, which inflicted
casualties, destroyed stores, and re-embarked
without loss. On February 26th motor launches
oo patrol north of Ramree Island intercepted
two Japanese motor launches, sank one and
‘damaged the other, inflicting at least 50
casualties on the enemy.

21. The R.A.F. gave invaluable aid to the
Army during these operations, both by attacks
on enemy positions in close support and by
attacks on other targets in forward areas, such
as boats on the rivers or transport on the tracks
and roads. The action of the R.A.F. 1s

OPERATIONS IN NORTHERN RURMA.

22. My intention had been that during the
winter the IV Corps (17th and 23rd Indian
Divisions) should advance into Burma and
establish itself on the Chindwin river between
Kalewa and Sittaung. The only strategical
objective of these operations was to assist the
advance of the Chinese forces into Northern
Burma (see paragraph 2 above) by engaging
as many enemy troops as pgssible.

There were two possible routes leading
towards the objective from the Imphal plain
in Manipur over the high range into Burma.
The road from Imphal by Palel to Tamu (in
the Kabaw valley) had been constructed in
£942, from Palel to Tamu it was a single-way
mountain road liable to frequent interruption in
the rains; the distance from Imphal to Palel is
28 miles; and from Palel to Tamu 36 miles
The other possible route was from Imphal by
Bishenpur to Tiddim (145 miles), thence to
Fort White and down into the Kabaw valley
at Kalemyo; this route had certain obvious
advantages in the approach to Kalemyo. since
it was screened by hills to the east until close
io Kalemyo, whereas an advance to Kalemyo
from Tamu was exposed throughout to
enemy attacks from across the Chindwin.
General'Irwin favoured the development of the
Tiddim route and placed most of our limited
yoad-making resources on it. A visit to the
front early in February convinced me that our
