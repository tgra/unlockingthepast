I now had to decide whether to try to hold
Tobruk or not. I had made it quite clear to
all concerned that, in the event of the enemy
returning to the offensive in Cyrenaica after his
defeat in December, 1941, I had no intention
of allowing forces under my command to be
again besieged in Tobruk.* This continued to
be my policy throughout the subsequent fight-
ing. But, unless Tobruk was fully stocked
and equipped as an advanced base of supply,
it was not possible for us to consider seizing
the initiative from the enemy and resuming our
offensive against Tripolitania, which always
remained my object. It was to protect Tobruk,
therefore, that I had ordered General Ritchie to
stand fast on the Gazala—Bir Hacheim posi-
tion. The railway had been extended to Bel-
hamed and much effort had been expended in
equipping Tobruk as an advanced base, and
our preparations for the offensive were practi-
cally complete.

When the enemy, by building up his tank
strength more quickly than we could, was able
to anticipate our intended offensive, I hoped
that, having defeated his armoured forces, we
might still be able to make an offensive on the
lines we had been planning since the enemy
was first checked at Gazala in February. The
initial course of the battle, which began on the
27th May, gave me no cause to give up hope of
turning to the attack when the enemy’s strength
should have been spent.

The destruction of an infantry brigade group
on the rst June and of two infantry brigades
and four regiments of artillery four days later,
the withdrawal from Bir Hacheim, and,
finally, the heavy losses of tanks we incurred
on the 13th June undoubtedly reduced con-
siderably our chances of making an early change
to the offensive. But there was no reason to

, Suppose that, for all the vigour he was display-
ing, the enemy had not also suffered heavily.
When we had reduced our commitments by
evacuating Gazala, it seemed to me we should
have sufficient forces to man Tobruk-and the
principal tactical localities to the south and

south-east of it as well as the frontier positions, ,

all of which had been prepared for defence.
By preventing the enemy from establishing him-
self to the east of Tobruk, which it still seemed
possible to do, we should not only deny him
landing grounds further to the east than those
he had been using, but also gain time to build
up a force with which to strike back. A small
armoured force was still in being to assist in the
task, besides numerous armoured cars and two
motor brigades; workshops were turning out re-
paired tanks at a satisfactory pace, and the New
Zealand Division, which I had ordered down
from Syria, was due shortly. The losses we
had sustained, considerable though they might
have been, did not appear so serious as to
make it imperative to abandon the fruits of the
previous success, and thus leave Malta to sur-
render and Egypt to be invaded.

Consequently, when I agreed to General
Ritchie’s withdrawal of the two divisions from
Gazala, I ordered him to stop the enemy on a
line through Acroma, El Adem, and then south-
wards, and not t8!allow Tobruk to be invested.
General Ritchie believed he could fight on the

western and southern faces of the Tobruk peri-
meter, E] Adem and to the south. But he
did not think it essential to hold Acroma, and
considered that our defence south of Tobruk
must be ensured by a mobile force with a maxi-
mum quota of artillery, since isolated -strong-
points would be liable to be overwhelmed in
detail owing to the weakness of our armoured
forces. It might take time to organise the
artillery of the rst South African and 5oth Divi-
sions for employment in a mobile role, and in
the interval General Ritchie visualised a situa-
tion arising in which Tobruk might become
temporarily invested. On the 16th June I told
him that, although I was determined Tobruk
must not be besieged, I accepted the possibility
of its becoming temporarily isolated, and left
him full liberty to make his dispositions
accordingly.
“I was glad to have the assurance of the Prime
Minister that the instructions I had given to
General Ritchie were approved in London. The
position seemed to me to be quite different to
that which had obtained in 1941, as we now held
fortified positions on the frontier, and it did not
seem as if the enemy had enough forces both
to invest Tobruk and at the same time
neutralise our troops to the east of it. I was
therefore able to tell the Prime Minister that I
hoped to be able to prevent the control of the
country between Tobruk and the frontier pass-
ing into enemy hands.

In deciding to hold Tobruk, I had not
visualised that the Eighth Army would be un-
able to interfere with the enemy’s operations

- against the fortress, or that the garrison-would

be required to hold more than the western and

southern faces of the perimeter against a serious

attack, which its strength and composition

should have enabled it to do, always provided

fet mobile forces were operating on its southern
nk.

The Eighth Army had at that time three
infantry divisions and an infantry brigade group
comparatively fresh, two more of its divisions
still had considerable fighting value, and the
New Zealand Division was on its way from
Syria. The armoured divisions, however, had -
lost heavily and could only muster about a
hundred tanks in all; but more tanks were on
the way, and there were many under repair in
the Eighth Army’s field workshops. Two of the
motor brigade groups were fighting vigorously
and the reorganisation of the third was almost
complete.

General Ritchie put four infantry brigade
groups into Tobruk with their proper comple-
ment of artillery and some infantry tanks, and
kept the rest of the Eighth Army as a mobile
force outside it. Major-General Klopper, the
commander of the 2nd South African Division,
was put in command of the fortress.

The enemy now concentrated his efforts
against El] Adem, Sidi Rezegh and Belhamed
and this area became just as important tactically
as it had been in the previous winter. I in-
structed General Ritchie to strengthen it without
delay, but he was unable to do so; and on the
r7th June the enemy took Sidi Rezegh, thus
beginning the encirclement of Tobruk. The
same afternoon our remaining armoured brigade
suffered a severe reverse in an encounter with
a powerful enemy tank forcé and was forced
to retire on Gambut, having lost all but twenty
of its tanks. This entailed the withdratval of
