Two regiments of the and Armoured Brigade were ordered to clear this area on their way northwards to cover Msus. Each regiment became engaged in a separate action with bodies of enemy tanks about fifty strong and each with its attached artillery suffered heavily. The third regiment reached its appointed position north, of Antelat without incident, but when the whole brigade was finally assembled it numbered only eighty tanks altogether. \u2018By the evening the enemy were in. occupation of Antelat and Saunnu."

At ogoo hours the same day General Montgomery received the formal surrender of the Italian authorities outside the city. The last of the enemy\u2019s armed forces had left some hours before but the entire civilian population remained, in contrast with Benghazi which had been evacuated by the Italians. Eighth Army\u2019s entry was accepted peacefully; the Italian municipal and police officials re- mained at their posts and the British Military Administration assumed the government of the city and province in an atmosphere of calm. A curfew was imposed on military and civilians, Private and civic buildings and establishments were little damaged. The public services were still functioning, but the food supply was re- stricted. This was remedied as occasion per- mitted and British soldiers were forbidden to buy \u2018Civilian food; none of them, except those whose duties made it essential, were quartered in the town. Many of the military establishments and installations had been wrecked and the damage to the port was particularly widespread. Quays and wharves were cratered, the mole breached,"

But French Tesistance was overwhelmed; the enemy reached Robaa and Ousseltia on the zoth and the equivalent of seven battalions of infantry were cut off in the mountains; also many field guns together with nearly all their few anti-tank guns were lost. I went to see General Juin and found him personally courageous, but tired and not hopeful. I had in the meantime ordered 5 Corps to send 36 Infantry Brigade Group to the Robaa Valley and requested 2 United States Corps to send a Combat Command of United States 1 Armoured Division to the Ousseltia area\u2014both to come under General Juin\u2019s orders on arrival.

It is thought that plans were in hand to strengthen the defences, as General Sir John Laverack, Commanding 1st Australian Corps, visited Palembang about 25th January and indicated that an Australian division might be expected invthe near future. Presumably, owing to the general situation in the Far East, the move was cancelled. ;"
