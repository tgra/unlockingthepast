OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 5 JULY 194131 OCTOBER 1041.

The following despatch was submitted to the
Secretary of State for War on the 8th March
1942 by GENERAL SIR CLAUDE J. E.
AUCHINLECK, C.B., CSI, D.S.0.,
O.B.E., A:D.C., Commander-in-Chief the
Middle East Forces. .

1. On taking over command of the Middle
East Forces on the 5th July 1941 I found the
general position incomparably better than it had
been a year earlier on the collapse of France.
This improvement was entirely due to the
energy of my opredecessor, General Sir
Archibald Wavell, and to his vigour in seeking
out the enemy wherever he was to be found.

. The defeat and capture of the Italian anmies
in East Africa had eliminated one serious
threat to our bases and communications, and
the winter offensive in Cyrenaica had resulted
in the destruction of another Jarge Italian Army.
Although the fresh forces brought up by the
enemy had succeeded in recapturing most of
Cyrenaica, they were unable to proceed much
further without first reducing Tobruk. More-
over our operation in June, though unsuccess-
ful, had robbed their armoured forces of much
of their offensive power. In the East, the
overthrow of the rebel government had cleared
the atmosphere in Iraq, while the operations
in Syria, though as yet unfinished, would deny
potential air and land bases in that country
to the Axis.

Only in the North had recent events made
our position more difficult. The enemy occupa-
tion of Greece and Crete increased the threat
of aerial attacks on our bases and lines of
communication, and, even more important,
seriously restricted the movements of the Fleet
in the Central Mediterranean. The enemy’s
hold on Cyrenaica greatly increased this restric-
tion, The running of convoys with supplies
and reinforcements to Malta from Egypt thus
became more difficult. The German attack on
Russia, however, had! come at a very oppor-

tune moment for ourselves as it prevented the
enemy from exploiting to the full his success
in the Balkans and the Aegean.

Although there was thus no immediate threat
to our base, there was every reason to believe
that in time such a threat would materialise
on either flank, and I found preparations to
meet this well in hand:

z. General Wavell’s campaigns in Libya,
Eritrea, Abyssinia, Greece,’ Crete, Iraq and
Syria had followed each other with such be-

‘wildering rapidity and had been undertaken

with such inadequate forces and equipment that
a considerable degree of disorganisation in the
Army as a whole was inevitable. Brigades had
perforce become separated from their divisions
and units from their brigades, while some
formations, especially those of the armoured
forces, had practically ceased to exist. This
entailed a comprehensive programme of re-
organisation, improvization, re-equipment and
training, which I found in progress on taking
over.

In no sense do I wish to infer that I found
an unsatisfactory situation on my arrival—
far from it. Not only was I greatly impressed
by the solid foundations laid by my predeces-
sor, but I was also able the better to appreciats
the vastness of the problems with which he had
been confronted and the greatness of his
achievements, in a command in which some
40 different languages are spoken by the British
and Allied Forces.

3. 1 soon found that the work of the opera-
tions, planning and intelligence branches of the
General Staff was good and thorough, and that
a sound system existed for the administration of
personnel, supplies. ordnance and medical
arrangements.

Liaison between the Navy, Army and Air
Force was excellent and it may here be of
interest to give some details of interservice
co-operation. :
