            "description": "At 2347, much tracer was seen coming from Ist, in what appeared to be a land battle, but the L.R.D.G. representatives on board H.M. M.T.B.634 considered that a low flying air attack was being made on the harbour. I myself thought this unlikely, and was of the opinion that an E-boat was firing irresponsibly for some obscure reason known only to the enemy. (I had seen this happen before, in the same place, on the night of 26th June, this year.) The firing then ceased, but ten minutes later broke out further south, near Mulat. This time there were some flares (or starshell) being used, and some large flashes were seen on the land, and the air\u00e9raft theory seemed possible: however, some 88-m.m. tracer was identified from the eastern side of Mulat and it was obvious that there was something taking place."

Preparatory work in the detailed planning of this combined operation was started immediately. Major-General R. G. Sturges, C.B., A.D.C. and Brigadier F, W. Festing, D.S.O., were brought over from Madagascar to assist in this."

            "description": "62. These rules for engagement, which I. ordered to be codified and issued to those con- cerned on the 26th June, were intended to pre- vent mutual interference between guns and fighters. For reasons which J shall explain later, they did not altogether achieve this aim. But before coming to this question it will be appropriate to review the progress of the Ger- man attacks and of our counter-measures up to the date in the middle of July when the question of an important change in our defence plan came to a head."

Brigade (Special Force), assisted by a Chinese regiment, captured Mogaung om the 26th June, the enemy losing severely in men and material, which included some medium artillery, This was a particularly fine action by 77 L.R.P. Brigade against most stub- born resistance by units of 53 Japanese Divi- sion. The capture of Mogaung was important, as it opened the way for further operations southward."

It-consisted of 35 ships and.was escorted by five ad bole three corvettes, one anti-aircraft ship, minesweepers, two trawlers and, as far as the Bear id area, one submarine. It was sighted by enemy aircraft on 30th June and . 2nd July ; but once more the enemy\u2019s policy was to concentrate on the eastbound laden \u2018convoy, and. Q.P.13 was not attacked."

The strong mountain positions north of Perugia, extending almost to the east shore of the lake, were unsuitable for operations by 6 British Armoured Division; the Germans rapidly appreciated \u2018this and were able to with- draw 15 Panzer Grenadier Division to the west side of the lake to oppose 13 Corps. They also pulled out 94 Infantry Division and sent it back to North Italy to reform completely with fresh drafts, On 26th June 10 Corps regrouped; 10 Indian Division arrived and 6 Armoured was sent across to reinforce 13 Corps. The same day 8 Indian Division scored a gratifying suc- cess \u2018by the capture of Monte Pilonica, east of the Tiber. Between the river and the lake the Germans now began, on 27th June, to fall back"

            "description": "The battles for the Trasimene line may be considered as having lasted from aoth to 30th June. They were most severe in the centre where the Germans opposed xo and 13 Corps; on the west coast, although the \u2018American advance was considerably slowed down, as compared with the first two weeks after the fall of Rome, the Germans were unable to pre- vent a steady gain of ground. IV Corps on the left, with 36 and xr Armoured Divisions leading, captured Follonica on 24th June and Piombino on the 25th. Then stiffer resist- ance was met, particularly inland where 1 Armoured Division, opposed by a skilful enemy and difficult country, lost seventy-one tanks in the course of these ten days. The stiffest resistance was at Cecina, at the mouth of the river of the same name; the battle for the town lasted from 2gth June to 1st July and cost 34 Division, which had relieved the 36th, fairly heavy casualties. 16 S.S. Division had been brought in here to strengthen the German defence and fought with skill and fanaticism. The French, directed on Siena, were held up from the 22nd to the 26th June on the River Orcia and were able only to make an advance of some two miles. On the night of the 27th, however, the Germans began to withdraw and only delaying actions were fought south of Siena, which was entered on 3rd July. By the 7th, with the capture of Colle di Val d\u2019Elsa, the whole of Route 68, from its junction with Route 2 to the sea, had been secured."
