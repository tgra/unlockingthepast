368 SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE; 15 JANUARY, 1048

The enemy tanks continued to advance, des-
troying our field artillery in their defensive
positions gun by gun. At about two o’clock
King’s Cross was taken, and the enemy over-
ran the rearmost artillery position in the
eastern sector. At the same time the head-
quarters of the 11th Indian Infantry Brigade
ceased to function. The German thrust then
divided. One portion continued along the top
of the escarpment, causing the Coldstream
Guards a number of casualties and overrunning
the Sherwood Foresters and, with them, the
headquarters of the 2o1st Guards Brigade. The
other column of German tanks proceeded down
the road to the town. The harbour came under
fire at five o’clock in the afternoon and by six
o’clock was cut off from the rest of the fortress.

About noon this day General Ritchie ordered
the 30th Corps to use the 7th Armoured
Division to advance on Tobruk. The Division
reached an area some 20 miles south of the
perimeter just before dark. About an hour
later General Klopper reported by wireless
to General Ritchie’s B.G.S. telling him what
had befallen and asking to be allowed to fight
his way out. He was authorised to do so and
was told that an endeavour would be made to
hold open a gap between El Adem and Knights-
bridge. About an hour later General Klopper
again communicated with the Eighth Army to
say that as the greater part of his transport had
been cut off in the harbour area, it was im-
possible to get it to the troops on the peri-
meter, who had practically no vehicles.

During the night, the headquarters of the
Army were intermittently in touch with General
Klopper, and early on the 21st June learned
from him that all water and petrol had been
destroyed. He also informed the Eighth Army
that the whole of his transport had been cap-
tured and on that account he had been unable
to break out. An order was circulated to all
units in the garrison that a capitulation had
taken place and that all vehicles, equipment
and arms were to be destroyed.

Certain detachments, which were in posses-
sion ‘of transport, then elected to break out
and some succeeded in rejoining the Eighth
Army. Other British, Indian, and South
African units continued to fight on throughout
the 2zst and there is evidence that more than
one unit was still fighting on the 22nd June.

The Retreat from Cyrenaica.

When he knew that Tobruk was about to
fall, General Ritchie telegraphed to enquire
whether he should continue to try to hold
the frontier positions or withdraw to Matruh.
He had been relying on Tobruk to contain part
of the enemy’s armour and to impose at least
some delay on his advance; not only would the
enemy now be free to employ all his forces
in the advance, but the stocks and transport
he thad captured would greatly simplify his
supply problem. The defence of the frontier
depended entirely on the backing of an ade-
quate armoured force, which was no longer
available; and General Ritchie wished to retire
to Matruh, in order to gain time to recruit his
armoured strength.

There were serious strategical disadvantages
in abandoning the frontier and I did so with the
greatest reluctance. The argument that an
armoured reserve was essential to the successful
defence of the frontier positions, applied with
equal force to the Matruh position, which,

owing to the configuration of the coast, could
easily be isolated by a movement past its south-
ern flank. The matter, however, was one
of general policy which could only be decided
in consultation with the other two Commanders-
in-Chief. In the meanwhile, since General
Ritchie alone was in a position to know whether
the immediate situation made it imperative to
withdraw, I was obliged to leave him to take
the decision. But I warned him that I did not
consider Matruh to be more easily defensible.

In order to gain time to build up an armoured
force, which he believed could be done very
rapidly, General Ritchie decided to fall back on
Matruh. His decision was subsequently en-
dorsed by the Middle East Defence Committee,
and he was instructed to prepare to fight a
decisive action round Matruh and to delay the
enemy as far west as possible with a covering
force. General Ritchie told the 13th Corps to
delay the enemy, and sent ‘back the head-
quarters of the 30th Corps to organise the
Matruh position for defence, until Lieutenant-
General W. G. Holmes and the roth Corps
Headquarters should arrive from Syria, The
headquarters of the 30th Corps were then to
go back and control the completion and occu-
pation of the E] Alamein position a hundred and
twenty miles further east.

The 13th Corps was organised into two ele-
ments: a striking force and a holding force.
The former was to operate under the head-
quarters of the 7h Armoured Division, the com-
mand of which Major-General J. M. L. Renton
had taken over from Major-General Messervy.
It comprised the 4th and 22nd Armoured
Brigade Groups, with seventy and twenty-two
tanks respectively; the 7th Motor Brigade
Group, of four battalions; and the 3rd Indian
Motor Brigade Group, which had been re-
organised, but was below strength. The’ hold.
ing force consisted of the 50th Division, the roth
Indian Division and the 1st South African
Division.

There were few troops immediately available
to occupy Matruh. The troops allotted to its
defence in the first place were the New
Zealand Division, which was just arriving from
Syria; the 5th Indian Division with one brigade
group only; and the r51st Infantry Brigade of
the 50th Division when it should be released by
the 13th Corps. .

The enemy spent the two days following the
capture of Tobruk in reorganising for a further
advance. But he lost little time, and, whereas
on the 22nd June only light forces appeared on
the northern flank of the frontier positions and
occupied Bardia, on the 23rd his divisions were
manifestly gathering for a thrust round the
south of Sidi Omar. The 7th Armoured
Division, however, succeeded in preventing all
but a very few from passing the fréntier wire
up to the evening of the 23rd June. ~

General Ritchie had authorised the retirement
to begin the previous night. The roth Indian
Division and the 151st Infantry Brigade began
to thin out from Sollum on the 22nd June, and
the same evening the 2nd South African Brigade
also began to retire from the eastern end of the
escarpment. On the 23rd June, fearing that
they might be cut off, General Ritchie gave
General Gott permission to withdraw the re-
mainder of the roth Indian Division from
Sollum and the 3rd South African Brigade from
the western end of the escarpment. As there
was then no longer any danger of the ‘holding
