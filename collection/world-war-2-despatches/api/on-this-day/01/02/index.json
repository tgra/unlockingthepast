On 2nd January, 1944, however, the landing-craft for this operation were diverted to the Anzio landing in Italy, and HERCULES was cancelled; nevertheless, in the-hope that Plan 437 would ensure Turkish co-operation, planning was continued and all the possibilities of such an operation were investigated.",

For this ro Corps was being reinforced by 5 British Infantry Division. This was the second division I had taken from Eighth Army, for 1 Division had been originally intended for it, and I was shorily afterwards to take three more. The Adriatic sector was now of secondary importance to the western sector. The intention was to launch successive attacks by the three Corps on the main front: the French Expeditionary Corps on 12th January against the high ground north of Cassino, II Corps on the 15th to capture Monte Porchia and Monte Trocchio and reach the Rapido river and 10 Corps on the 17th to cross the lower Garigliano in the Minturno area and attack northwards up the Ausente river valley towards San Giorgio a Liri.

In November, the only R.A-F. transport squadron operating was No. 31, an experienced and pioneer unit, but the Ist and 2nd Troop Carrier Squadrons U.S.A.A.F. had begun to work over the northern sector of the front and there were other squadrons both British and American, either in training or on their way. Unified operational control of these forces was effected by the institution in December of Troop Carrier Command, Eastern Air Command, under Brigadier General W. D. Old, U.S.A.A.F., administrative control remaining in the usual British or American channels.. Headquarters was _ established at Comilla on 2nd January, 1944, in close proximity to the Headquarters of Fourteenth Army and of the Third Tactical Air Force, as well as to main Army supply bases. Subsequent operations illustrated the dependence of air transport operations upon the tactical air situation, and in order to combine final responsibility for the former with the exercise of our air superiority as well as to integrate air transport with army policy Troop Carrier Command was placed under the .control of the Air Commander, Third Tactical Air Force, from Ist May. Subsequently Troop Carrier Command was dissolved as from 4th June, by when its component squadrons numbered 8 4 R.A. and 4 U.S.A.A.F. Moreover, in February the Air Transport Command had loaned to'me twenty-two Commandos (C.46) to meet the emergency in the Arakan, and when it became necessary to return these in April, five US.A.A-F. Troop Carrier squadrons and the larger part of 216 Squadron R.A.F, were detached to work with my Command from M.A.A.F. Upon their return to the Mediterranean theatre in June, aircraft and crews from the Strategic Air Force were attached to the Third Tactical Air Force to fill the gap until the first of the U.S.A.A.F. Combat Cargo Groups became operational. During its short but eventful life of little over six months, Troop Carrier Command had thus increased more than four-fold in size, and even more in significance.",

The leading Brigade. the 6th, passed through 11 (East African) Division on the 21st and advanced rapidly along the road from Kalewa towards Pyingaing. West of Pyingaing the advance was checked by a strong rearguard position. With the assistance of 32 Brigade of 20 Indian Division as stated above, the enemy was cleared, and Pyingaing was captured on the 24th. Determined resistance was again encountered in the Wainggyo Gorge, nine miles south-west of Pyingaing, but was overcome with tank support. The advance of 2 British Division continued with great speed. Dominating features astride the road 12 miles east of Pyingaing were cleared, and a large enemy detachment was successfully ambushed on the 28th December. On the 31st, the Kabo Weir, 11 miles north of Ye-U was captured intact. This was an important economic gain, since the Kabo Weir controls the irrigation of an extensive area of rice-growing country. It was a propitious entry into the Shwebo plain  the enemy's demolition party, sent to blow up the weir, arrived to find us in occupation. On the 2nd January, 5 Brigade had established itself at Ye-U and the Division was driving the enemy back on to Shwebo, the northern outskirts of which were reached by the 8th January. 64 Brigade of 19 indian Division had already reached the eastern outskirts on the 7th, having come via Kanbalu. Shwebo town was finally occupied on the 10th January, after the Japanese rearguard had fought to the last. man. 6 Brigade of 2 British Division was then concentrated at Shwebo after relief by 268 Indian Brigade in the Kabo Weir area.
