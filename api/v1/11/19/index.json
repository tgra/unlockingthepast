            "description": "The enemy lost no time in pressing their advantage, striking two crippling blows in swift succession. A surprise night attack chanced on the headquarters of the 4th Armoured Brigade, and most of its wireless links were captured. For the next twenty-four hours that brigade, which, with its hundred tanks, was the only substan- tial armoured force we had left, ceased to be a fighting entity. The Germans, on the other hand, still had a number of tanks in running order anil could recover others from the battle- field. Moreover, the Ariete Division had not been seriously engaged since the 19th November and must have had about eighty tanks, To these the zand Armoured Brigade could oppose about forty-five and the 7th Armoured Brigade only ten. Consequently, when the enemy attacked the 5th South African Infantry Brigade with over'a hundred tanks and a large force of lorried infantry in the afternoon of the 23rd, the 22nd Armoured Brigade was hopelessly outnumbered. The South Africans resisted gallantly, but the German attack was by all accounts well con- ceived and brilliantly executed; and the 5th South African Infantry Brigade was practically destroyed."

            "description": "231. During the evening of 19th November, a caique fleet left Turkey and the evacuation was carried out, although the rendezvous on the Turkish coast had to be changed owing to the unwillingness of the caique captains to face the Samos channel, where German \u2018\u2018 E \u201d\u2019 boats were thought to be operating. The fleet arrived at Kusadasi early on 20th November, bringing with it Brigadier Baird and his staff, Colonel Tzigantes, commander of the Greek Sacred Squadron, General Soldarelli, the Italian Com- mander, the Metropolitan Archbishop and all British and Greek forces, with a hundred Italian civilians. The British Attach\u00e9 at Ankara gained the consent of the Turkish Government for the evacuees to pass through Turkey in the guise of civilians."

            "description": "78 Division reached the right bank of the river from the mouth to as far south as Paglieta on 8th November and immediately began to organise patrols across it to dominate the plain on the left bank. 8 Indian Division, the left hand formation of 5 Corps, was longer in form- ing up to the line and the enemy did not with- draw completely across the river in their sector until 19th November. At that time the coastal sector was held by the recently arrived 65 In- fantry Division, a relatively inexperienced formation, with 16 Panzer Division supporting it in reserve. To the south 1 Parachute Divi- sion held a front of some twenty-five miles in the mountains. Before the main Eighth Army attack began 16 Panzer Division was withdrawn to proceed to the Eastern front; after the attack went in 26 Panzer Division had to be hurriedly brought back from the Mignano sector, where"
