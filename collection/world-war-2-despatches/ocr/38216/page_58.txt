R.A.AF., and from other individual officers
and. airmen, with almost complete lack of
success, in spite of protracted brutal treatment
in many cases. They then gave up all attempts
to obtain it. More than once, their Intelligence
Officers afterwards stated that the British had
proved obstinate and stupid about. the matter
and had suffered accordingly. Credit is due to
the above named individuals, who were the first
to set an example of compliance with orders
to observe complete reticence in spite of brutal
treatment, as it is due to those who subsequently
followed their lead.

609. The later treatment of P.O.W.’s, with
little regard to the terms of the Geneva Con-
vention of 1929 which had been accorded to
them on surrendering, is too wéll known to need
further elaboration in this report.

Breakdown of Signals Communication with Air
Ministry.

610. The original site chosen on 7th March
(p.m.) for the Signals Station near Tyikadjang
proved unsuitable for communication with out-
side countries, screened as it was by the
surrounding mountains. It was, therefore,
moved about noon 8th March towards the coast,
in an attempt to find a suitable position.

6rr. A technical breakdown, caused by
contamination of the Diesel fuel of the T. 1087
high power transmitter, followed by a road
accident which damaged the transmitter itself,
prevented this set being used again.

612. Attempts were made that evening to
come into action with another, a low power,
set were at first forbidden by the Commander
of the Dutch troops into whose area the station
had by now moved, and who by this time, was
strictly obeying the terms of surrender. These
orders forbade further communication with the
outside world. Despite them a T. 1082/R.
1083 Vanette set was brought into action but
it failed to establish communication with
Melbourne, Ambala or Air Ministry. Several
signals were broadcast by this means for three
hours on the morning of gth March in the hope
that they would be picked up. Amongst them
was the signal which informed the Air Ministry
that the orders to surrender were being complied
with (para. 596). "

It subsequently transpired that these signals
were not picked up although at the time the
operator believed that they had been.

613. Subsequent attempts by the Signal
Station to contact H.Q. and reciprocal attempts
by H.Q. to find the new position of, the station,
failed to establish touch before the staff of this
station had to destroy their equipment
because : — :

(a) It was believed. that the last signals
for despatch had been sent:

(6) Current reports of the imminent arrival
of Japanese troops (subsequently proved to
be false) made it necessary to destroy com-
promising documents and the set itself, to
avoid capture in accordance with strict instruc-
tions which the A O.C. had issued a few days
previously on the subject of preventing the
capture of cyphers and secret equipment.
These were the circumstances in which the

report of the'final surrender of the British troops
in Java was not received by their respective
Governments. Sos

SUPPLEMENT 1o tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948.

REFLECTIONS ON THE FAR EAST CAM-
PAIGN, DECEMBER, 1941, TO MARCH,
1942.

SCOPE OF REPorT.

614. This paper reports on only one aspect
of the compaign of 1941/42 in the Far East—
the air aspect. Weaknesses are admitted where
they are believed to have existed.

The air aspect was, however, only one of
several. An account which discloses its weak-
nesses, but not those of the other aspects, is
liable to leave an impression that the air was
primarily responsible for the downfall of
Malaya. This was not the case.

615. In order to counteract this tendency it
is necessary, therefore, to refer to weaknesses
elsewhere which played their part. This is
done hereunder in no carping spirit, but in
recognition of their causes and of the efforts
made by those who endeavoured to overcome
them. It is done for one reason only—to
counterbalance a one-sided examination and to
throw the whole into perspective. Weaknesses
lay in many places. Failure in Malaya was
a combined failure brought about firstly by
the unpreparedness of the Empire as a whole
for war, and then, when war came, by the
needs of far more vital theatres of war on the
other side of the world and in the seas which
served them.

WEAKNESSES IN THE FIGHTING SERVICES.

616. In Malaya, the old policy of restricting
the defence of Singapore to the immediate
vicinity of the Island had been replaced by one
of defending the whole of Malaya. In con-
formity with this policy the Chiefs of Staff had
authorised large army and air force increases.
In the absence of the Fleet, defence of the
Far East was to depend primarily on a mobile
air defence. Pending provision of the increased
air strength, the army needed additional interim
strength, over and above its ultimate total, to
ensure security in the meantime.

617. The Japanese attacked whilst this policy
was being implemented. The air force and the
army had by then received only a part of the
modern equipment and reinforcements which
had been estimated to be necessary. The vital
and pressing needs of the war in Europe and
the Middle East, which had passed through a
long and very critical period, had proved of
overriding importance. The result was that
the forces in the Far East were attacked in
positions which could only have been defended
if the full strength planned by the Chiefs of
Staff had been available.

Mutual Naval and R.A F. Support.’

618, The Air Force in Malaya was not yet
in a position to deny the waters off Malaya to
a_ seaborne invasion. It possessed, neither the
“necessary aircraft nor secure aerodromes, and
the enemy proved altogether too strong in the
air once he had obtained a footing in South
Siam and North Malaya.

619 The ‘‘ Prince of Wales’’ and ‘“‘ Re-
pulse ’’ were lost in a gallant attempt to help
the army and air force in their predicament in
-North Malaya. The attempt was made in the
face of a strong shore-based Japanese Air
-Force but without the. corresponding air sup-
port, either carrier-borne or shore-based. There-
after it was progressively impracticable for the
