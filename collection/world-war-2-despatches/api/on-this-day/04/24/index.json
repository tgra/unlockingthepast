The AURORA (Captain Louis Hamilton), was established as Senior Officer in Ofotfiord and with the ships under his orders maintained a steady and harassing pressure on the enemy. The bombardment took place cn 24th April; EFFINGHAM (in which I was accompanied by General Mackesy and Brigadier Fraser), WARSPITE, AURORA, ENTERPRISE, ZULU taking part. The bitter weather conditions, heavy snowstorms and low visibility prevented any aerial activity on either side. Troops were carried in the VINDICTIVE in case the morale . of the defenders should appear to be so affected as to give a promising opportunity to land. The climatic conditions were, however, entirely against any such undertaking and the low visibility entirely prevented any estimate of the effect achieved by the bombardment."
