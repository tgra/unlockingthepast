On the 28th September, the Commander, Fourteenth Army, in view of the re-grouping of the Japanese forces in Arakan, issued a fresh Operation Instruction to 15 Indian Corps. The bulk of 55 Japanese Division had been transferred from North Arakan into the lower Irrawaddy Valley, leaving a force of approximately four battalions in the forward area. Three more enemy battalions belonging to 54 Japanese Division were on Akyab Island and in the lower Kaladan Delta, and five battalions were in the coastal area between the Barongas and Cheduba Island. Thus the enemy was in no position to launch a serious attack. The tasks allotted to 15 Indian Corps on the 4th September were, therefore, changed and the Commander was ordered\u2014"

            "description": "The first phase of this plan was already practically completed when I wrote and, after the pause, we proceeded with the second phase. -Fifth Army had a hard struggle for the passes leading down into the plain of Naples but by 28th September ro Corps was through and the King\u2019s Dragoon Guards entered the great city at 0930 hours on 1st October. Eighth Army's principal objective, Foggia and its airfields, had fallen four days before on the 27th. On Doth fronts the pursuit went on, but it was slower now. On 6th October Fifth Army stood along the line of the Volturno River and realised that it would have to force a crossing against strong resistance; Eighth Army had also left behind the early days of rapid advance across the open country of Apulia and the line ran clear across Italy through the mountains from Termoli to Benevento and Capua and down to the Tyrrhenian at Castel Volturno. My _plan had been based on the German intention to withdraw to the Pisa-Rimini line and that intention had now been revoked on the highest authority; but before proceeding to discuss the effect of this new situation I must pause to describe the problems of administration which now faced us."
