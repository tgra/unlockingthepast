DESPATCH ON OPERATIONS IN IRAQ, EAST SYRIA AND IRAN,
FROM ioTH APRIL, 1941 To 12TH JANUARY, 1942.

The following Despatch was submitted to the
Secretary of State for War, on 18th October,
1942, by GENERAL,SIR ARCHIBALD P.
WAVELL, G.C.B., C.M.G., M.C., Com-
mander-in-Chief, India.

DESPATCH OF TROOPS TO IRAQ.

1. Events in Iraq, in early April, 1941, led
to a decision by His Majesty’s Government to
despatch a force to Iraq as rapidly as possible,
and on 8th April a telegram from the Secretary
of State for India was received enquiring if
the Government of India could make available
a suitable force to occupy Basra as early as
possible.

2. Detailed plans for the despatch of a force
to Iraq had been under préparation at Army
Headquarters, India, for some time but on

account of commitments elsewhere: it had not .

been found possible to provide the necessary
troops before July, 1941.

’ In order to meet the request of His Majesty’s
Government, and in view of the urgency of
the situation, it was therefore decided to divert
to Iraq a convoy which was at that time in
the process of embarking at Karachi prior to
sailing for Malaya. It was hoped at the same
time that the diversion of this convoy would
conceal the fact that troops were being
despatched to Iraq.

This proposal was communicated to His
Majesty’s Government on oth April and
accepted by them on roth April. The force
in this convoy, which was under the command
of Major-General W. A. K. Fraser, C.B.,
C.B.E., D.S.O., M.V.O., M.C., Commander
toth Indian Division, consisted of two senior
Staff Officers, Headquarters roth Indian Divi-
sion Artillery, 3rd Field Regiment, 2oth Indian
Infantry Brigade and certain ancillary troops.

3. Instructions were given to Major-General
Fraser to the following effect:—

(i) The object of his force was to occupy

the Basra-Shaiba area in order to ensure the

‘ safe disembarkation of further reinforcements
and to enable a base to be established in
that area. .

(ii) The attitude of the Iraq Army and
local authorities was still uncertain and it
was possible that attempts might be made
to oppose the disembarkation of his force.
In framing his plan for disembarkation, he
was, therefore, to act in the closest concert
with the officer commanding the Na
Forces. :

(iii) Should the disembarkation be
opposed, he was to overcome the Iraqi forces
by force and occupy suitable defensive posi-
tions ashore as quickly as possible.

(iv) The greatest care was to be taken
not to infringe the neutrality of Iran.

4. The force sailed from Karachi on x2th
April and a period of considerable anxiety
ensued as to whether the landing would be
opposed or not. As the force had originally
been prepared for despatch to Malaya it had
not been specially embarked with a view to
immediate tactical employment on arrival at
destination, and consequently a risk was
accepted in diverting it to Iraq where an
opposed landing was by no means impossible.
In view of the necessity for speed there was
no time to readjust the loading of units, which
would have caused a delay of some days.

5. In addition to the troops proceeding by
sea, 400 personnel of the 1st Bn. King’s Own
Royal Regiment were flown from Karachi to
Shaiba. The arrival of the first air party was
timed to synchronise with the arrival of the
