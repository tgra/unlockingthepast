3.  General Considerations.  Because of the presence  in  Greece of strong enemy air forces and  the rapidly. diminishing fighter support, it to carry out all.evacuation at  night and withdraw all ships to the southward  during the day. The whole programme was based on this consideration. It will  be noticed that nearly all losses from aircratt-were  sustained  in the region of the parallel of 37 degrees North, which was approximately the  limit of  the range of the enemy dive bombers. It was my policy to insist on: all ships leaving the places of embarkation in time to-be south of 37 degrees, North by daylight and it will be noted that the failure of the SLAMAT to leave

 Nauplia at the time ordered resulted in her

being within range of the dive  bombers. well after dawn. . . .

* Another factor to bs inane in mind was the possibility of, interference by surface craft from the westward., ~

Throughout there was no fighter a -for ships at sea north of 37 degrees North. The RAF. in Crete did what they could for convoys south of this latitude, but the protection was slender, by reason of the: small  number of aircraft. available. -
