Od. net. This set\n\nof maps also covers the operations described\n\nin the other Army and Air Despatches\n\nof the Burma Campaign from 16th November, 1943 to 12th September, 1945.\n\nThe following Despatch was submitted to the\nSecretary of State for War on the 4th\nFebruary, 1947, by LIEUTENANT-\nGENERAL SIR OLIVER LEESE, Bart.,\n\nK.C.B., C.B.E., DS.O., Commander-in-\nChief, Allied Land Forces, South-East\nAsia.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1. This Despatch covers the period from the\n12th November, 1944, on which date I\nassumed the appointment of Commander-in-\nChief, Allied Land Forces, South-East Asia,\nto the 15th August, 1945, when the Japanese\nsurrendered and when I relinquished my\nappointment. I have included the planning\nfor subsequent operations, as it was initiated\nand carried on during the period under con-\nsideration. But these plans are given in out-\nline only, because their execution is outside\nthe period of my command and because the\nJapanese capitulation caused many modifica-\ntions of the basic plan.\n\nI have divided my Despatch into three parts.\nPart I is concerned with the course of opera-\n‘tions and the planning and strategy which\ndetermined them. In Part II I have gone\ninto some detail of the administrative aspect,\nwhich in this campaign assumed such import-\nance that it justifies this separate treatment.\nIn Part III I have given some appreciations\nof the contributions made by those who took\npart in the campaign. It may be that, for the\ngeneral reader, a perusal of Parts I and II will\nsuffice to produce an adequate overall picture,\nbut for the military student the importance of\nthe administrative side of the campaign needs\nspecial emphasis.\n\nFinally, I have attached a table of contents\nof the Despatch and two other Appendices to\nwhich reference is made in the body of the\n\nDespatch.\nPART I\n\nNARRATIVE OF OPERATIONS\nSEcTION I (paras. 2-18) THE SITUATION ON\nTAKING OVER COMMAND\n\nLocation of my H.Q.: Constitution of the\ncommand: Note on the topography and climate\nof Burma: The task: Strategic plans already\nin existence: The new directive.\n\n2. I took over 11 Army Group from General\nSir George Giffard on the 12th November,\n1944, with the new title of Commander-in-\nChief, Allied Land Forces, South-East Asia.\nThis appointment had just been created follow-\ning the decision to place the American and\nChinese troops in South-East Asia under my\ncontrol. Since the 20th June, 1944, after\nthe capture of Kamaing (in the Mogaung\nValley), Northern Combat Area Command\nhad been under the direct operational control\nof the Supreme Allied Commander (Admiral\nThe Lord Louis Mountbatten, later Earl\nMountbatten of Burma). This arrangement had\nits origin in the refusal of General J..W. Stilwell,\nwho in addition to commanding Northern\nCombat Area Command was Deputy Supreme\nAllied Commander, to serve in a subordinate\ncapacity to the Commander-in-Chief, 11 Army\nGroup, although he had agreed to act under\nthe operational control of the Commander,\nFourteenth Army, for a limited period, that is,\nuntil the capture of Kamaing. When General\nD. I. Sultan, General Stilwell’s successor, came\nunder my command on the 12th November, a\n",

Wessels and Brigadier-\nGeneral R. T. Maddocks was added to my\nHeadquarters to provide adequate American\nrepresentation.\n\nOn taking over, I received my first Directive\nfrom the Supreme Allied Commander.\n\n3. My Advanced Headquarters were in the\nprocess of moving from Delhi to Barrackpore,\nwhere they opened on the Ist December, 1944.\nMain Headquarters, Allied Land Forces, South-\nEast Asia, at the insistence of the Supreme\nAllied Commander, were at Kandy where the\nSupreme Allied Commander and the Air Com-\nmander-in-Chief were located, while the Naval\nCommander-in-Chief was nearby at Colombo.\n\nIt was not, however, possible for me to\nexercise command from Kandy of an Army\nGroup which was actively engaged on three\nwidely separated fronts, 15 Indian Corps in\nArakan, Fourteenth Army in the Chin Hills,\nwest of the Chindwin River, and the British/\nChinese/American forces comprising the\nAmerican “Norther Combat Area Com-\nmand” in Northern Burma. Even from\nBarrackpore I was to find that it took me\n1,500 miles flying to visit the three fronts.\nDespite therefore the disadvantages of being\nseparated by so great a distance from the Head-\nquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander and\nfrom those of his two other Commanders-in-\nChief, it was necessary for me to base myself\non my Advanced Headquarters at Barrackpore.\nwhich was in fact by far the larger echelon,\nwhere all the day-to-day executive business of\nthe Headquarters was carried on. Actually\nBarrackpore had certain other advantages.\nFirst, Headquarters, Eastern Air Command,\nwere located only a mile or two down the\nHooghli. I was thus enabled to maintain that\nclose touch with General G. E. Stratemeyer\nwhich was essential to our joint operations\nwhile the battle for Burma was in progress.\nSecondly, I was in a good position to visit\nDelhi, the Headquarters of the India Base\nthrough which all my supplies and personnel\nhad to pass. And, lastly, I was well placed to\nvisit formations training under G.H.Q., India,\nwhich had been allocated to my future opera-\ntions, and in particular those at the Combined\nTraining Centres at Cocanada and near\nBombay.\n\nMy Main Headquarters at Kandy was in\nreality a strong liaison section under Major-\nGeneral I. S. O. Playfair, designed to main-\ntain close contact with Headquarters, Supreme\nAllied Commander, South-East Asia, and the\nother Commanders-in-Chief.\n\n4. On the 12th November, when J took over,\nmy command consisted of Fourteenth Army,\nmade up of 4, 15 and 33 Indian Corps, the\nNorthern Combat Area Command and Ceylon\nArmy Command. In addition there were cer-\ntain formations in India, which although not\nunder my command, were allocated for my\nfuture operations.\n\nIn Fourteenth Army (Lieutenant-General\nSir William Slim), 4 Indian Corps (Lieutenant-\nGeneral Sir Geoffry A. P. Scoones) consisted\nof 19 Indian Division and 23 Indian\nDivision, which was in the process of being\nwithdrawn to India. 33 Indian Corps\n(Qieutenant-General Sir Montagu G. N.\nStopford), consisted of 2 British Division, 5 and\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\n20 Indian Divisions, 11 (East African)\nDivision, the Lushai Brigade, 268 Indian\n(Lorried) Brigade, and 254 Indian Tank\nBrigade. 7 Indian Division was in the Kohima\narea and was destined for 4 Corps. 255 Indian\nTank Brigade at Imphal and 28 (East African)\nBrigade were also under Fourteenth Army.\nFifteenth Indian Corps (Lieutenant-General Sir\nA. F. Philip Christison) consisted of 25 and 26\nIndian Divisions, 81 and 82 (West African)\nDivisions, 50 Indian Tank Brigade and 3\nCommando Brigade.\n\nNorthern Combat Area Command\n(Lieutenant-General Dan I. Sultan) consisted\nof First and Sixth Chinese Armies, 36\nBritish Division, and 5332 U.S. (“‘ Mars”)\nBrigade. First Chinese Army (General Sun\nLi Jen) was composed of 30, 38, and 50\nChinese Divisions, while the Sixth (General\nLiao Yo Hsiang) was composed of 14 and 22\nChinese Divisions.

Willy) was in fact\nequivalent to a United States light division and\nconsisted of 475 United States Infantry\nRegiment, 124 United States Cavalry Regi-\nment, and one Chinese regiment. In addition\nNorthern Combat Area Command possessed\none Chinese tank brigade.\n\nCeylon Army Command (Lieutenant-General\nH. E. de R. Wetherall) consisted of a few\nlocally enlisted battalions and Base units, and\nalso the small garrisons in the island bases\nof Addu Atoll and Diego Garcia.\n\nIn India, assigned to my operations, but not\nunder my command, were Special Force, made\nup of 14, 16 and 23 Infantry Brigades, 77 and\n111 Indian Infantry Brigades and 3 (West\nAfrican) Infantry Brigade, which together\nformed six Long-Range Penetration Groups, 50\nParachute Brigade, two tank regiments (25\nDragoons and 149 R.A.C.), and certain small\nunits. 17 Indian Division was in India in\nG.H.Q. Reserve and not under my command.\n\n5. In mid-November, a reorganization of\nthe chain of command took place, which had\nbeen planned by General Giffard with\nthe object of freeing the Commander,\nFourteenth Army, from the control of opera-\ntions in Arakan, and from the responsibility\nof administering the long and difficult lines of\ncommunication in Assam. In this way he\nwould be enabled to concentrate his full atten-\ntion on the coming offensive across the\nChindwin River into Central Burma. Accord-\ningly on the 15th November, Lines of Com-\nmunication Command was formed under\nMajor-General G. W. Symes, with its H.Q. at\nComilla. It comprised 202 L. of C. Area\n(.Q., Gauhati), consisting of four sub-areas\nand the Fort Hertz Area, and 404 L. of C.\nArea of four sub-areas; it included a very\ngreat number of Base and L. of C. units. The\npolicy was to be that the rear boundaries of\nFourteenth Army and 15 Corps would be\nadjusted as the progress of operations allowed,\nin order to free them from rearward responsi-\nbilities. On the 16th November, 15 Corps was\nseparated from Fourteenth Army and came\ndirect under my command. I thus had under\nmy command three major formations im con-\ntact with the enemy, 15 Corps, Fourteenth\nArmy and Northern Combat Area Command,\nwith the L. of C. Command in the rear up\n\n‘to the boundary between South-East Asia\n\nCommand (S.E.A.C.) and India Command.\n",

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT to THe LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\n6. Before explaining my task and the exist-\ning strategical plans, I propose to say a few\nwords on the topography and climate of Burma,\nwhich exercised a preponderating influence on\nall operations there.\n\nThe only natural approach to the interior of\nBurma is through Rangoon, and thence by\nroad, rail or river to Mandalay. We, un-\nfortunately, had to re-enter the country from\nthe north, and for this there are only two\nroutes. The first is from Dimapur (Manipur\nRoad Railhead), then south through the moun-\ntains via Kohima and Imphal, then south-\neast through thick jungle hill country to Tamu,\nthence south down the notoriously unhealthy\nKabaw Valley to Kalemyo, across the Chind-\nwin River and then through gradually im-\nproving country to Shwebo in the dry belt.\nThe road from Tamu to Shwebo was only a\nfair-weather track quite unsuited as the main\ntoad artery of an army. The other northern\nroad approach was via Ledo, and, at the time\nwe are discussing, it was under construction,\nunder American control, as a land route to\nMyitkyina to link up with the Burma Road.\n\nThe only route from the Arakan coast into\nCentral Burma other than a rough foot track\nthrough An, was a fair-weather road of small\ntraffic-carrying capacity from Taungup to\nProme. Owing to its situation and limitations\nwe were not able to use it until after the\ncapture of Rangoon.\n\n7. Between Eastern Bengal and Central\nBurma lie the Lushai and Chin Hills, which\nextend south as the Arakan Yomas and north-\neast as the barrier between Burma and Assam.\nThey consist of a mass of parallel sharp ridges,\nrunning roughly north and south, with many\npeaks rising to heights of 6,000-9,000 feet. The\nhighest peak of the Arakan Yomas, Mount\nVictoria, is just over 10,000 feet. These moun-\ntains are covered with intensely thick jungle\nand form a complete military barrier between\nCentral Burma and the Eastern Bengal and\nArakan coast, with exception of the two tracks\nmentioned above.\n\nTn the centre of Burma, and containing Man-\ndalay and Meiktila, lies the “ Dry Belt,” which\nconsists of flat and open country. It has been\ndeveloped, and an all-weather road system\nexists, for example, connecting Shwebo, Manda-\nlay, Meiktila, Myingyan and Kyaukpadaung.\nIt was not until we reached this area that we\ncould expect to fight the Japanese under con-\nditions favourable to our superiority in armour,\nfire-power and mobility. The Arakan coast is\ndiscussed in more detail in the part of the\nDespatch which deals with the Arakan opera-\ntions (Sec. IX). It suffices to say that im-\nmensely thick jungle runs down to the coast\nfrom the hills, the only clearings being the\nsettlements. Suitable beaches for landing\noperations are very rare and most of the\nwater-ways, especially between Akyab and\npauneup. are hemmed in by dense mangrove\nforests.\n\n8. The climate of Burma, from an opera-\ntional point of view, is dominated by the\narrival of the summer monsoon. The excep-\ntionally severe monsoon rains in Arakan\nvirtually stop all movement by land between\nMay and the middle of December. Elsewhere\nthe rainfall is generally very heavy during the\nmonsoon except in the central dry belt. The\nmonsoon has the effect, too, of raising a swell\n\n60332\n\n1883\n\nin the Bay of Bengal from mid-March onwards,\nuntil, in early May, days suitable for landing,\noperations are very rare indeed. The mon-\nsoon conditions in the mountainous jungle\nareas make land operations difficult and ex-\nceptionally unpleasant, while flying conditions\nover them become hazardous in the extreme.\n\nThe question of health will be discussed in\ndetail with the medical aspect in the Adminis-\ntrative part of this Despatch. It is enough to\nsay here that without modern methods of main-\ntaining health, suppressive drugs, and the dis-\ncipline required with them, the campaign could\nnot have been fought.\n\n9. Finally, ‘before leaving the subject of\ntopography I make no apology for drawing\nattention to the huge distances in this theatre.\nOur road L. of C. from Kohima to Mandalay\nwas 527 miles long, and from Mandalay by\nroad to Rangoon was a further 433 miles.\n\n10. The first task assigned to me in my\nDirective was to protect the air route to China,\nto open the Burma Road via Myitkyina,\nBhamo and Wanting, to Kunming, and to pro-\ntect the airfields at Myitkyina. I was also to\ndestroy the Japanese Army in Burma, with the.\nproviso that these operations must in no way\ninterfere with my responsibilities for the pro-\ntection and opening of the Ledo/Burma Road\nand the air routes to China. I realised at once,\nhowever, that I could do nothing permanently\nto ensure the safety of the air route or the\nLedo/Burma Road until I had defeated de-\ncisively in battle the main Japanese forces in\n\nurma.\n\n11. The strategical plans which I took over\non arrival were as follows.\n\nOperation “Capital” was aimed at the re-\nconquest of Central Burma. It envisaged an\nadvance via Kalewa with Fourteenth Army\ninto the Mandalay Plain, with the first objective\nYe-U and Shwebo, which are both situated in\nthe more open country in the dry belt, and,\nsecondly, ‘Mandalay. Northern Combat\nArea Command was to conform in this by ad-\nvancing south to the general line Mongmit-\nLashio. The primary object of this operation\nwas to bring the Japanese to battle in country\nwhere we could exploit our superiority in fire-\npower, armour and mobility, and to provide\nan “anvil” for the eventual invasion of\nBurma from the Rangoon end, since it was\nconsidered that the clearing of Burma from\nthe north alone was impracticable.\n\nOperation “Dracula” was the invasion\nof Rangoon by air and sea. This operation\nwas originally planned for the middle of\n‘March, 1945. While I was in the United King-\ndom in early October, after leaving Eighth\nAnny, the Chiefs of Staff decided that this\noperation could not take place, since the re-\nsources, principally in formations which it was\nhoped to send from Europe, could not be re-\nleased. The original plans envisaged a seven\ndivision operation, including one airborne\ndivision and three air-transported, the re-\nmainder for sea assault and follow-up. The\nrequirements from Europe were two Corps\nHeadquarters, one airborne division, and three\nother divisions, one of which was to replace\nthe G.H.Q., India, reserve division. Although,\nhowever, it was not going to take place in\nthe Spring of 1945, it was still intended that a\nsimifar operation would take place after the\n\nA2\n",

The airborne and air-traus-\nported part of the operation, which was con-\nsidered essential owing to the difficulties of a\npurely seaborne assault on Rangoon, was to be\nmounted in the Chittagong area and a big\nprogramme of building of fair-weather air\nstrips, with all the necessary ancillaries such\nas fuel installations, had been approved. In\norder that these could be ready for a post-1945-\nmonsoon assault, I was directed to continue\nthe construction required. These pre-monsoon\npreparations were naturally at the cost of re-\nsources I wanted for my current operations.\n\nThe scale and concept of Dracula in its\noriginal form should be borne in mind when\nthe way in which Rangoon was captured is\ndescribed at the end of this part of the\nDespatch. The difference between the pro-\njected operation of early October, 1944, and\nthe actual operation of May, 1945, is the true\nmeasure of the development of the operational\nsituation in Burma between those dates.\n\n12. As soon as it was known that the air\nand sea invasion of Rangoon (Dracula) could\nnot be carried out before the 1945 monsoon, a\nfresh operation (Romulus) was planned in\nArakan. The situation there was unsatisfac-\ntory, as we had four divisions locked up by the\nJapanese threat of an advance up the Kaladan\nValley. .This threat, which was by a force\nmuch inferior in numbers to our own, could\nbest be liquidated by the capture of Akyab\nIsland, Myebon and Minbya. With this\nachieved, the Arakan garrison of four divi-\nsions could be reduced to one of four brigades\nduring the coming monsoon, and valuable\ndivisions thereby released for further opera-\ntions, thus partially -offsetting the non-arrival\nof formations from Europe.\n\n13. To recapitulate in brief, the tasks of the\nformations under my command at the time I\ntook over were as follows.\n\nNorthern Combat Area Command to recap-\nture and secure the trace of the Burma Road\nfrom its junction with the new road from Ledo\nand to hold the Myitkyina air bases.\n\nFourteenth Army to get into the dry belt\nof Central Burma in order to defeat the main\nJapanese armies and thus ensure permanent\nsecurity to the Ledo/Burma Road, to develop\nairfields there, and to provide an “ anvil” for\nthe invasion of Rangoon after the 1945\nmonsoon.\n\nFifteenth Corps in Arakan to liquidate the\nremaining Japanese threat in that sector by a\nlimited offensive to just beyond Akyab, in\norder that formations could be withdrawn to\ntake part in post-monsoon offensive operations\nagainst Rangoon or elsewhere.\n\n14. On the 4th November, eight days before I\nassumed command, the Supreme Allied Com-\namander had issued an Operational Directive to\nhis three Commanders-in-Chief, regarding an\noffensive in Arakan, instructing them jointly to\ninitiate the planning, and direct the execution\nof the following tasks.\n\nAn advance by land was to be made down\nthe Mayu Peninsula and the Kalapanzin and\n‘Kaladan Valleys with the object of clearing the\narea north of the general line Foul Point-\nKudaung Island-Minbya. This advance was to\nfbegin as soon as possible.\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nAn amphibious assault on Akyab Island was\nto be launched as early as possible in 1945,\nwith the aim of clearing the island by the end\nof January. The area north of the line Akyab-\nMinbya was to be consolidated but no\nexploitation was to take place south of Myebon\nwithout the Supreme Allied Commander’s\nauthority.\n\nOn the 9th November, General Giffard had\nissued an Operation Instruction to the Com-\nmander, 15 Corps, defining his task in Arakan\nin accordance with the above Directive.\n\n15. A week after I had assumed my new\nCommand, the Supreme Allied Commander\nissued a Planning Directive (19th November)\nin which he ordered plans to be made for the\nexecution of “the stages of operation Capital\n[the plan for the advance into Central Burma]\nnecessary to the security of existing air supply\nroutes and the opening of land communications\nwith China and the exploitation of Capital\nthroughout 1945 as far as may be possible\nwithout prejudicing the preparation for the\nexecution of Dracula [the plan for the am-\nphibious assault on Rangoon} at the very\nearliest date possible after the end of the mon-\nsoon in 1945.” (1 quote the actual words of\nthe. directive.)\n\nAfter stating that the plans for operations to\nsecure the general line Kalewa-Shwebo-Mogok-\nLashio (Phase II of operation Capital) had\nreceived his approval, the Supreme Allied\nCommander further directed me in conjunc-\ntion with the Allied Air Commander-in-Chief,\nto initiate and co-ordinate plans for the execu-\ntion of Phase III, with the object of securing\nthe genera! line Pakokku-Mandalay-Maymyo-\nLashio.\n\nI was also directed “to bear in mind the\nparamount importance of destroying the maxi-\nmum number of Japanese during this Phase,\nso as to prevent their withdrawal to South\nBurma and to facilitate subsequent exploita-\ntion.” This was fully in accordance with my\nown views since I had already decided in my\nown mind that the Mandalay Plain, for the\nreasons I have already explained, should be\nthe graveyard of the Japanese armies. I may\nadd that I found when I met General Slim\nthat he had long been of the same opinion and\nthat his future strategy was directed to this\nend.\n\n16. Another Directive which I received about\nthis time (18th November) informed me that\nthe British Chiefs of Staff had ordered that the\nCocos Islands, lying midway between Ceylon\nand Australia and some 1,500 miles from each,\nwere to be developed early in 1945 as an air\nstaging point for heavy aircraft in transit. I\nwas called on to provide for the land defence\nof these islands, in consultation with the Naval\nand Air Commanders-in-Chief ; the target date\ngiven for the completion of the development of\nthe islands being the Ist June, 1945.\n\nI may add here that the Army component of\nthe garrison eventually decided on was one\nbattalion, one Coast and two A.A. batteries,\nand certain Engineer and Pioneer companies.\nThe disembarkation of troops and stores com-\nmenced on the 25th March, 1945, and was\ncompleted without enemy interference.\n\n- 17. There is one other project that arose\nduring the period under consideration. In a\n",

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 195!\n\nDirective issued by the Supreme Allied Com-\nmander on the 3rd December, 1944, he in-\nstructed his Commanders-in-Chief to plan an\noperation for the capture of the Hastings Har-\nbour Island Group, which lies off Victoria\nPoint, the southern tip of Burma. The object\nof the operation was to establish an advanced\nnaval and air base for the exploitation of our\nnaval and air superiority, to assist operations\nin Burma and to prepare for an early advance\non Malaya. I represented to the Supreme\nAllied Commander that we had insufficient\nforce to do this operation in addition to the\nArakan and Fourteenth Army operations, and\nplanning was suspended.\n\n18. I have already mentioned in paragraph\n\n11 that a number of formations were due from\nEurope, but that this redeployment had been\npostponed. Two aspects of this deserve men-\ntion at once as they were problems which\nremained during the whole period on which\nI am reporting.\n\nThe first problem was the lack of sufficient\nformations with which to affect the relief of\nbattle-worn troops. General Giffard, with the\nhelp of the Commander-in-Chief, India, had\ndone much to improve the situation, but it was\nstill acute. It was only possible to spare one\ndivision at a time for rehabilitation in India.\nMoreover, the time and space factor, including\nthe limited number of transport aircraft avail-\nable in the theatre made this process necessarily\nslow. To send a division from Burma to India,\nfrom the point of view of time and availability,\nwas equivalent to moving such a formation\nfrom Italy to rest and refit in Palestine. Further,\nI could not afford to send more than one\ndivision outside the Fourteenth Army area.\nReorganizations for specific tasks and reliefs\nwere achieved by resting formations within the\nArmy area. But most of the formations under\nmy command had been in forward areas for six\nmonths—some much longer. Lack of trained\nreinforcements, especially in British personnel,\nmade it difficult to keep some of them up to\nfull establishment.\n\nThe second problem concerned the redeploy-\nment of formations from Europe. This scheme,\nknown as “Minerva,” involved the large-\nscale transfer of formations, units and cadres\ninitially to the command of General Head-\nquarters, India, for subsequent employment in\noperations in S.E.A.C. Although it was not\nimplemented to any extent during the period\ncovered by this Despatch, it was a matter under\nvery active consideration the whole time. The\nprincipal difficulty was the time lag. In the\ncase of an Indian division in Italy, it would\nbe eight and a half months from the time the\norder to withdraw from Italy was given to the\ndate of readiness for operations in S.E.A.C.:\nfor a British division from North-West\nEurope the corresponding delay was eight\nmonths. Moreover, the formations could not\nat this stage be linked up with a particular\nprojected future operation but had to build up\na balanced force suitable for any future opera-\ntions in the theatre. The composition of the\nforce table and the necessary priority of arrival\nin India were matters of close co-operation\nbetween General Headquarters, India, and my\nHeadquarters.\n\n1885\n\nSection II (paras. 19-27) THE OPERATIONAL\nSITUATION IN NOVEMBER\n\nThe failure of the Japanese invasion of\nSpring, 1944: The importance of the 1944 mon-\nsoon operations: The state of the enemy, his\nstrength and dispositions: Relative strengths:\nOur assets of sea and air power: Air supply.\n\n19. In February and March, 1944, Fourteenth\nArmy (15 Corps) had decisively beaten the\nJapanese in Arakan. This was followed by our\noutstanding victory in the Kohima—Imphal\nbattle (May-July). Thus the offensive, which\nthe Japanese had launched in the Spring with\nthe object of seizing the gateway to India, had\ncompletely failed. They had suffered tre-\nmendous casualties, estimated at 100,000 during\ntheir offensive and their subsequent retreat\n\nduring the monsoon, when privation and ex-'\n\nposure took a toll to which the thousands of\nenemy bodies counted by our advancing troops\nbore witness.\n\n20. During the monsoon, Fourteenth Army\nand Northern Combat Area Command both\nexploited success to the full. I wish to em-\nphasise the importance of these monsoon\noperations. In the Kohima—lImphal battle we\nhad inflicted a crushing defeat on the enemy\nand our continuous pressure throughout the\nrainy season had kept him on the run, allow-\ning him no respite. This was largely due to\n\nthe tenacity of 5 Indian Division (Major-\n\nGeneral D. F. W. Warren) and of 11 (East\nAfrican) Division (Major-General C. C.\nFowkes) which refused to be daunted by\nappalling conditions of weather and terrain.\n\n21. My problem, which was largely an admin-\nistrative one owing to the paucity of communi-\ncations, was how to maintain the impetus of\nour advance until we could bring the enemy\nto battle on ground of our own choosing. More-\nover, to be fully effective, this impetus had\nto be maintained over a broad front. It\nappeared likely that the enemy, having failed\nto stop us west of the Chindwin, would attempt\nto hold the Shwebo—Mandalay area ; and that\nhis intention would be to reorganize and re-\ninforce his armies behind a covering line, with\n\nthe view ultimately of passing again to the\n\nOffensive. His forward covering troops were\ndisposed well north of the general line Lashio—\nShwebo—Myingyan—Akyab.\n\n22. The location of Japanese formations at\nthe end of November was as follows:—\n\nIn the coastal sector, two divisions (the 54th\nand 55th), comprising Twenty-eighth Japanese\nArmy, were distributed between Maungdaw\nand Bassein. The enemy, however, appeared\nto be withdrawing from the Paletwa area in the\nKaladan, leaving only small detachments north\nof the Khawei—Paletwa line.*\n\nFacing Fourteenth Army were three Japanese\ndivisions, the 15th, 31st and 33rd, all much\nteduced in strength but with fresh drafts arriv-\ning.\nPinlebu area, and had recently withdrawn its\n\n15 Division was based on the Wuntho—.\n\n* Documents captured 4 after our offensive opened in-\n\nthe middle of Decem! showed that the Japanese\n\nintended to hoid forward as long as possible, but that,\n\ntheir main line was to be the Kaladan River from, and\n\nincluding, Akyab and Kyauktaw.\n",

The depleted 31st Division was in\nFifteenth Army reserve in the Ye-U area.\n\n53 Division was in the Naba—Katha area.\nThis Division, together with the 15th, 31st and\n33rd mentioned above, comprised the Japanese\nFifteenth Army. 14 Tank Regiment, which had\nsuffered heavily in the retreat, was believed\nto be refitting in the Shwebo area.\n\nFacing Northern Combat Area Command\nand the Chinese Expeditionary Force, there\nwere 56, 2 and 18 Japanese Divisions, disposed\nbetween Bhamo and the Salween River. These\nformed Thirty-third Army, but 2 Division was\nonly on loan and was to return to Burma Area\nArmy reserve,\n\nThe Japanese Burma Area Army reserve\nconsisted of 49 Division, in the Pegu Area.\nThe Japanese were known to be particularly\nsensitive to the threat of sea-borne attack, and\nour deception schemes were designed to increase\ntheir fears. It was therefore unlikely that they\nwould move troops from South to North Burma\nunless the situation there became critical. This\nalso applied to 72 Independent Mixed Brigade\nat Moulmein.\n\nIn addition to the formations listed above,\nthe Japanese had about 100,000 L. of C.\ntroops. The fighting qualities which these\nadministrative units displayed against General\nWingate’s brigades earlier in the year proved\nthem to be a factor which could not be\nignored. Experience in the Pacific theatre\nhad shown that Japanese base troops were\ncapable of stubborn and suicidal defence. The\nenemy also had at their disposal two “ Indian\nNational Army ” divisions, each 6,000 strong,\nand seven battalions of the “Burma National\nArmy.” Both these forces had a considerable\npotential nuisance value.\n\nTo summarise, therefore, the enemy had,\nin November, ten divisions and two indepen-\ndent mixed brigades in Burma, disposed as\nfollows: —33 Army (three divisions) facing\nNorthern Combat Area Command in the north-\neast; 15 Army (four divisions) in the centre\nextending from the Railway Corridor, through\nthe Zibyutaung Range, to the River Irrawaddy :\n28 Army (two divisions) in the coastal sector ;\nand a division in reserve.\n\n23. The situation of our own forces during\nthe latter part of November was briefly as\nfollows.\n\nIn 15 Corps, in Arakan, 25 Indian Division\n(Major-General G. N. Wood) was in contact\nwith the enemy in the general area of\nMaungdaw and the Maungdaw—Buthidaung\nroad, the eastern portion of which, including\nButhidaung, was in enemy hands, Our troops\nwere actively engaged in clearing features of\ntactical importance prior to the coming main\noffensive in December.\n\n26 Indian Division (Major-General C. E. N.\nLomax) had one brigade forward at the head\nof the Kalapanzin River, in the area of Bawli,\nTaung and Goppe Bazaars, and two brigades\nin reserve. It was in process of being relieved\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nby the newly-arrived 82 (West African) Division\n(Major-General G. Mc J. §. Bruce) and was\nabout to concentrate for training at Chittagong,\nin preparation for the sea-borne assault on\nAkyab in February. .\n\nIn the upper Kaladan, elements of 81 (West\nAfrican) Division (Major-General F. J. Loftus-\nTottenham) had by-passed the enemy positions\nin the Paletwa area (Paletwa itself was found\ndeserted on the 17th November) and were\nadvancing south down the Pi Chaung. Their\npatrols, on the 30th November, were within two\nmiles of Kaladan village, which lies some eight\nmiles south-south-east of Paletwa.\n\n3 Commando Brigade was concentrated at\nTeknaf and was responsible for the security\nof the Naf Peninsula.\n\n50 Indian Tank Brigade had not concen-\ntrated by the 30th November, and 22 (East\nAfrican) Brigade did not arrive till the end of\nDecember.\n\n33 Conps was leading the advance of\nFourteenth Army, with 5 Indian Division on\nthe right, and 11 (East African) Division on the\nleft. “5 Indian Division, which had advanced\nvia Tiddim, was concentrating in the Kalemyo\narea prior to being relieved. (Kalemyo itself\nhad been entered by the leading elements of\n11 (Q@Bast African) Division on the 15th\nNovember.) Between the Ist July and the\n30th November, 5 Indian Division had killed\nfifteen of the enemy for every one of its own\nmen ki The actual casualty figures,\nexcluding the Lushai Brigade area, and only\nincluding fresh bodies and wounded which the\nenemy were actually seen to remove, were:—\n\nKilled.

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nsuch a move would be feasible, and, on the\n18th November, 4 Corps were allowed to direct\nthe whole of 19 Indian Division, which had\nmoved forward from Imphal to the Tamu—\nSittaung area, on to Pinlebu. In addition to\nTeconnoitring routes east of this place, 19\nIndian Division was given the task of discover-\ning whether the roads from Pinlebu southwards\ncould be opened for a further overland\nadvance. By this means, coupled with the\noperations of 33 Corps, the possibility of com-\npleting Phase Il of Capital without airborne\noperations was to be investigated. The two\nJeading brigades of 19 Indian Division began\nto cross the Chindwin at Sittaung and Thaung-\ndut in the third week of November and, by\nthe end of the month, had occupied Nanbon\nand Paungbyin against minor opposition.\n\nMeanwhile, in the middle of November, 4\nCorps took over 268 Indian Brigade—an inde-\npendent formation composed of five battalions\n—from 33 Corps. The leading elements of this\nBrigade were, at this time, disposed on the east\nbank of the Chindwin, opposite Sittaung. 7\nIndian Division (Major-General F. W.\nMesservy) which was also to form part of 4\nCorps, was still resting in the Kohima area.\nIt was not to be committed across the Chind-\nwin, as, at this period, it was expected it might\nbe required later to be flown into the Shwebo\narea as a reinforcement.\n\nIn Northern Combat Area Command,\n36 British Division (Major-General F. W.\nFesting) on the 30th November captured\nPinwe, six miles north of the important rail-\nway junction of Naba, after the village had\nbeen fiercely defended by the enemy for over\ntwo weeks. The Japanese left behind many\ndead and much equipment. 38 Chinese Divi-\nsion had occupied Myothit, 16 miles north-east\nof Bhamo, and pushing on had encircled\nBhamo itself and the air-strip east of the town,\ndespite strong enemy counter-attacks. Other\nChinese troops were advancing down the\nBhamo-Namhkam and Bhamo-Mongmit roads.\n\n24. Bearing in mind the undoubted fighting\nqualities of the Japanese soldier, and the fact\nthat the enemy was operating on interior lines,\nhis strength of ten and two-third divisions (with\nauxiliary troops) appeared formidable. The\nquestion was how much of this force could be\nconcentrated against Fourteenth Army, or, in\nother words, how many divisions we could\nforce the enemy to employ against Northern\nCombat Area Command and in Arakan, in\norder to weaken this concentration.\n\nNorthern Combat Area Command comprised\n5332 (“Mars”) Brigade, which was the\nequivalent of an American light division, and\nfive Chinese divisions. The latter had little\nadministrative tail, as the Americans provided\nmuch of the administration, and were smaller\nthan Indian divisions. They also varied a good\ndeal in their state of training. ‘While it was\nunlikely that the Japanese could be induced\nto send more troops to this front, provided\nthat the pressure by Northern Combat Area\nCommand did not weaken, they might at least\nbe expected not to withdraw any substantial\nforce from it. There were two enemy divisions\nin the coastal sector, including Bassein. It was\nhoped that, in spite of the advantages of\nterrain and communications which the Japanese\ndefence enjoyed, they would not be able to\n\n1887\n\nreduce this force by more than a regiment or\ntwo. In the south of Burma, our deception\nschemes were framed with the object of tying\ndown the garrison there, which amounted to\nrather less than two divisions.\n\nThus I hoped that Fourteenth Army might\nnot be opposed by a force greater than five\nJapanese divisions, one independent mixed\nbrigade, a tank regiment and approximately\n50,000 L. of C. and auxiliary troops.\n\n25. The Commander, Fourteenth Army, had\nat his disposal six and two-third divisions (2\nBritish Division, 5, 7, 17, 19 and 20 Indian\nDivisions), 268 Indian Brigade, 28 (East\nAfrican) Brigade, and two Indian tank brigades\n(254th and 255th). But our transportation\nresources, air and road, were limited and it\nappeared impossible to maintain more than\nfour and two-third divisions and two tank\nbrigades beyond the Chindwin.\n\nTo launch an offensive, across a great river\n(the Chindwin) and with precarious communi-\ncations, with only four and two-third divisions\nagainst five and one-third, even though some -\nof the latter had been badly mauled, was\nto take a risk. But it was a calculated risk.\nOur troops had already shown themselves to\nbe superior to the enemy and, once we reached\nopen country, our superiority in armour, fire-\npower and mobility would tell.\n\n26. I relied also upon two other great assets\nin particularm—our complete sea and air\nsupremacy. As will be seen from the narra-\ntive of operations, it was thanks to sea power\nthat we were able to capture and then to stock\nand operate the great air bases on Akyab and\nRamree Islands, upon which the air supply of\nFourteenth Army so much depended. Sea and\nair power enabled us to deliver the final assault\non Rangoon.\n\n27. The factor of air supremacy was of the\nhighest importance. In jungle fighting, tactical\nmobility is afforded by air transport. Air\nsupply allows the carrying out of the out-\n\nnking manoeuvres necessary’ to pin enemy\nresistance, by-pass it, and isolate or destroy it.\nBy the use of air lines of communication, as\nwith sea lines of communication, not only are\nthe tenuous and limited overland routes supple-\nmented, but one checkmates the Japanese\ntechnique of establishing road blocks in one’s\ntear ; the advance can continue unchecked and\nthe enemy detachments are left to starve or are\nmopped up in due course.\n\nSupply by air formed a large and vital part\nof the whole gigantic transportation effort which\nthe prosecution of this campaign entailed. The\nfull details appear in the Administrative part\nof this Despatch. It is enough here to say that\nduring the peak month of April, 1945, when\nFourteenth Army was racing for Rangoon,\nover 68,100 tons were delivered by air, over\n11,000 men were brought forward and nearly\n10,000 casualties evacuated. The stores carried\nby air included engines and other essential\nmaterial for the building of the Inland Water\nTransport fleet at Kalewa, which was to operate\nthe inland water transport supply link to\nMyingyan, and the light locomotives which\nwere to Operate on stretches of railway east of\nthe Irrawaddy.\n\nThroughout the campaign, the availability of\naircraft for supply and transport was a major\ninfluence on the course of operations.\n",

Our bases, rear areas and land\ncommunications were secure from air action,\nwhile these vital parts of the Japanese army\nwere under constant attack by the Allied Air\nForces. The close support of bomber, fighter/\nbomber and fighter squadrons was denied the\nenemy, while our own army reaped the benefit\nof tactical air support.

An account of the operational situation\nof our troops at the end of November has\nbeen given in paragraph 23. In this section\nI propose to give an account of operations\nup to the virtual completion of Capital, Phase\nIl, that is, the securing of the Ye-U and\nShwebo areas in the belt area of Central\nBurma. In the original plan for Capital, the\nadvance of 33 Corps to Ye-U and Shwebo was\nto have been assisted by an airborne operation.\nIt soon became obvious, however, that the\nspecially trained and equipped troops, essential\nfor such an operation, were not going to be\navailable. It is worth, therefore, at this point\nreviewing the situation as regards airborne\ntroops in the Command, or available for it,\ngenerally.\n\n29. On the 1st November, 1944, just before\nI assumed command, H.Q., 44 Indian Airborne\nDivision had been formed from elements of\nthe recently disbanded H.Q., 44 Indian\nArmoured Division. The organization and\ntraining of this Airborne Division was to be\nthe responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief,\nIndia, who, however, kept in close touch with\nme, through the Supreme Allied Commander,\nin regard to matters of policy. It was agreed\nthat the Divisional H.Q. and Divisional troops\nwere to be concentrated for training by the Ist\nJanuary, while the remainder of the Division\n\nwas to be concentrated in the Bilaspur-Raipur.\n\narea by the end of March. The Division as a\nwhole was to be ready for war by the 15th\nOctober, 1945, that is, in time for immediate\npost-monsoon operations. The existing 50\nIndian Parachute Brigade formed the nucleus\nof this new Division, and this formation was\nthe one which had been originally earmarked\nto take part in operations in Burma to assist\n33 Corps. It had, however, been used in an\ninfantry réle in the Imphal battle and had\nsuffered severely. It had not been fully recon-\nstituted and so was not now available. A\nsecond parachute brigade was to have deen\nformed from Special Force, but as sufficient\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nvolunteers were not forthcoming, recruiting’.\nwas extended to other units in India, and to\nALF.S.£.A. units which were not involved in\noperations. By mid-1945 the Division was\nmore or less complete except for the Signals\nelement, which could only be made up when\nforces were redeployed from Europe after the\nGerman defeat. The provision of aircraft for\nthe training of this Division was a perpetual\nworry, since they could only ‘be supplied at the\nexpense of the more immediately pressing\nneeds of air supply for the Burma battle.\n\n30. Failing any part of the Airborne Division\nproper, the only other troops I could hope to\nbe able to call on for an airborne operation\nwere Special Force. This Force had suffered\nseriously from disease, especially malaria,\nduring its 1944 campaign. When I inspected\nit in December, 1944, I formed the opinion\nthat, despite its splendid achievements and fine\nesprit-de-corps, it was no longer battle-worthy\nand that it could not be used for the Capital\nairborne operation. Moreover I considered\nthat there was no longer a justifiable réle for\na force such as this, which, like all forces of\nthis nature, was particularly expensive in over-\nheads such as Headquarters and Signals. I\ntherefore recommended its disbandment, and\nlater, on the 23rd February, was informed by.\nIndia Command that the War Office had\napproved my recommendation. »\n\n31. I was thus compelled to abandon the-\nplan of an airborne landing as part of Capital,\nPhase II. I was also forced, reluctantly, to\ngive up the idea of reinforcing the Northem\nCombat Area Command front by fiying-in\nanother division. I had hoped to move 7\nIndian Division, which was resting at Kobima,.\ninto the Pinwe—Wuntho “ railway corridor ”\nby air, but examination showed that our air\ntransport resources would be inadequate with-\nout prejudicing the maintenance lift required\nfor the advance of Fourteenth Army. Instead,\ntherefore, I instructed the Commander,\nFourteenth Army, to direct 19 Indian Division\non to Indaw (less the brigade already advanc-\ning on Pinlebu). General Sultan for some time\nhad been worried about his right flank. I was\ntherefore glad to close the gap between him and\nFourteenth Army.\n\n32. General Slim now recast his plan and\ndecided to advance with two Corps up. This\ndecision fully accorded with my own views, as,\nto maintain the strongest pressure on the\ntetreating enemy, it was necessary to do so\non as broad a front as possible.\n\n33 Corps remained directed on Ye-U and\nShwebo, but he moved up 4 Corps on their\nleft, directed initially on Pinlebu. The orders\nissued to Commander, 4 Corps, on the 7th\nDecember were :—\n\n(a) Advance as rapidly as possible to\nmake contact with 36 British Division in the\narea Indaw—Wuntho.\n\n(6) Capture Pinlebu as quickly as possible\nand exploit towards Wuntho with a view to\ncutting the railway behind, and destroying\nany Japanese forces to the north.\n\n(c) Take over part of the sector of 36\nBritish Division, thus enabling General\nSultan to employ this Division in operations\nfurther to the: east.\n",

Two brigades of 11\n(East African) Division crossed the river, but\nmet determined opposition in their efforts to\nextend their bridgehead. By the 14th Decem-\nber, however, a semi-circular area, extending\nfrom a point six miles north-east of Kalewa to\nShwegyin, five miles to the south-east, had\nbeen ‘cleared. The withdrawal of the Division\nfor rehabilitation then began, on relief by 2\nBritish Division, and was completed by the\nend of the month.\n\n34. On the day before 11 (East African)\nDivision’s crossing, 32 Brigade of 20 Indian\nDivision had crossed the Chindwin about thirty\nmiles to the north, at a point seven miles south-\neast of Mawlaik. The passage of the river was\nmade mainly by rafting, and 5,065 men, 1,456\nmules and 30 tons of equipment were put across\nthis formidable obstacle in 100 hours, for the\nloss of one mule. The Division then advanced\nrapidly eastwards in difficult flooded country\nuntil it reached the Indaw—Pyingaing road.\nIt there turned south, reaching the Pyingaing\narea in time to attack in the rear the enemy\nrearguard which was blocking the advance of\n\n2 British Division who had come through the\nKalewa bridgehead. The enemy were routed,\nsuffering heavy casualties. 32 Brigade then\ncontinued its advance southwards, reaching a\npoint 19 miles south of Pyingaing by the 31st\nDecember. In the meantime, the rest of 20\nIndian Division (Major-General D. D. Gracey)\nhad moved south from their concentration\narea at Htinzin and relieved 5 Indian Division\nat Kalemyo and Khampat. Divisional Head-\nquarters and 100 Brigade then pushed on\nacross difficult country and occupied Mauk-\nkadaw on the Chindwin, 17 miles south-west\nof Pyingaing, on the 25th December. Thence,\nfollowing 32 |Brigade, their advance was\ndirected on Budalin, the important Japanese\ncommunication centre 54 miles south-east of\nMaukkadaw, flank protection being afforded\nby: 80 Brigade advancing west of the Chindwin.\n\n1889\n\n35. 2 British Division (Major-General\nC. G. G. Nicholson) remained concentrated in\nthe Yazagyo area until the 12th December,\nwhen it began its forward move to the\nKalewa bridgehead. The leading Brigade. the\n6th, passed through 11 (East African) Division\non the 21st and advanced rapidly along the road\nfrom Kalewa towards Pyingaing. West of\nPyingaing the advance was checked by a strong\nrearguard position. With the assistance of 32\nBrigade of 20 Indian Division as stated above,\nthe enemy was cleared, and Pyingaing was\ncaptured on the 24th. Determined resistance\nwas again encountered in the Wainggyo Gorge,\nnine miles south-west of Pyingaing, but was\novercome with tank support. The advance of\n2 British Division continued with great speed.\nDominating features astride the road 12 miles\neast of Pyingaing were cleared, and a large\nenemy detachment was successfully ambushed\non the 28th December. On the 31st, the Kabo\nWeir, 11 miles north of Ye-U was captured\nintact. This was an important economic gain,\nsince the Kabo Weir controls the irrigation of\nan extensive area of rice-growing country. It\nwas a propitious entry into the Shwebo plain—\nthe enemy’s demolition party, sent to blow up\nthe weir, arrived to find us in occupation. On\nthe 2nd January, 5 Brigade had established\nitself at Ye-U and the Division was driving the\nenemy back on to Shwebo, the northern out-\nskirts of which were reached by the 8th\nJanuary. 64 Brigade of 19 indian Division\nhad already reached the eastern outskirts on the\n7th, having come via Kanbalu. Shwebo town\nwas finally occupied on the 10th January, after\nthe Japanese rearguard had fought to the last.\nman. 6 Brigade of 2 British Division was\nthen concentrated at Shwebo after relief by 268\nIndian Brigade in the Kabo Weir area. This\nadvance of 150 miles in 20 days was a fine per-\nformance by an all-British Division.\n\n36. On the extreme western flank of 33\nCorps, a general redistribution of forces of\nLushai Brigade took place early.in December,\nBrigade Headquarters being located 18 miles\nnorth of Gangaw. Deep patrolling was main-\ntained east to the Chindwin, while two batta-\nlions continued to close in on Gangaw via the\nMyittha Valley. They reached the area three\nmiles north of Gangaw by the 14th December,\nbut here they bumped strong positions which\nthe enemy continued to hold stubbornly despite\nstrong air attacks. Meanwhile, Irregulars had\noccupied Mingin, on the river 24 miles §.S.E.\nof Kalewa. Other Irregulars had penetrated\n30 miles south of Gangaw and were engaging\nthe enemy in the Tilin area. Lushai Brigade\ncame under command of 4 Corps on the 23rd\nDecember.\n\nI may add here that this formation and its\nCommander, Brigadier P. C. Marindin, after\nthe fall of Kalewa and the clearing of the west\nside of the Chindwin (in which operations they\nhad played an important réle), received the\ncongratulations of the Supreme Allied Com-\nmander on the outstanding results they had\nachieved under exceptionally severe conditions\nduring the past 12 months.\n\n37. 4 Corps (Lieutenant-General F. W. (ater\nSir Frank) Messervy, who had _ succeeded\nLieutenant-General Sir Geoffry A. P. Scoones\non the 8th December) was in the area of the\nUpper Chindwin.\n",

The two lead-\ning battalions, advancing from the Chindwin,\nvia Pantha, reached Indaw and an area 15\nmiles to the east-north-east by the 15th Decem-\nber. They then pushed on a further 20 miles,\nthrough the Japanese advanced elements, and\noccupied two villages east of the escarpment,\nthereby blocking the road south-west from\nPinlebu. The remainder of the Brigade crossed\nthe Chindwin and followed up this advance,\noperating in the gap between 2 British and 19\nIndian Divisions. It was transferred back to 33\nCorps on the 26th December.\n\n38. 19 Indian Division (Major-General T. W.\nRees) advanced from the Sittaung bridgehead,\nthrough Wuntho. 62 Brigade, advancing\nrapidly from the bridgehead, occupied Pinlebu\non the 17th December after overcoming some\nopposition along the escarpment nine miles\nwest-south-west of Pinlebu. Wuntho, on the\nMyitkyina-Mandalay railway, was reached on\nthe 19th, and Kawlin on the 20th December.\nFurther north, 64: Brigade, passing through\nPinbon on the 15th December, made a rapid\nadvance of over 60 miles in seven days and\noccupied Banmauk on the 17th, making con-\ntact with 36 British Division and thus estab-\nlishing a continuous front with Northern Com-\nbat Area Command. After concentrating about\nWuntho, 62 and 64 Brigades conformed with\nthe main southerly axis of advance, and, by\nthe 23rd, they reached Kokkogon, 25 miles\nsouth-east of Wuntho.\n\n39. This advance of 192 miles in 20 days\nwas a wonderful achievement for troops who\nwere in action for the first time. Not only did\nthey overcome the scattered but desperate\nopposition of enemy rear parties, but they sur-\nmounted tremendous physical difficulties,\ncutting a road through steep, jungle-covered\nhills, and manhandiing their guns and vehicles\nover long distances. On one occasion, they\neven had to cantilever the track out on timber\nsupports round a cliff face. Two of the three\ncolumns were accompanied by their motor\nvehicles, though it was often necessary to winch\nthem up the hills. In spite of all these diffi-\nculties it is much to the credit of the R.E.M.E.\nmobile workshops that these two columns only\nlost 29 vehicles between them. This loss was\ncompensated by the addition to the divisional\nmotor transport of 47 broken down and aban-\ndoned Japanese vehicles which we successfully\nrepaired.\n\n40. On the 26th December, the Division\npassed under command of 33 Corps, with 62\nand 64 Brigades in contact with the retiring\nenemy on a 20 mile front. 64 Brigade pushed\non, smashing an enemy rearguard at Kanbalu\non the 2nd January, and, with 2 British Divi-\nsion, assisted in the capture of Shwebo on the\n10th January.\n\n41. 7 Indian Division (Major-General G. C.\nEvans, who had succeeded Major-General Mes-\nservy on the 12th December) which had been\nrehabilitating at Kohima, was now entering the\nforward zone. Its leading brigade relieved 98\nBrigade of 19 Indian Division, which had been\nemployed on road construction along the\nThanan-Tonhe track, in the middle of Decem-\nber. By the end of the month, 7 Indian Divi-\nsion was concentrating six miles south-west of\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON-GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nTamu, ready either to be flown in to the\nSchwebo area or to follow 19 Indian Division.\n\n42. 28 (East African) Brigade concentrated\nin December near Sunle on the Tamu-Kalewa\nroad. When the change of plan described in\nthe next section took place in the second half\nof December, this Brigade was ordered south\nup the Gangaw Valley, in rear of Lushai\nBrigade. By the end of December, it had\nreached Myintha, 29 miles north of Gangaw.\n\n43. On the Northern Combat Area Command\nfront in Northern Burma, 36 British Divi-\nsion had been advancing down the Railway\nCorridor. Following on the capture of Pinwe\non the 30th November (already mentioned in\npara. 23), Naba, Indaw and Katha were\noccupied in quick succession by the 10th\nDecember, and consolidation of the area pro-\nceeded without enemy interference. The situ-\nation at the end of the month was that 29\nBrigade was concentrating at Tigyaing on the\nIrrawaddy, while 72 Brigade had crossed the\nriver south of Katha and reached a point 25\nmiles south-west of Shwegu, on the south bank\nof the Shweli River. At this time 26 Indian\nBrigade joined 36 British Division and moved\nup to Indaw. Up till now, the Division had\ncomprised only the two British Brigades men-\ntioned above.\n\n44. Two regiments from 50 Chinese Division\nproceeded from behind 36 British Division and\ncrossed the Irrawaddy to concentrate at\nKontha, 24 miles south-east of Mawlu. By the\n30th December, one regiment had reached\nShwegu and the other a point 30 miles south-\neast of it. 5332 (United States) Brigade\n(“ Mars” Brigade) was operating over a\nwidely separated area from Bhamo to the south-\neast of Shwegu. 38 Chinese Division captured\nBhamo on the 15th December after a siege of\nfour weeks. The remnants of the Japanese\ngarrison, some 300 strong, succeeded in break-\ning out south of the town, but suffered severe\ncasualties in doing so. After mopping up in\nthe Bhamo area, 38 Chinese Division supported\n30 Chinese Division in the advance on\nNamhkam. On the 28th December, one regi-\nment crossed the Sino-Burmese frontier and\noccupied Loiwing (five miles north-north-east\nof Namhkam), together with its two all-\nweather airfields. .\n\n45. 30 Chinese Division met vigorous opposi-\ntion 20 miles north-west of Namhkam in its\ninitial advance down the Bhamo-Namhkam\nroad, but, with the assistance of 38 Chinese\nDivision and elements of Mars Brigade, it\nfought its way to within seven miles of\nNamhkam by the 31st December. The Japanese\nhad recently reinforced this front and it was\nevident that a determined effort was being made\nto check our advance in this area, to permit\nof the withdrawal of their 56 Division from\nWanting towards Hsenwi and Lashio.\n\n46. 22 Chinese Division, advancing south\nfrom the Bhamo area, occupied Siu, 48 miles\nto the south, on the 10th December, and cap-\ntured Tonkwa, seven miles to the south-west,\non the 12th against determined resistance. After\nthis, 22 Chinese Division was concentrated in\nthe general area of Sikaw, and began its fly-\nout to Kunming on the 22nd December.

This depletion of our strength\noccurred at a critical juncture. The magnitude\nof the air effort involved in the move can be\njudged ‘by the fact that between the 22nd and\n28th December alone the numbers transported\nwere 8,423 Chinese troops, 95 United States\npersonnel, four jeeps, 12 75-mm. guns and\n701 animals. This of coursé represented a very\nserious loss in lift by transport aircraft, which\nwould have been invaluable elsewhere on the\n‘ont.\n\n47. Nevertheless, when the original Phases\nof Operation “Capital” are consider, it\nwill be seen that the advance of Northern\nCombat Area Command was lagging behind\nthat of Fourteenth Army, which had com-\npleted Phase Two with great speed.\n\n48. Further east, elements of the Chinese\nExpeditionary Force made progress in Decem-\nber down the Lungling-Namhkam road, reach-\ning a point eight miles north-west of Wanting.\nThe Chinese Expeditionary Force was not, of\ncourse, under my command but their move-\nments at this time affected my operations.\n\n49. Finally, although the planning and\ndetails of the operations in Arakan are dealt\nwith in a later section of this part of the\nDespatch, the main events should be noted.\nOn the %h December, 81 (West African)\nDivision crossed the Kaladan River. On the\n15th December, Buthidaung fell to 82 (West\nAfrican) Division. In the coastal sector, the\nadvance of 25 Indian Division had been very\nrapid. On the 23rd December they reached\nDonbaik and on the 26th they were at Foul\nPoint looking across the water at Akyab\nIsland. Akyab itself was occupied on the\n3rd January.\n\nSection IV (paras. 50-69) THe READJUSTMENT\nOF PLANS IN DECEMBER\n\nThe diversion of resources to China and its\nadverse effects : The enemy’s dispositions : The\nx quality of Intelligence about the enemy :\nFourteenth Army’s plan for the battle of the\nMandalay Plain: Comments on the plan.\n\n50. ‘While operations for the completion of\nPhase II of Capital were thus, in December,\ngoing extremely well, other events had necessi-\ntated a considerable readjustment of plans for\nthe achievement of Phase [l[—the capture of\nthe Mandalay area ; and as these were the plans\nwhich resulted in the final destruction of the\nenemy forces in Burma, their development\ndeserves a full account.\n\n51. The first event which affected all our\nplans, imposed considerable delay on our sub-\nsequent advance, and had other serious effects,\nhad its origin in another theatre of war. Owing\nto the deterioration of the military situation in\nChina, General ‘Wedemeyer, Chief of Staff to\nGeneralissimo Chiang Kai Shek, had asked for\nthe transfer of troops from Burma to China.\nAs a result of orders received from the Chiefs\nof Staff at the beginning of December, the\nSupreme Allied Commander ordered me to\ntransfer 14 and 22 Chinese Divisions to China,\nand instructed the Allied Air C.-in-C. to lend\nthe necessary transport aircraft for their\nsupport. One Chinese Division was flown out\nfrom the Myitkyina area to China between the\n4th and 15th December and the second\n\n1891\n\nfollowed about a week later. This transfer\ninvolved some 1,300 Dakota sorties. This was\nserious enough, but on the 10th and 1ith\nDecember some 120 transport aircraft, 75 of\nwhich had already been allotted to Fourteenth\nArmy maintenance, were also removed to\nChina. These were in addition to the tem-\nporary diversion of aircraft for the fly-out of\nthe two Divisions mentioned above.\n\n52. Now it had been obvious that the\nrapidity of Fourteenth Army’s advance must\n‘become increasingly dependent on adequate air\nsupply, as our troops reached out into Central\nBurma and outran their land lines of com-\nmunication. This sudden and unexpected re-\nduction in transport aircraft therefore seriously\ncomplicated our already difficult administra-\ntive problem, thus inevitably hampering our\noperations. The loss of air-lift involved cur-\ntailed our freedom of action, and severely\nlimited the degree of exploitation which our\nforces were able to carry out. General Slim\ncalculated that Fourteenth Army’s operations\nwere retarded by at least two weeks. The\nJapanese thus gained valuable time in which\nto react to our moves. This, by itself, would\nhave been bad enough, but the weakening\nof Northern Combat Area Command by the\nloss of two Chinese divisions had another\nadverse effect on our strategy. I was now\nforced to accept a slower advance by Northern\nCombat Area Command. 36 British Division\nwas directed on Mongmit, one brigade to cross\nthe Irrawaddy at Tigyaing and the other at\nKantha. 50 Chinese Division was directed to\nrelieve 22 Chinese Division in the Siu area\nand advance towards Lashio, their initial ob-\njective being Namtu. 30 and 38 Chinese\nDivisions were ordered to advance on the axis\nNamhkam-Lashio, the latter to support the\nformer by ow ing operations. The Mars\nBrigade, directed initially on Mongwi, was to\nform the link between 36 British Division and\n50 Chinese Division, operating in the gap be-\ntween them. General Sultan, with whom I\ndiscussed the above plan, was convinced that\nthe Japanese would fight hard for the Burma\nRoad and anticipated a long and severe battle\nfor Lashio and Namhkam. He considered that\nthe enemy’s resistance on this front would be\nunaffected even iby the capture of Mandalay,\nsince the Japanese troops could still be main-\ntained by the direct route from Indo-China.\n\n53. On the other hand, my principal prob-\nJem was to ensure that Northern Combat Area\nCommand continued to contain all the Japanese\nforces opposing it. This could only be done by\nmaintaining the strongest pressure, but I was\nnow being forced to accept a weakening of this\npressure. Northern Combat Area Command\nnever fully recovered from this depletion of\nits strength. The advance lost its momentum,\nthereby releasing further enemy troops for\noperations against Fourteenth Army. Prin-\ncipally owing to the loss of aircraft, Fourteenth\nArmy’s lower crossing of the Irrawaddy\nactually took place about 14 days later than\nthe planned date. This meant that 19 Indian\nDivision, which had crossed the Irrawaddy\nnorth of Mandalay, had to hold on in their\nbridgehead against a greater concentration of\nenemy for 14 days longer than was originally\nexpected. The result was that the Division\nbecame involved in very bitter fighting and\nsuffered severe casualties. I have given some\n",

General Slim’s plan of concentrating the\n\nwhole Fourteenth Army in the loop of the\nChindwin and Irrawaddy, as given in para-\ngraph 32, was based on the belief that the\nJapanese would fight to cover Mandalay and\nthe Shwebo airfields ; that is, that they would\nstand west and north of the river. About mid-\nDecember, however, it became apparent that\nthe enemy was not going to do so and was\nwithdrawing his main forces southwards. It is\ntherefore worth while reviewing the enemy’s\nsituation at this stage.\n_ 55, At the end of November, the enemy’s\nalignment was as I have described in para-\ngraph 22. By the 3rd December, however,\nwe had cross the Chindwin at three points\nand held bridgeheads at Sittaung, Mawlaik and\nKalewa. The Japanese, of necessity, had con-\nformed to the advance of Fourteenth\nArmy and Northern Combat Area Com-\nmand by withdrawing southwards. The enemy\nsituation on the 7th December was that 33\nJapanese Division held from Gangaw to the\nnorth of Kalewa, with 15 Japanese Division\non its right extended up to the railway above\nWuntho. 31 Japanese Division remained in\nthe Ye-U area, while 53 Japanese Division\nfilled the ‘gap between Wuntho and the Irra-\nwaddy, with 18 Japanese Division on. its right\nup to the Bhamo-Namhkam road. 56 Japanese\nDivision held between Namhkam and the\nSalween River. 2 Japanese Division had been\nwithdrawn from this front and was believed to\nbe in reserve in Central Burma in. the vicinity\nof Pyinmana. Further south, 49 Japanese\nDivision remained in the Pegu area.\n\n56. By mid-December, the results of our\npolicy of applying continuous pressure over a\nbroad front began to be apparent. The enemy\nappeared to be readjusting his dispositions as\nfollows. In 15 Army’s sector, in the north, 53\nJapanese Division was crossing the river’ and\n\npositions east of the river; 15\nJapanese Division was also withdrawing across\nthe river into the Mandalay area. 31 Japanese\nDivision was withdrawing from the Ye-U area\ninto the strong natural bridgehead, west of the\nIrrawaddy, formed by the Sagaing Hills, while\n33 Japanese Division was apparently pulling\nback to a line running west-south-west from\nMyinmu to Pauk, in prolongation of the line\nto be held by 31 Division. Pauk was the junc-\ntion of 15 Army with 28 Army, which con-\ntrolled the Irrawaddy Valley. It was known\nthat 28 Army was building up a strong force\nin the Yenangyaung oilfields area comprising\none Independent Mixed Brigade, a part of 49\nJapanese Division, and a considerable force of\nLN.A. troops.\n\n57. The following points will be noted about\nthis new positioning of the Japanese forces.\nOnce the enemy had decided not to fight on\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nthe line of the escarpment running through\nPinlebu and Pyingaing he had virtually lost\nthe battle for the “dry belt” of Central\nBurma. The line of the escarpment represented\nthe last opportunity he had of compelling us\nto fight him on a narrow front and on some-\nthing approaching level terms. From this line\nonwards the country opened out and our\nsuperiority in mobility, firepower and armour.\nwould increasingly assert itself. There would\nbe two divisions (the 53rd and 15th) disposed:\nin depth east of the Irrawaddy, protecting\nMandalay from the north, with their left flank\nprotected by the river. The Sagaing Hills\nposition (31 Division), which the Japanese\nhad been preparing for some time, would deny\nus observation across the river and provide\nan outlet for counter-attack. Also, in con-\njunction with 33 Japanese Division further\nwest, it would cover any reserve formations\nwhich the enemy might bring up south and\neast of the Irrawaddy.\n\n58. The main reasons which compelled the\nenemy to make this alteration in his.plans were\nprobably three in number. :\n\nFirst, helped by our air superiority we had\nsprung a strategical surprise upon him by the\nspeed with which we had got strong forces’\nacross the Chindwin.\n\nSecondly, the troops (15 and 33 Divisions),\nwith which he had intended to hold a cover-\ning line, had been given no respite during the\nmonsoon and were thus no longer in a con-\ndition seriously to impede our offensive. Re-\nsistance to our entry into the Shwebo plain\nwas crumbling before our rapid advance. We\nwere now learning gradually just how badly\ndamaged some of the enemy formations were\nfrom their earlier defeat.\n\nThirdly, the time and space factor would\nnot allow the enemy to bring his reserve troops\nup from the south. Not only was he short\nof transport,, but, -lacking air supremacy, his\nmovements by day were restricted, and his\nlines of communication damaged by bombing.\n\n59. At this point I would like to draw atten-\ntion to a factor which will re-appear from\ntime to time in this Despatch, and that is the\npoorness both in quantity and quality of Intelli-\ngence about the enemy in the Burma theatre. I\nfound that, compared with the African and\nEuropean theatres, the information which we,\nreceived about the enemy from all sources was\nvery bad, and we were often virtually fighting\nin‘the dark. Although there was a large num-\nber of special and guerrilla organizations, full\nbenefit was not obtained from these sources\nowing to overlapping and the differing channels\nby which they reported. Very often little\nmore operational Intelligence was available\nthan was obtained from forward troops. I was\nvery keen to improve this state of affairs as it\nmade planning extremely difficult, and it did\ngrow better somewhat later on.\n\n60. General Slim had at once appreciated\nthat the Japanese had now no intention of\nseriously defending the Shwebo Plain, and that\nthe enemy’s covering forces were virtually\nevacuating the river loop, while the main forces\nwould be grouped in depth, protected by the\ngreat river obstacle. It appeared that the\nJapanese intended to fight for Mandalay and\non the line of the Irrawaddy, but it must be\nremembered that, at this stage, reports only\n",

There was still doubt as to whether\nthey meant to make a main stand on these\npositions, or merely to delay us on. this line.\nOne report received on the 16th December\ndefinitely stated that the enemy would not hold\nMandalay, but would continue withdrawal\nsouthwards. This was a contingency which had\nto be borne in mind. If the enemy had stood\nto fight north and west of the Irrawaddy, it\nwas General Slim’s plan to destroy him there.\nBut he had always had in his mind an alterna-\ntive plan which he could employ if the enemy\ndecided—as he did in fact—to fight east of\nthe river. The time had now come to put\nthis alternative into action.\n\n61. The essence of the new plan was a re-\ngrouping and redirection of the two Corps. 33\nCorps, consisting of 2 British Division, 19 and\n20 Indian Divisions, 268 Indian Infantry\nBrigade and 254 Indian Tank Brigade, was\ndirected to capture the area Monywa-Mandalay,\nthus holding the Japanese forces by frontal\nattack. 4 Corps, consisting of 7 and 17 Indian\nDivisions, 28 (East African) Brigade and 255\nIndian Tank Brigade, was to be switched from\nthe left of the Army to the right flank, and,\nthrusting down the Gangaw valley, was to seize\na bridgehead at Pakokku and capture the com-\nmunications centre of Meiktila. It was this\nblow at his most vital point that was to be\nthe basis of the enemy’s destruction, and it\nwas hoped he would not realise its significance\nuntil too late.\n\nBy cutting the enemy’s L. of C. at Meiktila,\na main frontal attack across the Irrawaddy\nwould be avoided, the escape route cut, and,\nby isolating the northern flank of the Japanese\nArmy, the enemy would be forced to give\nbattle in the Mandalay Plain. 19 Indian\nDivision, transferred to 33 Corps under the\nregrouping plan, would play an important part.\nCrossing the Irrawaddy, it would threaten\nMandalay from the north prior to 4 Corps’\nthrust at Meiktila. This, it was hoped, would\nconcentrate the enemy’s attention on Mandalay\nand maintain his main forces in the northern\nsector. Subsequent exploitation was to be by\n33 Conps down the Mandalay-Rangoon railway\naxis and by 4 Corps down the Irrawaddy\nValley.\n\n62. On the 19th December, the above plan\n‘was embodied in an Operation Instruction\n' issued to the Commanders of 4 and 33 Corps.\nIn it the Army Commander stated that it was\nhis intention to exploit the rapidity of the\nenemy’s withdrawal to the utmost, and, in con-\njunction with Northern Combat Area Com-\nmand, to destroy the Japanese forces in\n‘Burma, to advance rapidly to the general line\nHenzada-Nyaunglebin, and to seize any pos-\nsibility that might offer of capturing a South\nBurma port.\n\n63. To achieve this object, formations were\n‘to regroup not later than 0001 hours on the\n“26th December as follows :—\n\n2 British Division\n19 Indian Division (ex 4 Corps)\n33 Corps J 20 Indian Division\n. TPS 268 Indian Infantry Brigade\n(ex 4 Corps)\n254 Indian Tank Brigade\n\n1893\n\n7 Indian Division\n17 Indian Division (when available,\nexpected the Ist February)\nLushai Brigade (ex 33 Corps)\n255 Indian Tank Brigade (ex Army\nreserve)\n\n11 Cavalry\n\n28 (East African) Brigade (ex Army\n| reserve) '\n\nNore.—The above redistribution left 5\nIndian Division, which had been withdrawn\nto rest in the Kohima area, in Army reserve.\n17 Indian Division, allotted to 4 Corps, was\nstill in India, but would be available for\nexploitation. The organization of these two\nDivisions was being changed ; in each of them\ntwo brigade groups were being motorised,\nand one brigade group made air-transportable.\n\nA.L.F.S.E.A. reserve (in India) consisted of 23\nIndian Division, but it would be joined by\n11 Cast African) Division (already withdrawn)\nand Lushai Brigade (about to be withdrawn).\n\n64. The tasks allotted to 33 Corps were:—\n(@ To capture or construct airfields in the\nYe-U—Shwebo areas.\n(6) To capture Monywa.\n(c) To capture Mandalay.\n(d) To be prepared to advance on the\ngeneral axis Mandalay-Nyaunglebin.\nNorte.—Up to this date, 33 Corps had been\nacting on an Instruction issued on the 1st Octo-\nber which directed them to advance eastwards\nand capture the Ye-U area, with the object of\nestablishing airstrips.\n\n65. The tasks allotted to 4 Corps were: —\n\n(a) To capture Pakokku.\n\n(b) To seize a bridgehead across the\nIrrawaddy.\n\n(c) To capture Meiktila and the Meiktila\ngroup of airfields.\n\n(@) To be prepared to advance southwards\non the general axis Myingyan-Henzada.\nNote.—The previous Instruction to 4 Corps,\n\ndated the 7th December, directed its concen-\ntration in the Ye-U—Shwebo area by the 15th\nFebruary at the latest (see paragraph 32).\n\n66. This Instruction also laid down that the\nKalemyo-Gangaw-Pakokku road would becon-\nstructed to a standard sufficient only to pass\n4 Corps through, and that it would not be\nmaintained thereafter. The Kalewa—Ye-U—\nShwebo road was to be constructed to a fair-\nweather standard only, since time and the\navailable engineer and transport resources\nwould allow no more.\n\nWith regard to administration, the alloca-\ntion of air supply lift was laid down (1 shall\nrefer later in this Despatch to the actual ton-\nnage allotments), and the following important\ninstructions were given :—\n\n{a) Temporary airstrips were to be con-\nstructed every 50 miles, capable of taking\nC-46 aircraft.\n\n{b) Formations, when beyond maintenance\ndistance from Indianggyi, were to move by\nmarch route, owing to the shortage of avail-\nable air-lift and the consequent need for the\nmaximum economy in motor fuel.\n\n(©) The potentialities of the Chindwin\nRiver as a supply-carrying L. of C. were to\nbe exploited to the utmost, since we were\nnot able to construct an all-weather road\nroute from Kalewa to Shwebo.\n\n4 Corps\n",

First, a wide,\nbut converging, advance was being made\nagainst a retreating enemy—a strategy which\nis bound to discover weak points in his dis-\npositions. Secondly, the significance of the\nswitch of 4 Corps from the left to the right\nflank ; this switch, with its object the creation\nof a surprise thrust over the Irrawaddy in the\nneighbourhood of Pakokku, and then the\nseizure of the Meiktila airfields by a sudden\narmoured assault, reinforced by  air-\ntransported troops, was the key of the whole\nbattle plan. Secrecy was therefore of para-\nmount importance. The advance of 4 Corps\nwas to be led by 28 (East African) Brigade\nto give the impression that 11 (East African)\nDivision was again in the line under command\nof 33 Corps, and that 4 Corps was still operat-\ning north of Mandalay. Whereas, in point of\nfact, 11 (East African) Division and 5 Indian\nDivision had both been withdrawn for rest and\ntefitting after the capture of Kalewa. We cal-\nculated that, by bringing the enemy to battle\nin the Mandalay plain, we should be able to\ndefeat his northern wing in detail and thus\nhave an open corridor for a rapid advance to-\nwards Rangoon, since at last we would be\noperating in country suitable for the employ-\nment of armoured and mechanised forces.\nThirdly, the boldness of the plan should be\nnoted. Not only were we taking considerable\n(but calculated) administrative risks, but the\nwhole essence of the operation lay in decep-\ntion and speed. Two divisions and a\nbrigade had to move down the Gangaw Valley\nfor 320 miles making their own roads, establish\na bridgehead, and then make a mechanised\ndash on Meiktila. It would not, of course,\nbe possible to conceal our movements from the\nenemy ; however many ingenious devices were\noperated by Fourteenth Army, to persuade the\nenemy that 4 Corps was still concentrating on\nthe left of 33 Corps and that any movement\nin the Gangaw Valley was merely a demon-\nstration by a small force to distract his atten-\ntion from our main thrust toward Mandalay.\nFurther deception measures were also designed\nto tie down enemy forces which might other-\nwise be moved up from South Burma. Finally,\nI draw attention to the selection of Meiktila\nas an objective. It was the focal point of ail\nJapanese communications to their 15 Army,\nand their chief airfield centre. The manner\nin which the enemy reacted to its seizure\naffords sufficient proof of the value they\nattached to it.\n\n68. There is one other point I would like\nto mention at this stage. Ever since its forma-\ntion in 1942, Fourteenth Army had been\noperating in jungle-clad mountains. It was\nnow entering flat, open country, where\nmechanisation would have full scope, and\nspeed, mobility and dash would have to re-\nplace the slow and cautious tactics imposed by\nenclosed terrain. As much training as circum-\nstances allowed was garried out to meet these\nchanged conditions. The results achieved bear\nwitness to the skill, energy and versatility of\nboth Commanders and men.\n\n69. For the accomplishment of these plans,\nand particularly for the exploitation which\ntheir success would make possible, one thing\nespecially was required and that one thing we\n\nSUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951-\n\nhad not got—a sufficiency of transport aircraft.\nI continued to press the point, and finally, early\nin January, the Supreme Allied Commander\nsent his Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General\nF. A. M. (later Sir Frederick) Browning back\nto the United Kingdom to put the case person-\nally before the Chiefs of Staff, and point out\nhow great was the prize at stake. This had the\ndesired effect, as on the 26th January, the\nSupreme Allied Commander received a signal\nsaying that the transport aircraft would not\nonly be made up but increased. Besides the\ntwo Combat Cargo squadrons which it had\nalready been agreed would be returned from\nChina by the Ist February, two R.A.F, Dakota\nsquadrons would be made available, one being\non loan, from Ist March. In addition, it was\nproposed to raise the aircraft establishment of\nali R.A.F. transport squadrons in the theatre.\nThus, by March, our estimated essential re-\nquirements in air-lift were going to be met in\n\nSECTION V (paras. 70-91) THE IRRAWADDY\nCROSSINGS.\n\nThe establishment of 19 Indian Division’s\nbridgeheads: The advance of 33 Corps up to\nthe river: The bringing forward of 17 Indian\nDivision: The plans for the crossings: Opera-\n‘tions in 19 Indian Division’s bridgehead: The\nfour main crossings described: Progress by\nNorthern Combat Area Command.\n\n70. I will now resume the narrative of opera-\ntions from the point reached at the end of Sec-\ntion TII. While 64 Brigade of 19 Indian Divi-\nsion was engaged at Shwebo, the other two\nbrigades were switched eastwards, via Myemun\nand Kinu, to the Irrawaddy. Destroying all\ntesistance in their path and relying on speed\nto achieve surprise, they rushed the river and\neffected two crossings. 98 Brigade established\na bridgehead at Thabeikkyin, 28 miles north-\neast of Shwebo, on the 9th January, after\novercoming enemy defence in the village; 62\nBrigade followed suit at Kyaukmyaung, due\neast of Shwebo, on the 16th. The river at\nThabeikkyin runs between steep rock banks,\njungle-covered almost to the water’s edge. It\nis only about 500 yards wide, but is swift and\ndeep. Concentrated i harassing fire\nrendered raft assembly difficult by night and\nimpossible by day, but our crossing at this point\n\n, was evidently unexpected and the enemy in-\nfantry build-up was slow. At Kyaukmyaung,\nthe river is some 800 yards wide ; the current\nis not strong, but shifting sandbanks caused\ndifficulties. The terrain on both banks is flat\nand covered by scrub, except for open cultiva-\ntion round the village itself. The leading troops\nof 62 Brigade actually reached the river on\nthe 12th January, but enemy rear parties\nbetween Onbauk and Kyaukmyaung had to be\ncleared, and engineer equipment brought for-\nward. The first crossing was made on the night\n16th-17th January. As at Thabeikkyin, the\nenemy kept up a steady harassing fire with guns\nand mortars, but again we were allowed time\nto strengthen our bridgehead before any in-\nfantry or tank counter-attacks developed.\n\n71. During the period of the above cross-\nings, 64 Brigade concentrated at Onbauk, ready\nto reinforce 62 Brigade. Meanwhile 2 British\n",

On the right flank, 20 Indian\nDivision, advancing from Maukkadaw across\ndifficult country, captured Budalin on the 10th\nJanuary, after four days of the most bitter\nfighting. A week later, they were within five\nmiles of Monywa, which, despite our bombing,\nstill functioned as the chief Japanese river port\non the Chindwin.\n\n72. In the new 4 Corps sector, Lushai\nBrigade crowned its splendid fighting career by\ncapturing Gangaw on the 12th January after\na month’s serious fighting. The village itself\nwas entered unopposed after the enemy posi-\ntions covering it had been stormed with the aid\nof heavy air support. 28 (East African) Brigade\n(Brigadier T. H. §. Galletly) then relieved\nLushai Brigade, which was flown out later to\nIndia for rest and refit. While the above opera-\ntions were in progress, 7 Indian Division had\nbegun its advance south. By the 7th January,\nit had reached Natchaung, some 12 miles south\nof Kalemyo and a hundred miles from its\nconcentration area at Tamu. It was being\nfollowed by 255 Indian Tank Brigade, which\non this date (7th January) was concentrated\n72 miles south of Tamu. The steady advance\nsouthwards on this front was maintained.\nEnemy resistance in the Tilin area was quickly\novercome and Tilin itself occupied by 28 (East\nAfrican) Brigade on the 22nd January, by\nwhich date Headquarters, 4 Corps, had opened\nat Kan.\n\n73. The passage of 4 Corps south to\nPakokku presented considerable engineer prob-\nlems. There was an unmetalled track of sorts\nfrom Kalemyo to Pakokku, but it required\nwidening throughout its length and much\nbridging. The only difficult sections were some\nrocky hill stretches amounting in all to about\n40 miles. The main problems were, first, to\nwork on a narrow road without impeding the\ncontinuous stream of traffic which flowed\nthroughout the 24 hours and, secondly, the\nmovement of engineer units and equipment\nforward in the limited amount of transport that\nwas available, and their maintenance.\ngeneral the plan adopted was that the divi-\nsional engineers worked forward bringing the\ntrack up to a standard to carry three-tonners\nand Corps engineers followed making it pas-\nsable for heavy lorries and transporters, includ-\ning construction of the water crossings.\nAlthough the policy was that this road would\nbe abandoned after the passage of 4 Corps’ it\nwas in fact kept open as a subsidiary L. of C.\nuntil the Inland Water Transport link from\nKalewa to Myingyan was in operation.\nNevertheless it was a rough passage to travel\nby this route and drivers who had experienced\nthe Kabaw Valley during the monsoon were\nunanimously of the opinion that they would\nrather drive through two feet of mud than\nthree feet of dust. The latter, between Tilin\n\n* and Pauk, on occasions proved to be a barrier\neven to the usually ubiquitous jeep. It is worth\nremarking, none the less, that the original plan\nof moving 4 Corps up over the route taken\nby 19 Indian Division would have been far\nmore difficult and, with the engineer resources\nat our disposal, would have probably been\nimpracticable.\n\n74.7 Yndian Division was not to be\nthwarted by any of the difficulties described\n\n1895\n\nabove. While work on the road was in pro-\ngress, 89 Brigade, operating in two columns,\nexecuted a skilful flanking movement through\nthe hills, which forced the enemy to vacate\ntheir strong positions covering Pauk on the\n27th January. By the 3ist January, 7 Indian\nDivision was seven miles east of Pyinchaung,\nafter forcing the double crossing of the Yaw\nChaung against unexpectedly light opposition.\n28 (East African) Brigade was operating to the\nsouth, covering the right flank of the Corps.\n75. On the 8th February, the joint Four-\nteenth Army/221 Group R.A.F. Headquarters\nopened at Monywa. This now included the\nRear Headquarters, 221 Group, which had been\nleft behind at Imphal when Army Headquar-\nters moved forward, only a small operations\nstaff then accompanying the Army Head-\nquarters. 221 Group Headquarters, under Air\nVice-Marshal §. F. Vincent, and Headquarters\nFourteenth Army maintained a joint Head-\nquarters for the remainder of the campaign.\n\n76. It was now becoming operationally essen-\ntial to bring up more formations. To do so\ninvolved administrative risk, but we could now\nlook forward to some improvement in the\ntransport aircraft situation after the 1st Febru-\nary and a further large improvement on the\nIst March. By the end of January, therefore,\n17 Indian Division was concentrated forward\nin the Gangaw Valley, together with 255\nIndian Tank Brigade, as already mentioned.\nI also told General Slim that he could bring\nforward 5 Indian Division, which had been\nreorganized like 17 Indian Division, when he\nrequired it.\n\n71, The distance between 19 Indian Divi-\nsion’s bridgehead at Thabeikkyin, to the\nprojected 4 Corps’ crossing in the vicinity of\nPakokku is some 160 miles. Between\nThabeikkyin and the other 19 Indian Divi-\nsional bridgehead at Kyaukmyaung—about 24\nmiles—the river flows through jungle-clad hills\nand is comparatively narrow, being some 500\nyards wide. From Kyaukmyaung downstream,\nthe country opens out and the width of the\nriver varies from 2,000 yards to 4,500 yards\nat its junction with the Chindwin (between\nMyingyan and Pakokku). The current in the\n\nry season is about two knots in the\n\nwider stretches, but navigation is obstructed\nby islands and sandbanks. Generally speaking,\nthe south bank dominates the northern\napproaches, but this does not apply to the loop,\nwhere the Sagaing Hills (which the Japanese\nwere careful to hold) on the north bank\ndominate not only the river to the east and\nsouth, but all approaches to it from the north.\nI would sum up my impressions of this wide\nand treacherous river by saying that I cannot\nimagine a more formidable military water\nobstacle.\n\n78. Our primary object in the north was to\ndivert attention from the projected 4 Corps”\ncrossing near Pakokku. To achieve this, the\nfirst crossings, as already stated, had been made\nby 19 Indian Division on the extreme left flank\nof Fourteenth Army. This, it was hoped,\ntogether with the deception measures we were\nemploying, would lead the enemy to appreciate.\nthat the rest of 4 Corps would follow 19 Indian\nDivision, and that our main effort from there\nwould be directed on Mandalay. This illusion\nwould be strengthened by the steady advance\nof 36 British Division from the north. The\n",

                                "value": "1896\n\nquestion now arose as to the priority of our\nfurther crossings. If the next crossing were\nagain to be effected by 33 Corps, it would\nfurther indicate that our main objective was\nMandalay. On the other hand, it was essen-\ntial that 4 Corps should secure their bridge-\nhead early, in order to allow sufficient time for\nthe mechanised force designed for the thrust on\nMeiktila to pass through it—an operation\nwhich, once he realised its significance, the\nenemy would strain every nerve to delay.\nGeneral Slim, therefore, decided that one divi-\nsion from each Corps should cross simul-\ntaneously: 20 Indian Division from 33 Corps\nand 7 Indian Division from 4 Corps. He con-\nsidered that even if the enemy regarded 4\nCorps’ crossing as the greater menace, he\nwould not be able to react in time to upset our\nplans in this sector, in view of the existing\nthreat to Mandalay and the pressure exerted\nby 33 Corps elsewhere.\n\n79. The Japanese were completely deceived\nby 19 Indian Division’s crossing. They\nbelieved, as we had intended they should, that\nthis Division was the advanced guard of\n4 Corps and they decided to exterminate it\nbefore its two bridgeheads could be consoli-\ndated. I had hoped, when I had originally\ndirected 19 Indian Division on to Indaw in\nthe “ railway corridor,” that Northern Combat\nArea Command would be able to exert suffi-\ncient pressure from the north that the Japanese\nwould be unable to concentrate in strength\nagainst the left flank of Fourteenth Army.\nUnfortunately, as I have already indicated, the\nsudden transfer of the two Chinese divisions\nto China had disrupted General Sultan’s plans,\nand temporarily halted Northern Combat Area\nCommand’s advance. This enabled the enemy\nto concentrate the bulk of his 15 and 53\nDivisions against the Kyaukmyaung bridge-\nhead, thereby pinning 19 Indian Division to\nthis restricted area for a much longer period\nthan would otherwise have been the case.\nMoreover, the Commander, 15 Japanese Army,\nwas able to support these two Divisions, not\nonly with the bulk of his Army artillery, but\nalso with batteries drawn from 31 and 33\nDivisions, and with tanks. Covered by what\nGeneral Slim described as “the heaviest\nartillery concentration our troops had yet\nendured,” the Japanese infantry hurled them-\nselves against our defence night after night,\nkeeping up their attacks for nearly a month.\nNot only did 19 Indian Division hold its\nground, but, despite heavy casualties, it\nactually expanded its bridgehead. Gradually,\nas their losses mounted, the enemy attacks lost\ntheir sting until it became apparent, even to\nthe Japanese, that we could not be dislodged.\n\nI wish to pay tribute to the gallantry and\ndetermination displayed by 19 Indian Division\nin this their first major encounter with the\nenemy. Although, like all troops new to battle,\nwhen opposed by veteran formations, they had\nto buy their experience, their firm stand at this\nStage against serious odds _ contributed\nmaterially to the success of our operations\nelsewhere. It is perhaps worthy of note that\nthis Division, except for a few small units,\nwas composed entirely of pre-war regular\ntroops.\n\n80. It may serve to clarify the picture of\nthis vital phase of operations if, before\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\ndescribing what occurred at each crossing-\nplace, I summarize the crossings which were\nmade. Four crossings of the Irrawaddy were\nundertaken. Briefly they were as follows :—\n\n(a) 19 Indian Division crossed north of\nMandalay at Thabeikkyin (9th January) and\nKyaukmyaung (16th January), as already\ndescribed. They then, as will be shown later,\nadvanced south on Mandalay, shifting their\nbridgehead south to Singu.\n\n(6) 20 Indian Division crossed neat\nAllagappa, west of Mandalay, in the Myinmu\narea, on the 12th February, with the object\nof advancing east along the south bank’ of\nthe river towards Mandalay.\n\n© Twelve days later (24th February),\n2 British Division crossed at Ngazun, a\nvillage between Mandalay and 20 Indian\nDivision’s bridgehead.\n\n(d) Meanwhile 4 Corps (7 and 17 Indian\nDivisions with 255 Indian Tank Brigade),\nwith Meiktila as its ultimate objective, had\nadvanced down the Gangaw Valley\ncrossed the Irrawaddy at Nyaungu, to the\nwest of Pakokku, between the 13th and\n19th February.\n\nIt will be noted that the Army Commander’s\ndecision that simultaneous crossings should be\nmade on both 33 and 4 Corps’ fronts was\nsuccessfully implemented ; 20 and 7 Indian\nDivisions crossed within 24 hours of each other.\n\nThe crossings will ‘be described in the order\nin which they took place.\n\n81. First I will deal with 20 Indian Division’s\nadvance to, and crossing of, the river. After\nthe capture of Budalin, 20 Indian Division con-\ntinued its advance with all three brigades up.\nOn the right, 32 Brigade, directed on Monywa,\nthere met with fanatical resistance. This\nimportant river port was captured on the 22nd\nJanuary after three days fierce fighting. In\nthe centre, 80 Brigade occupied Wadan, on\nthe Ayadaw-Monywa road, and pushed south-\nward. On the left, 100 Brigade, advancing\nfrom Ayadaw, made a lightning thrust at\nMyinmu, on the Irrawaddy, which fell on the\n22nd January after bitter hand-to-hand fight-\ning. An incident occurred here which illustrates\nthe Japanese mentality: a detachment pinned\nagainst the river, formed up and marched\nstraight into it, deliberately committing mass\nsuicide by drowning. For the capture of both\nMonywa and Myinmu we received magnificent\nair support. The next three weeks were spent\nby 20 Indian Division in closing up to the north\nbank of the Irrawaddy between the Mu and\nChindwin Rivers. The Japanese rear parties\nremaining on the north bank put up a stubborn\nresistance. While this area was being cleared,\nwe pushed patrols out across the river. These\noperated with the greatest daring, not only\nreporting on possible crossing places, but in\nthe words of the Army Commander, maintain-\ning “a reign of terror among the Japanese\nposts on the southem bank.” The enemy\nresponded by sending a small detachment\nround the left flank of 20 Indian Division ; this\ndetachment crossed the Mu River from the east\nbank, under an artillery concentration, and re-\ncaptured Nyaungyin, a village two miles east\nof Myinmu. They then split up into small\nharassing parties, which had to be hunted down\nand eliminated.\n",

The area finally selected for the crossing\nof 20 Indian Division was at the bend, south\nof the village of Allagappa. The river here\nis about 1,500 yards wide. and the current is\nstrong (three knots). High ground to the\nsouth-east gave the enemy observation over the\narea initially. Not being an ideal crossing-\nplace, it was only lightly defended. Moreover\nit was the junction of 31 and 33 Japanese\nDivisions, which, as was hoped, led to\nconfusion when we struck. The crossing\nwas made by 100 Brigade on the night\n12th-13th February, and, by the following\nnight, a bridgehead six miles wide by two miles\ndeep had. been developed. The success of this\noperation was in great measure due to the\ndiversionary attacks made elsewhere by 32\nBrigade which attracted troops away from the\nreal crossing. This crossing by 20 Indian\nDivision is also notable for the fact that it was\nsupported by the only Corps artillery concentra-\ntion attempted during the whole campaign.\nGenerally, the artillery’s réle was unspectacular\nbut it should not be thought for that reason\nthat it was unimportant. The often few guns\nin action, brought forward sometimes by\ntremendous effort, played a vital réle and\nCommanders repeatedly commented on the\neffectiveness of the fire support that was\nprovided.\n\nEarly on the 15th, hostile air action caused:\nconsiderable damage to our already scant river\ncrossing equipment, but the damaged boats were\nreplaced by ithe evening of the 17th. By the\n16th February, our bridgehead had been\nsufficiently extended to allow crossings to be\nmade in daylight.\n\n83. 4 Corps’ crossing, which I shall next\ndescribe, was a mode] of its kind. For some\nweeks before the actual crossing, widespread:\ndeception measures were instituted indicating:\nthat a misor operation was in progress down\nthe Gangaw Valley with the Yenangyaung oil-\nfields as its objective. Shortly before the cross-\ning, obvious preparations were made further\neast, towards Pakokku. The real crossing was\n\ntimed for the night 13th-14th February, At ~\n\ndawn on the 13th, 28 (East African) Brigade,\nwhich had been fighting its way down the Yaw\nChaung, suddenly appeared on the west bank\nof the Irrawaddy opposite Chauk, after\ncapturing Seikpyu. These feints were entirely\nsuccessful. The Japanese moved more troops\nto both Pakokku and Chauk, while, as will\nappear, we crossed practically unopposed at\nNyaungu roughly half-way between these two\nplaces.\n\n84. Nyaungu was selected as the crossing\nsite for two reasons. First, it was on the\nboundary between 15 and 28 Japanese Anmies\nand experience had shown that the enemy were\nnotoriously weak at tying-in at such points.\nSecondly, it was, for topographical reasons, the\nmost unsuitable place for a crossing, and, con-\nsequently, its defence had ibeen largely entrusted.\nto an “ Indian National Army ” division.\n\n85. Three crossing-places were selected. The\nlongest, a diagonal crossing of two and a half\nmiles, was to be made by the assault brigade\n(33 Brigade of 7 Indian Division). The other\ntwo were about 1,800 yards and 1,300 yards\nwide respectively. The current was about one\nand a half knots. This, combined with a\nSteady east wind (ie. with the current),\n\n60332\n\n1897\n\nrendered navigation between the islands and\nsandbanks difficult. The approaches on the\nwest bank were open and completely over-\nlooked from the steep 100-foot cliffs on the\nopposite side. No power craft were used for\nthe first assault wave. Paddling silently in the\ndarkness for over two miles, they landed at\nthe foot of the cliffs and gained the crest with-\nout a shot being fired. The second flight\nattempted the shorter crossing, using outboard\nmotors, but were heavily fired on. The drivers -\nwere killed or wounded and the attempt\nfailed. By this time, however, troops of the\nfirst wave had established a small bridgehead\nand they were immediately reinforced by the\nrest of 33 Brigade and a detachment of tanks,\nwhich crossed in broad daylight practically\nunopposed. The Divisional Commander’s\nselection of the crossing site had been justified.\n\n86. 33 Brigade captured Pagan on the 15th\nFebruary. The build-up in the bridgehead con-\ntinued. On the west bank 114 Brigade entered\nPakokku on the 18th after overcoming strong\nopposition to the west of it. It then started\nto clear the large island which lies off Pakokku.\nBy this time (20th February), the Japanese\nwere attacking the bridgehead from the south,\nbut prisoners stated that our crossing was\nregarded merely as a diversion. 28 (East\nAfrican) Brigade were also heavily counter-\nattacked in Seikpyu area on the 16th. They\nregrouped at Gwebin, but were again severely\nattacked on the 20th and withdrew to Letse.\nHere the threat to our right flank was held.\nIt was evident that the enemy still continued\nto regard the feints which had been made on\nboth sides of Nyaungu as a greater menace than\nthe real crossing, despite our build-up in the\nbridgehead.\n\n87. While 7 Indian Division was operating\non and across the river, the other division of\n4 Conps, 17 Indian Division (Major-General\nD. T. Cowan), was closing up ready to cross,\nleaving its air-transportable brigade (99\nBrigade) at Palel ready to fly in. By the 22nd\nFebruary, two brigades of 17 Indian Division\nand 255 Indian Tank Brigade had actually\ncrossed into the bridgehead. 5 Indian Division\n(Major-General E. C. Mansergh) who had\ntaken over the Division after the death of\nMajor-General D, F. W. Warren in an aero-\nplane crash) less its air-transportable brigade\n(99 Brigade), was, during this period, also be-\ning brought forward. It was directed on\nNyaungu, via the Kabaw Valley, Ye-U and\nMonywa. The intention was that this forma-\ntion should assist 17 Indian Division in the\nMeiktila area and, also, exploit southwards.\n\n88. Back in 33 Corps’ sector, the last cross-\ning of the Irrawaddy was made by 2 British\nDivision at Ngazun, some 10 miles to the east\nof 20 Indian Division’s bridgehead, on the night\n2Ath-25th February. The river here contains\nmany large sandbanks and shifting shoals and\nvaries in width between 1,000 and 1,500 yards.\nThe current is considerable (two and a half\nknots). It was originally hoped to cross further\nto the east, but reconnaissance showed that\n‘beach obstacles had been erected, and defences\nmanned, in all suitable areas. It was planned\nto land on three beaches simultaneously :\nBeaches A and B lay some two miles and one\nmile respectively west of Ngazun Village, and\nC Beach on the large island north of the\nvillage, which it was necessary to secure since\n\nB\n",

The crossings had to\nbe made diagonally to avoid sandbanks, thus\nlengthening the time the boats were exposed\nto view and, unfortunately, the moon was\nnearly full. The first assault wave on to\nNgazun Island (C Beach) was fired on, but\nabout one company touched town and charged\nthrough the enemy positions. The supporting\nwave, however, failed to land and the enemy\nheld their ground, pinning the first wave’s\nboats to the beach by their fire and preventing\ntheir return. The assault on A Beach met\nheavy fire from artillery, mortars and infantry.\nMany boats were sunk and the assault had to\nbe abandoned. The situation was serious and\nit looked as if the crossing might fail, but\nthere remained B Beach. Here the Ist\nBattalion, The Queens’ Own Cameron High-\nlanders, who had the longest crossing to make,\nalso encountered heavy fire but they effected\na gallant landing, storming up the steep 30-\nfoot bank and establishing a bridgehead.\nAgain, however, no boats got back.\n\n89, What followed was an outstanding feat\nof control, staff work and discipline. It was,\nobviously, essential to reinforce with infantry\nthe bridgehead on B Beach at once, but this\nentailed a complete change of plan. The pos-\nsibility of partial failure had been foreseen and\nan alternative plan had been prepared, but the\nfact that it was rapidly and successfully\nexecuted in darkness—the moon had set—\ndespite the inevitable confusion of the initial\nfailures, and despite the shortage of equipment,\nmany craft not having returned, reflects great\ncredit on all concerned, from the Divisional\nCommander (Major-General C. G. G. Nichol-\nson) downwards.\n\nBy first light on the 25th February, two\nbattalions of 5 Brigade were established com-\nplete on the south bank and one battalion of\n6 Brigade complete on Ngazun Island. By the\n26th the whole of both 5 and 6 Brigades were\nover, together with a squadron of tanks, and\non this date Ngazun Village was captured.\nOn the 27th February, the bridgehead had been\nextended to a depth of five miles and 4 Brigade\nhad begun to cross, after being relieved in the\nOndaw area by 268 Indian Infantry Brigade.\n268 Indian Infantry Brigade had taken over\nthe Sagaing area to enable 2 British Division to\nconcentrate on their crossing, and were respon-\nsible for the open flank between 19 Indian\nDivision and 2 British Division. Our troops\nreceived strong air support throughout these\noperations : Ngazun was only captured after it\nhad been set on fire by the Royal Air Force.\n\n90. I would like to emphasise here the mag-\nnitude of Fourteenth Army’s achievement in\ncrossing this great river obstacle, in the face\nof a brave and determined enemy and with a\nminimum of modern equipment. It is worth\nconsidering that the Irrawaddy is four times\nas wide as the Rhine, while the Japanese\nsoldier in well prepared positions is no less\nformidable than the German. It is the greatest\ntribute to the Commander, officers and men\nof Fourteenth Army that such a hazardous and\nexacting operation was crowned with success.\nBy the end of February, four divisions and a\ntank brigade were firmly established on the\nleft bank of the river.\n\nSUPPLEMENT to rHE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\n91. Before going on to the next phase of\noperations and the Japanese reactions to our\ncrossings, which are described in the next sec-\ntion, I will draw attention to the progress made\nin Northern Burma on the Northern Combat\nArea Command front since my last mention of\nit (paragraphs 43-47). Nambkam fell to 30\nChinese Division on the 15th January. 38\nChinese Division entered the village of Muse\non the 22nd, linking up with the Chinese\nExpeditionary Force which had just captured\nWanting, thus reopening a through route from\nBurma to China. The American “Mars”\nBrigade were operating in the area 30 miles\nnorth-west of Hsenwi, into which 56 Japanese\nDivision from the ‘Wanting area was with-\ndrawing. The main body of 36 British Division\n(26 and 72 Brigades) was advancing south on\nMongmit and, at the end of January, it had\nteached a point on the Shweli River 18 miles\nto the north of that place. One detached\nbrigade (29 Brigade) of this Division had made\nconsiderable progress down the east bank of\nthe Irrawaddy, capturing Twinnge, 15 miles\nnorth of 19 Indian Division’s bridgehead at\nThabeikkyin on the 24th January. It then\nturned due east along the main road to\nMongmit.\n\nSEcTION VI (paras. 92-101) THe SITUATION IN\nFEBRUARY\n\nA.L.F.S.E.A, Operation Instruction of the\n27th February, 1945: The change in scope of\nthe Burma operations: The Japanese plans for\na counter-offensive: Operations to enlarge our\nbridgeheads: The Northern Combat Area\nCommand front.\n\n92. Directly it became apparent that our\ncrossings of the Irrawaddy had succeeded over\na wide front, I issued, on the 27th February,\nan Operation Instruction to General Slim,\nGeneral Sultan and General Christison in order\nto co-ordinate operations in the immediate\nfuture. Jt will be remembered that on the\n26th January, the Chiefs of Staff had promised\nto increase our transport aircraft to meet our\nessential requirements by the Ist March. ‘With\nthis in mind, I instructed Fourteenth Army to\ndestroy the Japanese forces in the Mandalay\narea and to capture Rangoon before the\nmonsoon. Northern Combat Area Command\nwere directed to seize the general area\nKyaukme—Lashio and then to turn south-west\nand co-operate in the Mandalay area battle.\nAfter this they were to exploit out towards\nLoilem. 15 Indian Corps, whose tasks I had\nalready a month before extended to include\ndeveloping the air bases on Akyab and Ramree\nIslands for the supply of Fourteenth Army,\nand to operations as far south as Taungup,\nwere now directed, in general, to contain the\nmaximum number of enemy forces, particu-\nlarly by operating up the An and Taungup—\nProme routes. (These operations by 15 Indian\nCorps will be discussed in detail in a later part\nof this Despatch.) Since this Operation In-\nstruction contains my brief appreciation of the\nsituation at the time, I have attached a copy\nat Appendix A.\n\n93. It will be seen at once that the outline\nof operations given above represents a great\ndevelopment from the situation in November,\n1944. Then we were directing our efforts to\nenable us to launch a major expedition against\n",

Now we\nwere aiming at capturing Rangoon by land\nadvance from the north, an operation which\nfor long had been regarded as impracticable.\nThere were additional reasons for this change.\nAfter the Yalta Conference, the Chiefs of\nStaff had sent the Supreme Allied Commander\na new directive. This was not only influenced\nby the speed and success of our advance in\nBurma, and the opening of the Ledo/Burma\nRoad, but also by the general quickening of the\ntempo of tha American operations against\nJapan in the Pacific and in the Philippines.\nThe new directive ordered South-East Asia\nCommand to defeat the Japanese Army in\nBurma and capture Rangoon; thereafter to\nopen the Straits of Malacca and to capture\nSingapore. After the Chiefs of Staffs’ promise\nto give us the necessary transport aircraft, on\nthe 5th February I received a directive from\nthe Supreme Allied Commander ordering me\nto “seoure the Ledo/Burma Road, capture\nRangoon by ist June, 1945, and destroy the\nmain Japanese forces in Burma excluding the\nTenasserim.” In furtherance of the second half\nof his directive from the Chiefs of Staff, Ad-\nmifral Mountbatten decided to capture the\nisland of Phuket, as an air base and a station\nfor the assembly of naval landing craft, with\na target date in June 1945. This proposal was\nput up to the Chiefs of Staff on the 26th Febru-\nary, and received their general approval on the\n2nd March.\n\n94, 34 Indian Corps was formed for this\noperation. It had been obvious for some time\nthat if operations were to be extended beyond\nthe Burma theatre, additional formations\nwould be required, and in particular another\nCorps Headquarters. There was only one\nimmediate source of man-power, namely\nSpecial Force, until the redeployment of forces\nfrom Europe began. I therefore recommended\nthe immediate formation of a Corps Head-\nquarters and Corps Signals to plan and train\nfor future operations and, in February, the\nSupreme Allied Commander asked the Com-\nmander-in-Chief, India, to implement the\nformation of such a Headquarters from the\nassets becoming available from the disband-\nment of Special Force. By the end of\nFebruary, H.Q., 34 Indian Corps, had been\nestablished at Poona, becoming an assigned\nformation. Placed under its command were\n23 Indian Division, which was the General\nHeadquarters, India, reserve division, but\nwhich was released for my operations by\nGeneral Auchinleck ; 81 (West African) Divi-\nsion, which had just come out of the Kaladan,\nand 3 Commando Brigade, which had carried\nout highly successful operations at Akyab,\nMyebon and Kangaw with 15 Indian Corps.\nPlanning by 34 Indian Corps for the Phuket\noperation began in Delhi on the Ist March,\nunder Lieutenant-General O. L. Roberts, who\nwas appointed to the command of the Corps\nearly in March. (See also Sec. XVII)\n\n95. Returning to the operations in Central\nBurma, if the Japanese reactions to our suc-\ncessful crossings of the Irrawaddy are to be\nunderstood, it is necessary to look at their plans\nand the situation as it must have presented\nitself to them at the time. It had been the\nintention of the Commander of the Japanese\nBurma Army that the main battle should be\nfought on the banks of the Irrawaddy. By the\n\n60332\n\n1899\n\nsecond half of February it must have been\nclear that this battle was not going very well,\nbut the position did not yet seem irretrievable.\nAt that time 19 Indian Division had broken out\nof their bridgehead at Kyaukmyaung and\nbegun their advance on Mandalay (i refer later\nto these operations), but they had not yet\ncrossed the formidable Chaungmagyi Chaung,\nwhich most effectively bars the approach to\nMandalay from the north. 2 British Division\nhad only penetrated five miles inland from\nNgazun. 20 Indian Division were being bitterly\nattacked and were still confined to a narrow\nsemi-circle of ground. They had not yet\nlinked up with 2 British Division. 7 Indian\nDivision had already captured Pagan, but\nbelieving, as they did, that 4 Corps was still\noperating on the left of 33 Corps, the\nenemy regarded this crossing merely as a diver-\nsion which could be dealt with by the troops on\nthe spot. General Kimura therefore decided to\nrestore the generally adverse situation by a\ncounter-offensive. The main effort was to be\nby 15 Army, which, reinforced by most of\n18 Japanese Division, was to launch an offen-\nsive with 18 and 31 Divisions from Madaya\nand Sagaing towards Wetlet (on the Shwebo\nrailway line from Sagaing). On the right\nflank of this counter-offensive 33 Army, with\n56 Division and a regiment of 18 Division,\nwas to hold the areas round Lashio and\nNamtu, whilst on the left 28 Army was to\ndefend the Irrawaddy valley about the\nYenangyaung and Mount Popa areas and\nlaunch an offensive in the Pakokku area. The\nscale of the latter—it was to be made by a\ncomposite force of less than divisional strength\n—showed that the real threat in that area was\nnot yet appreciated. The general offensive\nwas to begin on the 10th March.\n\n96. This plan involved considerable move-\nments of formations, which, in view of the\nstate of the Japanese communications and our\nair superiority, were executed with remarkable\nspeed. Besides the move of 18 Japanese\nDivision (less a regiment) from opposite\nNorthern Combat Area Command to the\nMandalay area, the remainder of 49 Japanese\nDivision (less the two regiments already com-\nmitted on the Northern Combat Area Com-\nmand front and in the Yenangyaung area\nrespectively) together with a regiment of 55\nJapanese Division (from the Henzada-Bassein\narea) were ordered up south of Mandalay. In\naddition, a regiment of 2 Japanese Division,\ndestined for Siam, was stopped at Pegu and\ncounter-marched north. From the Arakan\nfrorit, 54 Japanese Division was ordered to con-\ncentrate north of Yenangyaung and to block\nthe An and Taungup-Prome roads with detach-\nments. This attempt at reinforcement from\nArakan by the Japanese must have been in the\nnature of a forlorn hope and reflects their lack\nof knowledge of the situation there. Thanks to\nthe energetic operations carried out by 15\nIndian Corps, very few troops reached the\nIrrawaddy from Arakan. In short, General\nKimura decided to abandon Arakan, weaken\nSouth Burma and reduce the forces holding\nthe Northern Combat Area Command front to\na minimum in order to concentrate his troops\nin the Mandalay sector which he regarded as\njhe vital one. As will be seen later, he was too\nate.\n\n:\n\nB2\n",

The bringing forward of 17 and 5 Indian\nDivisions, which had been made possible by\nthe increase in transport aircraft promised by\nthe Ist March (vide paragraphs 69 and 93), had\nraised the number of divisions in Fourteenth\nArmy to six. Had the Japanese redistribution\nof their forces, mentioned above, been effected\nin full, it would have meant that their total\nstrength opposed to Fourteenth Army would\nhave been increased by the equivalent of three\ndivisions, i.e., up to a total of eight divisions\n(less one regiment), excluding the two I.N.A.\ndivisions. In view of this disparity in forma-\ntions, General Slim asked that 36 British\nDivision should be placed under his command.\nI was, however, unable to accede to this\nrequest at this juncture (though I was in a posi-\ntion to do so later), both because it would have\nupset_the Northern Combat Area d\nplan and also because of administrative difficul-\nties connected with air supply. It will be\nremembered that I had already instructed\nGeneral Sultan to accelerate his advance and\nco-operate in the coming Mandalay battle\n(vide paragraph 92). But while, on paper, I\nhad apparently ordered six divisions to destroy\na force of nearly eight, there were several fac-\ntors, which have been mentioned before,\noperating in our favour. We were now\nbeginning to realise how far the state of the\nenemy was deteriorating. We had overwhelm-\ning air superiority and all the great advantages\nof security from air attack, close air support,\nregular air reconnaissance, air supply and air\nmovement of troops—advantages which were\ndenied to the Japanese, owing to their marked\ninferiority in the air. We possessed great\nadvantages in mobility and in armoured\nstrength, and were in terrain where we could\nexploit them. And, last but not least, there\nwas the proved fighting value of our own\ntroops and their now most marked moral\nascendency over the enemy.\n\n98. In 33 Corps’ sector, 19 Indian Division\nmade substantial gains in the third week in\nFebruary, capturing Singu after stiff fighting\nand inflicting heavy casualties. On 98 Brigade’s\nfront, there were indications that the enemy\nwas pulling out from the Thabeikkyin area,\nafter ten days of continuous attacks. 98 Brigade\nwas, therefore, ordered to clear the area between\nThaibeikkyin and the southern bridgehead\nand rejoin the remainder of the Division. This\noperation was successfully completed by the\n20th February, on which date 19 Indian\nDivision commenced its drive south on a two\nbrigade front against continued resistance. 2\nBritish Division encountered only light opposi-\ntion to their build-up, as the enemy in this\nsector had concentrated his strength in an\nall-out effort to destroy 20 Indian Division.\nIn 20 Indian Division’s bridgehead, a prolonged\nand bitter struggle was raging, but the\nJapanese, following their usual custom, flung\ntheir reinforcements in piecemeal and their\ncasualties continued to mount. By the 16th\nFebruary, we had passed to the offensive, cap-\nturing Alethaung Village after savage hand-to-\nhand fighting. Fierce counter-attacks followed\nagainst the extreme west of our position ; but,\nby the 26th we had taken Tabingon and ex-\ntended our bridgehead to a width of eight miles\nand a depth of two and a half.\n\n99. In 4 Corps’ sector, after the capture of\nPagan on the 15th February already recorded,\n\nSUPPLEMENT To tae LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\n7 Indian Division’s bridgehead at Nyaungu was\nconsiderably enlarged. By the end of February,\n33 Brigade was thrusting east, along the\nsouth bank of the Irrawaddy, with Myingyan\nas its ultimate objective. Meanwhile, 89\nBrigade was striking south towards Singu. On\nthe north bank, 114 Brigade continued opera-\ntions about Pakokku. On the right flank of 4\nCorps, west of the river, 28 (East African)\nBrigade had repulsed enemy attacks south of\nLetse. Further west, a detachment composed\nof the Chin Hills Battalion and the Lushai\nScouts was pushing back the Japanese rear\nparties in the area of Point 468, west-north-\nwest of Letse. As already stated (paragraph\n87) 17 Indian Division (less its air-transportable\nbrigade) and 255 Indian Tank Brigade,\nhad concentrated in 7 Indian Division’s\nbridgehead at Nyaungu by the 22nd February.\nThe success or failure of the whole Fourteenth\nArmy plan depended on its subsequent opera-\ntions and they will be described separately.\n\n100. On the Northern Combat Area Com-\nmand front 36 British Division (less 29\nBrigade), advancing on Mongmit from the\nnorth, effected a strongly opposed crossing of\nthe Shweli River during the first week of\nFebruary. The first attempt failed, but the\nsecond one, made with increased air support,\nwas successful near the bend of the river north\nof Myitson. Myitson fell on the 9th February\nand the advance continued against stiff\nresistance. On the 17th, the enemy counter-\nattacked in strength, using flame-throwers and\nrouch artillery. They succeeded in penetrat-\ning our forward positions, but were ejected by\na Spirited attack by an Indian battalion\nafter bitter hand-to-hand fighting. Our\nfurther progress towards Mongmit continued to\nmeet with determined resistance. 29\nBrigade, advancing on Mongmit from the west,\ncaptured Nabu on the 18th February and, by\nthe end of the month, had reached a point\napproximately half way between Nabu and\nMongmit, Further east, 50 Chinese Division\nentered Namtu on the 23rd February, captur-\ning eleven locomotives and a quantity of\ntolling stock. Further east again, 30 Chinese\nDivision captured Hsenwi on the night 18th—\n19th February against light opposition. This\nvillage lies on the Burma Road about 30 miles\nnorth-east of Lashio. The enemy in this\nsector appeared to be falling back to posi-\ntions immediately north of Lashio, with a view\nto defending that town.\n\n101. Although the Japanese were withdraw-\ning along the whole of Northern Combat Area\nCommand’s front, they were doing so at their\nleisure. Since the weakening of Northen\nCombat Area Command’s front by the loss\nof two divisions and the securing of the road\ntrace through Namhkam and Muse by the\ncapture of Hsenwi, the pressure had slackened\nand this front was not fulfilling the task I\nwanted done, namely the containing of the\nJapanese forces there and the prevention of\nenemy concentration against Fourteenth\nArmy. it was for this reason that, in my\nOperation Instruction of the 27th February (see\nAppendix A), I directed the Commanding\nGeneral, Northern Combat Area Command, to\nsecure the general area Kyaukme—Lashio with\nall speed.\n",

While the Japanese were concentrating\ntheir forces against 33 Corps (vide paragraphs\n95 and 96) the thrust at their vitals by 4 Corps\nwas developing. I use this term advisedly for\nall the Japanese communications radiated from\nMeiktila and Thazi; north to Mandalay and\nLashio, south to Rangoon, north-west to\nMyingyan, west to Kyaukpadaung and thence\nto the oilfields at Chauk and Yenangyaung,\nand east, via Kalaw, to Siam. Meiktila was\nthe advanced supply base for all the Japanese\nforces in Burma, with the exception of those\nin Atakan. At Meiktila, too, were located the\nprincipal Japanese airfields, the capture of\nwhich would be of inestimable value to us.\nIf we could seize Meiktila, and hold it, the whole\nstructure of the Japanese defence in Central\nBurma was bound to collapse.\n\n103. The great dash om Meiktila started on\nthe 21st February, when a mechanised and\narmoured. column composed of 48 Brigade (17\nIndian Division), with tanks, broke out of the\nNyaungu bridgehead, captured Hnawdwin 15\nmiles to the east, and were then temporarily\nheld up by deep ravines beyond the village.\nHere they were joined by the rest of the Divi-\nsion and 255 Indian Tank Brigade (less one\nregiment left with 7 Indian Division). The\nadvance continued the same day, but to avoid\nthe difficult country between Pyinsin and\nWelaung, the Division fanned out, 48 Brigade\nand a proportion of armour moving on\nTaungtha, via Kainye, and 63 Brigade with\nthe main body of the Tank Brigade directed\nsouth-east on Seiktin and then north-east, via\nWelaung. Both columns reached Taungtha on\nthe 24th February after overcoming desperate\nresistance and clearing many minefields. By\nthe evening of the 24th, our leading troops\nhad progressed five miles south-east of\nTaungtha, towards Mahlaing. By 0900 hours\nom the 26th we had captured the important\nThabutkon. airfield intact, smashing through a\ndetermined Japanese effort to protect it. The\nfly-in from Palel of the air-transportable brigade\n(99 Brigade).of 17 Indian Division began next\nmorning, by which time our tanks were engaged\nwithin five miles of Meiktila.\n\n104. This rapid drive merits attention. It\nwas the first opportunity we had had of utilis-\ning our mechanised and armoured superiority\non a large scale and the Japanese were com-\npletely bewildered and overwhelmed. The\nenemy positions, manned by such scratch\nforces as could be hastily collected, were sub-\njected to heavy air attack, encircled by tanks\nand lorried infantry, and rendered untenable.\nForced into the open, the enemy suffered enor-\nmous casualties. The “Cab Rank” method\nof air support was here employed most success-\nfully for the first time in Burma, squadrons\nremaining over the operations area and being\ndirected on to fleeting targets from ground con-\ntrol centres. These were known as Visual\nControl Posts (V.C.Ps.) which comprised an\nArmy and a R.AF. officer and which were\nusually located at brigade headquarters. It\n\n1903\n\nproved a most efficient method, though un-\neconomical from an Air Force point of view,\nof providing instantaneous air strikes during\nrapidly moving operations. The finding of the\nnecessary officers for these V.C.Ps., and their\ntraining had in the past been matters of some\ndifficulty. The efforts which had been made\nto overcome these were now rewarded in full.\n\n105. The Japanese garrison at Meiktila\ntotalled 3,500, according to a document cap-\ntured later. Unfortunately, our arrival in the\narea coincided with that of one regiment of\n49 Japanese Division, which was being rushed\nfrom Pegu to Mandalay. The enemy was also\nstrong in artillery. The commander of the\ngarrison,’ General Kasuya, had acted with\nvigour in the short time at his disposal. The\ndefences were strong and ingeniously sited, and\nall available men, including hospital patients,\nwere put in to man them. The large lakes to\nthe west of the town narrowed the areas of\napproach and, in all sectors, the lines of\nadvance suitable for tanks were well covered\nby artillery, which included many anti-aircraft\nbatteries used in their anti-tank réle. All this\nin an area where the deployment of armour\nwas already hampered by broken country and\ndeep irrigation cuts.\n\n106. As dawn broke on the 28th February,\nthe attack on Meiktila went in from four direc-\ntions. On the north-west, 48 Brigade drove\ndown the axis of the main road, while\n63 Brigade attacked from the west. Simul-\ntaneously, 255 Indian Tank Brigade, with two\ninfantry battalions, attacked from the east and\nnorth-east. The tanks experienced difficulty in\ndeploying and the infantry were at first pinned\ndown by heavy fire, but later succeeded in\ncapturing Point 859, which dominates the town\nfrom the south-east. 48 Brigade were tem-\nporarily held up by a blown bridge, but by\nnightfall Point 859 had been consolidated and\nMeiktila had been entirely surrounded. There\nfollowed three days and nights of ‘hand-to-hand\nfighting as savage as any yet experienced in\nthe campaign. The enemy put up the most\nfanatical resistance and houses and dug-outs\nwere only cleared after the last defender had\nbeen bayonetted. By the morning of the 4th\nMarch, all Meiktila north of the railway had\nbeen cleared, but on both sides of the lake\nsuicide parties still held out, which it took some\ndays to eliminate. In this bitter fighting, the\nJapanese garrison had been practically\nannihilated—over 2,000 bodies being counted\nin the town alone. The booty captured included\n48 guns.\n\n107. In the meantime, the fly-in of 99 Bri-\ngade of 17 Indian Division, which had begun\non the 27th February (paragraph 103), was\ncompleted early on the 2nd March, three days\nahead of schedule, and the Brigade moved\nforward into battle. In all, 353 sorties were\nflown without the loss of a single man, a very\nfine achievement by the RAF. and\nUSAAF, —\n\n108. On the 4th March, leaving the complete\nclearance of the town to 63 Brigade, columns of\nall arms were despatched along all the roads\nradiating from Meiktila. The important road\nand railway junction of Thazi was reported\nclear, but, in other sectors, columns of rein-\nforcements, guns and lorries heading for\nMeiktila were encountered.

The enemy, caught completely on\nthe wrong foot, was engaged by aircraft, tanks\nand infantry and thrown into utter confusion.\nHere again, the “Cab Rank” method proved\nmost efficacious.\n\n109, To say that our capture of Meiktila\ncame as a surprise to the enemy Command\nwould be an understatement. Not only was\nthe blow utterly unexpected, but their Intelli-\ngence was for some time completely baffied\nas to what troops had inflicted it. The general\ncounter-offensive plans for early March had to\nto put aside, as, until Meiktila was recaptured\nand our forces south of Mandalay destroyed,\nno major attacks could be launched north\nand west of the Irrawaddy. On the other\nhand, failure to recapture Meiktila could result\nin disaster for practically the whole of the\nBurma Area Army. Although captured orders\nshow that Kimura realised this, yet, curiously\nenough, other documents show that he still\nintended to prosecute what he called “The\ndecisive battle of the Irrawaddy Shore.” The\nresult was that he adopted half-measures. He\ncountermanded the moves directed against\n33 Conps {vide paragraph 95) and diverted\nthese formations on to Meiktila, stressing, in\nhis orders, the vital necessity for speed. He\nalso directed General Yamamoto in the west\n(Yenangyaung area) to sever 4 Corps’ commu-\nnications by capturing their Pakokku bridge-\nhead by an advance up both banks of the\nIrrawaddy. But he gave no orders to his forces\nwho were about Mandalay or south of the\nriver to withdraw, evidently considering he\ncould restore the situation about Meiktila while\ncontinuing the battle in the north. Here, as\nso often before, the Japanese under-estimation\nof their enemy was to prove fatal to them.\n\n110. The forces which Kimura concentrated\nto recover Meiktila were as follows: 18\nJapanese Division (less 114 Regiment), brought\nsouth from the Northern Combat Area Com-\nmand’s front: 119 Regiment (53 Japanese Divi-\nsion), from south of Mandalay ; 214 Regiment\n(33 Japanese Division) from the Irrawaddy\nfront, opposite Pakokku; and 49 Japanese\nDivision (less 153 Regiment) which had been\nhurried north from Pegu. These forces were\nreinforced by Army Troops, including medium\nartillery and some tanks. It was a formidable\nconcentration and it was being rapidly effected.\nOur forces in Meiktila comprised 17 Indian\nDivision and one tank brigade. The only re-\ninforcement available was 5 Indian Division,\nwhich moved forward from Jorhat (700 miles\ndistant) on the Sth March. Its forward con-\ncentration was carried out with great speed and\nthe whole Division (less its air-transportable\nbrigade) had reached 7 Indian Division’s\nbridgehead at Nyaungu 10 days later. The\nfly-in of the remaining brigade from Palel to\nMeiktila was completed on the 17th March,\nbut I will refer to this again. It will be seen,\ntherefore, that the enemy was concentrating the\nequivalent of six brigades, plus Army units,\nagainst our four infantry brigades and one\ntank brigade. There was nothing perturbing\nabout this, but it must be remembered that our\ncommunications were vulnerable ; our forward\nairfields were exposed to attack, as, also, was\nthe road back via Taungtha, while the road\nwest, via Kyaukpadaung, was of course still\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nunder enemy control. Our object, therefore,\nwas to hold Meiktila, acting as offensively as\npossible, while 7 Indian Division kept open\nthe bridgehead area and enabled 5 Indian\nDivision to pass through.\n\n111. As already stated (paragraph 109), the\nenemy commander at Yenangyaung had been\nordered to seize our bridgehead at Nyaungu,\nthus cutting our L. of C. to Meiktila. Yama-\nmoto’s plan was to make a converging attack\nfrom the west, on the right bank, and from\nthe south and east on the left bank. This\noffensive, however, was uncoordinated. The\nIN.A. Division attempted an assault from the\neast against 114 Brigade in the bridgehead, but\nits attacks were half-hearted and were driven\nback with heavy casualties. To the south, a\nJapanese force, assembling for an attack near\nSingu four miles north-east of Chauk, was\ncaught and routed by 89 Brigade. The attack\non the bridgehead from the west was pre-\nvented from developing by 28 (East African)\nBrigade, which successfully repulsed a series of\nattacks. Thus ended the threat to our com-\nmunications at Nyaungu.\n\n112. 28 (Bast African) Brigade deserves\nsome remarks. Besides 11 (East African) Divi-\nsion, the original East African contingent in-\ncluded two independent brigades, the 22nd and\nthe 28th, which were originally allotted for\ndefence duties in Ceylon. Shortage of forma-\ntions, however, had resulted in both brigades\nbeing sent to Burma, primarily to undertake\nduties on the L. of C. The Commander, Four-\nteenth Army, soon found himself forced,\nthrough lack of sufficient troops, to employ\n28 (East African) Brigade in the line, although\nthe formation had not really reached a suffi-\nciently advanced state of training to be pitted\nagainst the enemy. It will be remembered\nthat a reverse was suffered resulting in a with-\ndrawal to the Letse area. Reinforced, how-\never, by an Indian battalion and some artil-\nlery, the Brigade fought well, as shown above.\nIn accordance with the decisions reached at\na Conference with the G.O.C.-in-C., East\nAfrica, held in February, 28 (East African)\nBrigade was flown out of Burma to Dohazari\nin March and April, and broken up, as the first\nstep in the reduction of the East African forces,\nwhich, owing to the man-power situation, were\nto be reduced to the one division by early 1946.\n\n113. On the east flank of the Irrawaddy\nbattlefront, over a 100 miles up river, another\ngreat battle was raging. 19 Indian Division,\nwhich had broken out of its bridgehead on the\n20th February, had begun its drive down the\neast bank of the river, advancing with great\nspeed and determination. The two Japanese\ndivisions (the 15th and 53rd) opposing 19\nIndian Division completely failed to stop it.\nStrong positions were either assaulted, with\ntank and air support, or were by-passed. In a\n“Jeap-frogging ” advance, 98 Brigade were the\nfirst troops to reach the Chaungmagyi, estab-\nlishing a bridgehead on the 5th March ; while,\nfurther north, 64 Brigade was still mopping up\nin the Pinlein area and 62 Brigade was fighting\nat Yenatha, which they captured on the 6th.\nThe result of this method of advance was that\nwe reached and passed through Madaya before\nthe enemy had time to retire to the strongly\nprepared positions covering the two water\nbarriers north of the town.

Meanwhile, 62 Brigade had\nturned off south-east from Madaya on the 8th\nMarch and struck through the forest-clad hills\ntowards Maymyo, which was occupied on the\n11th; the astonished Japanese only offering\nslight resistance. The following day a large\nenemy convoy of lorries and staff cars in this\narea was surprised and wiped out. The capture\nof Maymyo cut the enemy’s communications\nbetween Mandalay and their forces facing\nNorthern Combat Area Command on the\nKyaukme—Lashio front.\n\n114. Mandalay contains two areas of tactical\nimportance : Mandalay Hill and Fort Dufferin.\nThe fonmer is a great rock feature, covered\nwith pagodas and Buddhist monasteries, which\nTises some 750 feet above the surrounding\npaddy fields, completely dominating the city\nfrom the north-east. Fort Dufferin lies south-\nwest of Mandalay Hill and about two miles\nfrom the river. It is encircled by a moat about\n80 yards wide, while its 20-foot walls are\nbacked with an earth embankment some 72 feet\nthick at the base. The manner in which these\nancient types of defences withstood many of\nthe most modern and scientific forms of attack,\nincluding skip-bombing and rocket attacks by\naircraft, is not without interest. It is worth\nrecording, however, that low-level bombing\nattacks by Thunderbolts caused a gap in the\nwalls large enough to enable a tank to get\nthrough.\n\n115. The attack on Mandalay Hill was\nJaunched by 98 Brigade early on the 9th March,\nand the hill was captured after 24 hours of the\nmost bitter hand-to-hand fighting. The enemy\nfought to the end, the last defenders being\nkilled by means of petrol drums, set on fire,\nwhich were rolled down into the tunnel they\nwere holding. There followed three days of\nstreet fighting. By the 14th the city had been\ncleared and Fort Dufferin invested. A gallant\nattempt by 98 Brigade to storm the fort failed,\nthe attackers being held up by the thick weed\nin the moat. Old fashioned siege warfare\nmethods were then adopted, in order to avoid\nthe casualties which a direct assault would have\nentailed : but even medium artillery, firing from\n500 yards, and aerial rocket projectiles failed\nto break the massive walls, with their earth\nembankment. By the 19th March, however,\nthe Japanese had had enough, and that night\nthe remnants of the garrison attempted to\nescape through the ruins. The majority were\nintercepted and only a few got away. An\nimmense quantity of equipment, chiefly ord-\nnance stores, fell into our hands and 160\ncivilian internees were rescued. The capture\nof Mandalay was a fitting climax to a great\nadvance. Between the date it crossed the\nIrrawaddy on the 9th January and the fall\nof Mandalay, 19 Indian Division had accounted\nfor 6,000 Japanese killed, actually counted on\nthe ground.\n\n116. General Kimura’s plan (paragraphs 109\nand 110) to recapture Meiktila, ‘both by cutting\nour communications thereto and by direct\nassault was energetically pursued. Early in\nMarch, a strong enemy force re-occupied\nTaungtha and the dominating hills to the north-\neast. This meant that nearly 5,000 unarmoured\nvehicles, comprising the administrative “ tail ”\n\n1903\n\nof the formations in Meiktila, could not get\nthrough. As already stated (paragraph 110)\n5 Indian Division had reached Nyaungu on\nthe 15th March and to it was then allotted the\ndifficult task of reopening the road to Meiktila.\n\n117. In the Meiktila area, there was con-\ntinuous fighting. While mobile columns of\ninfantry and tanks were successfully operating\nagainst the enemy who were attempting to close\nin on the town, inflicting heavy casualties and\ncapturing many guns, the Japanese were con-\ncentrating on capturing the airstrip, two miles\nnorth of Meiktila, on which our supplies de-\npended. On the night 15th-16th March, their\nattacks reached the north-west corner of the\nairstrip where they dug in. They were success-\nfully counter-attacked but their guns still\ndominated the strip, and the air-transportable\nbrigade of 5 Indian Division, which was then\nbeing flown in landed under artillery fire.\nSeveral aircraft were destroyed, but the\nAmerican Air Commandos were undeterred\nand no sortie turned back. The enemy then\nattacked in strength and succeeded in capturing\nthe airstrip. This resulted in an immediate\nsevere curtailment of supplies, including\nammunition, since we had to fall back on\n“ dropping ” as opposed to “landing.” There\nfollowed a week’s fierce fighting to regain the\nstrip. The enemy dug in in the broken country\nto the north, which was almost impassable for\ntanks, and strengthened the position with\nnumerous anti-tank guns and minefields. This\nmeant that the clearance of the strip was a job\nfor the infantry, together with elements of the\nR.AF. Regiment and R.A.F. Servicing Com-\nmandos, and it was achieved against the most\ndetermined opposition with the magnificent\nsupport of R.A.F. fighter-bombers. The\nJapanese artillery, however, still covered the\nairfield at almost point-blank range and further\nbitter close-quarter fighting was necessary be-\nfore the enemy was routed. The whole area was\ncleared by the 29th March. The enemy’s suici-\ndal resistance cost him nearly all his guns and\nwe inflicted tremendous casualties.\n\nSecron VII (paras. 118-130) Tae CLEARING\nOF THE MANDALAY PLAIN\n\nThe end of operations by Northern Combat\nArea Command: The opening of the road to\nMeiktila: The capture of Kyaukse: The clear-\ning of Ava and Sagaing: The Japanese decision\nto withdraw: Shortage of transport aircraft:\nThe achievements of 33 Corps.\n\n118. In early March decisions were taken\nwhich resulted in Northern Combat Area Com-\nmand’s operations ceasing altogether by the end\nof the month. Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek\nwas preparing his forces for an offensive in\nthe Autumn of 1945, and for this he proposed\nto form an army of some thirty-six divisions,\nwhose spearhead would be the five Chinese\ndivisions from Burma, which had been trained\nat Ramgarh in India. He also required the\nAmerican Mars Brigade from Burma to train\nfresh divisions in China on the lines of the\nRamgarh-trained divisions, On the 8th March,\nthe Supreme Allied Commander visited Chung-\nking to confer with the Generalissimo on these\nmatters. General Wedemeyer was not present\nas he had gone to Washington to consult the\nCombined Chiefs of Staff on the same issue.\nAdmiral Mountbatten pointed out to the\n",

While\nhe insisted on their eventual withdrawal, the\nGeneralissimo appeared to agree to the Chinese\ndivisions continuing the present operations, but\nin actual fact the Chinese forces never came\nbeyond Lashio and Hsipaw. Moreover, the\nCombined Chiefs of Staff confirmed the Gen-\neralissimo’s request for the Mars Brigade,\nwhose retention I had particularly pressed, by\nan order for their move to China at once. As\nwill ibe seen from the account of operations\nbelow, this put a virtual end to the offensive\noperations of Northern Combat Area Com-\nmand, though, of course, I realised that it\nwould be considered that the American forces\nin Burma had achieved their primary object\nonce the Burma Road was opened to connect\nwith the road they had built from Ledo. I had\nhoped that Northern Combat Area Command,\nbeside co-operating in the Mandalay battle,\ncould assist our further advance by sending\nweak forces southwards towards Loilem, but\nthis was not to be.\n\n119. On the 9th March, 36 British Division\ncaptured Mongmit, and, advancing south-west\nreached Mogok on the 20th. They were then\ndirected on to Kyaukme, which lies some 45\nmiles due south of Mogok. 50 Chinese Divi-\nsion, advancing southwards from Namtu,\nentered Hsipaw on the 16th March, and then\nturned west down the road towards Kyaukme.\n38 Chinese Division captured Lashio on the\n7th March, and by the end of the month had\npushed south-south-east 38 miles along the\nLashio—Mongyai road. Other troops from this\nDivision turned south-west down the Lashio—\nHsipaw road and, by the 26th March, had\nlinked up with 50 Chinese Division in the\nHsipaw area.\n\n120. This limited advance was the end of\nNorthern Combat Area Command’s opera-\ntions. Unfortunately, the relaxing of the pres-\nsure had, as already shown, allowed the\nJapanese to reinforce the Mandalay sector from\nthis front. The bulk of 18 Japanese Division\nhad been brought into the Meiktila battle, while\nlater 56 Japanese Division with the remaining\nregiment of the 18th were ordered to withdraw\ntheir main forces for the main battle and hold\nthe right flank with minimum strength. On the\n30th March, I issued orders for 36 British\nDivision to come under command of Fourteenth\nArmy on reaching Kyaukme. I also directed,\nthat one brigade should be flown into Manda-\nlay as quickly as possible. The whole of 36\nBritish Division was then to relieve 19 Indian\nDivision and assume control of operations in the\nMaymyo—Mandalay—Ava area. This would\nrelieve the strain on Fourteenth Army until\nthe Japanese had been pushed further south,\nbut it could only be regarded as a temporary\nexpedient since the American aircraft, on which\n36 British Division was dependent for main-\ntenance, were to be withdrawn in May, before\nwhich the Division would have to be flown out\nto India. 36 British Division, less 26 Indian\nInfantry Brigade which remained in Burma,\nwas actually flown out between the Ist and 21st\n\nay.\n\n121. Returning now to the main battle on the\nFourteenth Army front: while our forces in\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nMeiktila were engaged in frustrating and des-\ntroying the Japanese built-up against them, the\nremainder of 4 Corps was engaged in pushing\nback the enemy west of the Irrawaddy, and\nin expanding the Nyaungu bridgehead south-\nwards towards Chauk and eastwards towards\nMyingyan. On the 18th March, 33 Brigade (7\nIndian Division) attacked prepared positions\nsouth of Myingyan, securing the road and rail-\nway crossing. On the 21st with tank support,\nthey forced an entry into the town, and by the\n23rd the whole of Myingyan had been cleared.\nMeanwhile, a detachment of the same Brigade\nhad cleared the Chindwin-Irrawaddy conflu-\nence area to the north-west. The capture of\nMyingyan was a very important gain since it\nopened the way for our Inland Water Trans-\nport (1.W.T.) on the Chindwin. The admin-\nistrative plan was to transport supplies by\nwater from Kalewa to Myingyan, and thence\nby rail to Meiktila. It will be remembered that\nwe had no all-weather road from Kalewa to\nShwebo ; the alternative route by water was\ntherefore very important. A very great deal\nof transport and constructional effort was being\nexpended on this I1.W.T. L. of C. as can be\nseen in more detail in the part of this Des-\npatch which deals with administration, and it\npaid good ‘dividends.\n\n122. At the same time as 7 Indian Division\n(33 Brigade) was attacking Myingyan, 5 Indian\nDivision (161 Brigade) was advancing on\nTaungtha. The hill massif north of the town\ndominates the whole of this area and, after an\nassault launched on the 28th March, this\nfeature was captured the following day. On the\n30th, Taungtha was occupied, 161 Brigade was\nat once relieved by 33 Brigade from Myingyan\nand continued the advance, passing through\nMahlaing on the 31st March and making con-\ntact with 17 Indian Division in the vicinity\nof Thabutkon. The road to Meiktila was open,\nand the rear echelon of 17 Indian Division,\nfollowed by the whole of 5 Indian Division\n(less the air-transportable brigade already in\nMeiktila), moved forward immediately.\n\n123. As already described (paragraph 111),\nYamamoto’s offensive against 4 Corps’ bridge-\nhead had completely failed. His forces on both\nbanks of the river were pushed back and, by\nthe end of March, 89 Brigade (7 Indian Divi-\nsion) had entered Lanywa on the west bank\nand were successfully probing south from\nSingu, and west towards Kyaukpadaung, east\nof the river. 7 Indian Division (less 33\nBrigade) was placed under command of 33\nCorps on the 29th March, when that Corps\nentered the area in which the Division was\noperating. 33 Brigade reverted to under the\ncommand of 7 Indian Division on the 31st\nMarch.\n\n124. 20 Indian Division linked up their\nbridgehead with that of 2 British Division to\nthe east on the 2nd March. The prolonged\nperiod of severe defensive fighting had ended\nand all three brigades broke out of the bridge-\nhead. By the 10th March, 80 Brigade had\ntaken Gyo to the south-east, capturing eleven\nguns. On this date, also, 32 Brigade began\nits break-through against stiff opposition and\nadvanced three miles. By the 12th March,\n100 Brigade (from the west flank of the\nMyinmu bridgehead) had captured the impor-\ntant road junction of Myotha, inflicting heavy\ncasualties. The advance continued eastwards\n",

By the\n231d March, 80 Brigade were two miles west\nof the important enemy base of Kyaukse, where\nthey were held up. With a view to outflanking\nthe Japanese positions, 32 Brigade began an\nencircling movement south-west of the town. A\nweek’s hard fighting ensued before Kyaukse\nwas entered on the 30th March, the booty cap-\ntured including rolling stock, motor transport,\nand a quantity of valuable stores. The fall of\nKyaukse was a severe blow to the enemy,\nstrategically as well as administratively, since\nit formed the bastion behind which their dis-\norganized forces, streaming back from north\nand west, were attempting to rally. Since\ncrossing the Irrawaddy on the 12th February,\n20 Indian Division had killed over 3,000\nJapanese (counted), and captured 50 guns.\n\n125. While the other two brigades of 20\n\nIndian Division were advancing on Kyaukse,\n100 Brigade (less one battalion) and two\narmoured car regiments made a spectacular\nraid against the enemy’s communications to the\nsouth. Moving with great speed, this mechan-\nised column captured Pyinzi on the 20th March\nand Pindale the following day. Turning east-\nwards, it then captured Wundwin on the 22nd,\ndestroying large enemy dumps. It then turned\nnorth, surprising and killing a considerable\nforce of Japanese encountered at Kume, 18\nmiles due south of Kyaukse.\n_ The effects of this daring raid can well be\nimagined ; it inflicted severe casualties, cap-\ntured guns, and created havoc in the enemy’s\nrear. But it did much more than this: it com-\npletely disrupted the Japanese system of com-\nmand over a wide area, just at a time when its\nsmooth working was essential to restore their\ncrumbling battle fronts.\n\n126. 2 British Division began its break-out\nfrom the Ngazun bridgehead on the 7th March.\n4 Brigade captured Myintha on the 8th, and\ncleared the area to the west to the common\nboundary with 20 Division during the following\nweek. 5 Brigade ‘captured Kyauktalon\non the 11th March and pushed rapidly east-\nwards. By the 15th, they were within two miles\nof the Myitnge River. On this date also, 6\nBrigade operating to the south of 5 Brigade\nagainst strong opposition, inflicted heavy casu-\nalties on the enemy and reached a point two\nmiles south of Tada-U. On the 17th March,\n5 Brigade captured Ava Fort, liquidating a\nstubborn defence and, by the 21st, Japanese\npockets of resistance had been mopped up, the\nAva-Mandalay road opened, and junction\neffected with 19 Indian Division. 6 Brigade\nin the meantime had reached the Myitnge River\nand proceeded to inflict severe casualties on the\nenemy retreating before 19 Indian Division.\n4 Brigade, transferred from the west, passed\nthrough 6 Brigade on the 18th and continued\nthe advance towards Sado. While 19\nIndian Division continued to advance southwards,\n2 British Division were deflected south-west\nclearing the triangle Myitnge—Myingyan—\nMeiktila. On the 27th March, 4 Brigade\ncleared Pyinzi and on the 31st reached\nMahlaing. 5 and 6 Brigades cleared the area\nbetween Myitnge and Myingyan, linking up\nwith 268 Indian Infantry Brigade at Natogyi,\n17 miles east of Myingyan, on the 30th March.\n268 Brigade had cleared Sagaing at the north\nend of the Ava bridge on the 18th March, and\nthen advanced south-west via Myotha.\n\n1905\n\n127. By the end of March, Kimura evidently\nrealised that “The decisive battle of the Irra-\nwaddy Shore” had ended for him in decisive\ndefeat, for he ordered a general withdrawal.\nHis plan now was for 33 Japanese Army, com-\nprising 18, 49 and 53 Japanese Divisions, to\nstem our advance in the east down the railway\naxis, and for 28 Japanese Army, comprising\nYamamoto’s force and other detachments, to\nhold us in the west in the Irrawaddy Valley.\nNot for the first time, the Japanese Commander\nhad left it until too jate. From now on his\nlosses in artillery and transport were to hamper\nhis defence and restrict his mobility.\n\n128. Another event occurred about this time\nto add to the Japanese difficulties. On the\nnight of the 24th March the Headquarters staffs\nof the Burmese forces, which they had\nraised during their occupation, deserted. Three\ndays later there was open revolt. The Burma\nDefence Army had turned against its masters.\nThe revolt was widespread and considerable\nnumbers of Japanese were killed. This rising,\nalthough in no way decisive, proved of great\nvalue to our operations, and forced the enemy\nto divert forces to deal with it. On joining the\nAllies the force was re-named the “ Burma\nNational Army ”.\n\n129. But we ourselves were now faced again\nwith the ever recurrent crisis of transport air-\ncraft. General Sultan had agreed to hand over\n36 British Division to Fourteenth Army, for\nGeneral Slim to use for mopping-up work in\nthe Mandalay area, with a view to the release\nof 19 Indian Division into Army reserve. 36\nBritish Division would in any case have to be\nflown out to India as soon as possible as it\ncould not be maintained for long, and it also\nneeded ‘a rest after a year’s continuous fighting.\nAn examination of the position on the 19th\nMarch had shown that we had insufficient\ntransport aircraft to meet our present needs.\nThis was likely to have the serious result that\nanother division—probably a British one—\nwould have to be flown out in April to relieve\nthe supply situation. Further, I felt that the\ntime had come when we should start to insure\nagainst the probable removal of the United\nStates aircraft in the fairly near future. Ad-\nmiral Mountbatten accordingly held a con-\nference at my Tactical Headquarters at\nMonywa on the 22nd March, to discuss air\nsupply. The following attended: Lieutenant-\nGeneral Sultan, Air-Marshal Park, Major-\nGeneral Stratemeyer, Lieutenant-General Slim,\nMajor-General Fuller and Air Vice-Marshal\nVincent. All the resources in transport aircraft\nwhich could be made available were to be\nused to help Fourteenth Army in their battle\nof annihilation and their subsequent dash for\nRangoon. I asked for sufficient aircraft to\nenable me to keep 2 British Division in Four-\nteenth Army, and for a few over to enable\nGeneral Christison to continue mobile opera-\ntions in Arakan to contain the enemy there.\nOwing to the nature of the country, operations\nup the An track or inland from Taungup were\nimpracticable on an effective scale without air\nsupply. I also suggested that as many now\nunwanted American and Chinese troops as pos-\nsible should be flown out, so as to release trans-\nport aircraft for Fourteenth Army. But I\ninsisted that no transport aircraft could be\nspared for this task from those supplying my\nforces at this critical stage.\n",

By this means it\nis possible to see the magnitude of the cumula-\ntive defeat of the Japanese forces. On the 3rd\nApril, 1944, Headquarters, 33 Corps, had\nopened at Jorhat and had proceeded at once\nto organize the operations which led to the\nrelief of Kohima. Exactly one year later, the\ntroops comprising this Corps were able to claim\nthe following successes: Japanese killed (and\nactually counted) 19,547, prisoners taken 720,\nguns captured or destroyed 252. The following\nadvances had taken place: on the right 597\nmiles, in the centre 549 miles, on the left 645\nmiles. The Japanese had been cleared from an\narea of 35,000 square miles. At least 11,000\ninhabited localities had been liberated, includ-\ning the city of Mandalay.\n\nSection TX (paras. 131-158) OPERATIONS\nIN ARAKAN\n\nGeneral remarks: Topography: The 15\nIndian Corps plan: The Divisional plans:\nOpening stages of the offensive : The advance\nto Foul Point: Operations inland and in the\nKaladan Valley.\n\n131. I think that this is the appropriate place\nto turn from Fourteenth Anmy to the opera-\ntions of 15 Indian Corps in Arakan. The\nobject of these operations has already been\ngiven (paragraph 12), as has the outline of\nthe plan (paragraph 14). Some reference\nhas been made also to the progress there\nin November and December (paragraph 49).\nIn this and the two ensuing sections,\nI propose to describe in more detail these\nplans and operations, showing how, from first\nbeing at the release of formations\nfor post-monsoon operations against Rangoon,\nthey developed so that their new object became\nthe assistance of Fourteenth Army to capture\nRangoon ‘before the monsoon, by containing\nenemy forces, establishing air supply bases and,\nfinally, by mounting an ancillary seaborne\noperation against Rangoon itself.\n\n132. In the Arakan sector, we were faced\nwith peculiar difficulties. The first was\ntopographical. The country entirely favoured\nthe Japanese. The tangled, jungle-clad\nmountains run down to a narrow coastal strip\nof paddy or mangrove swamp, which is inter-\nsected by unfordable tidal creeks. These creeks\nor “ chaungs ” present problems which few who\nhave not experienced them can imagine. They\nare mostly bordered by mangrove forest to a\nconsiderable depth on each side, which makes\nlanding altogether impossible except at the\nextremely rare landing places, of whose import-\nance the enemy was obviously aware. These\nlanding places, however, are only short\nstretches of muddy bank. The chaungs vary\na very great deal in size, some being arms of\nthe sea, while others are narrow and winding\nstreams, hedged in both sides by the mangrove\nforest. In the latter case visibility is only to\nthe next bend in the chaung. Near the sea,\ntidal conditions add to the difficulties.\n\nNorth of Akyab a few beaches can be found,\nbut south to beyond Taungup, the mangrove\nswamp conditions are at their worst.\n\n133. The other great difficulty is the weather,\nwhich is a major strategic factor. The excep-\ntional severity of the monsoon in Arakan is\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\napparent when one realises that the rainfall is\nover fifty inches during the months of July and\nAugust. During June and September the rain-\nfall varies betwen fifteen and twenty inches for\nthe former and between twenty and thirty\ninches for the latter month. This has two main\neffects. Movement on land is more or less im-\npossible except between mid-December, when\nthe ground dries out, and the breaking of the\nmonsoon about mid‘May, or a little earlier.\nNot only do the waterways rise and flood, but\nthe paddy fields, which form most of the open\ncountry are under water and impassable. The\njmpracticability of the employment of armour\nis obvious. and the absence of all-weather roads\nmakes a land of L. of C. impossible during the\nrains. The second effect of the monsoon is that\nsea conditions prevent the use of landing craft\nexcept in virtually inland waterways. The\nnumber of days on which landing is impossible\nbecomes progressively greater during April, and\nit will be seen later how the Japanese in fact\nanticipated no landings from the open sea after\nmid-April, until the monsoon was over.\n\n134. Fortunately we had two advantages\nwhich enabled us decisively to overcome both\nthe natural difficulties and the Japanese. We\nhad secured complete command of the sea and\nthe air and were thus able to utilise to the full\nthe mobility conferred by this supremacy. Thus\nalthough the country favoured the land defence,\nwe were in a position to force the enemy to\nfight on ground of our own choosing and to\nmake ourselves independent, to a great extent,\nof overland Ls. of C. The campaign there-\nfore hinged upon a series of combined opera-\ntions, rapidly and efficiently mounted by a\ncombined headquarters. Excellent team-work\nwas established between Lieutenant-General\nSir Philip Christison, commanding 15 Indian\nCorps, Rear-Admiral Martin, commanding a\nnaval force consisting, in part, of his own land-\ning craft of Force “W”, which was arriving\nfrom England, and a scratch force of landing\ncraft from India, and Air Commodore (later\nAir Vice-Marshal) the Earl of Bandon, com-\nmanding 224 Group, R.A.F. The planning and\nexecution by these Commanders and their staffs\nwas excellent. In conjunction with these\namphibious operations, the operations further\ninland by 81 and 82 (West African) Divisions\nfulfilled a very important réle. Fighting under\nvery arduous conditions, they kept the enemy\nspread over a wide front, containing the equiva-\nlent of about three Japanese regiments, and,\nby preventing the enemy from concentrating\nmore troops in the coastal sector, materially\nassisted the speed of operations there.\n\n135. To recapitulate what has been said in\nthe early paragraphs of this Despatch, the\nprimary object of the Arakan campaign was to\nliquidate the very unsatisfactory position which\nthen existed. We had four divisions contained\nthere by a very much inferior enemy force,\nwhich was able to threaten to outflank our\npositions by an advance up the Kaladan Valley.\nBy a limited offensive to capture Akyab,\nMyebon and Minbya, we would eliminate this\nthreat, and, by the coming monsoon, be en-\nabled to reduce our garrison to about four\nbrigades. The remaining formations could be\nwithdrawn for post-monsoon operations, which\nat that time (November, 1944) were visualised\nas including an amphibious and airborne\nassault on Rangoon.\n",

The Supreme Allied Commander had,\non the 4th November, directed that plans\nwere to be prepared and executed to accomplish\nthe above object as follows :—\n\n(@) A land advance, to start as soon as\nthe drying of the ground allowed it, down\nthe Mayu Peninsula and the Kalapanzin and\nKaladan Valleys, with the object of clearing\nthe area north of a general line Foul Point\n—Kudaung Island—Minbya.\n\n. (6) An amphibious assault on Akyab\nIsland to take place as early as possible, with\nthe aim of clearing the island by the end of\nJanuary.\n\n(c) Consolidation of the area north of the\nline Akyab—Minbya, but no exploitation\nto take place south of Myebon without the\nSupreme Allied Commander’s authority.\nThese instructions had been passed on to the\n\nCommander, 15th Indian Corps, by General\n\nGiffard in an Operation Instruction dated the\n\n9th November.\n\n137. General Christison’s plan to fulfil these\ndirections for the clearing of Northern\nArakan was as follows: 25 Indian Division\n(Major-General G. N. Wood) was to clear the\nMayu Peninsula, and seize Foul Point and\nKudaung Island. 82 (West African) Division\n(Major-General G. McI. S. Bruce) was to\noperate inland, as left flank guard to 25 In-\ndian Division’s advance, along the general axis\nof the Mayu River as far as Htizwe. This\nentailed the capture of Buthidaung and the\ncrossing of the Kalapanzin River. On arrival\nat Htizwe, the Division was to turn east, over\nthe Kanzauk Pass, and relieve 81 (West\nAfrican) Division in the Kaladan Valley, and\nthence continue south towards Myebon. About\n30 miles further inland, separated from 82\n(West African) Division by a considerable\nrange of hills, 81 (West African) Division\n(Major-General F. J. Loftus-Tottenham) con-\nsisting of only two brigades, was allotted the\ntask of clearing the Kaladan Valley as far as\nMyohaung, by an advance down the axis of\nthe Pi Chaung and the Kaladan River. After\nMyohaung, it was to hand over to 82 (West\nAfrican) Division, and withdraw into Corps\nTeserve at Chiringa as the first step towards the\nreduction of formations in Arakan. 26 Indian\nDivision (Major-General C. E. N. Lomax)\nwith 3 Commando Brigade under command,\nwas to capture Akyab by a seaborne assault\nmounted from Chittagong and then to exploit\neastwards through the chaung country to the\nline Minbya—Myebon, while 82 (West African)\nDivision came down the road from Myohaung.\nIt will be seen from this plan that the main\nthrust was down the coast where our mobility\ncould be exploited, while the two African\ndivisions inland kept the enemy spread on a\nbroad front, preventing him from concentrat-\ning in the coastal sector and safeguarding the\nland communications, first of 25 Indian\nDivision and later of the rear of 15 Indian\nCorps. We thus would eliminate the threat of\nJapanese outflanking operations, hitherto a\nworry.\n\n138. As far as the timings of these opera-\ntions were concerned, the advance of 81 (West\nAfrican) Division was to begin first, and it\nwas to secure the general line from Kaladan\nVillage westwards to the Pi Chaung by the\nlst December. The advance in the Mayu\nsector was not due to start until the 12th\n\n1907\n\nDecember, by which date the country would\ndry up sufficiently to allow the movement\nof armour and guns, and for air support to be\ngiven from fair-weather strips. Nevertheless,\n15 Indian Corps carried out what amounted\nto a preliminary offensive prior to this date.\nAll ground which we had voluntarily vacated\nwest of the Kalapanzin River prior to the\nmonsoon was re-occupied, while, in the coastal\nsector, 25 Indian Division reached Udaung 13\nmiles south-east of Maungdaw. The first\nobjective allotted to 25 Indian Division and\n82 (West African) Division when the main\noffensive opened was the general line Indin—\nHtizwe, which was to be secured by the 31st\nDecember.\n\n139. In the matter of ground communica-\ntions, the advantage lay with the Japanese in\nthat they controlled the mouths of the Mayu,\nKywede and Kaladan Rivers, the Htizwe—\nKanzauk jeep track, and the road south from\nKyauktaw, on the Kaladan, to Myohaung.\nThese advantages were, however, counter-\nacted by the fact that our advance down the\ncoast could be based on the sea, while,\nfurther east, the Kalapanzin waterway from\nButhidaung could be used to supply any\nparallel advance in that area. In the Kaladan\nValley, the enemy’s river and road communi-\ncations were offset by the fact that 81 (West\nAfrican) Division was on air supply, with the\nconsequent freedom of manoeuvre which it\nallowed.\n\n140. The plan of 25 Indian Division was,\nbriefly, for 74 Brigade to advance down the\ncoastal plain, “cutting its tail” as it went and\nbeing supplied from the sea, while 53 Brigade\nadvanced down the Kalapanzin Valley, being\nsupplied by air until the Kalapanzin River\ncould be opened for Inland Water Transport\nfrom Buthidaung. 51 Brigade was to follow,\nand clear enemy pockets which had been by-\npassed in the Mayu hills. The essence of this\nplan was our refusal to present General\nSakurai with his favourite target—a vital\nmaintenance road in our rear. The Divisional\nArtillery was supplemented by the support of\ntwo destroyers which, as events proved, filled\na most useful réle in shelling enemy hill posi-\ntions defiladed from our own guns. The chief\ntask during the planning period was to pro-\ncure sufficient boats to maintain the advance\nof 53 Brigade and to arrange for their over-\nland transportation through the narrow tunnels\non the Maungdaw—Buthidaung hill road across\nthe Mayu Range to the Kalapanzin River.\nSome 650 craft were required for this\nproject.\n\n141. In 82 (West African) Division, 4\nBrigade had already relieved a brigade of 26\nIndian Division in Taung Bazaar. The re-\nmainder of 82 (West African) Division was to\nconcentrate just prior to D-Day (12th Decem-\nber) astride the Buthidaung road, immediately\neast of the Mayu spine, whence a simul-\ntaneous advance was to made by\n2 Brigade, with tank support, on Buthi-\ndaung and by 1 Brigade further south\non Baguna. 1 Brigade was then to\ncross the Kalapanzin River and capture the\nhigh ground on the east bank. This feature\ndominated the river and the 53 Brigade\n“regatta,” mentioned at the end of the pre-\nceding paragraph, could not start until it was\n",

Subsequently, when the\nwhole Buthidaung area had been cleared, 82\n(West African) Division, less one brigade left\nfor rear protection, was to advance through\nKindaung on Htizwe. The rate of advance\nwas to be co-ordinated with 53 Brigade to\nensure that the Divisional task of protecting\nthe Corps’ eastern flank was effectively carried.\nout. From Htizwe, 82 (West African) Division\nwas to cross the Kanzauk Pass into the Kaladan\nValley, relieve 81 (West African) Division north\nof Myohaung, and then to continue the\nadvance south.\n\n142, The 11th December saw 74 Brigade of\n25 Indian Division beginning its advance in the\ncoastal sector—a flying start in order to attract\nthe enemy’s attention away from the Buthi-\ndaung area. On the 12th December, 51\nBrigade extended its hold east towards\nButhidaung against slight opposition. By the\n14th December, 53 Brigade had concentrated\nin the eastern foothills of the Mayu Range,\nfour miles south of Letwedet. Forward\nelements of 82 (West African) Division had\ndebouched from the Tunnels, passed through\n51 Brigade, and had reached Buthidaung and\nBaguna. By the 15th December, 2 (West\nAfrican) Brigade had secured Buthidaung and\ncleared it of the enemy, and 82 (West African)\nDivision had secured its first objectives. The\nadvance of 15 Indian Corps was thus success-\nfully launched on both the 25th and 82nd\nDivisional fronts.\n\n143. Further east, in the Kaladan Valley,\nthe main body of 81 (West African) Divi-\nsion had crossed the Kaladan River by the 12th\nDecember, while on the west side of the river\na detachment attacked and drove the enemy\nfrom positions south of Kinthe {14 miles south\nof Kaladan Village). The crossing of the\nKaladan is described in more detail in para-\ngraph 154 below. The West Africans had\ncarried out a highly successful advance against\nopposition, covering 50 miles in 42 days. This\nrate of advance may not sound very rapid,\nbut it was achieved through extremely dense\nand difficult country. There is no doubt that\nits speed took the Japanese by surprise and\nforced them to withdraw southward, abandon-\ning areas which they had intended to hold,\nbut which were now outflanked\n\n144. A significant report was received about\nthis time (mid-December) stating that the\nJapanese had started to improve the track\nover the An Pass, leading westwards from\nMinbu on the Irrawaddy, to Dalet, on the west\ncoast. This route was obviously intended to\nprovide interior lines of supply from the middle\nIrrawaddy to the Arakan coast, or else a\nmeans of withdrawal in the reverse direction.\nThe only other practicable route lay much\nfurther south, a fair-weather road from\nTaungup inland to Prome.\n\n145. In the early stages of the advance of\n25 Indian Division, the enemy were amply\nin evidence in the hills, but they were so\nrapidly outflanked that only on one occasion\ndid they succeed in launching an attack on\nthe advancing column. This was repulsed with\nheavy loss to the attackers. What did happen\nhowever, was that the Japanese on more than\none occasion attacked areas in our rear which\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nwere devoid of troops. The enemy shelling\ndid nothing to impede our advance; more-\nover it proved somewhat profitable, since ruth-\nless counter-battery action was invariably\nforthcoming from the watchful destroyers\nNAPIER and NEPAL lying off the coast,\nwhich also, on occasions, even dispersed\nenemy detachments attempting to destroy\nbridges on the line of our advance. By the\n\nth December, 74 Brigade of 25 Indian\nDivision had already covered half the distance\nfrom Maungdaw to Foul Point.\n\n146. On the 19th December, the Navy turned\ntheir attention to a strategical target and the\nNAPIER shelled the town of Rathedaung, east\nof the Mayu Range and on the far bank of\nthe Mayu River, which was the Headquarters\nof the Japanese “Sakura Detached Force.”\nTheir fire was controlled by an Army Air\nObservation Post and the incident constituted\nan innovation in inter-Service liaison in this\ntheatre. The results were most satisfactory.\nIndin Village was occupied on the 21st and\nits airstrip was soon in commission. In country\nwhere operational airfields were not easy to\nconstruct, this acquisition proved of great\nvalue in subsequent operations. 74 Brigade’s\nnext bound was to Dombaik, the scene of the\nbattle of early 1943. The enemy had recently\nimproved this strong position, and it might\nhave provided us with a problem. But the\nJapanese had been left far in the rear and the\ndefile was occupied on the 23rd December\nbefore the enemy could get any garrison back\nto man their defences. They did, however,\ncut in behind our troops, but our advance\ncontinued unchecked. The incident merely\nserved to illustrate once again the importance\nof sea power ; had we been dependent on sup-\nplies by road, this severance of land communi-\ncations could not have been thus ignored. As\nit was, the Brigade was effectively maintained\nby Naval landing craft and the I.W.T.\n\n147. 74 Brigade reached Foul Point, at the\ntip of the Mayu Peninsula, on the 26th Decem-\nber, after an advance of 30 miles in 14 days,\nand by the 27th December, the dominating hill\nfeatures in the neighbourhood were in our\npossession. This opened the mouths of the\nMayu and Kywede Rivers for the operations\nof light Naval craft and for sea-borne main-\ntenance. The whole of the south of the penin-\nsula was reported clear of the enemy and the\nBrigade began to concentrate for future\noperations.\n\n148. While 74 Brigade had been making\nrapid progress in the coastal sector, 53 Brigade\nhad been advancing east of the spine with\n82 (West African) Division, moving down the\naxis of the Mayu River. Some determined\ntesistance from enemy covering positions had\nbeen encountered and, in addition, 82 (West\nAfrican) Division had ibeen impeded by adverse\ntidal conditions at major river crossings. After\nthe occupation of Buthidaung and Baguna\n(paragraph 142) 82 (West African) Division\nbegan an opposed crossing of the Kalapanzin\nRiver. The following day, a second surprise\ncrossing was effected a few miles further south,\n‘but the enemy held grimly to the foothills over-\nlooking the road and the advance was checked.\n\n149. While these operations were in progress,\nthe immense task of assembling and launching\nthe large fleet of boats on the Kalapanzin River\n",

On the fleet of\nover 600 craft the maintenance and transport\nof 53 Brigade depended. It will be remem-\nbered (paragraph 140) that they had been\ncollected at Maungdaw and then transported\nacross the Mayu Range, by the hill road and\nits tunnels, to Buthidaung.\n\n150. Meanwhile, by the 18th December,\n53 Brigade had occupied Seinnyinbya, seven\nmiles south of Buthidaung. Leaving a detach-\nment heavily engaged in this area, the Brigade\neffected a double river crossing and occupied\nthe large village of Kwazon on the 21st Decem-\nber; while another detachment advanced,\nagainst opposition, down the east bank of the\nfiver. On the 19th December, 1 Brigade of\n82 (West African) Division to the north made\na great stride forward and occupied Kindaung,\nforcing the crossing of the Saingdin Chaung.\n4 Brigade, released from its protective réle at\nTaung Bazaar, was at this time rounding up\nscattered enemy parties north of Buthidaung,\npreparatory to rejoining the Division in its\nadvance on Htizwe. After securing Kindaung,\n82 (West African) Division encountered stub-\nborn resistance. A number of attacks failed to\ndislodge the enemy rearguards from their\nstrong hill positions, despite concentrated air\nsupport, On the 22nd December, however, the\nenemy was outflanked by a strong force which\nmoved down the river in boats and seized the\nhigh ground north of Zedidaung against stiff\nopposition. From this area, we were able to\noverlook the enemy’s line of retreat and his\nresistance collapsed. The Kalapanzin Plain,\nnorth of the Saingdin Chaung, had been\ncleared of the enemy.\n\n151. On the 27th December, when 74\nBrigade had already reached Foul Point, 53\nBrigade began their last bound. It entailed\nthe crossing of the Mayu River (two miles\nwide), the capture of Rathedaung, and finally\nof Kudaung Island, which was the objective.\nThis island lies due north of Akyab, in the\njunction of the estuaries of the Mayu and\n‘Kywede Rivers. One battalion, ferried from\nKwazon to the west bank of the Mayu, drove\n-on to Pyinshe (seven miles south of Kwazon),\nsweeping prisoners into their net. On the\n29th December, they crossed the river to\nUtizwe, forestalling the West Africans in the\noccupation of this objective. Two days later\n‘they occupied Rathedaung unopposed, after it\nhad been bombarded from tthe sea by the\ndestroyer NEPAL. On the same day (3i1st\nDecember) another battalion occupied\nKudaupg Island, thus fulfilling the Brigade’s\n\n152. The success of all the foregoing opera-\n‘tions of 53 Brigade had been made possible by\nthe fleet of boats already mentioned. Not only\nwere they vital for the supply of the Brigade\n“but they conferred the tactical mobility which\nwas so essential. The great effort which they\n“had involved was fully justified. The task of\nmaintenance of the Brigade still remained.\nNavigational difficulties were not at an end,\nfor the lower Mayu is an arm of the sea rather\nsthan a river, Great assistance ‘was, at this\nstage, rendered by Naval motor launches,\nwhich by the end of the month were able to\nstound Foul Point.\n\n1909\n\n153. On the 17th December, 22 (East African)\nBrigade began to take over the defence of the\nTunnels area, thereby releasing 51 Brigade to\n[mop up a number of bewildered Japanese\ndetachments, who were garrisoning strongholds\non the Mayu Ridge, by-passed by the advance\nof the other two brigades of 25 Indian Division.\nBy the 22nd December, 51 Brigade began to\nspread southwards down ithe coastal plain and\nconcentrate at Indin, where it remained until\nit later rejoined 25 Indian Division in Akyab.\nIt had taken 25 Indian Division less than three\nweeks to secure their final objectives on either\nside of the Mayu Range, a fortnight ahead of\nschedule. The enemy had withdrawn east to\nKanzauk and a large column was known to\nhave moved from there to Myohaung. It thus\nappeared unlikely that 82 (West African)\nDivision would encounter much determined\nTesistance on its way into the Kaladan Valley.\n\n154. Earlier, during their advance down the\nKaladan Valley in the Spring of 1944, 81 (West\nAfrican) Division bad suffered a check at\nKyauktaw. They were unaccustomed to open\ncountry and Kyauktaw lies in a cultivated\nvalley four miles south of the confluence of\nthe Kaladan River and the Pi Chaung. This\ntime it had been planned to cross the river\nnorth of the confluence and to outflank\nKyauktaw to the east, while leaving a holding\nforce on the west bank. This would act as a\nprotective detachment against any counter-\nthrust and mislead the enemy as to our inten-\ntions. Accordingly, on the 4th December,\n6 (West African) Brigade advanced east from\nKyingri on the Pi Chaung, with the intention\nof crossing the Kaladan at a point some ten\nmiles north of the confluence of the two rivers.\nThe first troops of the Brigade made the\ncrossing on the 6th December ; by the 9th the\nwhole of 6 Brigade and Divisional Headquarters\nwere across, and three days later only a detach-\nment of battalion strength remained west of\nthe river. Beyond shelling the bridgehead, the\nJapanese were slow to react to this crossing\nand subsequent concentration, and it was not\nuntil the 15th December that they launched a\nnight attack against 6 Brigade, which was\ncovering the bridgehead. This attack was\nrepulsed after bloody fighting.\n\n155. It should be noted here that the\nJapanese had a heavy preponderance in guns ;\n81 (West African) Division only possessed pack\nartillery, whereas the enemy possessed not only\nfield but a considerable number of medium\nguns. In this close country, air support could\nnot always redress the balance. In order to\nmaintain the momentum of our advance,\ndespite the fact that we were out-gunned, it\nwas desirable to avoid open fighting. It was\ntherefore decided to execute a wide hook\nthrough the hills to the east, by-passing\nThayettabin (through which the road runs from\nKyauktaw) and emerging only to cut the\nenemy’s communications about Myohaung.\n\n156. The advance from the bridgehead\nstarted on the 19th December and the leading\ntroops of 6 Brigade, with 5 (West African)\nBrigade following, were already eight miles\nsouth-east of Tinma on the following day, with\na major left hook developing. A small decep-\ntion detachment was left in the Tinma area for\nseveral days, which successfully diverted the\nenemy’s attention from the main outflanking\n",

The\nenemy had been out-witted and the majority\nof his force, including all his guns, were still\nnorth of Thayettabin, expecting to fight in\nthe area which they had selected.\n\n157. The next few days were spent by 81\n(West African) Division in establishing a firm\nbase in the hills south-east of Thayettabin. The\nJapanese pulled back and concentrated west\nof Point 317—an isolated feature which runs\nparallel to, and just east of, the road\nThayettabin—Myohaung. Despite three days of\nsaturation bombing, from the 29th to 31st\nDecember, and vigorous ground attacks sup-\nported by further air strikes, the new enemy\npositions in this area were not carried till the\n9th January, and then only in the face of a\ndetermined defence.\n\n158. At this stage, 4 Brigade of 82 (West\nAfrican) Division came into the picture. This\nBrigade, moving via Kanzauk, reached\nApaukwa on the 9th January and came under\ncommand of 81 (West African) Division, on the\n10th, for the operation to capture Myohaung.\nMyohaung and Minbya were now the enemy’s\nconcentration areas and there were good\nreasons for anticipating that he would defend\nthis zone strongly. It included the only road\nfit for vehicles ; it covered the flank of their\nactivities 180 miles to the east ; and finally, the\nDalet—An—Minbu track was not yet ready for\ntraffic, and further time was required to com-\nplete its construction. The somewhat abnormal\namount of artillery known to be in the area\nalso indicated the probability of determined\nresistance. Before, however, describing what\nactually happened on this front, it is necessary\nto revert to the operations which took place in\nthe coastal sector.\n\nSection X (paras. 159-185). CAPTURE OF\nAKYAB AND SUBSEQUENT EXPLOITATION\n\nModified plans for the capture of Akyab:\nThe enemy’s withdrawal: The Myebon and\nKangaw operations: The battle for Myo-\nhaung: Operations of the West African\ndivisions.\n\n159. For the past two years planning teams\nhad fbeen studying how best to recapture the\nisland of Akyab by amphibious assault. On\nthe 10th December, I had issued an Operation\nInstruction, based on plans made and instruc-\ntions received before I took over command,\nfor the mounting of an amphibious operation\nfrom Chittagong. 26 Indian Division (Major-\nGeneral C. E. N. Lomax) was earmarked for\nthis assault, which was scheduled to take place\nabout the 15th February but it looked as if\nit might have to be made later, since the land-\ning craft of Naval Assault Force “ W” were\nonly partially assembled. In this original plan\nthe choice of a landing beach caused a good\ndeal of anxiety. The tests recommended by\nthe Scientific Advisers to the Supreme Allied\nCommander had not yielded any conclusive\nresults on the consistency of the ‘beaches, and\ninland swamps and waterways limited the land-\ning places from which deployment was practic-\nable. It was, however, decided that a beach\non the south cost of the island, between\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nFakir Point and Akyab Town, showed most\npromise. It was, however, narrow—about 900\nyards—and looked like restricting the assault\nto a one brigade front. The garrison of the\nisland had been some 2,000 infantry, supported\nby artillery. As usual our Intelligence of the\nenemy garrison was very poor and we later\nfound out that the Japanese had started to\nthin out in the autumn, and by December only\nabout a battalion remained.\n\n160. As described in the last section, our\noffensive in Arakan had opened well, and un-\nexpectedly fast progress had ‘been made. It\nwas essential to maintain this momentum and\ntake full advantage of the enemy weakness.\nThus the situation demanded that quicker, and\ntherefore simpler, ways of capturing the island\nbe devised than the original fairly large-scale\namphibious operation in mid-February or later.\nAccordingly Lieutenant-General Christison,\nwith Rear-Admiral Martin and Air Commodore\nthe Earl of Bandon, prepared new plans. These\nwere considered by the Supreme Allied Com-\nmander, with the Naval and Air Commanders-\nin-Chief and myself, at a conference at my\nAdvanced Headquarters at Barrackpore on the |\n21st December. From the outset it was realised\nthat, in the event of the enemy weakening\nfurther, even these new plans would be too\nslow and elaborate, and it was agreed that if\ncircumstances allowed it, emergency plans for\nthe quickest possible occupation of the island\n—known as Operation “ Lightning ”—should\nbe carried out. The plans for a fully opposed\nlanding were, nevertheless, very carefully\nexamined. It should be remembered that this\noperation was the first combined operation to\nbe undertaken in the theatre, and the import-\nance of its complete success, as affecting the\nsubsequent larger ones we were going to under-\ntake, was very much in the minds of all con-\ncemed.\n\n161. This revised operation took the form of\na river crossing operation using combined\noperations technique, by 25 Indian Division,\non ‘to the north-west corner of the island,\nfollowed by the capture of Akyab town from\nthe landward side. The method to be adopted, -\nand the concept of subsequent operations, may\nbe summarised as follows. The initial landing\nwas to be made by 3 Commando Brigade, half\nof which was composed of Royal Marines,\nmounted in the Naf River, to be followed by\n74 Brigade of 25 Indian Division from Foul\nPoint. Full air and naval support would be\navailable. Meanwhile 53 Brigade of 25 Indian\nDivision was to clear Kudaung Island, which\nlies-to the north of Akyab, and exploit to\nAkyab Island and also eastwards through Ale\nChaung to Ponnagyun on the Kaladan River,\nabout 14 miles from its mouth. 25 Indian\nDivision was then to exploit success, seizing\nall commanding ground on the Boronga Islands,\nand on the Pauktaw Peninsula to their north.\nIt was then to advance by way of the rivers and\nestablish a base south-east of Minbya, prior\nto attacking Myebon. 82 (West African) Divi-\nsion, after relieving 81 (West African) Division,\nwas to clear the area south of Kyauktaw and\njoin 25 Indian Division at Minbya.\n\n162. It must be remembered that, when the\nabove revised plan was decided on, our offen-\nsive, though going well, was still in its early\nstages. On the 21st December, when the\n",

It was therefore quite possible that\na fair proportion of the Japanese forces in the\nMayu Peninsula might withdraw on Akyab,\nand that we might have to land against a re-\ninforced garrison totalling some 4,000 men.\nThere was every reason for supposing that the\nenemy would not surrender the island without\na struggle—not because it was vital to them,\nbut because of its strategical value to us. Apart\nfrom its political importance as an administra-\ntive centre for liberated areas, its possession\nwould enable us to assist our forces driving\nsouth down the Kaladan. It would provide\nus with a forward base, which was becoming\nincreasingly necessary now that Cox’s Bazaar\nwas 100 miles in rear of our forward troops.\nOur nearest railhead, Chittagong, was about\n70 miles further back still. Finally, transcend-\ning even the importance of the port and har-\nbour, there were the airfield potentialities of\nthe island. An air base was essential both for\nthe support of further operations in Arakan\nand, above all, for the maintenance of Four-\nteenth Army in Central Burma.\n\n163. The situation on the 1st January neces-\nsitated further modification of the plan, which\nhad already been anticipated. The Akyab\ngarrison was known to have been further\nweakened, although to what extent was still\nuncertain. 25 Indian Division had .reached\nFoul Point, Rathedaung and Kudaung Island\nwell ahead of schedule. 81 (West African)\nDivision was successfully containing the enemy\nby its pressure in the Kaladan. It was, there-\nfore, imperative to block the Japanese Minbya—\nMyebon escape route as early as possible. The\nimmediate possession of Akyab thus became\nessential to our further progress, and the\nquickest emergency plan for its capture was put\ninto action. 3 Commando Brigade, mounted in\nthe Naf River as previously planned, was to\ncarry out an assault landing on the north-\nwestern beaches of the island, supported by\nsuch naval and air bombardment as could be\nprepared at short notice. Simultaneously 53\nBrigade was to cross the two mile wide mouth\nof the Kywede River in country craft, from\nKudaung Island. 74 Brigade would be ferried\nacross the four mile wide Mayu estuary from\nFoul Point and follow up 3 Commando\nBrigade. D-Day was fixed for the 3rd January.\n\n164. On the 2nd January, an artillery officer\nin an air O.P. over Akyab, seeing no signs of\nthe enemy, landed on the airstrip in the centre\nof the island. He was informed by the local\ninhabitants that the enemy had left. The ques-\ntion, of course, immediately arose as to whether\nthe assault landing should go in as planned. I\ninsisted that it should, except that there would\nbe no sea and air bombardment unless such\nsupport was called for. To have changed the\nplan at this juncture would have [involved\ndelay, and, also, it was not certain that the\nJapanese had evacuated the whole island—the\npossibility of some opposition in the coastal\nareas remained. My experience in the past\nhad always been that, in cases when opposition\nbas suddenly given way, one should still go\nin on the original battle front, though without\nthe planned supporting fire. If, instead, the\nadvance is changed to something resembling an\n\n1911\n\nadvanced guard, time is bound to be wasted\nwhen the necessity for redeploying occurs, and\nmomentum is consequently lost.\n\n165. The operation, therefore, proceeded as\nplanned in its final form (para. 161). Neither\nlanding was opposed and Akyab Town was\noccupied on the 4th, our troops receiving a\nrousing reception.\n\nPatrols found the Boronga Islands and the\nPauktaw Peninsula clear of the enemy. Work\non the airfields began immediately and, as a\nresult, a squadron of Spitfires was able to fly\nin just in time to punish the first enemy air\nattack on shipping in the harbour on 9th\nJanuary, by shooting down five out of six of\nthe Japanese aircraft.\n\n166. It was learnt that the Japanese had\nevacuated Akyab Island 48 hours prior to our\narrival. The last elements—a battalion and\nsome anti-aircraft troops—had proceeded to\nPonnagyun on the west bank of the Kaladan\nRiver. Two battalions of 53 Brigade, follow-\ning in rapid pursuit, had a sharp engagement\nwith these troops, forcing the main body to fall\nback across the river. Despite their heavy\ncasualties, however, this force made a spirited\nattempt on the night of the 9th January to\nrescue their compatriots still marooned on the\nwest bank. They effected a landing from\narmoured landing craft but most of these were\nsunk, and the attempt ended in disaster.\n\n167. In order to maintain contact, and to\noblige the enemy to keep troops facing west,\nthe detachment (two battalions) of 53 Brigade,\nmentioned above, was then directed towards\nMinbya. After a series of chaung crossings, it\nreached the Thinganet River at a point four\nmiles south-west of Minbya. A number of\nsharp actions disclosed that the Japanese were\nholding the area between tue Thinganet and\nYede Rivers, just west of Minbya and covering\ntheir road L. of C. to Mychaung. It had\nalways been the intention that we shduld ex-\nploit to Minbya and Myebon directly Akyab\nhad been secured. Now that Akyab was in our\nhands and probing towards Minbya: already\nbegun, the opportunity had been created to\nblock the Japanese L. of C. Before dealing\nwith this phase of operations, however, I wish\nto say a final word about Akyab.\n\n168. The final capture of the island may\nat first appear as something of an anti-climax\nafter all the preparations and planning that it\nhad at various times involved. A project which\nhad originally been planned as a fairly con-\nsiderable combined operation became an un-\nopposed river crossing. Nevertheless [ would\nlike to dispel this impression, and to stress the\nSignificance of this operation apart from the\nstrategic gain of Akyab itself (which I have\nalready mentioned in para. 162). The original\ndate for the full-scale assault was the 15th\nFebruary and, at one time, it looked as if a\nthree weeks’ postponement might be necessary\nowing to lack of the resources required. It\nwas the tireless efforts and moral ascendency\nof our men in the early stages of the offensive,\nas well as the bold and efficient handling of\nthe campaign by Lieutenant-General Christison\nand his Naval and Air colleagues, which made\nit possible and necessary continually to ante-\ndate D-Day, until the landings were finally\nmade some six weeks before 15th February.\nThe Japanese evacuated Akyab not because\n",

The\nbattle that might have been fought on Akyab\nbeaches, and which we should rejoice was not,\nhad already been won in the jungles to the\nnorth. The Japanese were fully alive to the\nvalue of Akyab to us: it can in fact be said\nthat their evacuation of the island reflected\ntheir reactions to battles fought elsewhere in\nBurma during the previous six months.\nFinally, here again I had it forcibly brought\nhome to me how poor our Intelligence was\nin this theatre. It was not until a very short\ntime before Akyab fell that we realised, for\nthe first time, the weakness of the Japanese in\nArakan. The real state of the Akyab garrison\nwe never knew.\n\n169. On the 12th January, one week after\nthe occupation of Akyab, 3 Commando Brigade\n(consisting of Nos. 1 and 5 Army Commandos\nand Nos. 42 and 44 Royal Marine Com-\nmandos), and 74 Brigade (25 Indian Division),\ncarried in craft of the Royal Indian Navy,\nand supported by naval and air bombardment,\nmounted an operation from Akyab and made\na successful, but opposed, landing on the\nMyebon Peninsula, 35 miles east-south-east\nof Akyab. Complete surprise was effected\nand a bridgehead quickly established. The\nNaval Forces were commanded by Captain\nD. C. Hill, R.N. Naval bombardments were\ncarried out by H.MIS. NARBADA and\nJUMNA. This move rendered the position of\nall the Japanese forces in Arakan, north of\nMyebon, precarious. They had either to with-\ndraw through the bottleneck east of Myebon,\nvia Kangaw, or face destruction. The original\nintention was that 74 Brigade should advance\nup the various chaungs and capture Minbya\nfrom the south, after the Myebon Peninsula\nhad been cleared, Jt was now essential to cut\noff the enemy troops still in the Kaladan and\nto relieve the pressure on 81 (West African)\nDivision.\n\n170. By the 13th January Myebon itself and\nthe high ground to the west had been occupied\nby 74 Brigade with tank support against in-\ncreasing enemy resistance, and exploitation\nnorth through Kantha and east towards\nKangaw began. At this stage, Naval launches\nsuccessfully co-operated by patrolling the\nchaungs, sinking twenty of the enemy’s supply\ncraft besides a number of sampans. The\nJapanese reacted sharply to this disruption of\ntheir communications, sending four relatively\nheavily armed assault craft into action against\nthe naval motor Jaunches. The enemy ships\nwere promptly sunk. At a later stage, too, the\nsmall Naval craft materially assisted in bringing\nabout the eventual destruction of the enemy\nforce north of Myebon.\n\n171. There followed a week of severe fight-\ning against the strongest enemy concentration\nthat the troops of 25 Indian Division had yet\nencountered. Kantha was occupied on the\n17th January, and the enemy driven from an\nimportant hill feature to the north of it. By\nthe 21st, 74 Brigade had reached a line\nrunning east and west two miles north of\nKantha. This effectively sealed off the Myebon\nPeninsula and the mouth of the Myebon River.\nIt remained to cut the enemy’s other avenues\nof escape in this area. These were the water\nroute down the Daingbon Chaung, and the vital\nroad to the east of it, which runs north and\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nsouth through Kangaw. Recent air recon-\nnaissance and captured documents had shown,\nthat a series of strong enemy defences existed\nfrom Kangaw Village (which lies nearly eight\nmiles north-east of Myebon on the main and\nonly road), across to the hills on the opposite\nside of the river to the Myebon Peninsula. This\ndefence system faced north and north-east,\neffectively blocking the approach to Kangaw\nfrom that direction. It was, therefore, decided\nto cancel the projected advance of 74 Brigade\nby chaung route to Minbya, leaving it to deal\nwith the enemy on its immediate front, and to\nmove a force by water from Myebon south\ndown the Myebon River and then up the\nDaingbon Chaung, thus out-flanking the main\nJapanese positions, though the whole area con-\ntained defences. The landing was to be effected\nas close to Kangaw as possible and, relying\non a brief period of tactical surprise, a swift\nadvance made to cut the road. The troops most\nreadily available for this opetation were 51\nBrigade of 25 Indian Division, which had been\nbrought forward to Akyab from Indin, with\n3 Commando Brigade under command. 14\nBrigade was to continue its exploitation to-\nwards Minbya under the direct command of\n15 Indian Corps, and 53 Brigade was brought\nforward to Myebon.\n\n172. The objective—the main road where it\nskirts the foothills just north of Kangaw—was,\nas indicated above, too strongly defended to\ninvite approach by any overland route. The\ndirect water approach, via the Myebon and\nKyaukngamaw Rivers, was _ completely\ndominated by enemy hill positions near\nZinyawmaw. The only alternative was to put\nout into Hunter’s Bay, turn east through the\nThegyan River, and then north up the\nDaingbon Chaung to a selected landing place\ntwo miles south-west of Kangaw Village. This\nroute lay through 20 miles of tortuous water-\nways and mangrove swamps in the heart of\nenemy occupied country. It had one supreme\nadvantage however; any approach from this\ndirection was likely to be unexpected. It was\nonly due to naval surveys that this route could\nbe used at all.\n\n173. On the 22nd January a naval force\ncommanded by Captain D. C. Hill, RN.,\nlanded 3 Commando Brigade as Gianned, on\nthe east bank of the Daingbon Chaung, two\nmiles from Kankaw.- This landing achieved\ncomplete tactical surprise, but was hampered\nby very difficult conditions of thick mud and\nmangrove swamps which prevented the early\nputting ashore of guns and tanks. Moreover,\nthe position was made worse by the fact that\nwe occupied a narrow strip of flat, open\ncountry, largely flooded, while the enemy over-\nlooked our area from positions on jungle-clad\nfeatures on which accurate artillery fire\ncould not easily be brought to bear. Naval\nbombardments in support of the Army were\ncarried out by the NARBADA and JUMNA,\nand close support was given by motor launches\nand support craft.\n\n174, The ensuing week was to see some of the\nheaviest fighting of the whole Burma campaign.\nThe Japanese quickly reacted to the threat\nwhich we had produced. By their prepara-\ntions for the defence of Kangaw, they had\nalready shown that they appreciated the im-\nportance of the area. Our unexpected landing,\n",

The enemy\nresisted fiercely from extremely strong bunker\nposition, and continued to build up against us.\n\n175, Starting on the 25th January, a three\n\ndays’ air offensive was arranged to soften\nup the main hill features commanding the\nroad. The bombing was well concentrated\nand accurate, and 51 Brigade attacked\non the 28th. One battalion reached and\ncaptured an under-feature near Kangaw\nVillage, but was later called off by the\nBrigade Commander as the feature proved\nto be completely dominated from the east.\nAnother battalion secured a precarious footing\non a small feature further east, and held on\ndespite strong counter-attacks. On the 28th\nJanuary alone, the enemy fired about 1,000\nshells into our restricted positions, using guns\nof all calibres, including 150-millimetre and\n25-pounders, the latter presumably captured in\nMalaya.\nevitable, including some divisional troops.\n_ 176. It had become evident that the enemy\ndefences protecting the road were stronger than\noriginally anticipated. It was, therefore, de-\ncided to abandon further attacks on the hill\nfeatures north of the road and concentrate\nour forces on the right flank, where, by secur-\ning Kangaw Village and the hills to the east\nof it, the object of effectively blocking the road\ncould be achieved. A strong enemy counter-\nattack on the night 28th-29th January was re-\npulsed with loss. On the 29th, we drove the\nenemy from Kangaw Village and captured the\nsmall hill which dominated it, and from which\nany movement on the road could be prevented\nby fire. On the early morning of the 31st\nJanuary, the Japanese launched the most\ndesperate attack of the whole Arakan cam-\npaign, but gained no ground and received\nsevere punishment. It was now eleven days\nsince the initial assault on Kangaw had been\nmade, a period in which our field, medium and\nNaval artillery, together with the Thunderbolts\nand Spitfires of the R.A.F, had hammered the\nenemy without intermission. The capture of\nKangaw and of an important hill to the east of\nit which had followed on the Ist February,\nmarked the turning point of the battle; the\nenemy’s escape road from Myohaung and\nMinbya had been finally cut. 51 Brigade then\nsecured a dominating position north of the\nroad, which effectively prevented any possi-\nbility of a break-through from the north. As\nwill be seen later, 82 (West African) Division\nhad already begun their task of driving the\nJapanese up against this block. This result\ncould not have been achieved without the work\nof Naval craft and beach parties, which con-\ntinued to land supplies under heavy fire.\n\n177. I have dealt with this action in some\ndetail both in justice to the gallantry and en-\ndurance displayed by our troops and in view\nof_ its strategical importance. It provides a\nstriking illustration of the principle, that, if you\nwish to bring a retreating enemy to battle,-you\nmust hit him where he is most sensitive. This\n\n60332\n\nConsiderable casualties were in-*\n\n1913\n\nwe did, by cutting the only road escape route\nfor all the Japanese forces to the north. In\ntheir struggle to regain this vital area the\nJapanese threw in three regiments, as well as\nDivisional and Army troops. They suffered\nat least 2,000 killed and lost 16 guns, 15 large\nmotor craft, and quantities of other equipment.\nAgainst this, our casualties were under 600\nand the morale of 3 Commando Brigade and\n51 Indian Infantry Brigade, after six days of\nthe most gruelling hand-to-hand fighting, was\nvery high.\n\n178. On the Ist February, part of 74 Brigade\ncrossed the Min Chaung from the neck of the\nMyebon Peninsula, and, after establishing\nthemselves on the east bank, launched opera-\ntions against the Japanese positions two miles\nnorth-west of Kangaw. Faced with encircle-\nment by the rapid advance south of 82 (West\nAfrican) Division (which I will shortly de-\nscribe), the enemy began to withdraw into the\nmountains to the east. By the 8th February,\nthe leading brigade {the 2nd) of 82 (West\nAfrican) Division was in contact with the\nenemy nine miles north of Kangaw, but the\nJapanese continued to resist as the jaws of the\ntrap closed. On the 9th, 2 (West African)\nBrigade passed under command of 25 Indian\nDivision and a series of co-ordinated attacks\nwere made on successive enemy positions. It\ntook another nine days before the whole area\nwas cleared. The toll of captured guns rose\nto 26, but the enemy threw all their remaining\nartillery into the chaungs, and gun muzzles\nprotruding from the water bore silent witness\nto the magnitude of the Japanese disaster.\n\n179. 51 Brigade of 25 Indian Division and\n3 Commando Brigade were now withdrawn\nfrom operations, as part of the phasing-out\nprogramme of 15 Indian Corps, which was to\ntake place before the monsoon. 53 Brigade,\nafter completing its task of clearing the chaung\ncountry between Akyab and Minbya, had\nalready been concentrated in Myebon. Thus\n25 Indian Division was left with two brigades\nin the area, the 53rd and the 74th.\n\n180. While operations to close the Japanese\nescape Toad at Kangaw were in progress, the\nWest Africans were engaged in driving the\nenemy in the.Kaladan Valley south on to the\nKangaw block. It will be recalled (vide para-\ngraphs 157 and 158) that by the 10th January,\n81 (West African) Division was fighting in the\nhills about 15 miles north-north-west of\nMyohaung, with 4 Brigade of 82 (West African)\nDivision under command, at Apaukwa, which\nlies on the Kaladan River 16 miles north-west\nof Myohaung. Care had to be taken at this\nstage to avoid forcing the enemy into making\na too early withdrawal before the trap was\nclosed by 25 Indian Division in his rear. The\nKangaw landing was timed for the 22nd\nJanuary, and it was therefore decided to clear\nMyohaung by a determined drive on the 25th.\n\n181. Operations southwards towards\nMyohaung began on the 15th January. By\nthe 19th, Teinnyo had been occupied, and our\nforward troops were established six miles north\nof Myohaung. Opposition continued stubborn\nfor the next four days, particularly east of the\ntoad, and there were no signs of the enemy\ntesistance weakening, though we continued to\npress forward. Early on the 23rd January,\n\nCc\n",

Urgent orders were issued to 1 Brigade\nof 82 (West African) Division, which was now\nnear Kanzauk (on the Yo River), to move\nsouth to Yotarok (12 miles south of Apaukwa)\nand then to advance on Myohaung and the road\nMyohaung—Minbya, from the west. Simul-\ntaneously, 2. (West African) Brigade, engaged\nin protecting the Forward Maintenance Area at\nButhidaung, was directed: to hand over this\ntesponsibility to 22 (East African) Brigade\nand to rejoin 82 (West African) Division in the\nMyohaung area. Both these Brigades moved\nwith great speed, 1 Brigade arriving to take\npart in the final phase of the Myohaung opera-\ntions on the 24th January, on which date 81\n(West African) Division completed the occupa-\ntion of al] the commanding features north of\nthe town and east of the Lemro River, while\n82 (West African) Division (1 Brigade) seized\na dominating feature five miles south of the\ntown, after an air attack.

Loftus-Tottenham\nand 81 (West African) Division had thus com-\npleted their task. The Division was now with-\ndrawn to Chiringa, north of Cox’s Bazaar,\nwhere it was concentrated until its final with-\ndrawal. For more than four months the\nDivision had advanced through most difficult\ncountry, against continuous opposition. The\nenemy had been obliged to weaken his Mayu\nand Akyab garrisons in an attempt to stem\nthis threat to his Minbya L. of C., which\nserved all his forces in Arakan. With no land\nlines of communication, and little physical con-\ntact with the outside world, 81 (West African)\nDivision (which it must ibe remembered only\nconsi of two brigades), had out-manceuvred\nand out-fought parts of the Japanese 54th and\n55th Divisions and cleared the greater part\nof the Kaladan Valley.\n\n184. 82 (West African) Division (Major-\nGeneral H. C. Stockwell, who had succeeded\nMajor-General Bruce on the 12th January)\ntook up the advance south ofMinbya encounter-\ning only slight opposition, The situation on\nthe 30th January was that one battalion of\n53 Brigade (25 Indian Division) was operating\nwest of the town, the remainder of 53 Brigade\nhaving been transferred to Myebon. 82 (West\nAfrican) Division had its Divisiona] Recon-\nnaissance Regiment and its Anti-Tank Regi-\nment west of the Lemro River, and these were\ninvesting the town from the north. The rest\nof the Division, east of the river, was advanc-\ning on Hpontha. But the garrison at Minbya\ndid not wait to be assaulted.

Minbya was occupied on the 2nd\nFebruary. Forward elements of 82 (West\nAfrican) Division were now in contact with the\nenemy from Zibingyi to Hipontha, 20 miles\nnorth of Kangaw. Here the Divisional Com-\nmander divided his forces, pushing south from\nHpontha on the 3rd February. 1 and 4 Brigades\nwere directed on Kyweguseik in order to inter-\ncept the Japanese forces withdrawing from\nKangaw. I will deal later with this phase of\nthe operations. 2 (West African) Brigade\npushed south on to the Kangaw block, over-\ncoming considerable opposition. As already re-\ncorded, they passed under command of 25\nIndian Division on the 9th February, when -\nwithin nine miles of Kangaw. By the 14th\nFebruary, they were driving the enemy from\nthe high ground north of the road; and the\njunction of the two geographical divisions of\nthe Arakan campaign had been effected.\n\nSection XI (panas. 186-211). THE EXTENSION\n\nOF THE ARAKAN CAMPAIGN\n\nReasons for the extension of the campaign:\nThe capture of Ramree and Cheduba: New\ninstructions to the Commander, 15 Indian\nCorps: The new plan and its subsequent modi-\nfication: The withdrawal of 25 Indian Division:\nThe Letpan landing: Occupation of Taungup.\n\n186. After the capture of Akyab and Myebon,\nwe had reached our original objectives. The\nclearing of the Minbya area was only a matter\nof time. As was described in the last section,\nwe were exploiting these gains to the maximum,\nbut, nevertheless, the campaign as originally\nplanned was virtually completed. A new situa-\ntion, however, had been created by the speedy\nand successful advance of Fourteenth Army\njn Central Burma. <A decisive victory in the\nMandalay Plain would make the prize of\nRangoon a possibility. Everything had to be\nconcentrated on helping on Fourteenth\nArmy. Other operations in Burma became sub-\nsidiary. The first and major way in which\nFourteenth Army could be helped was by\ndirecting all possible means towards increasing\nthe supply tonnage which they received, and\nsince all other supply lines were working to\nfullest capacity, this meant increasing their\nsupply by air. By their advance, Fourteenth\nArmy had left their main air supply bases,\nwhich were in the Imphal and Chittagong areas,\nfar behind. By the establishment of new and\ncloser supply bases, giving a shorter journey,\nthe tonnage could be materially increased for\nthe same number of available aircraft, Akyab,\nand Ramree Island to the south were the best\navailable places for these new air supply bases,\nas, in addition to giving a shorter flying\ndistance, they were reasonably easy of access\nby sea. There were, however, a number of\ndifficulties, which will be discussed later. The\nfirst task of 15 Indian Corps was therefore to\ndevelop to the maximum these air supply bases.\nThe second way in which 15 Indian Corps\ncould assist Fourteenth Army was by containing\nthe maximum number of troops in the coastal\nsector, including those further south in the\nTaungup, Sandoway and Bassein areas. This.\nmeant continued offensive action. At the same\ntime the original object—the withdrawal of -\n",

Our resources, particularly in harbour-\ncraft, severely limited the rate at which these\nstocks could be built-up, and we were working\nto a very small margin of time before the\nmonsoon broke.\n\n187. The next step in the extension of the\ncampaign was, then, the capture of Ramree\nIsland, which lies some 70 miles to the south-\neast of Akyab. The acquisition of Ramree\nwould deprive the enemy of a vital link in his\ninland water communications, on which he was\nso dependent, and furnish us with a valuable\nforward sea and air base. The harbour of\nKyaukpyu, at the north end of the island,\nprovided sheltered anchorage for large ships,\nand an all-weather airstrip to operate transport\nsquadrons for the maintenance of Fourteenth\nArmy could be constructed. The particular\nimportance of the establishment of an air\nsupply base on Ramree Island lay in the follow-\ning facts. It shortened the air-lift journey as\nalready stated, thus allowing more sorties by\nthe available aircraft, The mountain barrier\nbetween Ramree and Fourteenth Army’s lines\nof advance was lower than that which had\nto be crossed in the flight from Akyab, a\nmatter of great importance with the approach\nof the monsoon. The airfield capacity of Akyab\nalone was not great enough, as the fair-weather\nfields had to be put into action as soon as\npossible to relieve the present air supply situa-\ntion, while with the approach of the monsoon,\nall-weather airfields had to be built so that\nair supply could continue as far as possible\nduring the rains.\n\n188. The plan was to launch a seaborne\nassault against Ramree, using 26 Indian\nDivision, which had been trained, but not\nused, to carry out a similar operation against\nAkyab, and then to effect a landing on Cheduba\nIsland, 12 miles to the south-west, with a\nforce of Royal Marines. The timing of this\noperation in relation to the rest of the opera-\ntions in Arakan is worth noting. On the 21st\nJanuary we assaulted Ramree, on the 22nd we\nlanded at Kangaw, while the Myebon operation\nwas still in progress. Three days later the West\nAfricans (81 Division) captured Myohaung in\nthe Kaladan Valley. Under such pressure the\nJapanese command must have been in no\nsmall difficulty.\n\n189. Strong Naval Forces under the com-\nmand of Rear-Admiral B. C. S. Martin trans-\nported 71 and’ 4 Brigades (26 Indian Division)\nfrom Chittagong, and landed the troops at\nKyaukpyu on the 21st January under cover\nof a heavy Naval and Adr bombardment. The\nNaval bombardment force consisted of the\nQUEEN ELIZABETH, fiying the flag of\nVice-Admiral H. T. C. Walker, PHOEBE,\nRAPID, NAPIER, FLAMINGO and\nKISTNA. For the first time an Aircraft\ncarrier, the AMEER, took part in Burmese\noperations, her aircraft spotting for the\nQUEEN ELIZABETH. The whole of\nKyaukpyu village was in our hands by night-\nfall. On the next day, the Brigades started\nto move south, and, by the 24th, they had\nadvanced 30 miles down the west coast, to\n\n60332, .\n\n1915\n\nwithin three miles of the formidable Yanbauk\nChaung. Although the Japanese fought\ntenaciously, we recaptured a number of British\n25-pounder guns. It was apparent, however,\nthat the northern part of the island was ‘not\nbeing held in strength. Incidentally, the local\ninhabitants gave our advancing troops the\ngreatest welcome they had had since the com-\nmencement of the campaign.\n\n190. On the 26th January a force of 500\nRoyal Marines, supported by a Naval Squadron\nconsisting of the NEWCASTLE, wearing the\nflag of Rear-Admiral A. D. Read, KENYA,\nNIGERIA, PHOEBE, AMEER and four\ndestroyers, landed’ on Cheduba Island. The\nMarines met with no resistance. It had not\nbeen expected that the Marines would be able\nto clear the whole island and they were to be\nrelieved after landing by 36 Brigade (26 Indian\nDivision) ; but this actually proved to be un-\nnecessary. The other tasks allotted to 36\nBrigade were to capture the small island of\nSagu Kyun, south of Ramree, which it accom-\nplished on 30th January under cover of the\nfire of NORMAN and RAIDER, who\nsilenced enemy guns, and then to assault the\nsouthern end of Ramree itself, and exploit\nnorthwards.\n\n191. On the night of the 26th, and again on\nthe 28th, 71 Brigade made two unsuccessful\nattempts to cross the Yanbauk Chaung. The\nenemy were obviously determined to hold this\nexcellent natural obstacle. It was, therefore,\ndecided to leave a holding detachment on the\nnorthern bank and to switch the axis of ad-\nvance north-eastwards, towards Sane on the\neast coast. On the Ist February, 36 Brigade\nlanded on the southern tip of Ramree against\nonly slight opposition. The same day, the\nJapanese in the Sane area were subjected to\nheavy bombardment by the Royal Indian\nNavy. On the 2nd February, leading elements\nof 71 Brigade drove the enemy out of Sane.\n\n192. In the meantime 22 (East African)\nBrigade were transferred from Akyab to\nKyaukpyu, thus releasing 4 Brigade of 26\nIndian Division for more active operations\nfurther south. 4 Brigade forced a crossing of\nthe Yanbauk Chaung on the 6th February.\nThe enemy were now trapped by the\nthree-pronged advance of 71 Brigade due\nsouth from Sane, 4 Brigade south and east\nfrom the Yanbauk Chaung, and 36 Brigade\nnorth and north-west, after its landing in the\nsouth. They were being driven towards Ramree\ntown, in the south-east corner of the island,\nwhence their escape was cut off by the Naval\nblockade under the orders of Captain E. W.\nBush, R.N. On the 8th February, 71 Brigade\nhad reached the hills north of Ramree. There\nthey were heavily engaged, though a patrol\nwhich entered the town itself that afternoon\nwas informed that it had been evacuated. The\nenemy were, however, unable to stop our tanks\nand, by the 9th, they were driven from their\npositions overlooking the town—the Japanese\ndefence, determined as it had been, had failed,\nbut they made a final effort to break the sea\nblockade and extricate their garrison. On the\nevening of the 11th February, they launched an\nair attack on our two destroyers, which were\nguarding the sea approaches. Under cover of\nthis diversion, forty powered craft left Taung-\nup to rescue their troops in Ramree. The\n\nC2\n",

Four actually got through,\nbut were sunk on the return trip with all hands.\nBy the 15th February, all organised resistance\non Ramree Island had ceased, but mopping up\ncontinued for some time.\n\n193. Earlier, on the 25th January, I had\nissued orders to the Commander, 15 Indian\nCorps, extending his tasks in accordance with\nwhat has been discussed earlier in paragraph\n\nI directed him now to: —\n(@ Clear the Japanese out of Northern\nand Central Arakan.\n(b) Establish a bridgehead at Taungup.\n(c) Open the road from Taungup to Prome\nif possible.\n@) Develop the air bases at Akyab and\nKyaukpyu.\nThe last task had precedence over the others\nand I laid down that their accomplishment was\nnot to interfere with this commitment.\n\nAs already pointed out, the construction had\nto include both fair-weather airfields to meet\nour present needs, and all-weather fields to\nallow air supply to continue during the\nmonsoon. These requirements not unnaturally\nconflicted. The target for all-weather con-\nstruction was accommodation for three trans-\nport squadrons at Akyab by the end of April\nand three at Kyaukpyu by mid-May. In fact\nwe managed to get three squadrons working\nfrom all-weather bases in each place in early\nMay. The fair-weather bases were wanted as\nearly as possible and by the 20th March there\nwere two transport squadrons working from\nAkyab, with two more eleven days later. During\nApril, half a squadron operated from Kyaukpyu\nfor the supply of troops in Arakan only. I\nmake no apology for going into this matter\nof airfields in some detail, as the responsibility\nfor their construction, as of the great majority\nof the others in the theatre, rested with the\nArmy, as did their stocking and subsequent\nsupply. .\n\n194. It will be noticed that in the instructions\ngiven in the preceding paragraph, the Com-\nmander, 15 Indian Corps, was ordered to open\nthe Taungup—Prome road if possible. This\nlooked an attractive-enough project on the map,\nas it appears to give direct access from the\nsea to the Irrawaddy Valley. In practice, how-\never, it was a very doubtful proposition. It\nwas only a fair-weather road, the greater\npart passing through the thickest bamboo\njungle. Taungup, the sea terminal, was no\nport, merely a village up a narrow winding\ncreek, ‘with a landing place on a bend in the\ncreek. Ships bringing supplies would have to\nanchor a long way off and the passage up the\ncreeks would be made by lighters and other\nharbour craft. The latter ‘were not available\nin the quantity required, after the needs of\nAkyab and Ramree had been met. The road\nitself required very extensive engineer work and\nthe time factor alone precluded the road paying\nany dividend before the monsoon ; moreover\nunless the road was made all-weather before\nthe rains, it would be closed for the whole\nperiod of the monsoon. . In actual: fact, our\ntroops did not pass over this road until after\ntthe 1945 monsoon. Finally, if the road was\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nto be opened, the operations necessary to do\nthis in a reasonable time had to be given some\nair supply ; this we could not do.\n\n195. By early February, the Japanese main\nforces had been split up into two groups. The\nNorthern Group was in the Dalet Chaung—An\narea, covering the An Pass. The Southern\nGroup was in the Taungup area, covering the\nTaungup Pass. The enemy also had troops\nin the Sandoway area, in the Bassein delta,\nand in the Prome—Henzada area, which were\nwithin reach of the Arakan front. Our own\ntroops at this time (early February) were located\nas follows. 25 Indian Division was engaged\non the general line Kangaw—Myebon, with 82\n(West African) Division driving the enemy\nsouth on to this line. 3 Commando Brigade\nwas concentrated in Myebon, after five weeks\nhard fighting. 26 Indian Division, with 22\n(East African) Brigade under command, was\nclearing up Ramree Island, and, in addition,\nraiding the Japanese road communications\nbetween the An Chaung and Taungup, with a\nview to ascertaining the intentions of the\nJapanese garrison in that area.\n\n196. As indicated above, the operations of\n15 Indian Corps were directed, not merely to\nclearing Arakan, but to containing the enemy\nand to preventing them from crossing the\nYomas and interfering with the advance of\nFourteenth Army. It was, by this time, almost\ncertain that the Japanese were using the An\nPass road and that they intended to withdraw\ntheir Northern Group (54 Division) by that\nroute. General Christison’s task was, there-\nfore, to frustrate this plan, and, also, to threaten\nthe Taungup Pass to prevent the enemy’s\nSouthern Group (55 Division) being diverted\nto fight Fourteenth Army. this task, the\nR.A.F. were to assist by intensive bombing of\nthe Taungup—Prome road with the object of\nproducing landslides in certain vulnerable\nmountain sections of it. I may add here that\nthis was successfully achieved, the road being\nrendered impassable for long periods.\n\n197. My intention was that 15 Indian Corps\nshould destroy 54 Japanese Division in the An\narea and contain 55 Japanese Division by\nthrusting inland from Taungup on the axis of\nthe Taungup-Prome road. Unfortunately, as\nwill appear later, the,plan to destroy 54 Japan-\nese Division had in the end to be abandoned\nowing to shortage of transport aircraft.\nEncircling operations—the only type which\ncould sucessfully destroy the enemy in the thick\nArakan jungle country—were only possible if\nsupplied. by air, which would enable our forces\nto be independent of a land L. of C.\n\n198. General Christison decided first to\ndestroy the Northern Group, in the Dalet\nChaung—aAn area, by a pincer movement of 25\nand 82 Divisions, then to eliminate the\nSouthern Group, in the Taungup area, by a\nsimilar pincer movement of 82 (West African)\nDivision from the north and 26 Indian Divi-\nsion from the coast. The exploitation up the\nProme road could then follow. To ease the\nmaintenance problem and assist the vital build-\nup of air bases, 81 (West African) Division and\n50 Tank Brigade (less two squadrons) were to\nleave Arakan at once, and a provisional pro-\ngramme for the evacuation of other formations\nwas prepared, -\n",

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\n199. It will be recalled (vide paragraph 185)\nthat, by the 9th February, 2 Brigade of 82\n(West African) Division had nearly reached\nKangaw, while 1 and 4 Brigades were en route\nfrom Hpontha to Kyweguseik to intercept the\nJapanese forces withdrawing from Kangaw.\n82 (West African) Division (less 2 Brigade)\nwas now directed to advance on An with\npossible speed, leaving a detachment to mask\nKyweguseik, which was found to be strongly\nheld. Maintenance would be by air, since they\nwould be going through some of the thickest\nand most mountainous country in the whole\nof Arakan. While 82 (West African) Division\nwas continuing its difficult approach march to-\nwards An, 53 Brigade (25 Indian Division) was\nto make yet another landing, this time at Ru-\nYwa, a village some 14 miles due west of An.\n2 (West African) Brigade, from Kangaw, was\nthen to pass through this bridgehead and\nadvance on An from the south-west, thus\nforming the southern arm of the pincer move-\nment against this village, the northern arm\nbeing formed by the other two brigades of\n82 (West African) Division. After 2 (West\nAfrican) Brigade had passed through the\nbridgehead, 74 Brigade of 25 Indian Division\nwas to land and, advancing north up the coast,\ncapture Tamandu, a village three miles east of\nthe enemy’s inland water transport base of\nKantaunggyi, and the western terminus of the\nroad to An. 25 Indian Division was also\ndirected to find a small pursuit force to\nfollow up its success at Kangaw, which\nwas to press rapidly south, through\nKyweguseik, on to Tamandu from the north.\nThis secondary pincer movement was designed\nto destroy fhe large body of enemy troops\nknown to have been virtually trapped in that\narea.\n\n200. It was also decided to carry out a com-\nbined naval and artillery bombardment of\nTamandu while the Ru-Ywa operation was be-\ning mounted. This had the double object of\nriveting the Japanese commander’s attention\n. to this area (since it was known that the enemy\nthere expected attack), and of destroying im-\nportant installations. This ‘bombardment,\nwhich wags cafried out by the NARBADA,\nKISTNA, JUMNA and FLAMINGO, began\non the 5th February and lasted for ten days\nand nights. The area was utterly wrecked and,\nlater, when the Ru-Ywa landing was made, it\nbecame apparent that, as a deception measure,\nthis operation had achieved its object.\n\n201. On the 16th February, naval forces,\ncommanded by Captain D. C. Hill, R.N.,\nlanded 53 Brigade at Ru-Ywa against slight\nopposition. Enemy gunfire from the Tamandu\narea was dealt with by the NARBADA and\nJUMNA. This initial success, and the subse-\nquent build-up, were largely due to audacious\nminor operations carried out during the three\nnights preceding the landing. Detailed recon-\nnaissance by 3 Commando Brigade of the man-\ngrove swamps west of Ru-Ywa revealed an\nunoccupied island four miles from the proposed\nbridgehead. A battery of medium artillery was\nunobtrusively transported to it by naval land-\ning craft, a light airstrip was constructed, and\nsupplies dumped. The enemy never succeeded\nin'locating this battery and its support proved\ninvaluable. The Japanese made a determined\nattack on the bridgehead on the 19th February,\n\n1917\n\nwhich was only beaten off after severe hand-\nto-hand fighting. On the 20th, while the enemy\nwere still attempting to dislodge our troops, the\nfirst flight of 2 (West African) Brigade arrived\nfrom Kangaw. By the 25th, this Brigade was\nfour miles east of Ru-Ywa, having passed\nthrough 53 Brigade, On the 25th February\nalso, 74 Brigade started to land. In spite of\nmost difficult conditions the supply of the\ntroops ashore was maintained by naval landing\ncraft, and the sloops, motor launches and sup-\nport craft continued to afford fire support to\nthe Army, especially in the Dalet—Tamandu\narea.\n\n202. In the north of the sector, 82 (West\nAfrican) Division, which had occupied Kywe-\nguseik on the 24th February, was making sur-\nprisingly good progress despite physical\ndifficulties ; every step of the path had to be\ncut and impassable cliffs imposed wide diver-\nsions. They were, however, doing useful work\n‘as they were continually cutting off and destroy-\ning enemy parties, of the order of 50 strong\nwho had formed part of the Kangaw\ngarrison.\n\n203. Meanwhile, 74 Brigade, supported by\ntanks, had begun its advance north. By the\nend of February, it had pushed the enemy\nback over the Me Chaung and this obstacle\nwas crossed on the 3rd March. 53 Brigade was\ncarrying out extensive patrolling east and south\nof Ru-Ywa and several small clashes occurred.\n2 (West African) Brigade continued its ad-\nvance on An from the south-west, meeting\nonly slight opposition, but experiencing great\ntopographical difficulties. 74 Brigade after\ncrossing the Me Chaung, pushed ahead towards\nTamandu against considerable opposition. On\nthe 4th March, with the aid of tanks, they over-\nTan several enemy positions, the enemy’s anti-\ntank artillery making no impression on our\nShermans. After a sharp ‘but successful en-\ngagement in the vicinity of the road junction\nsouth of Tamandu they exploited northwards\nto the village, which they found derelict and\ndeserted and which was proudly handed over\nto them by a naval party which had landed\na few hours earlier. Severe fighting, however,\ncontinued east and north of Tamandu for some\ndays until the enemy’s fierce resistance -was\nbroken by the combined efforts of 74 Brigade\nand the West Africans advancing from the\nnorth. On the 7th March 1 Brigade crossed\nthe Dalet Chaung and occupied Dalet Village.\nSimultaneously, 4 (West African) Brigade\ncrossed the Chaung further south and estab-\nlished itself in the hills five miles north-north-\neast of Tamandu. 2 (West African) Brigade\nhad reached the Tamandu—An road and estab-\nlished a block at the Me Chaung crossing.\n\n204, It was at this stage that the overall\nshortage of transport aircraft forced me to\nintervene and upset the Corps plan. When I\nissued General Christison with his orders as\ngiven in paragraph 193, he had been allotted\n130 tons per‘day of the air supply capacity.\nBut in early March Fourtee: Army was\nheavily engaged in the Mandalay and Meiktila\nareas and the continued success of its opera:\ntions, with Rangoon as the goal, depended\nJargely on increasing ‘its air supply. At the\nsame time, the build-up of supplies at Akyab\narid Ramree had to be speeded up, if sufficient\nstocks were to ibe accumulated on these islands,\n",

The\ninterests of 15 Indian Corps had to tbe sub-\nordinated to those of Fourteenth Army, who\nwere playing for high stakes. I was reluctantly\nobliged to reduce the air supply lift allotted\nto 15 Indian Conps from 130 to 30 tons per\nday, though I realised that this meant the\nabandonment of General Christison’s plan—\nwhich was going well—for the encirclement\nof 54 Japanese Division. Orders had, there-\nfore, to be issued to all three brigades of 82\n(West African) Division to break contact and\nmake for the An—Tamandu road; but, as\nwill appear later, this did not mean that the\nJapanese in the An area would be Jeft un-\nmolested.\n\n205. In accordance with the policy for easing\nthe maintenance situation, 25 Indian Division\nwas now directed to withdraw to Akyab by\nthe end of the month (March). 22 (East African)\nBrigade, from Ramree, was to relieve 53\nBrigade at Ru-Ywa, at once, but, until the\nForward Maintenance Area at Tamandu was\nfirmly established, 74 Brigade was to remain in\nthe area under command of 82 (West African)\nDivision.\n\n206. The achievements of 25 Indian Division\nare well summarized in the farewell order\nissued to this formation by the Commander,\n15 Indian Corps, on their departure : —\n\n“You have to your credit the clearance.\n\nfrom the Mayu Peninsula of the famous 55\nJapanese Division and the capture of Akyab\nand clearance of the surrounding districts,\nthe Myebon operations and the surprise land-\ning and resultant decisive battle of the whole\ncampaign—Kangaw. You finished off your\ncampaign to clear the Northern and Central\nArakan of the Japanese 54 Division by the\nbrilliantly executed landing at Ru-Ywa—\nleading to your final capture of the enemy’s\nbase at Tamandu.\n\nThroughout these operations you have\nshown magnificent fighting qualities and the\nhighest morale. You have to your credit the\nsuccessful accomplishment of probably the\nmost difficult combined operations any\nBritish force has ever attempted.\n\nYou have inflicted 8,300 casualties on the\nJapanese and taken 37 guns.”\n\n207. On the 13th March, naval forces under\nthe command of Captain E. T. Cooper, R.N.,\ntransported 4 Brigade of 26 Indian Division\nfrom Kyaukpyu and landed it unopposed due\neast of the village of Letpan, 36 miles south of\nRu-Ywa. The landing was supported by naval\ngunfire from the ROEBUCK, ESKIMO,\nCAUVERY and JUMNA. This final landing\non the Arakan coast was effected in order to\ncut the main road behind the enemy’s forward\ntroops. It brought us nearer Taungup and the\nwestern entrance to the last pass across the\nYomas into the Irrawaddy Valley. The\nadvance of 4 Brigade down the road axis to-\nwards -Taungup was rapid, despite considerable\nopposition, until it was held up, on the 25th\nMarch, by hill positions three miles south of\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THs LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nthe Tanlwe Chaung, about five miles from\nTaungup.\n\n208. In the meantime, the enemy had\nsucceeded in establishing a strong block on the\nTamandu—An road, to the west of 2 (West\nAfrican) Brigade, and the supply situation of\nthis Brigade was, for some days, critical. The\nToad was, however, reopened on the 26th\nMarch. 2 Brigade was ordered to withdraw\nwest to the Tamandu area, while 1 (West\nAfrican) Brigade, now the most easterly troops\non the An road, readjusted their dispositions\neast of Letmauk (seven miles east of\nTamandu). On the 17th March, 22 (Bast\nAfrican) Brigade was concentrated at Ru-\nYwa and assumed charge of that area, It\nwas then ordered to move south in support\nof 4 Brigade of 26 Indian Division, which\nwas advancing towards Taungup. By the 231d\nMarch, forward troops had reached the north\nbank of the An Chaung at Kywegu, meeting\nonly slight opposition and, by the end of the\nmonth, they had reached Letpan.\n\n209. The time had now arrived, in the begin-\nning of April, to relieve 26 Indian Division, as\nthe continuation of the phasing out of 15 Indian\nCorps. 36 and 71 Brigades had remained on\nRamree Island and thus it remained only to\nrelieve 4 Brigade in the Taungup area. 25\nIndian Division had already been withdrawn,\nand so there remained on the mainland, in\naddition to 4 Indian Brigade, only 82 (West\nAfrican) Division, disposed between Tamandu\nand Letmauk (where 1 (West African) Brigade\nwas in contact with the enemy), and 22 (East\nAfrican) Brigade, which was advancing south\nfrom Letpan. In the Irrawaddy sector, the\nrapid advance of Fourteenth Army was bring-\ning it appreciably closer to Minbu, at the\neastern end of the An—Minbu road. It was,\ntherefore, clearly the responsibility of 15\nIndian Corps to prevent the Japanese forces\nabout An withdrawing east to oppose Four-\nteenth Army. Since, without air supply, it\nwould not be possible to despatch a column\nto block the enemy’s escape route east of An,\nthe best alternative was to maintain an offen-\nsive force before An, whose réle would be to\nkeep the enemy facing west, without actually\ndriving him from his present positions. This\ntask was allotted to 1 (West African) Brigade.\nThe Japanese appeared remarkably sensitive\nto the activities of this force and the ruse was\nentirely successful. This new operation up the\nAn road released 2 and 4 (West African)\nBrigades. 2 Brigade was immediately ordered\nsouth to relieve 4 Indian Brigade, thus freeing\nthis formation to rejoin 26 Indian Division on\nRamree prior to its departure for India. 4\n(West African) Brigade was used to secure the\nbase at Tamandu, and, when this became no\nlonger necessary, it too was: transferred to\nTaungup.\n\n210. During the second week in April, it\nseemed evident that the Japanese were thinning\nout north and north-east of Taungup. Re-\nported withdrawals of their troops between\nTaungup and Sandoway into the hills east of\nTaungup also indicated that the enemy were\nnow more with preventing our ad-\nvance across the Yomas, than in maintaining\ntheir defence of the coast further south. Patrols\nof 4 Indian Brigade found Taungup deserted\non.the 15th April. This Brigade was relieved\n",

On the 19th April, 22 (East\nAfrican) Brigade captured the village of Dalet\non the Tanlwe Chaung nine miles north-east\nof Taungup. On the 28th April, 4 (West\nAfrican) Brigade actually occupied Taungup,\nand with this fitting conclusion 82 (West\nAfrican) Division and 22 (East African) Brigade\npassed under my direct command. The for-\nmations of 15 Indian Corps had completed\ntheir task and were withdrawn to India, less\nHeadquarters, 15 Indian Corps and 26 Indian\nDivision in Ramree.\n\n211. The campaign had fulfilled its objects.\nThe Japanese had been driven out of Arakan.\nThe air bases, which enabled Fourteenth Army\nto continue its rapid advance, had been secured,\n54 Japanese Division and the Sakura detached\nforce of 55 Japanese Division had been largely\ndestroyed. The balance of 55 Division, already\nseriously depleted by our 1944 offensive, was\nkept deployed on the coast until too late to\noffer any serious resistance to Fourteenth\nAnny. .\n\nSECTION XII (paras. 212-227), PLANS FOR\nTHE. CAPTURE OF RANGOON\n\nThe situation in Central Burma at the end\nof March: General Slim’s plan for the drive\nsouth: The decision to go for Rangoon by\nsea: Reasons for this decision: Directive\nissued by the Supreme Allied Commander on\nthe 17th April.\n\n212. It will be remembered (paragraph 92)\nthat on the 27th February I had directed\nGeneral Slim to destroy the Japanese forces\nin the Mandalay Plain and to seize Rangoon\nbefore the monsoon. During the second half\nof March the clearing of the Mandalay Plain\nproceeded with very great loss to the enemy\n(paragraphs 102 to 127). The remnants\nof 15 Japanese Army were being driven by 33\nCorps east of the road Mandalay—Thazi and\nwere endeavouring to retreat south along the\ntracks in the foothills. Their 33rd and 28th\nArmies had suffered severe casualties and lost\nmany guns, but, although their fighting value\nhad decreased, it was by no means negligible.\nIt was important that they should not be given\ntime to recover from the battering they had\nreceived. Our own losses, considering the\nnature of the fighting, had not been excessive\nand, with one important exception, they had\nbeen replaced. (This exception was in the\nBritish battalions. While we had the reinforce-\nments at Comilla, we lacked the transport\naircraft to fly them in) The morale of our\ntroops was magnificent and had to be seen\nto be fully realised.\n\n213. General Slim’s task now was to get to\nRangoon before the monsoon broke, which\nmight be. in early May. Time was thus very\nshort. Our biggest problem, as always, was\nadministrative. It was not possible to maintain\nmore than five divisions south of the line\nMeiktila—Yenangyaung, and our supply diffi-\nculties were, of course, going to increase in\ndirect proportion to the length and speed of\nour advance. Thus the enemy might be able\nto concentrate superior forces against one, or\neven more than one of our possible lines of\nadvance if he were given time to recover his\nbalance. .\n\n1919\n\n214. Since a simultaneous advance in\nstrength down both the road and rail axis, on\nthe east, and the river axis, on the west, was\ntuled out for maintenance reasons, the question\narose on which axis our main thrust should\nbe concentrated. Speed being essential, the\nstriking force would have to be on a fully\nmechanised basis. The eastern axis was\nselected for two reasons. First, the river\n(western) line of advance contained many more\nwater crossings. Since we must expect all\nbridges to be blown, these obstacles would\nseriously delay our progress. Secondly, an\nadvance down the eastern axis would cut off\nmany more of the enemy. Those escaping\neast from the Irrawaddy would have to cross\na range of difficult jungle-clad hills, possibly at\na time when the monsoon would be at its\nheight, and then have to attempt to break out,\nthrough flooded country, across the Mandalay\n—Rangoon road, along which we should have\nestablished a cordon.\n\n215. General Slim decided that the advance\ndown the eastern axis should be made by 4\nCorps, because 5 and 17 Indian Divisions\nwere already organized each with two\nmechanised brigades and one air-transportable\nbrigade, and because is Corps was\nalready concentrated in the Meiktila area,\nwell south of 33 Corps. This plan entailed\nmoving 2 British and 20 Indian Divisions from\nthe north-east to the south-west into the\nIrrawaddy Valley, where they would join 7\nIndian Division, which had already been placed\nunder 33 Corps. 19 Indian and 36 British\nDivisions would constitute the army reserve.\nThe general method of advance to be adopted\nby 4 Corps was to be the seizure of an airstrip,\nor a site for one, by a rapid bound forward,\nfollowed by the fly-in of an air-transportable\nbrigade. While this brigade held the airstrip\narea, the rest of the division would make its\nnext bound. Airstrips would be required every\nfifty miles. Divisions were to advance by\nleap-frogging, each division halting on reaching\nits objective while the other passed through.\nSouth of Toungoo, all the formations’ of 4\nCorps would be on air supply, while those to\nthe north would be maintained by road,\nsuppemented by tail as far as the number of\nlocomotives, the amount of rolling stock, and\nthe state of the line permitted. 33 Corps was\nallotted enough supply air-lift for one division,\nthe rest of the Corps thus being dependent on\nsupply by road and inland water transport.\n\n216. On the 18th March, the Commander,\nFourteenth Army, had issued an Operation\nInstruction to his Corps Commanders dividing\nthe forthcoming operations into three phases: —\nthe present battle, the re-grouping stage, and\nthé advance south. The intention was stated\nthus :—\n\n“On completion of the task of destroying\nthe Japanese forces in Central Burma,\nFourteenth Army will: —\n\n(a) Capture Rangoon at all costs and as\nsoon as possible before the monsoon.\n(b) Capture Yenangyaung, Magwe and\n\nProme.\n\n©) Secure the area Myingyan—Mandalay\n—Maymyo—Chauk, and the road and rail-\nway axis Meiktila to Rangoon.”\n\n217. The instructions given to the two Corps\nfor the regrouping stage were that 4 Corps,\n",

The magnitude of the undertaking\nshould be noted. About five weeks were\navailable before the monsoon broke. Its\narrival would cut the land line of communica-\ntion from Kalewa to Shwebo and vastly\nincrease the difficulties of air supply. The\nserious consequences of the delay imposed on\nour advance by the transfer of airlift and\nforces to China (see paragraphs 51 and 52)\nwere now fully apparent. To reach Rangoon\nin time meant that Fourteenth Army’s advance\nhad to average at least ten miles a day against\nopposition and despite demolitions—a formid-\nable proposition. There was also the very dis-\nturbing possibility that the Japanese, instead\nof withdrawing their defeated forces south-\nwards, would retire into the mountains that lay\nto the east of the road and railway between\nMandalay and Rangoon. Maintenance would\nbe possible by the road from the Lampang rail-\nhead in Siam, via Kengtung, Takaw and\nLoilem. The presence of such a force on our\nflank would inevitably have weakened the drive\nsouth, while we certainly could not afford to\noperate eastwards against it in any strength.\nFortunately, this threat did not materialize.\n\n219. I had, for some time, been considering\nthe necessity of a subsidiary operation to assist\n\nFourteenth Army. At the end of March, I .\n\ndecided that I must recommend to the Supreme\nAllied Commander that a sea-borne attack on\n-Rangoon, in addition to Fourteenth Army’s\nthrust, was essential. .\n220. Both General Slim and I were full of\nhope that Fourteenth Army would reach\nRangoon before the monsoon, despite the diffi-\nculties which faced them. But at the same\ntime I had to take into account the possibility\nof failure to do so. It is not too much to\nsay that the results of such failure would have\nbeen disastrous. The long land L. of C.—it\nis over 600 miles from Manipur Road railhead\nto Meiktila—was not designed to withstand\nmonsoon conditions, as an important length\nof the road, running from Kalewa to Shwebo,\nabout 108 miles, was constructed to fair-\nweather standard only. Air supply on a con-\nsiderable scale was in any case essential to\nsupplement what came by land and river. But\nduring the monsoon, flying conditions were\noften hazardous, and would certainly inter-\ntupt air supply altogether for periods, at a\ntime when our land L. of C. was interrupted\nand possibly the I.W.T. traffic on the Chindwin\nwas reduced too. Moreover, I knew, and the\nAmericans had been quite candid and warned\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nme, that if we did not get into Rangoon by\nJune, their American transport aircraft which\nformed a large proportion of the theatre re-\nsources, would be taken off to China. Thus\nwe might well have the position where our\ntroops, halted only a comparatively short dis-\ntance from Rangoon by the monsoon rains,\nwould have to be withdrawn back to Manda-\nJay or even to the Chindwin, with all the\nattendant losses in vehicles and morale, for\nreasons of supply. How real this danger was,\nwas afterwards proved by the fact that, even\nafter Rangoon was captured and opened in\nMay, the R.A-F. were unable, at times, during\nthe June monsoon rains, adequately to supply\neven the small forces which we still had to\nmaintain in Central Burma. General Slim\nhad repeatedly asked me to put in an amphi-\nbious operation to assist his army to capture\nRangoon, because he felt he could not guaran-\ntee reaching it before the rains.\n\n221. In the early part of this Despatch (para-\ngraph 11) I mentioned that a combined opera-\ntion for the capture of Rangoon, known as\nDracula, had had to be postponed. This\noperation was, however, never actually\ncancelled. As far back as the Sth February,\nthe Supreme Allied Commander had issued a\nDirective in which my tasks were defined as\nfollows: “To secure the Ledo—Burma road,\ncapture Rangoon by 1st June, 1945, open the’\nport of Rangoon and destroy the main Japan-\nese forces in Burma, excluding the Tenasserim\ncoast.” In this Directive the Commander-in-\nChief, East Indies Fleet, was instructed “To\nfurnish such Naval support and amphibious\nresources as may be’ required for combined\noperations,” and, mention was also made of\nthe Indian Airborne Division, which was to be\nheld under the Supreme Commander’s opera-\ntional control. This amounted, in effect, to.\n“Operation Dracula,” though in a modified\nform, and I considered the time had now come\nto put it into effect, that is, to carry out a com-\nbined sea, land and air operation against\nRangoon, though on a much smaller scale than\nwas originally planned.\n\n222. Everything indicated that the enemy\nwas going to make determined efforts to halt\nus in the Yenangyaung area on the Irrawaddy\naxis, and that we should meet defence.in depth\non the road-railway axis to the east. From\ncaptured documents and the evidence of Staff\nofficers obtained later it is clear that the enemy\nintended to halt us successively at Pyawbwe,\nPyinmana and Toungoo. It was only his in-\nability to carry out the necessary moves in\ntime that prevented these plans from fully\nmaterialising.\n\n223. Moreover, there was the problem of\nRangoon itself. The garrison was at this time\nknown to be some 10,000 strong. Although\nthese were largely Base troops, experience in\nManila and elsewhere in the Pacific theatre\nhad shown that these troops were capable of\nstubborn and suicidal defence, and I had had\nno indication from my Intelligence that the\nenemy might abandon Rangoon. Nor with the\nclearing of Rangoon town itself was the prob-\nJem by any means solved. Before supplies could\nbe brought in by sea, the twenty-four odd\nmiles of the Rangoon River approach had to\nbe cleared of mines; and naturally the mine-\nsweepers could not start until the banks weré\ncleared of enemy. It was not difficult to foresee\n",

These areas\nare intersected with creeks, and with the mon-\nsoon rains it would be nearly impossible to\ndeploy forces effectively against the enemy who\nremained. Thus with Rangoon actually in our\nhands, we could find ourselves in a worse\nposition than ever, until we opened the Ran-\ngoon River. With a seaborne attack the\nRangoon River had to be opened first, and\nthe capture of Rangoon town could be closely\nfollowed by the opening of the port to traffic.\nThe strength with which Rangoon might be\nheld had made me, earlier on, consider the\npossibility of going for the less defended ports\nof Bassein or Moulmein, but it was soon clear\nthat, since these had no all-weather road com-\nmunications with the main body of Four-\nteenth Army, Rangoon was the only useful\nobjective.\n\n224. I therefore recommended to the Supreme\nAllied Commander that a force of two divisions\n—one for the assault and one for the follow-up\n—under the command of 15 Indian Corps,\nshould be used to capture Rangoon from the\nsea. I realised that if my recommendation\nwas a ted, it meant postponing or even\ncancelling the Phuket operation for which plan-\nning was well advanced, and which I had pre-\nviously agreed to try to carry out.\n\n225. The Supreme Allied Commander\napproved my recommendation after discussion\nat a meeting with the Naval and Air Com-\nmanders-in-Chief and myself at Kandy on the\n2nd April, a few days after I had sent my\nsignal making the recommendation. He made\nthe proviso that the decision as to whether the\nsecond (follow-up) division should actually be\ncommitted would be taken later. On the 17th\nApril he confirmed his approval in an Opera-\ntional Directive addressed to his Commanders-\nin-Chief, in which we were instructed “To\ncarry out an amphibious/airborne operation\nwith the object of the early capture of Ran-\ngoon should this not have been previously\nachieved by Fourteenth Army from the north.”\nD-Day for the initial amphibious assault was\nto be the 2nd May, and this date should be\nborne in mind when the progress of Fourteenth\nArmy’s advance southwards is followed in the\nnext section of the Despatch.\n\n226. I should like to stress here the hazardous\nnature of the Rangoon operation. Heavy\nstorms are a common occurrence just before\nthe breaking of the monsoon and, in any\ncase, at this time of year there was a heavy\nswell outside the Rangoon River. This, com-\nbined with the exceptionally long run-in for\nminor landing craft from the lowering position,\nmade the task extremely difficulty and its\nsuccess somewhat uncertain.\n\n227. Planning started on the 8th April under\nthe experienced team who had been responsible\nfor our combined successes in Arakan. On the\n18th April I issued the necessary detailed in-\nstructions to the Commander, 15 Indian Corps.\nThe details of the plan itself and its execution\nare dealt with in a later section of this\n\nDespatch. «-\n\n1921\n\nSECTION XII (paras. 228-256) FOURTEENTH\nArmMy’s Drive SOUTH\n\nThe regrouping phase: Fighting in the Irra-\nwaddy Valley: The capture of Prome: 4\nCorps’ axis: Successive captures of Pyawbwe,\nPyinmana and Toungoo: Japanese plans to\ndefend Pegu: The advance to Pegu: Capture\nof Pegu. :\n\n228. Early in April, 5 Brigade of 2 British\nDivision and 268 Indian Brigade, advancing\nsouth-west from Myingyan—Natogyi area and\ndestroying many isolated enemy detachments\nen route, encountered stubborn resistance at\nMount Popa. This is an extinct volcano, 5,000\nfeet in height, whose steep slopes afforded\nexcellent defensive facilities. Here a force of\nabout 600 Japanese, supported by field and\nmedium artillery, held out until the 20th April,\nwhen they were finally eliminated, losing much\nequipment including vehicles and guns. While\nthis action was in progress, the remainder of\n2 British Division was being flown out to India.\nThe fly-out began on the 11th April from\nMyingyan and was completed by the 25th. For\nadministrative reasons, it had become necessary\nto reduce the forces in Central Burma by one\ndivision, and 2 British Division was required\nas the follow-up division of the force for\noperation “ Dracula,” the capture of Rangoon\nby a combined airborne and seaborne landing,\nwhich was discussed in the last section.\n\n229. 7 Indian Division (less 33 Brigade)\nwas, in the meantime, operating down both\nsides of the Irrawaddy, while 33 Brigade was\ndirected on the important communications\ncentre of Kyaukpadaung. This town fell on\nthe 12th April, after a strong enemy counter-\nattack had been repulsed just to the west of it.\n33 Brigade then turned west and captured\nChauk on the 18th April, the booty taken in-\ncluded five guns (including two medium), and\nmuch transport. On the 19th, 89 Brigade\ncleared Singu, four miles to the north-east. 33\nBrigade, advancing south from Chauk, met\nfierce resistance at Yenangyaung. This exten-\nsive oilfield area was completely cleared by the\n23rd April after three days’ stiff fighting. On\nthis date, 89 Brigade were concentrating seven\nmiles north of Yenangyaung preparatory to\ncrossing the river. West of the Irrawaddy, 114\nBrigade had reached a point 17 miles south-\nwest of Seikpyu without meeting any organized\nresistance. During its advance, 7 Indian Divi-\nsion had inflicted heavy casualties, captured\nmore guns and much booty.\n\n230. After clearing the Myittha—Wundwin\narea on the railway axis, 20 Indian Division\nchanged two of its brigades from an animal\ntransport to a motor transport basis, and\nbegan its rapid move south-west across\nto the Irrawaddy. This quick re-organization\nwas rendered possible by the fiy-out of\n2 British Division, whose vehicles thus\nbecame available for re-allotment. The\nadvance of 20 Indian Division was directed\non Taungdwingyi, which lies some 43\nmiles east-south-east of Magwe and roughly\nhalf-way between the Mandalay—Rangoon\nrailway and the Irrawaddy. This place was\nthe vital rail and road junction of the Japanese\ncommunications linking their east and west\nfronts.

By the\n2nd May, breaking through all enemy attempts\nto stop it, it had advanced a further 40 miles\nand captured the great river port (now in ruins)\nof Prome, the eastern terminus of the road from\nTaungup. The last escape route of the rem-\nnants of the Japanese forces in South Arakan\nwas now blocked.\n\n233. I will now turn to the main axis of the\ndrive south, the road and railway between\nMandalay and Rangoon. After the failure of\nhis counter-offensive in the Meiktila area, the\nCommander, 33 Japanese Anmy, decided to\nhalt our advance north and west of Pyawbwe,\n24 miles south-east of Meiktila, where good\nnatural defensive positions exist. He withdrew\n18 Japanese Division, through Thazi, to take\nup positions covering Pyawbwe from the north\nand he ordered 53 Japanese Division to with-\ndraw from west of Meiktila and occupy posi-\ntions west of Pyawbwe. 49 Japanese Division,\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nwhich had already suffered severely at out\nhands, was to act as a rearguard, delaying out\nadvance down the Meiktila—Pyawbwe road.\n\nFurther to the east, 15 Japanese Division was\n\nbeing withdrawn through Taunggyi and Loikaw\nso that it could reinforce the railway lowet\nlown.\n\n234. Pushing south from Meiktila,on the Sth\nApril, 48 Brigade of 17 Indian Division met\nheavy opposition eight miles down the\nPyawbwe road. Leaving a detachment to deal\nwith this, the Brigade by-passed the enemy\nposition and advanced another five miles, over-\ncoming further opposition north of Yindaw.\nThey were eventually held up by minefields and\nheavy mortar fire at the village itself. 99\nBrigade, operating east of the road, cleared\nvillage after village, eventually being held up\nnine miles south-south-east of Meiktila. 63\nBrigade on the right flank made an advance of\nfive miles. It was evident even at this early\nstage of the advance that 49 Japanese Division\nwas putting up a determined stand. On the\n6th April, the enemy again re-occupied the\npositions eight miles south-east of Meiktila from\nwhich they had been cleared by a detachment\nof 48 Brigade the previous evening. We\nattacked again, this time annihilating the de-\nfenders. Yindaw still held out, but was by-\npassed by a battalion and 255 Indian Tank\nBrigade, less a squadron, which was operating\nwith 99 Brigade. On the 7th, this battalion\nand a detachment of tariks overcame enemy\nopposition near Ywadin, seven miles due west\nof Pyawbwe, and were then held up by a\nblown bridge. Meanwhile 63 Brigade reached\nYwadin.\n\n235. On the 8th April, on the main Meiktila\n—Pyawbwe road, Yindaw still held out, but its\nreduction was left to 161 Brigade of 5 Indian\nDivision, which was following 17 Indian Divi-\nsion according to plan. 48 Brigade by-passed\nit and fought their way forward to within eight\nmiles of Pyawbwe, shelling the enemy with\nsome of their own guns, which had been cap-\ntured on the 6th. Meanwhile 99 Brigade was\nstill fighting north of Yindaw, inflicting heavy\ncasualties. On the 9th April, 5 Indian Division\ncaptured Yindaw, killing almost the entire\ngarrison and capturing three guns. On this\ndate, 99 Brigade with tank support captured\npart of the high ground three miles north of\nPyawbwe and reached the landing ground just\nnorth-west of the town. 48 Brigade, attack-\ning astride the road, broke through stubborn\nresistance, inflicting heavy losses and capturing.\ntwo guns. 63 Brigade occupied a village two\nmiles west-south-west of Pyawbwe, taking three\nguns and then probed forward to the out-\nskirts of the town. Meanwhile our armoured\ncolumns were operating south-west and south\nof Pyawbwe, capturing artillery and slaughter-\ning the gun crews. Altogether a total of fifteen\nguns (some medium) were taken by 17 Indian\nDivision during the fighting on the 9th April.\nPyawbwe fell on the 10th to co-ordinated\nattacks by infantry from the north and west\nand armoured troops from the south-west, the\nlatter assault proving decisive.\n\n236. Our victory at Pyawbwe was one\nof the most costly defeats the enemy had\nsuffered during the whole campaign. During\nour advance, 49 Japanese Division, already\ngreatly depleted in strength, was practically\n",

Their 53 Division attempt-\ning to occupy its allotted defence zone\nwest of Pyawbwe was struck in the flank\nand severely mauled before it ever got there.\nDuring the fighting in and around the town\nitself, 18 Japanese Division lost 2,200 killed,\nand we captured 31 guns, eight tanks and much\ntransport. The tactical handling of 17 Indian\nDivision by Major-General D. T. Cowan in\nthis fighting was excellent. The enemy were\nexpecting an attack from the north and they\nwere attacked by infantry from this direction,\nbut what surprised and disrupted their defence\nwere the armoured columns operating from\nthe south. The whole battle was a massacre\nby tanks, guns, infantry and aircraft. 33\nJapanese Army was shattered.\n\n237. The advance from Pyawbwe was\ntaken up by 5 Indian Division, which passed\nthrough 17 Indian Division on the 11th April.\n123 Brigade Group reached Yamethin on that\ndate and our armour contacted the enemy seven\nmiles to the south. During the night, an\nenemy detachment some 400 strong, with an\nanti-tank battery, entered the town from the\neast and occupied buildings and trenches com-\nmanding the road. This detachment fought\nto the last man and it took two days to elimi-\nnate them, the process being considerably\nhastened by accurate air strikes. In the mean-\ntime, a by-pass road was constructed west of\nthe town to allow our unarmoured vehicles to\nget forward. On the 12th the Japanese\nachieved a minor success in one of their rare\nair attacks, 16 vehicles of a petrol and ammuni-\ntion convoy being destroyed by them.\n\n238. While Yamethin was being finally\ncleared, an armoured column and 161 Brigade\nGroup had advanced and contacted the enemy\non the 15th, astride the road and railway on\nthe general line of the Sinthe Chaung, 27 miles\nfrom Yamethin and three miles north of\nShwemyo. While this portion of the enemy\nwas being subjected to successful air strikes\nwhich caused them heavy casualties, an\narmoured column operating west of the road\nand railway crossed the Sinthe Chaung and\nbroke into Shwemyo itself, which it completely\ncleared the same day (16th April). Meanwhile\nthe engineers, though harassed by enemy\nartillery fire from the Shwemyo Bluff, bridged\nthe Sinthe north of Shwemyo and bulldozed a\nby-pass over difficult ground. This enabled\n161 Brigade Group to outflank the Japanese\npositions north of the town, and harbour south\nof it for the night 16th-17th. In their efforts\nto establish a bridgehead across the Sinthe\nChaung the next day, however, this Brigade\nwas held up.\n\n239. 123 Brigade Group, ten miles north of\nShwemyo, were preparing for an attack on the\nShwemyo Bluff, while 9 Brigade Group con-\ncentrated in the Tatkon area, four miles north-\nwest of the entrance to the Shwemyo Bluff\ndefiles. This Bluff is a steep feature rising to\n700 feet, dominating the road and rail-\nway on the east side. It was expected that\nthe Japanese would hold this strong position,\nand they did, but they did not anticipate an\nattack from the jungle-covered hills east of\nthe Bluff, which was the line of advance\nselected by 123 Brigade. This assault on the\n18th caught the enemy in flank and rear and\nwas completely successful. 123 Brigade were\n\n1923\n\nthen relieved in this area by 99 Brigade of 17\nIndian Division, to free them for a further\nadvance.\n\n240. Early on the 18th April, 161 Brigade\nsucceeded in forcing a crossing of the Sinthe\nChaung and repaired the bridge. They then,\nin conjunction with 255 Indian Tank Brigade,\ninflicted heavy casualties on the enemy over\na wide area well south of Shwemyo, destroying\nthree guns. By the evening of the 18th, the\narmoured column was only twelve miles north\nof Pyinmana, despite mined road blocks and\ndemolitions, which were covered by enemy\n‘detachments concealed in the thick country on\neither side of the road. The airstrip near\nShwemyo was taken over on the 18th April by\nthe air-transportable brigade which had moved\nup by road, leaving the rest. of 5 Indian\nDivision free for their next bound forward.\n\n241. Our tanks reached Pyinmana on the\n19th April. Finding it held, they by-passed\nit and captured the valuable Lewe airfield, just\nto the south of the town, on the 20th. By\nnightfall, they had reached Yeni, 43 miles from\nToungoo and 218 miles from Rangoon. 161\nBrigade took over the defence of Lewe air-\nfield after its capture by the armoured column,\npreparing it for the glider fly-in of aviation\nengineers. They also cleared the northern part\nof Pyinmana, the Japanese garrison still re-\nsisting stubbornly in the southern sector. Mean-\nwhile 123 Brigade passed rapidly through\n161 Brigade and reached Thawatti, almost\ncatching up with our armour three miles further\nsouth. Continuing their rush south, both our\ntanks and our infantry reached a village 15\nmiles north of Toungoo on the 21st April. On\nthis date, the enemy in Pyinmana were finally\nliquidated. .\n\n242. The last lap of the race for Toungoo\nwas now being run. There were three com-\npetitors. 5 Indian Division were driving\nhard down the axis of the main road. The\nenemy columns, which had been driven off the\nmain road were attempting by forced marches,\nalong jungle tracks on both sides of the main\nroad, to reach Toungoo ahead of us. These\ncolumns were being looked after by our air-\ncraft, but, we too, had our difficulties in the\nshape of mines, demolitions, and heavy rain-\nstorms—the first two delayed our tanks on the\nroad, while the third hindered their move-\nment off it. The third competitor was 15\nJapanese Division, which was moving by motor\ntransport parallel to 5 Indian Division, and\nsome 60 miles to the east of it, down the\nTaunggyi—Loikaw road, which turns west at\nKemapyo, via Mawchi, to Toungoo. We owe\nit to the Karen guerillas, under their British\nofficers, and to the airstrikes by the R.A.F.\ndirected by these same British officers, that\nthis enemy division lost the race. Ambush\nafter ambush, demolition after demolition, air-\nstrike after airstrike, delayed its advance and,\nalthough a forward element got within artillery\nrange of its objective, it was too late.\n\ne\n\n243. After a sharp action on the 22nd April\n“by our tanks in a village eight miles to the\nnorth, our troops swept into Toungoo itself.\nThe leading light tanks of 123 Brigade column\nignored the traffic signals of an indignant\nJapanese policeman in the centre of the town,\nand ran him down.

By the evening\nof the 22nd, our leading tanks and infantry\nwere in Oktwin, eight miles to the south,\nwhere they captured a loaded train (complete\nwith two engines) which was on the point of\ndeparture. The importance of Toungoo to us\nlay in its airfields from which fighters could\noperate over Rangoon, distant 166 miles.\nSince our captures in Toungoo fortunately in-\ncluded an I.N.A. division (some 3,000 strong),\nthere was no shortage of labour to get the air-\nstrips into running order. In the 21 days of\ncontinuous fighting since 4 Corps broke out\nfrom Meiktila, it had advanced 170 miles and\nkilled 4,800 Japanese, of which 1,677 had been\naccounted for by 5 Indian Division between\nthe 12th and 22nd April. These were casualties\nactually counted on the ground; the total\nenemy killed considerably exceeded this figure,\nwhich does not include the many losses in-\nflicted by our armour in quick-moving tank\nactions, and by our aircraft.\n\n244, Continuing their dash south, 5 Indian\nDivision’s armoured column on the 24th April\nfound the Pyu Chaung, 30 miles south of\nToungoo, held and the bridge destroyed.\nNevertheless, by the 25th, a crossing had been\neffected and Pyu succumbed to an artillery\nconcentration. The progress of 161 Brigade was\ndelayed by the bridge two miles south of\nToungoo being washed away, necessitating the\nconstruction of a 180-foot Bailey, which was\ncompleted early on the 25th. The Brigade\nthen pushed forward through Pyu in hot pur-\nsuit of our armour which, on the night 25th-\n26th, had reached Milestone 128 from Rangoon,\n29 miles north of Nyaunglebin. Incidentally,\n17 Indian Division had been scheduled to pass\nthrough $5 Indian Division on the 24th April,\nand indignation swept the former when it was\nlearnt that the latter had invaded what should\nhave been 17 Indian Division’s area of opera-\ntions. I mention this small point as it illus-\ntrates the fine aggressive spirit which per-\nmeated not only 4 Corps, but the whole of\nFourteenth Anny in this campaign.\n\n245, The Japanese Air Force was so over-\nwhelmed by the Allied Air Forces at this time,\nand indeed throughout the whole Bunma cam-\npaign, that its existence is apt to be over-\nlooked. Nevertheless, the enemy did on occa-\nsions attempt to delay the onward rush of 4\nCorps. On the 24th April, for example, twelve\nOscar fighter-bombers twice bombed and\nstrafed the Tennant and Kalaywa airfields\nnorth of Toungoo, and then attacked the\narmoured column to the south. Our\ncasualties in these attacks were light, whereas\nthe hostile aircraft were intercepted by Spit-\nfires and lost half their number.\n\n“246. The loss of Toungoo must have con-\nvinced General Kimura that the situation was\ncritical. There is no doubt, evidence later\n. showed, that the Japanese Commander in-\ntended as adast resort to hold a line through\nToungoo and Prome until the coming of the,\nmonsoon forced us to ease the pressure of our\nOffensive. Our break-through at Toungoo\ndestroyed this last hope. Whether he intended\nto hold Rangoon, or whether he meant to with-\ndraw the remnants of his forces across the\nSittang, it was essential that the road and rail-\nway through Pegu—the only land communica-\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\ntions link between Rangoon and Moulmein—\nshould be kept open. Thus the defence of\nPegu now became absolutely vital. Kimura\nhad apparently no hope of retaking Toungoo\nitself, but ihe directed 15 Japanese Division\nto accelerate its move west from Mawchi and\nblock the Toungoo—Mawchi road at the point\nwhere it enters the hills. The object was two-\nfold. First, this threat.to 4 Corps might delay\nits advance and cause it to divert troops;\nsecondly, this position would protect the flank\nof those elements of 33 Japanese Army still\nnorth of Mawchi, who were retreating south.\nThe Japanese Commander’s next step was to\nconcentrate every available man for the defence\nof Pegu. 24 Independent Mixed Brigade was\nrushed north from Moulmein to the Pegu—\nMokpalin area. He also formed two new Mixed\nBrigades rom the Rangoon garrison, which\nwere largely composed of administrative and\nnaval personnel. The Rangoon Anti-Aircraft\nCommand, the largest in Burma, provided the\nguns for this scratch force, all its batteries being\nutilised for this punpose. These two brigades\nwere moved up to Pegu on 27th April with\norders “To destroy the enemy north of\nPayagyi and 'Waw ”, which lie 10 and 15 miles\nnorth and north-west of Pegu respectively.\nWhile this was going on, the major portion of\nthe small detachments guarding the mouth of\nthe Rangoon River were moved back into\nRangoon “ To cover demolitions ”. With effect\nfrom the 28th April, therefore, Rangoon was\nPractically denuded of troops, except for 5,000\n\n247. I must make it clear however that it\nwas not until the Ist May that I received any\nindication that Rangoon was going to be evacu-\nated, and it was only after 15 Indian Corps\nlanded that it became certain. This was another\nexample of how poor our Intelligence was in\ncomparison with the European theatre and\nhow, so often, we were virtually fighting in the\ndark. It was known that Pegu was being re-\ninforced at the expense of Rangoon, but it\nwas always considered that Rangoon itself\nwould be the centre of a desperate resistance.\nI need not emphasise how serious the delay\ncaused by such resistance would have been.\n\n248. On the 24th April, General Kimura and\nhis Headquarters retired to Moulmein. They\nwere accompanied by Ba Maw and several\nministers of his puppet Government. With\nthem went Subhas Chandra Bose—the Com-\nmander-in-Chief of the “Indian National\nArmy ”—leaving behind him several thousand\nof his troops, with orders to fight to the last.\nThey surrendered directly we reached Rangoon,\nthereby easing our labour problem.\n\n249. 19 Indian Division, following up 5 and\n17 Indian Divisions, took over the Toungoo\narea on the 26th April, the actual locations of\nits brigades on this date being 98 Brigade in\nToungoo itself, 62 Brigade at Lewe airfield, and\n64 Brigade back in Meiktila. 98 Brigade\nimmediately began operations to clear the\nleading elements of 15 Japanese Division east\nof Toungoo, and our artillery engaged the\nenemy guns shelling Toungoo. The next week\nwas spent in mopping up scattered parties of\nthe enemy in the vicinity; on the 29th April,\nfor example, 200 Japanese were surrounded\nand killed just south-west of the Lewe airfield,\nand a further 150 ten miles south-west of\nToungoo. Although it falls outside the period\n",

The armoured column, which on the\nnight 25th-26th April was 29 miles north\nof Nyaunglebin, made a further rapid advance\non the 26th, capturing Nyaunglebin and driving\nforward a further 19 miles; that is, to within\n80 miles of Rangoon. The resistance en-\ncountered was reported as “increasingly dis-\norganized ” and many casualties were inflicted ;\nalso three locomotives were captured, together\nwith rolling stock loaded with rations. On the\n27th April, the armoured column met deter-\nmined opposition at a village near Milestone 68\nand fighting continued throughout the day,\nJapanese suicide parties, who attempted to\ndestroy our tanks with pole-charges, having\nto be eliminated. 17 Indian Division had passed\nthrough 5 Indian Division on the 26th and was\nbusy mopping up and repairing crossings be-\nhind the armoured column. Five bridges south\nof Nyaunglebin had been destroyed by the\nenemy and another washed away by a flooded\nchaung. Valentine +ridge-layer tanks had\nenabled our armour to cross, but our lorried\ninfantry was temporarily held up pending the\narrival of Bailey bridging.\n\n251. By the morning of the 28th, the\narmoured column had pushed forward another\nsix miles, but again met strong resistance at\nMilestone 62, twelve miles north of Pegu. This\nwas cleared by nightfall, the Japanese losing\n300 killed. Difficult country now lay ahead\nwith reservoirs and marshy ground. Both the\nmain road and the side-tracks were mined and\nbooby trapped, and these obstacles were\nstrongly covered by fire. Nevertheless, by the\n29th April, 63 Brigade, supported by tanks,\nhad fought its way through Payagyi and\nreached the outskirts of Pegu, despite stiff\nopposition, both ground and air. To the north\nof Pegu, an armoured detachment moved east,\njust south of the Moyingyi Reservoir, and cut\nthe Pegu—Mokpalin road at Waw, 15 miles\nnorth-east of Pegu.\n\n252. 4 Corps was now straining every nerve\nto get to Rangoon before 15 Indian Corps\ncould reach the city through the sea-gate. In\nthe present campaign they had captured or\ndestroyed 299 guns and killed over 16,000\nJapanese, over 6,500 of whom had been\naccounted for between the Ist and 28th April.\nThey thad cheerfully advanced and fought on\nreduced rations to make room for more\nammunition and __ petrol. 17 Indian\nDivision was now only some 50 miles from its\ngoal, and, it must be remembered, it was this\nDivision which had carried out such a gallant\nwithdrawal from Burma three years eaztlier,\nand, only the previous year, had fought so\nmagnificently in the defence of Imphal. 17\nIndtan Division had an old score to settle,\nand, if it was humanly possible, it was going\nto be settled. But the obstacles to be overcome\nwere serious. Between 4 Corps and Rangoon\n\n1925\n\nlay the wide Pegu River, forming a very strong\ndefensive position. In this position was con-\ncentrated every available man that General\nKimura could raise, including, as we afterwards\nfound out, the whole of the Rangoon garrison,\nThey had orders “To ‘hold to the last”, and\nthe fanatical courage of the Japanese soldier\nhas never been questioned.\n\n253. The Pegu River, astride our line of ad-\nvance, was bridged in three places; the main\nroad bridge west of Pegu, the railway bridge\n(branch line) about a mile to the north, and\nthe main railway bridge about three miles\nfurther north. The enemy had prepared strong\npositions on both banks of the river, including\nPegu itself, through which the river flows. I\ndo not believe, however, that these defences,\nstrong as they were, would have delayed 4\nCorps—animated as it was by a fierce de-\ntermination to reach its objective—for very\nlong, had not a catastrophe intervened. A\nviolent tropical storm broke on the afternoon\nof the 29th April and continued throughout the\nnight. All movement of tanks or wheeled\nvehicles off the road became impossible; no\naircraft could land or take off ; the Pegu River\ntose in full flood. It was a foretaste of the\ncoming monsoon, and I was indeed thankful\nthat the early capture of Rangoon was not de-\npendent on our land advance alone.\n\n254. Despite the deep mud, 48 ‘Brigade\nadvanced on the 30th, stormed the Japanese\nposition at Milestone 51 at the point of the\nbayonet and, by nightfall, that part of Pegu\nwhich lies north of the river was in our hands.\nNorth of Pegu, we thad an even more important\nsuccess. On the 30th, as our attack progressed)\nthe enemy blew all the three bridges, but at\nboth the railway bridges, our infantry, crawling\nunder heavy fire over the wrecked girders,\nseized and held a small bridgehead. This most\ngallant feat was the turning point of the battle ;\nan attack on Pegu from the north-west had\nbeen planned, but the ford eight miles up river\nwas found to be impracticable. The crossings\nat the railway bridges, however, gave us what\nwe wanted—a bridgehead on the west bank.\nMeanwhile, another infantry column drove the\nenemy from a village six miles east of Pegu.\n\n255. On this date also (the 30th April), we\nrescued 350 British, American and Indian\nprisoners of war. Their escort, on finding the\nroad to Moulmein cut at Waw, abandoned their\ncharges, but anly to be destroyed by our ad-\nvancing troops. It was fitting that this rescue\nshould have been made by 17 Indian Division,\nto which some of these prisoners had belonged\nwhen they were captured in 1942.\n\n256. The attack on Pegu progressed through-\nout the Ist May, in a deluge of rain. 99\nBrigade attacked from the north, west of the\nTiver, supported by 255 Indian Tank Brigade\nfiring from among the ruins of the northern\npart of the town on the opposite bank. The\nJapanese A.A. artillery had its hands full, both\nin its normal and anti-tank réles, and we cap-\ntured twelve guns. By nightfall, the town had\nbeen practically cleared and the same night\nthe indomitable 17 Indian Division resumed\nits advance south. It was a gallant effort.\nSince our airstrips had been put out of action.\nthe troops had had to be further reduced to half\nrations. They were hungry and soaked to the\nskin, but their magnificent spirit was undimmed,\nand Rangoon lay ahead. But they were not to\n",

By the afternoon of the 3rd May, when\n17 Indian Division was still 32 miles from the\ncity and held up by a flooded chaung, Ran-\ngoon ‘was being entered by 15 Indian Corps.\n4 Corps had been frustrated, not by the Japan-\nese, but by the elements.

Although they did not actually\nliberate its capital, the reconquest of Burma\nwas in the main effected by Fourteenth Army,\nan to them Jargely belongs the honour and\nory.\n\nSECTION XIV (paras. 257-265) THE CAPTURE\nOF RANGOON\nThe plan for the seaborne operation against\nRangoon: The airborne operation: Rangoon\ndiscovered virtually abandoned: The link-up\nwith Fourteenth Army.\n\n257. While Fourteenth Army were thrust-\ning south, the planning of the seaborne inva-\nsion of Rangoon was proceeding. It will be\n\nremembered that, as stated at the beginning of |\n\nthis Despatch, when the various projects were\ndiscussed, how considerable an operation this\ninvasion in its original form was to have been.\nIt was now proposed to carry it out on a very\nmuch smaller scale, but the inherent diffi-\nculties of the operation remained the same,\nwith the exception that the weather conditions\nwould be a great deal worse than at the time\nof year originally contemplated for this opera-\ntion.\n\n258. In preparing the plan for a seaborne\nassault on Rangoon, the first consideration was\nthe clearance of the Rangoon River and its\nchannel, to permit the approach of major Jand-\ning craft. Throughout its whole length of 24\nmiles it had been mined both by the Japanese\nand by our own minelaying aircraft. Since\nminesweepers could only work with the flow\nof the tide, it was estimated that they would re-\nquire four days to complete their task. Before\nminesweepers or major landing craft could\nenter the river, the coastal defences on the west\nbank, especially those at Elephant Point,\nwould have to be eliminated. Owing to the\ndifficulties of approach to the mouth of the\ntiver, it was not practicable to neutralise these\nby’ fire nor was a sea landing on the Point\nitself possible at this time of year. The only\nsolution was to seize Elephant Point by an air-\nborne operation, so as to allow the sweeping\nof the entrance to the river and the approach\nof major landing craft. In any case a very\nlong run-in for minor landing craft was in-\nvolved, about 24 miles. On the east bank,\nthe village of Kyauktan and the town of Syriam\non the Pegu River were both believed to be\ngarrisoned, the latter being held in. strength.\nThus it was apparent that preliminary opera-\ntions, probably extending over several days,\nwould be necessary before Rangoon itself\ncould be attacked.\n\n259. The plan in broad outline was as follows.\n15 Indian Corps was to consist of 26 Indian\nDivision, now at Ramree, as assault division,\nwith 2 British Division, which had been with-\ndrawn into the Calcutta area, as follow up.\nThe airborne operation was to consist of a\nparachute battalion dropped on the Ist May,\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nwest of Elephant Point, with’ the task of\ndestroying the defences in that area. This\nwould permit the entrance of minesweepers\nwhich would sweep a channel up the river as\nfar as its junction with the Bassein Creek at\nThakutpin, some twelve miles from Elephant\nPoint. The way being thus opened for the first\nflight of assault troops, 36 Brigade of 26\nIndian Division was to land half-way between\nElephant Point and the Bassein Creek\non the 2nd May (D-Day). Simultaneously\nwith the landing of 36 Brigade, one\nbattalion of 71 Brigade was to land on\nthe east bank, near the mouth of the\nHmawwun Chaung, and exploit towards\nKyauktan. The remainder of 71 Brigade was\nto build up this bridgehead as landing craft\nbecame available, followed by 4 Brigade. These\ntwo Brigades, after capturing Kyauktan, were\nto drive northwards to the outskirts of Syriam.\nOn D plus 9, 6 Brigade of 2 British Division\nwould take over the area from 71 Brigade,\nthus releasing 71 and 4 Brigades for the cap-\nture of Syriam and the clearance of the\nsouthern bank of the Pegu River. The re-\nmaining two brigades of 2 British Division\nwere to follow up and assault Rangoon.\n\n260. One of the main difficulties was the\nshortness of time available for preparing for\nthis operation. The greater part of the Para-\nchute Brigade was on leave and so an impro-\nvised Gurkha battalion had to be got together\nfor the operation. It was very much to the\ncredit of the Indian Airborne Division that this\nwas efficiently organized and the operation\ncarried out up to time. The consideration\nwhich limited the size of the airborne\noperation was the available air-lift. To\nfind enough aircraft to lift the battalion,\nthe two American Air Commandos had\nto be taken from 4 Corps. At the same\ntime we could afford no reduction in air supply\nlift and so pilots had to be called on to fly at\nvery high rates during this period, a call to\nwhich they, needless to say, responded mag-\nnificently. Finally, it will be remembered that\n2 British, Division had been flown out of Burma\ninto India. To take part in this operation it\nhad to be re-equipped. This was done by\nG.H.Q. India, in what must have been record\ntime, brigades being re-equipped in turn with-\nin seven to ten days of their arrival, and\nalthough the whole Division was not in the end\nused, the first brigade embarked to schedule.\n\n261. On the 1st May, heavy air attacks were\nmade on all knowa defences on both banks of\nthe Rangoon River and the Parachute Batta-\nlion was dropped successfully at 0630 hours.\nThey captured Elephant Point practically un-\nopposed. It was only now that we received\nthe first indication that the Japanese had vir-\ntually abandoned Rangoon. Aircraft reported\nthe message “ Japs gone” painted on the roof\nof the Rangoon jail, which was known to be\na prisoner of war camp.\n\n262. By the 2nd May, the invasion fleet had\nbeen successfully and correctly assembled—\nno mean task—and Jay off the river estuary\non the agreed lowering position, which as 1\nhave said before was a considerable distance\nfrom the beaches.

Despite\nthis, it was decided that the operation should\nnot be postponed and the magnificent work of\nthe landing craft crews entirely justified this\ndecision. Admiral Martin’s signal to the fleet\nof “Guts and good seamanship” was an apt\nslogan for the occasion. The landings were\n\nsuccessful, the only opposition coming from the:\n\nelements. By 2000 hours the same night, 36\nBrigade had reached and crossed the Bassein\nCreek. It was on this day that it might be said\nthat the first element of the Imperial forces re-\nentered Rangoon. An R.AF. pilot, after seeing\nsignals from the ground and a Union Jack\nflying over the jail, landed at the airfield seven\nmiles north of the town. He was greeted by\nthe local inhabitants, and made his way into\nthe city and, after contacting our prisoners in\nthe jail, went down river in a country boat and\ngave 26 Indian Division the news. By 2200\nhours on the 3rd May, 36 Brigade had occu-\npied Dala Village, opposite the Rangoon\ndocks, against minor opposition. They had\nalso crossed the river and entered the dock\narea. This was found to have been wrecked by\nour bombers, but the only serious damage to\nthe residential part of the town was to the\nwater and lighting installations. Meanwhile,\n71 Brigade had occupied Syriam, the only\nresistance coming from snipers, and were pre-\nparing to cross the Pegu River.\n\n263. The liberation of Rangoon had cost\nus just under one hundred casualties. Only one\nlanding craft, unfortunately containing key\nengineer and medical personnel, was Jost on a\nmine. By the successful re-entry into Rangoon\nthrough the ‘sea-gate, the port was re-opened\nat least 14 days earlier than if it had been\nleft to Fourteenth Army to take from the\nnorth, even as events turned out. The value\nof these 14 days at this critical period needs no\nemphasis.\n\n264. By the Sth May, the occupation of the\ncity was complete and exploitation north in\nprogress. On the following day 26 Indian\nDivision linked up with Fourteenth Army at\nMilestone 29 on the Rangoon—Pegu road,\nand the north-south bisection of Burma was\ncomplete, with 18,000 Japanese troops being\ncut off to the west. On this date, also, 26\nIndian Division passed temporarily under com-\nmand of Fourteenth Army and 15 Indian Corps\nthus completed its campaign in Burma.\n\n265. With the capture of Rangoon a major\nphase of the war against Japan had been com-\npleted, a phase important in itself and decisive\nas far as Burma was concerned. It will be to\nthe eternal credit of the sea, land and air forces\nof South-East Asia that this phase was com-\npleted before the 1945 monsoon.\n\nSECTION XV (paras. 266-274) THe NEw\nSITUATION\nOpening of a new phase: Internal Security\nsituation: Tactical situation after capture of\nRangoon: The administrative situation and\nthe effect on future plans.\n\n266. The capture of Rangoon marked the\ncompletion of operation Capital and the end\nof a definite phase in the operations in Burma.\nFrom this time onwards I was concerned with\nthe dual task of finishing off the liberation of\n\n1927\n\nBurma, and at the same time completing pre-\nparations for the campaign in Malaya. For\nthe sake of clarity, I propose to deal first with\nour operations in Burma, leaving the plans for\nMalaya to a later section of my Despatch.\nBut it must be remembered that the planning\nwas in fact being canried out concurrently with\nthe operations.\n\n267. Before describing the continuance of\noperations, one other matter requires mention.\nThis was the internal security aspect, which\ncould not now be ignored. Both during the\nretreat in 1942 and during the recent advance\nlarge quantities of British and Japanese\narms and ammunition had fallen into the\nhands of the civil population. Further-\nmore, British and American Long-Range\nPenetration Brigades, and guerilla organiza-\ntions, had armed the northern hill tribes\non a substantial scale. And finally the\nJapanese had issued arms to locally raised\nforces.\n\nThe civil population was therefore in posses-\nsion of a large number of weapons, and there\nwas every chance of a serious outbreak of both\ndacoity and communal strife. Indeed, dacoity\nhad already been met in the Akyab area,\nnecessitating the detaching of troops to suppress\nit.\n\nIn January the Burma Government had\ntaised the question of the reconstitution of the\nBurma Army, and I had recommended the\ntaising of seven infantry battalions in addition -\nto those already under my command. The\nraising of the first of these was begun in June\nbut until the end of the period under review\nthe question of internal security was, as can\nbe understood, constantly in the minds of\nmyself and my subordinate Commanders.\n\n268. My main object at this time, early May,\nwas to complete the liberation of Burma by\nthe destruction of the remaining enemy forces\nin the country. Apart from direct operations\nagainst the Japanese cut off to the west of the\nMandalay—Rangoon corridor, it was necessary\nto exert pressure to the east and south, along\nthe Taunggyi and Mawchi roads, in order that\nthe maximum advantages could be obtained for\npost-monsoon operations. ;\n\n269. Our estimate of the Japanese effective\nfighting strength in Burma at this time was\n77,000, of which 18,200 were west of the\nIrrawaddy. Enemy formations were much\nintermingled and disorganized as a result of\ntheir defeats, and it was therefore difficult to\ndetermine accurately their exact groupings.\nTheir locations, however, were generally known,\nand the Japanese Burma Area Army fell into\nfive main groups. (See Appendix B.)\n\nFirst, west of the Irrawaddy in ‘the\nThayetmyo area, were 54 Division, 72 Inde-\npendent Mixed Brigade, 153 Regiment from\n49 Division and remnants of 112 Regiment of\n55 Division.\n\nSecond, concentrating in the Pegu Yomas\nbetween the Rivers Irrawaddy and Sittang, was\na considerable but ill-organized force, consist-\ning of H.Q. 28th Japanese Army and Army\ntroops, 55 Division less 112 Regiment, remnants\nof 18, 49 and 53 Japanese Divisions, two\nBrigades formed from the original Rangoon\ngarrison and a number of Lines of Communica-\ntion and Base troops. .\n\nThird, 113 Regiment was east of Sittang,\naround Taunggyi.\n",

Burma Area\nArmy, H.Q. 33rd Japanese Army, 31 and 33\nDivisions, 24 Independent Mixed Brigade and\nL. of C. and Base units.\n\n270. This force was not in fact as formidable\nas it first appears. 56 Division and 24 Inde-\npendent Mixed Brigade were the only major\nformations which had not been severely\nhandled, with the loss of a large proportion of\ntheir artillery and transport. Moreover these\ntwo formations alone had managed to retain\ntheir inter-communication systems reasonably\nintact, There was therefore, I appreciated, no\nimmediate possibility of a major counter-offen-\nsive, and the only possible intention of the\nJapanese would be to extricate those troops\nwest of the Sittang from their almost hopeless\nsituation. .\n\n271. I also appreciated that, in broad terms,\nthe Japanese would endeavour to hold the east\nbank of the Sittang as a rear-guard position\nunder cover of which the bulk of their forces\nnow west of the river could be withdrawn east\ninto Siam or south to Moulmein. While this\nwas in progress the Japanese were likely to\noppose any advances by our forces on the\nTaunggyi and Mawchi roads as likely to turn\ntheir position, and cut off or disrupt an\norganized withdrawal south or east of his\nforces west of the Sittang. Elements of 56\nand 15 Japanese Divisions did in fact oppose\nour advance on the Taunggyi and Mawchi\nroads respectively until the surrender.\n\nIt was obvious that the extrication of the\nJapanese formations west of the river was an\noperation involving tremendous difficulties.\nThere were the truly formidable natural\nobstacles of the Irrawaddy, the Pegu Yomas\nmountains and the Sittang to be crossed, during\nthe monsoon, by jungle tracks and without\nwheeled transport or river crossing equipment.\nThey were also already cut off from all normal\nsupply and while they might live by foraging\nthey could not be maintained in ammunition\nand other expendable military stores. Our air\nsuperiority forbad the use of air supply.\n\n272. Against this situation, Fourteenth Army\nwas in general extended over several hundreds\nof miles on the Yenangyaung—Rangoon and\nMandalay—Rangoon axes. It was only pos-\nsible under such conditions to hold key points\nand patrol the intervening gaps, while the\nmovement eastwards of the considerable body\nof enemy might well disrupt our tenuous lines\nof communication.\n\nAlthough we had gained a valuable fort-\nnight by the capture of Rangoon from the sea,\nthe administrative situation now limited our\ncapabilities for further action, coupled as it was\nwith the necessity to begin immediately the\npreparations for the attack on Malaya.\nAlthough it is dealt with in Part II of this\nDespatch, I think it desirable to draw atten-\ntion here to the two routes by which our sup-\nplies arrived, and to point out that I was\nTesponsible not only for the maintenance of\nthe Army, but also for that of all Naval and\nAir Force bases in Burma and for the carriage\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THe LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nto distribution centres in Burma of civil\nsupplies. .\n\nThe Northern supply route ran by rail to\nManipur Road in Assam thence by road\nthrough Imphal to Kalewa then by Inland\nWater Transport to Myingan, and finally by\nrail to Thazi for distribution. It could be\nsupplemented by air transport from Imphal to\n\n‘Myingan, but this method was as liable to\n\nmonsoon interruption as was the worn-out road\nroute. In fact, the rapid deterioration of this\nroute had already caused 4 Corps to be put on\nhalf rations as a precautionary measure.\n\nThe Southern supply route was by sea to\nChittagong, Akyab or Kyaukpyu and thence\nby air to Central Burma or Inland Water\nTransport to troops in Arakan.\n\n273. It was therefore essential to open, de-\nvelop and stock Rangoon as the main lbase for\nSouthern Burma, and improve its communica-\ntions northwards as rapidly as possible. This\nwas underlined by the administrative problems\nwith which we would be faced when operating\nin the Moulmein area, for here roads were few,\nand monsoon conditions precluded the main-\ntenance by sea of an advance down the Tenas-\nserim coast. Finally, no further resources of\naircraft or shipping were available, and I was\nforced to the conclusion that no major opera-\ntion could be undertaken at any distance from\nthe main Mandalay—Rangoon road or railway.\n\n274. I accordingly directed General Slim to\ncomplete the destruction of the enemy west of\nthe Sittang and to maintain constant pressure\nagainst Moulmein, Mawchi and Taunggyi.\n\nSECTION XVI (paras. 275-281) OPERATIONS\nIN (May\n\nNew orders issued by General Slim : Arakan\noperations: 4 Corps operations: 33 Corps\noperations : Note on guerilla organizations.\n\n275. To carry out the tasks I had now given\nhim (see para. 274) General Slim issued fresh\norders to ‘his subordinate commanders. Besides\n4 and 33 Corps, General Slim had 26 Indian\nand 36 British Divisions, and 64 Indian Brigade\n(19 Indian Division), under his direct control.\n\nHe instructed 4 Corps (General Messervy)\nto capture Mokpalin and Bilin, east of the\nSittang and reconnoitre towards Moulmein : to\ndestroy any enemy forces attempting to escape\nfrom the Pegu Yomas across the Mandalay—\nRangoon road and railway; and to capture\nThandaung on the road from Toungoo to\nMawchi.\n\n33 Corps (General Stopford) at the same\ntime was ordered to destroy the enemy in the\nIrrawaddy Valley, open the Prome—Rangoon\nroad and railway, and capture Bassein. 26\nIndian Division was ordered to advance on\nProme from Rangoon to meet 33 Corps, and on\nthe 15th May a battalion group from 2 British\nDivision (then in the Rangoon area) was sent\nto carry out the capture of Bassein.\n\nFinally General Slim ordered 64 Indian In-\nfantry Brigade to relieve 36 British Division\non the Taunggyi—Thazi road and capture\nKalaw, the Brigade coming under command\nof 4 Corps on the 18th May.\n\n276.

I also instructed General\nStockwell to patrol east of the Taungup—\nProme road to establish contact with 33 Corps\nas the monsoon conditions made it impossible\nto move the whole Division on this route.\n\n277. 4 Corps operations during May, 1945:\n5 Indian Division was ordered to open the\nroad from Payagyi to Mokpalin and also clear\nthe area between Pegu and the southern end\nof the Pegu Yomas of enemy. 9 Indian In-\nfantry Brigade opened the road as far as Waw\nagainst determined Japanese resistance, and\nthen continued towards the Sittang River. The\nheavy rainfall, however, rendered the deploy-\nment of tanks and artillery difficult if not im-\npossible, as the west bank of the Sittang is\nflat and, during May, flooded. With the enemy\noverlooking them from jungle-clad hills on the\neast bank and without adequate river-crossing\nequipment it was not possible to launch an\nattack to capture Mokpalin, or do more than\npatrol across the Sittang River on a wide front,\nuntil after the monsoon.\n\n‘Meanwhile 123 and 161 Brigades were en-\ngaged in widespread patrols under appalling\nclimatic conditions, seeking out the numerous\nJapanese in the area to the south of the Pegu\nYomas. Throughout the month their toll of\nJapanese dead mounted; the enemy became\ndesperate in their attempts to escape, and on\noccasions would deliver fierce attacks upon\nour patrols.\n\nMeanwhile 17 Indian Division was disposed\nbetween Penwegon and Nyaunglebin, and spent\nthe whole month in most active patrolling,\ndesigned to kill the enemy wherever found and\nto prevent a concentrated attempt at a break\nout. In this they were highly successful, and\nproved conclusively their superiority to the\nJapanese in this type of operation. As an\nexample, at Konin on the 21st May a patrol\nof 99 Brigade in one encounter killed 148\nJapanese at a cost to themselves of 4 wounded.\n\n19 Indian Division from Toungoo had by the\n10th May advanced 5 miles along the road to\nThandaung, but 98 Brigade, the leaders, were\nbeing strenuously opposed. On this date 62\nBrigade, with tank support, took over the\nlead and fought its way forward in the face\nof extensive mining of the road and determined.\nresistance from prepared positions on the high\nground dominating the area. On the 25th May\n98 Brigade took over again, and three days\nlater captured the road junction at Thandaung,\n\nthough pockets of the enemy continued to hold”\n\n‘out in the surrounding hills.\n\n278. It is convenient at this juncture to deal\nwith 64 Indian Infantry Brigade and the opera-\ntions on the Thazi—Taunggyi road. On the\n10th May it relieved 36 British Division,\nwhich was due for withdrawal from operations\nafter a year’s hard fighting from Myitkyina in\nthe north to Thazi. The Brigade met most\ndetermined resistance in the locality known aptly\nas “ The Staircase”, 12 miles north of Kalaw.\nHere 56 Japanese Division, probably the least\nbattered formation left in the Burma Area Army\nhad a well prepared defensive position sup-\nPorted by artillery. However, after prolonged\nand bitter fighting “The Staircase” fell to\n\n60332\n\n1929\n\nour troops on the 3lst May and Kalaw was\nentered a week later.\n\n279. 33 Corps operations in May : The opera-\ntions of 33 Corps in May consisted initially\nof an advance south by'20 Indian Division on\nthe east of the Irrawaddy to meet 26 Indian\nDivision marching from Rangoon north to‘\nProme, and thereby to seal off the enemy\nforces, which consisted of elements of 54 and\n55 Japanese Divisions, and 72 Independent\nMixed Brigade, to the west of the Irrawaddy.\nAt the same time 7 Indian Division, 268\nIndian (Independent) Infantry Brigade and\nthe Lushai Brigade, were driving the enemy\nsouth before them down the west bank of the\nIrrawaddy, and so closing the net. The link-\nup between 20 and 26 Indian Divisions was\nmade on the 15th May at Taikkyi, 60 miles\nmorth of Rangoon, and 26 Indian Division\nthen came under command of 33 Corps.\n\nAs had been anticipated, the enemy now\nattempted to concentrate on the west bank of\nthe Irrawaddy in the general area Thayetmyo—\nKama, and to force his way across into the\nPegu Yomas. General Stopford accordingly\ndirected 7 Indian Division to operate against\nhis crossings on the west bank of the river be-\ntween Allanmyo and Kama, while 20 Indian\nDivision consolidated the Prome—Rangoon\nroad and railway axis and prevented the enemy\nestablishing escape gaps across the river into\nthe Pegu Yomas. 20 Indian Division was also\nordered to push west on the Prome—Taungup\nroad to make contact with patrols of 82 (West\nAfrican) Division and so cut off stragglers from\n55 Japanese Division.\n\nIn early May under the increasing pressure\nof 7 Indian Division, the Japanese began their\nattempts to break-out east over the river. 54\nJapanese Division succeeding in establishing a\nbridgehead at Zalon, 10 miles north of Prome\nwhile one regiment of 49 Japanese Division\nand 2 Japanese Brigade actually succeeded in\ncrossing just north of Prome and making good\ntheir escape. '\n\nGeneral Stopford, faced with the problem of\ntrying to prevent all escape crossings over some\n50 miles of river with the limited number of\ntroops available, decided to concentrate against\nthe Zalon bridgehead, First 80 Brigade of 20\nIndian Division and later 33 Brigade of 7 Indian\nDivision were directed against the bridgehead\nand throughout the remainder of May both 7\nand 20 Indian Divisions were involved in much\nbitter fighting against the enemy concentrations\non the west bank and against the crossings.\n\nMost of these crossings were destroyed or\n‘beaten back, but some small parties were able\nto slip across the river.\n\nVery heavy casualties were inflicted on the\nenemy during this period and by the end of\nMay the fighting in the Zalon area had reached\nits conclusion. The west bank was virtually\nclear of the enemy and those who had suc-\nceeded in crossing were being hunted into the\nfoothills of the Pegu Yomas. 268 Indian\nInfantry Brigade was left on the west bank to\nmop up the stragglers.\n\n280. Bassein was occupied by a battalion\ngroup of 6 Brigade without opposition on the\n25th May, our troops receiving a joyous wel-\ncome from the local inhabitants.\n\nD\n",

It was during this period that the Burma\nNational Army, now renamed the Patriot\nBurma Forces, began to take an active part\nin the operations, The Japanese had raised\nthe Burma Defence Army of some 3,000 men,\nand this force had come over to our side in\nMarch. From this date they fought the Japanese\nin co-operation with our troops, particularly\nour Force 136, and the degree of co-operation\nimproved steadily as time went on, reaching its\nclimax in the battle of the break-out in July.\nDuring May these organizations operated\ncourageously and successfully in a guerilla rdle\neast of the Sittang. They were particularly\nsuccessful when they worked in co-operation\nwith 221 Group, R.A.F., attacking enemy\nheadquarters, dumps and stores, and damaging\ncommunications. Their efforts were by no\nmeans to be ignored, and the results attained\nwere a fit reward for the arduous conditions\nunder which they lived and in which the\nRAF. pilots flew. Their presence compelled\nthe Japanese to abandon their attempts to\nescape in small parties, and forced them to\nadopt the alternative of a concentrated break-\nout, which ended so disastrously for them.\n\nSECTION XVII (paras. 282-291) Tae FINAL\nBATTLES\n\nReorganization of the Allied Land Forces:\nFormation and tasks of Twelfth Army: Opera-\ntions in the Irrawaddy Valley: The Lower\nSittang Battle: The Battle of the Break-out:\nConclusion of operations.\n\n282. Continuing the narrative of events, it\nwas towards the end of May that it became\nnecessary to reorganize my forces in order to\ncarry cut the operations planned to take place\nagainst Malaya. These plans I will describe\nin a later section, so here it is but necessary to\nstate that they involved the removal to India\nof Headquarters, Fourteenth Army, and certain\nformations and units. In India General Slim\n- Was to be responsible for the planning and\npreparations for the new venture, while Burma\nbecame the responsibility of a new Army—\nTwelfth Army, under the command of General\nStopford.\n\n283. On the formation of Twelfth Army\n(28th May, 1945), 33 Corps ceased to exist.\nThe formations allotted to Twelfth Army\nwere (by the 2nd June, 1945) 4 Corps\n(consisting of 5, 17 and 19 Indian Divi-\nsions), 7 and 20 Indian Divisions, 82 (West\nAfrican) Division, 255 Indian Tank Brigade,\n6 British and 268 Indian Infantry Brigades.\n26 Indian Division and 254 Indian Tank\nBrigade were in the process of moving back to\nIndia, but the guerilla forces mentioned in\nparagraph 281 remained to operate under\nTwelfth Army. To deal with internal security,\n505 District and No. 1 Area were formed, with\ntheir Headquarters at Meiktila and Rangoon\nrespectively. Besides administrative units, they\nhad at their disposal a total of eighteen infantry\nbattalions.\n\n284. My directions to General Stopford were\nto complete the destruction of the Japanese\nforces remaining west of the Sittang, and to\nliberate that part of Burma (including the\nTenasserim Civil Division) which Japanese\nforces still occupied. He was also charged\nwith the introduction of the Civil Affairs Ser-\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nvice (Burma) into the country, the maintenance\nof law and order, and the re-formation of the\nBurma Army.\n\n285. In order to carry out my orders,\nGeneral Stopford instructed 4 Corps (disposed\nbetween the Sittang and the Pegu Yomas) to\nblock any attempts the Japanese might make to\nbreak out of the Yomas, to advance along the\nTaunggyi road and the Mawchi road, and to\nmaintain a brigade opposite the Sittang cross-\ning near Mokpalin. Meanwhile 7 Indian Divi-\nsion (with 268 Indian Infantry Brigade under\ncommand) were to clear the Allanmyo—Kama\n—Prome area of Japanese stragglers, and\noperate with offensive patrols into the Pegu\nYomas from the west. 20 Indian Division were\nto act likewise in the area to the south of the\nYomas, and 6 Infantry Brigade and 255 Indian\nTank Brigade were held in reserve in Rangoon,\nwith the task of forming a mobile column in\nthe event of an enemy thrust towards Rangoon,\nand in addition to operate water patrols in con-\njunction with the Navy in the Irrawaddy Delta.\n\n286.The operations under control of 7 Indian\nDivision in the Irrawaddy Valley around\nAllanmyo proceeded as planned, and many\nJapanese raiding and foraging parties were\ndestroyed. Patrols probed the Pegu Yomas\nand met increasing resistance, until by mid-\nJune it was apparent that the valley was clear\nand that the Japanese in the Pegu Yomas were\npreparing an attempt to break out eastwards\nthrough 4 Corps’ area. Of this Corps, 5 Indian\nDivision was about to leave to join Fourteenth\nArmy in India, and therefore 7 Indian Divi-\nsion was switched to 4 Corps, leaving 268\nIndian Brigade, now joined by 22 (East\nAfrican) Brigade, in the Irrawaddy Valley.\n\n287. The relief of 5 Indian Division in the\narea between Pegu and the Sittang by 7 Indian\nDivision coincided with a counter-attack by\nelements of 18 and 53 Japanese Divisions\nacross the Sittang from Mokpalin. This was a\ndetermined drive towards Pegu, designed to\nassist the Japanese in the Southern Pegu Yomas\nto break out eastwards by pinning down 7\nIndian Division. The country in which the\nbattle was fought was one large lake, over-\nlooked by the Japanese artillery position in\nthe hills east of the Sittang. Conditions were.\nsuch that at times it was impossible to use the\nGurkha battalions owing to the depth of water\non. the “land” over which they were to\noperate. Our lack of artillery was made good\nby the magnificent efforts of the R.AF., and\n7 Indian Division was able to stem the attack.\nA battalion (4/8 Gurkha Rifles) was at\none time surrounded at the end of a peninsula,\nbut fought its way out through the Japanese\nlines, and by the end of July the situation was\ntestored to what it had been before the Japan-\nese attack. Owing to lack of co-ordination the\nJapanese efforts did not assist their comrades\nin the Pegu Yomas, and resulted in their sus-\ntaining casualties much larger than those of\n7 Indian Division,\n\n288. Operations on the Mawchi road con-\ntinued throughout June and July. 19 Indian\nDivision made slow but steady progress despite\nJapanese resistance, and dreadful climatic and\ntopographical difficulties. On the Taunggyi\nroad the Japanese resistance was less, and by\nthe 25th July Taunggyi itself was in our hands.\n",

V Force provided\nmost valuable information, and enabled us to\nlocate the Japanese and forecast their plans.\n4 Corps estimated their numbers at just under\n10,000, but this figure was in fact only half the\ntotal. The discrepancy was due to the un-\nexpectedly large number of non-divisional\nJapanese troops caught in the trap, who took\npart in the break-out. Finally, on the 4th\nJuly, an operation order was captured giving\nthe entire Japanese break-out plan; the only\ndetail lacking was the date selected for D-Day,\nbut other Intelligence placed D-Day as approxi-\nmately the 20th July.\n\n290. With this information at his disposal\nGeneral F.LS. Tuker, acting for General\nMesservy who was on leave, was able to dispose\n4 Corps to block all intended lines of escape.\nThe Japanese held to their plan to the last de-\ntail, and the resulting slaughter was tremendous.\nBetween the 2ist July and the 4th August over\n10,000 casualties were inflicted on the Japanese,\nnot counting wounded. Of these only 740 were\ntaken prisoner.\n\n291. The Battle of the Break-out, it trans-\npired, was the last battle of the war. For the\n10 days which intervened between the con-\nclusion of the battle and the end of the period\ncovered by this Despatch, a lull ensued during\nwhich little of note occurred. Patrols and small\nadvances were the order of the day, and the\nRoyal Air Force continued to add to the\ndestruction they had caused throughout the\ncampaign.\n\nSection XVID (paras. 292-301) PLans FOR\nMALAYA\nJoint Planning Staff Paper of the 23rd\nFebruary, 1945: Operations Roger, Zipper and\nMailfist: Cancellation of Roger: D-Day for\nZipper: Zipper appreciation and plan.\n\n292. It is now necessary to revert 10\nFebruary, 1945, to consider the evolution of\nthe plans for the recapture of Malaya.\nThroughout the post-Rangoon operations to\nwhich the last three sections have been devoted,\nplanning and preliminary action for subsequent\noperations had been continuing, and their\neffects on current operations, particularly com-\nmand and organization, have been recorded.\nThe assaults on Malaya and Singapore (opera-\ntions Zipper and Mailfist) had absolute priority,\nand every unit required for these operations was\neither moved to India or concentrated in\nRangoon (which was to be the forward base\nfor the assault forces) for rest and\nreorganization.\n\n293. On the 23rd February the Supreme\nCommander had held a conference at Fort\nWilliam, and at it approval was given to the\noutline plan produced by the Joint Planning\nStaff in their Paper No. 88 of the 6th February.\nIt was appreciated that the Japanese would\nendeavour to hold Malaya and in particular,\nSingapore, as a barrier to prevent our entry\ninto the area of the South China Sea.\nSimilarly, without Singapore we would be un-\nable to extend materially our operations east-\nwards. The object of the paper was to exaniine\nthe best outline method of reaching Singapore.\n\n60332\n\n1931\n\n294. It was anticipated that the Japanese\nwould build up their strength in Malaya, and\ntherefore it was desirable to mount the opera-\ntion as speedily as possible and by the quickest\nroute. This rendered undesirable an approach\nvia the Sunda Straits, Sumatra, or the Andaman\nIslands, as the establishment of a forward base\nin these areas would still leave that base at a\ndistance too great for a direct assault on Singa-\npore. By various means we attempted\nto give the impression that we would\nmove on Singapore by one or more of these\ntoutes. It was therefore agreed that the for-\nward base should be on the Malay Peninsula,\nand an examination was made of the geo-\ngraphical features of the area.\n\n295. The Tenasserim coast was ruled out as\na suitable area for a landing owing to the mon-\nsoon conditions. The further south the better\nwould these conditions become, until, in the\nStraits of Malacca, sea conditions were suitable\nthroughout the year.\n\nThe Phuket operation was feasible, but the\nvery narrow waterway dividing Phuket Island\nfrom the mainland made it necessary to provide\na force capable of withstanding any build-up\nagainst it. The size of this force depended\nnaturally on the anticipated size of the build-\nup, and this in turn depended on the length\nof time during which the British force was to\nbe the only one ashore in Malaya. Another\nlanding would, of course. divert some of the\nbuild-up, but the scarcity of landing craft meant\na considerable time lag before the next\namphibious operation could take place, and\nfor that reason therefore the Army commit-\nment at Phuket had to be considerable if the\nproposed airstrips were to be protected from\nartillery fire. While relatively near Rangoon,\nthe seizure of Phuket did not, of course, obviate\nthe need to make another landing on the Malay\nPeninsula nearer to Singapore.\n\n296. A study of the beaches and anchorages\nrevealed that the Port Dickson/Port\nSwettenham area also was suitable, though by\nno means perfect, and the distance on to Singa-\npore was reduced to about 200 miles. This\nplan would make the maximum use of the\ncapture of Rangoon, and it was considered that\nwith the seizure of a bridgehead in this area\nit would be possible to disrupt Japanese com-\nmunications along the Malay Peninsula by the\njoint use of air power and guerilla forces. It\nwas therefore agreed at this meeting on the\n23rd February to examine this project in de-\ntail, target dates being decided as the Ist June\nfor Phuket (Roger), early October for the Port\nSwettenham/Port Dickson landing (Zipper)\nand December for Singapore (Mailfist).\n\n297. Planning accordingly was begun in de-\ntail, while the operations in Burma proceeded.\nAs has been recorded (para. 224), the Roger\noperation was postponed by the decision\nto capture Rangoon from the sea, as the\nonly landing craft available were used for\nthis operation. On the capture of Rangoon\nin May, the rapid deterioration of the\nJapanese air and naval forces and the avail-\nability of sufficient aircraft carriers, was such\nthat the Supreme Commander decided\nthat he could accept the risk of not seizing\nPhuket Island at all, and planning thereafter\nwas concentrated on Zipper and Mailfist.\nFurthermore the situation had now developed\n\nD2\n",

L.\nRoberts (see para. 94) was therefore allotted\nto the new task of undertaking operation\nZipper. General Roberts and the Naval and\nAir Force Commanders examined the prob-\nlem, and. produced by the 23rd June an appre-\nciation and outline plan. They divided the\noperation into three phases ; the securing of the\nbridgehead, the advance to the Johore Cause-\nway and the assault on Singapore. The last\nphase was Mailfist, and the two projects were\ncombined into one.\n\n298. At a meeting with the Supreme Com-\nmander at Delhi on the 30th May I was re-\nluctantly compelled to tell Admiral Mount-\nbatten that the effects of repatriation on my\nunits was such that I must request a post-\nponement of Zipper from August to early\nSeptember.\n\nft had been decided by the War Cabinet that\nthe period of overseas service necessary to\nqualify for repatriation was to be reduced by\nfour months, and this decision resulted in\nBritish units being decimated by wholesale de-\npartures of battle experienced men to the\nUnited Kingdom. Training and reorganization\nwas essential, and the Supreme Commander,\nconsidering this and certain other factors,\naccepted my recommendation. General Slim\n(who had by now taken charge of Zipper plan-\nning —see para. 282) and his colleagues were\nso informed, and detailed examination led\nto the 9th September being selected as D-Day.\n\n299. The appreciation of the Japanese re-\nsistance to be expected, led us to anticipate\nthat the landing would be lightly opposed,\nand that the subsequent build-up against it\nwould be at the worst three divisions, and at\nthe best not more than two, in addition to the\ngarrison of Singapore itself. Against this we\nwere able to deploy two divisions and one\nbrigade on D-Day, rising to three divisions and\na Parachute brigade by D plus 8 and a fourth\ndivision by D plus 25. This force, plus non-\ndivisional troops, comprised 34 Corps. My\nplan after the seizure of the bridgehead was\nbased on making a rapid advance on Singapore\nin order to avoid if possible a serious battle\nfor the Island. If opposition proved light,\n34 Corps was to begin the advance south as\nsoon as possible; and we estimated this might\nbe possible by D plus 13. It would even then\nbe necessary to leave two divisions to secure\nthe Port Dickson/Port Swettenham area, but\nthe build-up from India and Rangoon was to\ncome in any case. My plan was to bring in\n15 Indian Corps to take over rearward com-\nmitments, and thereby allow the Commander,\n34 Corps, to devote his entire energies to the\nadvance south. I planned also a series of\namphibian hooks down the coast, in order to\ncut off the Japanese facing 34 Corps and to\nprevent them retiring on to the Singapore gar-\nrison. To control these diverse operations and\nto conduct the battle on the ground, General\nSlim and his Fourteenth Army Headquarters\nwas scheduled to arrive with the second\n‘Corps.\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\n300. The landing itself was to be covered by\ncarrier-borne aircraft for the first 8 to 10\ndays, by which time a strip had to be operating\nashore. It was essential also to capture a port\nthrough which stores could be landed to sup-\nplement the small amount which could be taken\nover the beaches. The conclusion reached\ntherefore was that the main assault by three\nbrigades should go in over the Morib beaches\non D-Day, with the object of securing the air-\nStrips in the area and also Port Swettenham.\nAlso on D-Day, another brigade was to land\nat Sepang to seize the road bridges there; this\nsubsidiary landing would be a support to the\nmain one. In addition, on D plus 3, three\nmore brigades were to land on the somewhat\nobvious beaches by Port Dickson, with the\nobject of enlarging the bridgehead and seizing\nanother usable port.\n\n301. The plan described in outline above,\nwas in fact carried out subsequent to the\nJapanese capitulation, but its execution did\nnot take place during the period covered by\nmy Despatch. Furthermore the Japanese sur-\nrender caused certain alterations to it, and J\nhave therefore decided that it would be undesir-\nable to go into fuller detail myself. At this\npoint therefore I shall conclude the Operational\nportion of my Despatch, and follow with Part\nII which examines the very vital Administra-\ntive aspect of the campaign in considerable\n\njetail.\n\nPART II\nADMINISTRATION\nSECTION XIX (paras. 302-310)—THE\nMAINTENANCE PROBLEM\nThe Northern, Southern and Air Lines of\nCommunication generally: The size of the\nproblem.\n\n302. The Japanese failure to solve their ad-\nministrative difficulties in their attempt to in-\nvade India led them to disaster at Kohima: and\nImphal. The fact that we overcame the diffi-\nculties of administration resulted in the recon-\nquest of Burma. The problem that faced us\nwas immense, and the effort that was put into\nits solution was as great. In the final analysis\nof military history this may ‘be the outstanding\nfeature of the campaign, and it is with this\nin mind, that I intend to go into this aspect\nmore fully than is usual in a Despatch.\n\n303. The outstanding administrative problem\nof an army is usually its maintenance ; that is,\nthe unfailing supply of ail the commodities\nwhich keep that army fighting in the field. The\nbase for our operations was India. The rail-\nheads were at Chittagong (with short exten-\nsions to Dohazari and to the north for the\nArakan coast) ; Dimapur (Manipur Road), rail-\nhead for Fourteenth Army; and Ledo and\nChabua for Northern Combat Area Command\nand the United States air ferry route to China.\nThese railheads thus joined the only three road\nentries to Burma from the north. A certain\ndegree of flexibility was provided between the\nAssam lines to Dimapur, Ledo and Chabua\nand the Eastern Bengal dines to Chittagong by\nthe rail link between Lumding and Badarpur,\nthough this link was of limited capacity owing\nto gradients. The whole system of communi-\ncations between India and Burma has already\nbeen fully described by my predecessor, Gen-\n",

The Northern L. of C. was made up, at\nits fullest and longest development, of three\nmain sections from the Manipur Road rail-\nhead. The first was 320 miles of road from the\nrailhead, via Imphal and Tamu, to Kalewa.\nIt was in part a mountainous route, and the\nstretch from Tamu onwards could at first only\nbe called a road by courtesy, though subse-\nquently brought up to all-weather standard.\nThe second section was by river from Kalewa\nto Myingyan, about 240 miles downstream, in\nInland Water Transport craft. During the dry\nweather there was also the fair-weather road\nfrom Kalewa via Pyingaing to Shwebo and\nthence on by the Central Burma all-weather\nroad system, but our engineer resources never\nallowed the conversion of this stretch to higher\nstandard. The third section was by a combina-\ntion of railway and road from Myingyan south-\neast to Thazi and thence south to Rangoon,\nabout 430 miles. In addition, a secondary\nLW.T. L. of C. ran down: the ‘axis of the Irra-\nwaddy. Demolitions and bombing had cut the\nrailway into sections, which were operated to\na limited extent with motor transport bridging\nthe gaps. The Northern L. of C. is thus seen\nto total nearly a thousand miles, using road,\nrail, and water transport. The resources to\noperate this immense and complicated L. of C.\nhad either to be brought in by road form the\nManipur Road railhead or be flown in. The\nlimitations and development of this L. of C.\nwill be described later.\n\n305. On the Southern L. of C. maintenance\nwas initially by sea from the main base ports\nin India to Chittagong and to small river ports\nsuch as Cox’s Bazaar and Maungdaw. After\nthe capture of Akyab and ‘Ramree Islands the\nbulk of this maintenance was sent direct to\nAkyab and Kyaukpyu. The latter were how-\never capable of only limited development, with\nthe harbour-craft which we had available.\n\nThe Southern L. of C. could, by land and by\ncoastal craft, only serve the Arakan operations.\nThere were only two overland routes from the\ncoast inland to Central Burma, one a rough\ntrack via An, incapable of development as a\nroad L. of C. without thorough and expensive\nconstruction, for which we had neither the\ntime nor the resources. The other was the fair-\nweather road from Taungup to Prome. The\nreasons why this route was never opened up\nhave been discussed fully in Part I of this\nDespatch. It is sufficient here to say that it\ncould not have been developed to a sufficient\ncapacity in time to be any use, even if we had\nhad the engineer resources available. Thus the\nonly way the Southern L. of C. could feed Cen-\ntral Burma and Fourteenth Army was by\nair transport, and: this is what it did. The\ndevelopment of this L. of C. will be described\nlater.\n\n306. At the start of the offensive, the air\nsupply organization was based on groups of air-\nfields near Imphal in the north, Comilla,\n\n* Operations in Burma and North-East India from\nthe 16th November 1943, to the 22nd June, 1944.\n\n1933\n\nAgartala and Chittagong in Eastern Bengal.\nWith the limited land lines of communication\nand no access to Central Burma by sea, air\nsupply was the only way of getting in sufficient\nmaintenance for Fourteenth Army’s operations.\nThat is, when all.other means were being\nworked to absolute maximum capacity, there\nremained a large essential tonnage which could\nonly be brought in by air. Were this essen-\ntial tonnage reduced, I would be forced to cut\ndown my forces. The total tonnage which\ncould be lifted by air, however, depended not\nonly on the number of available transport air-\ncraft squadrons ‘but on the location of the trans-\nport airfields at economic ranges from the\ndelivery airfields. In the case of the C 46 and\nC 47 aircraft which were being used, this was\nabout 250 miles. It was not long therefore\nbefore the advance of the Army took it beyond\nthe economic range of the air bases mentioned\nabove. To move these bases forward on the\nAnmy’s L. of C. was impracticable owing to the\nundeveloped nature of the country and the\nlimitations of the L. of C. itself. The air bases\nnear Imphal were already uneconomical since\neverything for them had to be moved by road\nfrom the Manipur Road railhead to Imphal.\nThe desired result could, however, be achieved\n‘by opening new and improved air supply bases\non the coast, where the material of war could\nbe delivered by sea. This showed at once the\nvital importance to the maintenance of\nFourteenth Army of Akyab and Ramree Islands,\nwhere airfields could ibe constructed, and where\nthere were ports capable of development, even\nif limited. From these bases, aircraft could\n\n‘ate at economic range to Central Burma\nand the Irrawaddy and road {railway axes south\nto Rangoon, It was a question of capturing\nthe areas in time to allow their development\nand stocking before the monsoon.\n\n307. There was one other route into Burma,\nthe road from Ledo, via Myitkyina to join with\nthe Burma Road to China. This was under\nconstruction under American control (as has\nbeen said already). Northern Combat Area\nCommand in their operations down this road\naxis towards Lashio were almost entirely sup-\nplied by American air transport, operating from\nthe Chabua group of airfields north-west of\nLedo.\n\n» 308. Two factors should be considered when\nthe Ls. of C. are under examination. First,\nland Ls. of C. in an undeveloped country like\nBurma and with a determined enemy like the\nJapanese are liable to be cut by hostile action.\nOn the other hand, our complete air and sea\nsupremacy made transport iby these elements\nsecure.\n\nSecondly, I must again draw attention to the\nfactor of the weather, During the monsoon,\nsay 15th May to 15th November very roughly,\nwe had to expect all fair-weather routes to be\nout of action ; even all-weather roads were sub-\nject to wash-outs and damage. Although flying\nwas certain to be intermittent and hazardous,\nair supply became often the only practicable\nmeans, but it was entirely dependent on all-\nweather airfields. AI] administrative planning\nhad to include provision for the continuance\nof adequate maintenance under monsoon condi-\ntions. The absolute importance of completing\nthe construction of all-weather airfields for\nsupply aircraft before the monsoon was there-\nfore obvious.\n",

From the brief description of the Ls. of\nC. it is plain that the main problem through-\nout the period of this Despatch was the main-\ntenance of Fourteenth Army. The difficulty\nof this problem was not only qualitative but\nquantitative. Requirements of course varied\nwith the number of formations and nature of\noperations ; but, as an example, during April,\n1945, the daily maintenance tonnage required\nby Fourteenth Army, including R.A.F. and\nCivil Affairs (Burma) requirements, averaged\n2,090 tons (long) per day, while the equivalent\nrequirement by 15 Indian Corps was 84 tons\nper day. (The size of 15 Indian Corps at this\nperiod had been reduced to allow the maximum\ntonnage for Fourteenth Army.) Of these\namounts, the quantities delivered by air\naveraged, for Fourteenth Anmy 1,845 tons, and\nfor 15 Indian Corps 16 tons.\n\n310. To sum up, we were entering Burma\nby the back door, with wholly inadequate land\ncommunications. We were fighting an enemy\nwho had a first rate port behind him and good\ntail and road communications, since he was\noperating with his supply system on the same\nlines that Burma’s internal supplies were car-\nTied in normal times. We were enabled to con-\nquer him as a result of the tremendous effort\nthat was put into overcoming the administra-\ntive difficulties and in particular by supple-\nmenting the inadequate land Ls. of C. with an\nair L. of C., developed to an unprecedented\nextent. The details of this conquest of the\nadministrative problem set by the natural and\ngeographical peculiarities of the Theatre are\nthe main burden of this part of this Despatch.\n\nSECTION XX (paras, 311-334) THe DEvELopP-\nMENT OF THE NORTHERN LINE OF COM-\nMUNICATION\n\nFormation of L. of C, Command: Supply\n\nroutes to the Advanced bases: The Assam\nRailways: The problem of replacement\nvehicles: The development of the Chindwin\nI.W.T. link: Changes in the organization of\nthe L. of C.: Changes in the organization of\nSupply and Transport: Further changes in\nthe organization of the L. of C.: The develop-\nment of the Burma Railways: Petrol distribu-\ntion: Some statistics.\n311. I propose to deal with the development\nof the land Ls. of C. first, as a proper under-\nstanding of the difficulties and limitations of\nthese Ls. of C. is essential to any real compre-\nhension of the administrative aspect of the\ncompaign as a whole, including the air supply\naspect. I regard it as absolutely essential, too,\nthat it should be realised what a prodigious\neffort had to be put into the land Ls. of C.,\nas the spectacular results of air supply and\nthe successful capture of Rangoon, with the\nconsequent restoration of a more normal L. of\nC. tend to obscure the extent and duration of\nthis effort.\n\n812. The organization and development of\nthe Northern line will be described first. When\nI took over command in November 1944, orders\nhad already been issued for the formation of\nL. of C. Command, which actually took place\non the 15th-November. The two L. of €.\nAreas 202 and 404, were transferred from the\ncommand of Fourteenth Army to the new L.\nof C. Command, the Commander of which,\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nMajor-General G. W. Symes, was directly\nresponsible to me. Hitherto H.Q., Allied Land\nForces, South-East Asia (or H.Q., 11 Army\nGroup as it had been called before it became\nan Allied Command) had been represented by\nAdvanced Echelon North at Manipur Road\nand Advanced Echelon South at Comilla.\nThese Advanced Echelons were almost en-\ntirely concerned with movements and with the\nprocessing of stores, etc., along the complicated\nL. of C. To ensure continuity and relieve\nCommander, L. of C. Command of purely\nmovement problems these Advanced Echelons\nwere retained under the new organization.\nFourteenth Army was thus relieved of L. of C.\nresponsibilities and could concentrate on the\nmain offensive. The boundary between\nFourteenth Army and 15 Indian Corps and\nL. of C. Command very nearly coincided with\nthe political boundary between India and\nBurma with a deviation south-east of Chitta-\nong. The whole of L. of C. Command\nlay in India, 202 Area consisting of most of\nAssam, including Manipur State, while 404\nArea consisted of that part of Bengal lying\neast of the Meghna River, and a part of\nAssam lying to the south of Shillong.\n\n313. The system of maintenance at this time\non this L. of C. was that supplies were sent\nforward from the India Base by rail and Inland\nWater Transport to the Advanced Bases at\nGauhati on the Brahmaputra, and at Manipur\nRoad (Dimapur) in Assam. It can be seen\nthat this was not a simple, straight run-\nthrough. In India Command there was the\ntranshipment at the Ganges Ferry at Mokameh\nGhat and, for stores coming by rail from Cal-\ncutta, the change from broad to metre gauge\nrailway at Parbatipur. Further tranship-~\nments were necessary at the Brahmaputra\nferries at Dhubri Ghat, Amingaon or Tez-\npur or at the I.W.T. transhipment points\nat Pandu or Neamati. The distribution from\nthe Advanced Bases was affected by motor\ntransport (L. of C. Transport Column) to\nTiddim, and thence via Tamu to the Corps\nMaintenance Areas.\n\n314. The Assam Railway system worked\nwell on the whole, any occasional shortfall\non stores tonnage being quickly rectified by\nincreased despatches later. -Where target\nfigures were not reached, it was usually due\nto a temporary shortage of wagons or to the\nlack of stores ‘ready to load. Only one serious\naccident ocourred during the period of this\nDespatch, when a buckled rail caused a derail-\nment and the foss of 18 wagons by fire.\nThroughout the period there were extensions\nand improvements made to the transhipment,\nmarshalling, reception and departure yards.\nEngine shed accommodation and yard layouts\nwere improved and the ferry and personnel\nghat lines developed.\n\n315. When control of the L. of C. was taken\nover from Fourteenth Army by H.OQ., Allied\nLand Forces, South-East Asia in November\nthrough L. of C. Command, the responsibility\nfor and control of the movement of replacement\nvehicles forward of Calcutta also passed from\n#.Q., Fourteenth Army to my H.Q. This not\nonly freed Fourteenth Army from all responsi-\nbility in rear of the Army boundary, but,\nthrough the closer control which my H.Q.\ncould exercise, being on the spot, it resulted\n",

Delivery was, in theory, to be made to\nthe nearest depot in Fourteenth Army’s area,\nat this time at Imphal, but as the advance into\nBurma progressed, it was unfortunately often\nfound necessary for Fourteenth Army to send\nback part of the way, owing to shortage of\nivers.\n\n316. In December 1944, India Command\ncame to our rescue and accepted the responsi-\n’ bility for moving up replacement vehicles to\nManipur Road by the rail/road route, but,\nunfortunately, the supply of civilian drivers\n‘oved inadequate to meet increasing demands.\ncourse had to be made to pulling back\ndrivers from the L. of C. Transport Column,\nto using spare drivers of units going forward,\nand of combing our reinforcement camps for\ndrivers. By these expedients, the forward flow\nof replacement vehicles was maintained at a\nsufficiently high level to meet essential require-\nments. Thus, for example, in March 1945,\nover 7,000 vehicles, including trailers were sent\nforward, whereas, before December 1944, it\nhad never been found possible to exceed 2,000\nreplacement vehicles per month.\n\n317. It was during December 1944 that an\nimportant development of the Northern L. of\nC. started, namely the building of the Inland\nWater Transport base on the Chindwin near\nKalewa. As part of the policy of developing\nthe Northern L. of C. to its fullest extent, it\nwas obvious that we should have to make the\nmaximum use of the river waterways. At this\ntime it was not possible to estimate exactly\n\n_to what extent this I.W.T. link could be\ndeveloped, but as will be seen later it subse-\nquently became of the utmost importance.\n\n318. In January 1945, the success of opera-\ntion Capital—Fourteenth Army’s offensive\ninto Central Burma—necessitated the extension\nof administrative planning for the maintenance\nof the army south of Mandalay. It now became\nclear that we could not spare the resources for\nthe reconstruction of the road from the\nChindwin crossing at Kalewa, via Pyingaing to\nShwebo up to all-weather standard. At the\nsame time, the development of the River\nChindwin L. of C. showed great promise. It\nwas therefore decided to put the maximum\neffort into the LW.T. project and to abandon\nany idea of using the road between Kalewa and\nShwebo during the monsoon. In any case, it\nwould not be possible to maintain the Bailey\npontoon bridge across the Chindwin when it\nstarted to rise with the advent of the rains.\nThe Chindwin River had thus to be developed\nas fast as possible to bridge the gap between\nKalewa and the all-weather road system of\nCentral Burma: this link in the chain and the\nextent to which its capacity could be raised\ngoverned the overall capacity of the Northern\nL. of C, once the monsoon had started. As\nthe lower terminal of the I.W.T. link, and as\nthe Advanced Base for supplying the forces in\nCentral Burma, Myingyan was chosen, and\nplans for its development were prepared.\nMyingyan was on the existing all-weather road\nsystem of Central Burma and there was also\nthe possibility of being able to use stretches\nof the railway. It was well placed with regard\nto Meiktila, the road/railway axis to Rangoon\nand the Irrawaddy River axis to Prome and\nbeyond. ‘\n\n1935\n\n319. The development of the IW.T. pro-\nject deserves to be discussed in detail, since\nin many ways it is unique in the annals of war-\nfare. There were three main ways in which we\ncould build up the fleet ; from craft transported\nin sections from India, from craft built on the\nspot out of timber felled in the jungle, and by\nsalving and capturing boats already on the\nTiver. All these methods were used to\nthe fullest extent. During January, IW.T.\nOperating Companies, Craft Erection and\nWorkshop Companies, Salvage Companies, a\nHiggins Barge Erection Section and—somewhat\nto their surprise—a Railway Workshop Com-\npany were moved to Kalewa. It should be\nremembered that the whole project started right\nfrom nothing. The boat-building yards, jetties,\npiers and accommodation had first to be built\non an open sand bank. Timber was felled in\nthe jungle, hauled by elephants and shaped in\nimprovised sawmills, the work being carried\nout by an Artisan Works Company and a\nForestry Company R.E. Craft were despatched\nin sections from Calcutta by rail to Manipur\nRoad and thence carried by road 304 miles to\nKalewa, where they were reassembled. The\ncutting of a large boat into section for re-erec-\ntion elsewhere was no easy task technically, as\nanyone who saw the experiments carried out\nnear Calcutta will agree. The transport of these\nawkward loads over the already congested road\nL. of C. also presented many problems. About\n50 craft of all types were normally under con-\nstruction at the same time. Between January\nand April 1945 (inclusive), no less than 415\ntivercraft were built, comprising 11 different\ntypes, including barges, tugs, ramped cargo\nlighters, launches, etc., all of which were pre-\nfabricated types. The vessels constructed even\nincluded two gun boats for the Royal Navy,\narmed with Bofors and Oerlikon guns, which\nwere commissioned for operations on the\nChindwin. This must represent a high water-\nmark of inter-Service co-operation. Engines\nand other vital stores were at times brought in\nby air transport. Much improvisation was\nnecessary to maintain the rate of construc-\ntions, as, for example when fencing wire was\nused for welding electrodes.\n\n320. ‘Local construction was concentrated on\nthe building of blunt-ended pontoons,\nwhich, lashed in threes and decked over, made\na taft of 30 tons capacity. These rafts were\ntowed by the power pre-fabricated craft. By\nthe end of April, 541 pontoons had been built\nand put into service. In addition to these, 174\nex-enemy and other crafts of various types were\nsalvaged and powered with engines, largely\nflown in from India. When Mandalay was\ncaptured in March, the Government Dockyard\nwas found to contain a large quantity of dis-\nmantled machinery. The power plant, smithy\nand foundry were soon put into working order\nand assisted the Kalewa boat-building opera-\ntions. A measure of the size of the whole\nKalewa project is perhaps indicated by the fact\nthat over five million rivets were used.\n\n321. The target for the capacity of the I.W.T.\nlink between Kalewa and Myingyan was 700\ntons a day by the arrival of the monsoon.\nOperation started on a small ‘scale between\nKalewa and Alon (120 miles downstream) on\nthe -Ist February and by the énd of February\nthe capacity of this link rose to 255 tons per\n",

The full link to Myingyan stanted opera-\ntion on the 26th March, with an initial lift of\n200 tons per day, rising to 380 tons per day\nby the ist April. During April the capacity\nrose until by the end of the month 575 tons\nper day was reached. In four months 25,688\ntons of stores had been lifted from Kalewa to\nAlon and Myingyan, with a record day’s lift\nof 1,147 tons.\n\n322. In January, Railway Operating Con-\nstruction and Maintenance Companies were\nconcentrated at Manipur Road, awaiting call\nforward by Fourteenth Army, to start traffic on\nsuch stretches of the Burma Railways as proved\npossible. At the same time plans for getting\nin locomotives were made—a matter of some\ndifficulty, as the only methods available were\nroad and air transport. The problem was\nsolved with the aid of our American allies, as\nwill be described later. During this month, too,\nthe Movements and Transportation staff\nattached to Fourteenth Army became part of\nthe new provisional Movements and Transpor-\ntation, Burma, organization, while its com-\nposition remained much the same.\n\n323. At the end of January I sent a signal to\nthe War Office, H.Q., Supreme Allied Com-\nmander, South-East Asia and the Commander-\nin-Chief, India, giving my views on the future\norganization of my lines of communication.\nThese proposals were, of course, modified as\nthe situation developed. The basis of my pro-\nposals was the progressive establishment of\ndistricts, each coming direct under my com-\nmand, as L. of C. Command would not be\nable to exercise effective control as the lines of\ncommunication extended. Coincident with the\nformation of the districts would be the handing\nback of territory to G.H.Q., India. I saw the\ndevelopment in seven main phases. Phase J\nwas the establishment of 505 District for the\nadministration of North Burma, and part of\nCentral Burma. Phase II would consist of the\nhanding back to G.H.Q., India, of the whole of\n202 Area, except for some territory round\nImphal which would pass to 505 District, and\npart of 404 Area including Silchar. Geographi-\ncally this roughly amounted to handing back\nthe Province of Assam with Shillong. Phase\nUI, which was to be simultaneous with Phase\nIE, consisted of the raising of 404 Area to Dis-\ntrict status. The importance of the Southern\nL. of C. had greatly increased, as will be seen\nlater, with the development of the Akyab and\nKyaukpyu air supply bases. Phase IV would\nconsist of the abolition of L. of C. Command as\nsuch and Phase V of the abolition of Advanced\nEchelons North and South, with consequent\nsaving in staff. Phase VI consisted of the estab-\nlishment of 606 District in South Burma in due\ncourse, and Phase VII of the eventual handing\nover of 505 and 606 Districts to the H.Q.\nappointed for Burma when operations there\nconcluded.\n\n324. During January certain changes in\norganization of the Supply and Trarsport\nsystem took place, whereby a basic allotment\nof Supply and Transport units to formations\nwas fixed. By this time we were suffering from\na severe manpower shortage in R.A.S.C. and\nR.LA.S.C. personnel. I obtained War Office\napproval, however, for the disbanding of two\nAnti-Aircraft regiments and so was able to\ntransfer some 400 gunners to the R.AS.C.,\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nconverting them to form supply and petrol\nplatoons.\n\nA serious shortage nevertheless still re-\nmained, and in February India Command\nagreed to the dilution of static supply units in\ntear areas with civilians, thereby releasing\nsoldiers to ‘reinforce forward supply units.\nThis scheme was extended later to include all\nsupply units, and a considerable number of\neducated Burmese civilians in the liberated\nareas volunteered. for such employment. In\naddition, several entirely Burmese small sup-\nply units were formed, which proved particu-\nlarly useful as Local Purchase sections. The\nmen in these units were enrolled in the Burma\nArmy Service Corps.\n\n325. A change took place during February\nin the system of working the L. of C. Transport\nColumn. This organization has already been\nreferred to on more than one occasion. Some\nindication of its size is given by the fact that\nduring the previous month (January) it oper-\nated some thirty General Transport .companies\non the 320 mile stretch of road between Dima-\npur and Kalewa. Up till February, the L. of C.\nTransport Column had worked on the\n“Round the Clock” system. In order to pro-\nvide sufficient drivers for day and night run-\nning, it was necessary to reduce the number\nof load vehicles operated by the companies.\nThis, together with certain other disadvantages,\nresulted in the tonnage lifted being less than\nthe maximum which could be achieved. The\nrapid advance of Fourteenth Army, the\nlengthening of the road L. of C., the increased\nallotment of vehicles, and the desirability of\nhaving a more flexible organization, rendered”\nit necessary to introduce a new system of\nworking.\n\n326. Under this new system, all General\nTransport companies operated their full scale\nof vehicles, that is 120 instead of 99 under the\n“Round the Clock” system, and they were\nnot divorced from their own workshop sec-\ntions. A Commander, R.A.S.C./R.LA.S.C.\nTransport Column was provided at a scale of\none for every six companies, thereby relieving\nthe H.Q., L. of C. Transport Column of duties\nwhich had hitherto made it top-heavy. Finally,\nthe companies, as far as possible, worked\nthrough the daylight hours only, the loading\nand unloading at depots being done at night.\nThis system proved a success: the average time\nof “tum-rounds” remained unaffected, but\nthe tonnage lifted increased and vehicle main-\ntenance improved. The “turn-rounds” for\nthe vehicles of the L. of C. Transport Column\nfor the various sections of the road were as\nfollows :—\n\nManipur Road—Imphal/Palel, two days.\nImphal /Palel—Moreh, two days.\nMoreh—Indainggyi, two days.\nIndainggyi—Kalewa, one day.\nKalewa—Shwebo, three days.\nShwebo—Monywa, two days.\n\n327. While on the subject of road transport,\nI would like to add a few remarks on the work\nof the R.E.MLE. and LE.MLE. Services. Most\nof the road from Imphal to Kalewa especially\nthe mountain stretches, was very bad and\nvehicles, especially the larger 5 and 10 tonners\ninevitably sustained considerable damage.\nThis was in spite of the careful driving of\ntheir Indian drivers, to which General Symes,\n",

Command, has paid special\ntribute, as did United States officers who\nvisited this L. of C. Considerable economy in\nrecovery facilities was achieved in January,\n1945, by locating a single recovery organization\nwith the H.Q., L. of C. Transport Column, and\nmaking it responsible for the whole stretch of\nroad. Other special measures included the\nequipping of each Recovery Company with\ntwelve extra jeeps, which formed “Spanner\nPatrols.” These “Spanner Patrols,” which\nhad by this time become a standard E.M.E.\nservice with Fourteenth Army, had their\norigin in the earlier advances by 5 Indian and\n11 (ast African) Divisions. The condition of\nthe roads would not permit the sending out of\nrecovery vehicles as rearwards movement was\nonly possible at certain times. In addition\ndivisional and corps workshops had to be left\nbehind. Fitters in the “Spanner Patrols”\nwent up and down the roads in jeeps, doing’\nwhat repairs they could, while vehicles needing\nworkshop attention were put into parks for\nlater repair. A lesson that was learnt was that\nsuch parks required careful guarding, if the\nvehicles in them were not to become unser-\nviceable by the theft of vital parts and equip-\nment.\n\n328. Mandalay was captured in March and\nthe implementation of my plans for the re-\norganization of the L. of C. became necessary.\nThe raising of the new District to take over in\nrear of Fourteenth Army was comparatively\nsimple and was brought about by the end of\nthe month. The return of 202 Area to India,\nwhich was also part of my plan, was a much\nmore complicated business, especially as it\ninvolved consideration of the question whether\n404 Area should not also be handed over. It\nwas not until May, 1945, after prolonged\ndiscussion with G.H.Q., India, at which the\nSupreme Allied Commander, the A.O.C.-in-C.,\nSouth-East Asia, and the G.O.C.-in-C., Eastern\nCommand, India, were represented, that it was\ndecided that 202 Area would be transferred to\ncontrol of India Command, while I retained\n404 Area, but raised to District status. I may\nadd here that the actual handover did not take\nplace until the 1st June, 1945, on which date\nalso H.Q. L. of C. Command was disbanded,\nand 404 Area came under my direct control.\nThe overall administrative organization of\nBurma was considered at the same time and\nmy proposal to form 606 District for South\nBurma out of the H.Q. L. of C. Command,\nwhich became redundant, was agreed. Thus\nafter the fall of Rangoon, I should have three\nDistricts, 404 controlling Chittagong and\nArakan, 505 controlling Northern and Central\nBurma including Mandalay, and 606 control-\nling Southern Burma, including eventually\nTenasserim,\n\n329. Certain changes in organization had\ntaken place on the Movements and Transporta-\ntion side of the Northern L. of C. A new L. of\nC. Movement Control Group, No. 8, which had\nmoved up in February, on the 15th March took\nover from the Movements and Transportation\nstaff of L. of C. Command, which was moved\nto Arakan. This Group came under the direct\ncontrol of my H.Q., which had also taken over\nthe Movement Control Area (L. of C.),\nManipur Road from L. of C. Command at the\nbeginning of the month.\n\n“1937\n\n330. The final development of the Northern\nL. of C. was the rehabilitation of stretches of\nthe Burma Railways. The line from Shwebo\nto Sagaing was found to have been damaged\nbeyond repair, except as a long-term project.\n\nThe line from Myingyan to Meiktila was,\nhowever, capable of development. I have\nalready said that it was thanks to our American\nallies that the locomotives were brought in.\nHow this was done deserves description in\ngreater detail. Six five-ton petrol-driven loco-\nmotives were flown in sections to Myingyan and\nthere reassembled. General Stratemeyer pro-\nvided a Liberator from his own H.Q. for this\nspecial task. For use on the line north and\nsouth through Meiktila, three giant MacArthur\nlocomotives, each weighing over 70 tons, were\nloaded on special trailers (converted Macks)\nand brought in by road to Kalewa, and on to\nMyingyan, which involved ferrying over both\nthe Chindwin and the Irrawaddy. A senior\ntechnical officer of the U.S. Army supervised\nthis often hazardous journey, where these mon-\nstrous vehicles at times had to negotiate hair-\npin bends overlooking deep precipices. Six\nsteam locomotives and tenders, each locomotive\nweighing some 21 tons, were carried complete\non transporters to Kalewa and thence loaded\non to ramped cargo lighters and carried down\nriver to Myingyan. In addition, 2,540 tons of\nheavy railway stores and material were brought\nin by road, LW.T. and air.\n\nThe above, together with a few recaptured\nand reconditioned locomotives and rolling stock\nof the Burma Railways enabled us to reopen\nrail communication from Mandalay and\nMyingyan with a very limited though valuable\ncapacity, and to begin the work of railway re-\nhabilitation from Central Burma southwards\nagainst the day when we could also work north-\nwards from Rangoon. On the 23rd April, the\nline from Myingyan to Meiktila was opened\nwith jeep trains giving a lift of 150 tons a day,\nof which 70 tons a day could be taken forward\nas far as Pyawbwe.\n\n331. When we captured Mandalay, a com-\nplete Japanese Base Workshop was found in\nthe town almost intact. This was a great\nasset, as it saved bringing forward heavy\nequipment. It is interesting to note that—\ncontrary to the generally held belief—the\nJapanese machinery in this Base Workshop in-\ncluded good quality high precision machine.\ntools. The same applied to the mobile work-\nshops that we captured, and their machinery\nlorries were equal to ours.\n\n332. One further aspect of the Northern\nL. of C. deserves consideration, namely, petrol\ndistribution. In a country with poor and,\nowing to the monsoon season, precarious com-\nmunications, the advantages of distributing\npetrol by pipeline are especially obvious. It\nwas agreed in Decentber, 1944, that the control\nof both the six-inch American pipeline from\nChittagong to Tinsukia in North-East Assam,\nand the British four-inch pipeline to Manipur\nRoad, which ran parallel to it, should be\nvested in the American Chief Engineer, who\ncontrolled all the American pipelines in Bengal\nand Assam. The allocation of products to\nBritish and U.S. consumers was to be made by\nFLO. Supreme Allied Command, South-East\nAsia. About the same time a joint Allied Land\nForces, South-East Asia, and India Command\nCommittee decided that in future the grades\n",

This reduction in the number of\ngrades reduced our storage problems and those\nin India.\n\nOn the 9th February, the hitherto uncom-\npleted section of the British four-inch pipeline\nbetween Chittagong and Chandranathpur\nbegan pumping, thus giving a continuous flow\nto Manipur Road. This pipeline was by the\n2nd March extended to Imphal, and storage\ntanks to deal with a flow of three and a half\nmillion gallons per month had been constructed\nthere. The opening of this pipeline eased the\nstrain on the road transport a great deal, as\nhitherfo all the petrol for Imphal, including\nvery large Air Force requirements, had had to\nbe brought from Manipur Road by motor\ntransport. Later this pipeline was extended\nbeyond Imphal to Moreh, thus bridging an\nexceptionally bad sector of hill road from\nPalel. The supply onward was by road tanker\nto Kalewa, by I.W.T. from Kalewa to\nMyingyan and from Myingyan forward by\nroad and rail.\n\n333. Finally, a few more general observa-\ntions on this exceptional road L. of C. are\ncalied for. With a single road of limited\ncapacity, there comes a time when, if its length\nis extended sufficiently, no matter how much\nis put in the rear end, practically nothing comes\nout at the forward end. On the Northern L.\nof C. we had nearly reached this stage, despite\nthe tremendous effort that had been put into\nits development and operation. The magni-\ntude of the road transport can be gauged by\nthe following figures. Between November,\n1944, and April, 1945, the quantity of stores\nsent forward, excluding petrol, oil and lubri-\ncants, varied between 31,000 and 45,000 tons\nper month, while petrol, etc., came to between\n16,000 and 27,000 tons per month. The per-\nsonnel lift forward varied from 25,000 to\n50,000 men per month.\n\nThe L. of C. Transport Column had a daily\naverage of 8,830 tons on wheels in March, and\n9,932 tons in April; during the latter month a\ntotal lift forward of 91,378} tons was achieved\nbetween Manipur Road and Shwebo.\n\n334. For comparison with these figures, it\nis interesting to analyse the actual require-\nments of Fourteenth Army and how they\nreached it. I have already said that in April\nFourteenth Army’s average daily require-\nments were 2,090 tons. These were made up\nas follows: —\n\nTons\n\nSupplies ... we 445\n\nPetrol, oil, lubricant 406\n\n -» Ammunition 175\n\nOrdnance stores .. 110\n\nEngineer requirements - 148\nConstruction and Transporta-\n\ntion projects ... oe we 225\n\nR.AF. requirements ... ww 196\n\nCivil Affairs (Burma) ... wee 5\n\nStocking, maintenance of Sub-\nareas, Reserve Divisions, etc. 365\n\n2,090\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nDuring April, a daily average of 1,845 tons\nwas delivered by air, while the balance came\nby road and I.W.T. to Myingyan. This, more\nthan anything else, shows the total inadequacy\nof the Northern L. of C. Owing to the inability\nof the Chiefs of Staff to meet our constantly\nincreasing demands for additional transport\naircraft, we were compelled to develop this\nwasteful route to the utmost, despite the gross\ndisproportion between the effort expended and\nthe results which it was possible to achieve. It\nshould dispel any idea that the fullest attempts\nto send up supplies by ground L. of C. were\nnot made before we made our urgent appeals\nfor more transport aircraft to be sent to the\ntheatre.\n\nSECTION XXIJ (paras. 335-350) THe DeveELop-\nMENT OF THE SOUTHERN LINE OF COMMUNI-\nCATION\n\nDevelopment of Chittagong and the smaller\nArakan ports: I.W.T. projects: Development\nof Akyab and Kyaukpyu: The final stages in\nArakan.\n\n335. The development of the Southern L. of\nC. was on different lines. I have touched on\nthe main characteristics of this L. of C. in para-\ngraph 305. Initial maintenance was by sea\nfrom the main base ports in India to the\nAdvanced Base at Chittagong, and by rail to\nChittagong from the Advanced Base at\nMymensingh (north-east of Calcutta). As in\nthe case of the Northern L. of C., rail tranship-\nments were necessary, at Santahar owing to\nchange of gauge, at the ferry at Tistamukh\nand into Inland Water Transport at Goalundo\nand Sirajganj. Distribution from the Advanced\nBases was by sea to Cox’s Bazaar and Maung-\ndaw, by motor transport to Bawli Bazaar, by\nI.W.T. and animal transport to Taung Bazaar,\nand by air from various airfields, as will be\ndescribed in the next section. Shipments were\nalso made direct from India to Cox’s Bazaar\nand Maungdaw, but it must be borne in mind\nthat these were only small river ports, used\nin normal times for local coastal traffic.\n\n336. Chittagong itself is a port of very\nlimited facilities. Some construction was\nundertaken, notably a 700 foot timber jetty\nand a screw pile petrol and oil jetty. The\nport lighting was greatly improved and the\nwater supply scheme completed in December,\n1944. Chittagong and the area round about\nwas important, however, for an additional\nreason. It will be remembered from Part I\nof this Despatch that the original operation\nDracula—the large-scale combined airborne\nand seaborne invasion of Rangoon—was in\nNovember, 1944 postponed by the Chiefs of\nStaff but not actually cancelled. The area round\nChittagong was the mounting base for the air-\nborne part of this operation and I was ordered\nto proceed on the assumption that the post-\nponed operation would be launched immedi-\nately after the 1945 monsoon. This meant that\nconstruction had to be virtually complete be-\nfore the 1945 monsoon, that is by about May,\n1945. The planning and construction of this\nmounting base, involving, as it did, fair-weather\nairfields, petrol pipelines, bulk tankage, camps,\n\nhospitals and water supply, required consider-\n",

Not only were nearly\nall the branches of the Army administrative\nservices affected but also the R.A.F. to a very\nlarge extent. Unfortunately the work done on\nthis base was of little or no use for my current\noperations or their development ; on the con-\ntrary, it involved a diversion of constructional\neffort that I could very ill afford to spare.\n\n337. I have mentioned above the employ-\nment of the smaller Arakan ports such as\nCox’s Bazaar and Maungdaw. As might be\nexpected, these came into their maximum use\nin December when 15 Indian Corps’ offensive\nwas launched. Two jetties had been completed\nat Cox’s Bazaar during the previous month and\nthe remaining two at this period. During\nDecember, imports at Cox’s Bazaar, including\nUltakhali, amounted to 30,000 tons and at\nMaungdaw to 20,000 tons. After the capture\nand development of Akyab and Kyaukpyu in\nJanuary, the traffic at these ports declined.\nMaungdaw was closed on the 31st March while\nCox’s Bazaar continued to operate on a re-\nduced scale ; the jetties at Ultakhali were des-\ntroyed by fire in April.\n\n338. The early stages of 15 Indian Corps’\nOffensive saw two interesting and important\ndevelopments in maintenance by I.W.T., which\nhave already been mentioned in Part I. The\nMost spectacular feat was the transportation\nover the Maungdaw—Buthidaung hill road of\nthe 650 craft required for the maintenance of\n53 Brigade (25 Indian Division) in its advance\ndown the Kalapanzin Valley. The most care-\nful calculation and loading were required to\nenable the vehicles carrying these boats, which\nwere of varied types, to negotiate not only\nthe difficult mountain road but particularly the\ntunnels which were low, narrow and winding.\nThe reassembling and launching of this fleet, at\nButhidaung, was completed in the remarkably\nshort space of five days; but this did not end\nthe difficulties. The intricacies of navigation\ndown the Kalapanzin, which in its lower\nreaches is really an arm of the sea, remained.\nThe manner in which these navigational diffi-\nculties were overcome by the Inland Water\nTransport service and infantry, with the aid of\nthe Royal Navy, deserves the highest praise.\n\nMeanwhile, further east on the Kaladan\nRiver, 81 (West African) Division, which was\non air supply, had developed flotillas of local\ncraft for the local movement of supplies. These\nthey operated themselves.\n\n339. It will be remembered from Part I that\nthe original operation planned for the capture\nof Akyab was to have been mounted from\nChittagong. Owing, however, to the limited\ncapacity of the port, maintenance had to be\narranged direct from depots in India, and\ndespatched from Calcutta. This resulted in\nloss of flexibility, so that when Akyab was\ncaptured by a river-crossing operation on the\n3rd January, it was found that the shipping\nfrom Calcutta could not be made to arrive\nbefore the 20th January; even then it was\nloaded with stores, etc., planned for the original\nFebruary assault. The landing on the Myebon\nPeninsula, which took place only nine days\nafter the capture of Akyab, was mounted and\nmaintained from that port. The export com-\nmitment inevitably delayed the stores build-up\nin the island, and, for a time, our resources\n\n1939\n\nthere were slender. Energetic action, however,\novercame the emergency and the development\nof Akyab as an Advanced Base began; the\nbuild-up and maintenance being effected by sea\nfrom India.\n\nThe next major operation was the landing at\nKyaukpyu on Ramree Island, which was\nmounted from Chittagong. The reasons for the\nair supply bases here and on Akyab Island\nhave been dealt with in Part I. The develop-\nment of the airfields and the air supply aspect\nwill be dealt with in the next section. The port\nand Advanced Base development, however,\nwas an essential part of the development of\nthe Southern L. of C. This development began\ndirectly Akyab and Kyaukpyu were captured.\nTo achieve the results required as quickly as\npossible, a Sub-Area was established early in\nFebruary in each place to develop the advanced\nbase, and over 20,000 construction and\nadministrative troops were allotted to each\nSub-Area.\n\n340. Despite the fact that shipments were\nmade direct from India to both Akyab and\nKyaukpyu, their intensive development placed\na very much heavier load on Chittagong.\nImports of stores rose from 23,000 tons in\nJanuary, 1945,‘to 60,000 in April, while bulk\npetrol imports increased from 38,000 tons\nduring November, 1944, to 82,000 in April,\n1945. Exports were contingent on forward re-\nquirements and were not limited by port\ncapacity. Port working was satisfactory\nthroughout the period. Further development\nof the Eastern Bengal Railway system was pro-\nceeding ; important improvements being made\nto the railhead facilities and to the water\nsupply scheme for railway operation, as well as\nextension of marshalling yards and loops, and\nthe development of stations and sidings. In\nmid-March, my Headquarters assumed direct\nresponsibility for the Chittagong area and\nports, which had hitherto been under Head-\nquarters L. of C. Command.\n\n341. The only aspect which gave a certain\namount of anxiety was in connection with rail-\nway traffic. Serious congestion began to arise\nat Chittagong in mid-February due to un-\nbalanced arrivals by both sea and rail. This\ncondition was made worse later in the month\nby the arrival of large quantities of Bailey\nbridging. In March an embargo had to be\nplaced on all traffic ex India to Chittagong,\nuntil the position could be restored by relating\nand phasing despatches more closely to the\nreleasing capacities of the depots. This was\ndone during the latter half of March by im-\nproving railway working in the Chittagong\ndistrict, and by the provision of more load-\ncarrying motor transport in the depot area.\nUnfortunately congestion again occurred early\nin April, and forwardings, except in the case of\npriority items, had again to be restricted. A\nstrong contributory factor which led to this\nstate of affairs was the necessity, owing to the\nbreak-up of the airfield, for moving 42,000 tons\nof airfield construction stores from Chittagong\nto Pathangar, halfway between Chittagong and\nComilla, in addition to the large normal\nsupply traffic. weet\n\n342. An interesting side-light on the Ramree\noperation deserves mention. It will be re-\nmembered that 26 Indian Division was\n",

The speed of 15 Indian Corps’\ncampaign necessitated their early return to\nBurma. Ships fitted out at Calcutta were\nTushed to Vizagapatam where the Brigade and\nBeach Group were embarked, and then sailed\nto Chittagong where they arrived on the 4th\nJanuary. In spite of bad weather, vehicles\nwere discharged, waterproofed and re-\nembarked, and the force mounted by the 8th\nJanuary, when the convoy. sailed on to stage\nat Akyab. This convoy was followed: shortly\nafterwards by the remaining Ramree assault\nconvoys, which sailed on the 17th, 18th and\n19th January.\n\n343. Due to the combined results of our own\nbombing, the Japanese denial measures and\ngeneral neglect during the occupation, the port,\nand accommodation facilities at Akyab and\nKyaukpyu were found to be almost negligible.\nAt Akyab the main stone jetties and\napproaches required extensive repairs, and the\nremoval of two ships sunk alongside was\nnecessary. In addition considerable new con-\nstruction was required. Development began\non the 15th January. By the 12th February,\nseven pontoon jetties had been built, and a\nfortnight later the stone jetty had been suffi-\nciently repaired to be used for personnel. A\nnew solid timber piled wharf 600 feet long\nand twelve feet wide was built in a space\nof six weeks, and by the end of April, not\nonly had a wreck at the main jetty been\nremoved ‘but the jetty itself had been com-\npletely repaired, all the stone for which had had\nto be imported. For all this work, only one\nPort Construction Company was employed,\nwhich carried out its task more efficiently, des-\npite shortages of material. The target set for\nthe development was 1,200 tons daily before the\nmonsoon and 800 tons daily during it. By\nthe beginning of April, the target had been\nexceeded and on the 3rd April a record dis-\ncharge of 2,406 tons was achieved. The initial\nworking of the port in the early stages was by\n41 Beach Group ut the responsibility was\nhanded over early in February to a Port Com-\nmandant.\n\n344. At Kyaukpyu there were no existing\nfacilities at all. Development as a beach port\nbegan on the 2ist February. Despite the fact\nthat only one Port Construction Company was\navailable, and that it had to do most of the\nsorting of stores besides its proper work, (by the\nend of April five pontoon jetties with Bailey\nBridge approaches had been built, a timber\npier 130 feet long with a 122 foot pontoon head\nhad been completed, and a start made on a\ntrestle jetty. As in the case of Akyab, the\ninitial working of the port had been by 41\nBeach Group who soon handed over to the\nPort Commandant. The target port capacity\nwas the same as for Akyab, but with very\nincomplete facilities. This target was early\nexceeded, a record discharge of 1,767 tons\nbeing achieved on the 17th March.\n\n345. The development of Kyaukpyu port and\nthe Ramree Advanced Base was complicated\n\nby the fact that in March it became necessary\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nto switch the maintenance of 15 Indian Corps”\nmainland operations to them. As the de-\nvelopment of the Base was then in its early\nstages, the requirements of 15 Indian Corps\ncould not be met in full without prejudicing\nits completion. Priority was given to the\ndevelopment of the Base, as this was now\nessential to ensure the readiness of the airfields\nfor the supply of Fourteenth Anmy as it\nadvanced southwards towards Rangoon, and\nthe 15 Indian Corps Commander’s plan for\ndestroying the enemy had to be modified con-\nsiderably. I have already referred to the\nnecessity for taking 15 Indian Corps off air\nsupply at this time, since all transport aircraft\nwere required for the maintenance of Four-\nteenth Army.\n\n346. Bulk petrol tankage projects were\nplanned for both Akyab and Kyaukpyu, with\na target completion date of the Ist May. In\nthe case of Akyab, however, this was acceler-\nated to the 15th April; and the’ first tanker\ndischarged on the 21st, just in time for the\nintensive air supply effort to support Four-\nteenth Army in the last critical stage of their\nadvance. Nevertheless, the situation gave cause\nfor anxiety. Squadrons were greatly exceeding\nthe rates of maximum effort, which resulted in\nabnormal consumption of petrol, oil and lubri-\ncants. Although the actual consumption was\nfar in excess of estimate, our petrol stocks just\nheld out. Aero engine lubricants were flown\nin from Chittagong and even from Western\nBengal, and the emergency was met.\n\n347. In the meantime the various landing\noperations on the Arakan coast had taken place.\nThe operations at Kangaw, the success of which\nwill be remembered from Part I, were main-\ntained by Naval landing craft and I.W.T. from\nthe Base Maintenance Area which had been\nestablished at Myebon. The operations against\nRu-Ywa were mounted and maintained from\nMyebon and Kangaw. The Tamandu opera-\ntions were maintained from Akyab, and the\nLetpan landing by Naval landing craft and\nLW.T. from Ramree.\n\n348. The last important event on the\nSouthern L. of C. was the mounting of the\nmodified Dracula operation from Ramree in\nApril. This was done under supervision of\n453 Sub-Area. With the very limited port\nfacilities available, this task caused consider-\nable interference with the build-up of the\nAdvanced Base, but as progress was well ad-\nvanced iby this date, the repercussions were\nnot serious. To start with, the only available\nfacilities at Kyaukpyu were a small beach and\na ricketty jetty. IW.T. creek steamers were\nused for the embarkation of personnel while\n“Z” craft and ramped cargo lighters were\nemployed for loading vehicles and stores. The\nweather fortunately remained calm and the\nmounting was carried out in accordance with\nthe programme in spite of a number of last\nminute changes due to the rapidity with which\nthe whole plan had been prepared.\n\n349. In spite of the meagre facilities avail-\nable, and the additional strain put on the port\nby the mounting of Dracula, the discharge of\nmaintenance cargo ships was maintained at a\nmost satisfactory rate.

Finally, to put the scale of the develop-\n‘ments described above into their proper pro-\nportion, I will quote yet a few more figures. It\nwill be remembered that in April the average\ndaily tonnage requirements of Fourteenth Army\nwas 2,090 tons of which an average of 1,845\nwas delivered by air transport. The require-\nments of 15 Indian Corps were only 84 tons\n‘per day, made wp as follows :—\n\nSupplies... a .. 16 tons\nPetrol, oi] and lubricants ... 16 tons\nAmmunition 8 tons\nOrdnance 4 tons\nEngineers 16 tons\nRAF. 8 tons\nStocking, etc. 16 tons\n\n84 tons\n\nUntil I was finally compelled to take away\nall air supply from 15 Indian Corps, 16 tons\ndaily was delivered by air and the rest by\nsea to Akyab and Kyaukpyu.\n\nFrom these figures it can clearly be seen that\nthe tremendous development of the Southern\nL. of C. was almost entirely for Fourteenth\nArmy. The reason for and value of 15 Indian\nCorps’ operations, which made this develop-\nment possible, and thus their contribution to\nthe reconquest of Burma is clear to see.\n\n1941\n\nSECTION XXII (paras. 351-365) THe DEVELOP-\nMENT OF THE AIR LINES OF COMMUNICATION\n\nThe air supply situation in November, 1944:\nThe organization of F.AM.Os. and\nR.A.M.Os.: Opening of Chittagong air base:\nFormation and organization of C.A.A.T.O.:\nThe switch to Akyab and Ramree Advanced\nBases: The air supply situation in April, 1945:\nAirfield construction: Casualty evacuation:\nSituation after the capture of Rangoon.\n\n351. The total inadequacy of the overland\nNorthern L. of C., in spite of the enormous\neffort which was put into its improvement,\nresulted in the development to an unprecedented\nextent of the only practicable alternative,\nsupply by air, which became the main channel\nfor the supply and maintenance of the fighting\nforces in the field. The results achieved in the\nfinal stages of the campaign, during the rapid\nadvance to Rangoon exceeded in scale any-\nthing done in any other theatre of operations\nor indeed in the history of warfare. While\nTecognising that this system of the supply of an\narmy in the field, and the organization required\nfor it, are still in their infancy, and that much\nhas still to be learned, it is clearly of the\ngreatest value to give the closest examination\nto this, its first really large-scale and con-\ntinuous practical employment.\n\n352. It will be remembered from Part I that\nthe original plans for Capital—the invasion of\nCentral Burma by Fourteenth Army—-were\nbased on using air supply on a very large scale.\nIn November, 1944, when I took over com-\nmand, the average daily supply lift by air was\n247 tons. The way in which this was handled\nis best shown in tabular form, giving the loca-\ntions of the air supply bases and the proportion\nof the lift handled at each base.\n\nRear Airfield\n\nMaintenance Remarks\nOrganizations\n(R.A.M.Os.)\n\n2 Combat Cargo Sqn.\n\nUS.A.A.F. moved\nfrom Sylhet to\nImphal on the 21st\nNovember, 1944.\n\nArrived November,\nbut did not operate\nuntil December.\n\n4 USAAF,\n\n31 RAF, on No. 3 129\n62 R.A.F.

A word on the R.A.M.Os. is perhaps\nnecessary. These were Rear Airfield Main-\ntenance Organizations which operated on the\ndespatching airfields.

I would\nlike to emphasise the necessity for having\ntrained units such as these for dealing with\nstores when air supply is operated on a large\nscale. The proper packing, etc., of supplies\nand stores, always against time, is a job for\nexperts.\n\nNormal supplies for the force dependent, in-\nincluding petrol, supplies and ammunition, were\nheld at each R.A.M.O. Specialised items,\nengineer stores, ordnance and medical stores\nhad to be held where accessibility to the main\ndepots was best. This had a limiting effect\non complete flexibility, but was the only prac-\nticable compromise between splitting stocks and\nthe complete use of air flexibility.\n\n354, The corresponding organization at the\nreceiving airfield was the Forward Airfield\nMaintenance Organization (F.A.M.O.). In this\nconnection I may remark that air landing was\nalways established as soon as possible, as\ndropping results in a wastage of about 25%\nof the lift, and in addition many heavy stores,\nsuch as Bailey bridging, cannot be dropped at\nall. The organization at the forward landing\ngrounds is most important. Speed is always\nessential first in completion of the forward air-\nstrip itself and then in the quick unloading\nof aircraft. In the case of the C. 46 and C. 47\naircraft in use in Burma, fifteen minutes was\nthe target unloading time for each aircraft.\nConsiderable endurance and efficiency was\nrequired to achieve this target, as many loads\nwere both awkward and heavy. As the com-\nmodities were unloaded, they were taken by\nlorry to the nearby depots, from which bulk\nissue was made to formations, except in the\ncase of troops in the vicinity, who received their\nsupplies from a Detail Issue Depot. Both\nF.A.M.Os. and R.A.M.Os. made _ heavy\ndemands on labour, and Pioneer companies\nformed a vital part of the whole air supply\nsystem.\n\n355. The use of air supply had the subsidiary\nbut very beneficial result that it was possible\nto send fresh supplies to the forward troops, a\nvaluable contributing factor to the maintenance\nof health and morale. As much as 50 tons per\nday of vegetables, fruit and eggs were sent for-\nward in this way. Later, when the cultivated\nareas of Central Burma were reached, it was\npossible to make use of local resources and the\navailability here and in the Shan States was\nexploited to the full. In the case of Arakan,\nit was, of course, possible to send fresh supplies\nup by coaster.\n\n356. I do not intend here to recapitulate the\nstory of the loss of transport aircraft to China\nand the problems of the lengthening L. of C. It\nis enough to remember that the available lift\nwas never as much as we wanted and that often\nit was sufficiently low as to constitute a major\nadministrative crisis. Moreover, we could not\nplan with certainty on those we had, since\nthe possibility of further withdrawals existed\nand had to be guarded against. Efforts, there-\nfore, to increase the efficiency of the air supply\nsystem wefe continuous. But J would like to\nsay at the outset that, in spite of these efforts,\nadequate’ supplies could not have been brought\nforward but for the courage and skill of the\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nRAF., R.CA.F. and U.S.A.A.F. squadrons,\nwhich often substantially exceeded the approved\nmaximum sustained rates of flying effort, in\nspite of very hazardous routes over high moun-\ntains in often terrible weather.\n\n357. The first major development during the\nperiod under report was the switch of an air\nsupply base from Agartala to Chittagong on\nthe 27th January, 1945, when No. 3 R.A.M.O.\nwas moved across and reopened as No. 7. This\nwas the first step in bringing the air bases\nforward to keep up with the advance of\nFourteenth Army. Chittagong airfield had\noriginally been designed for the operation of\n‘light bombers, and considerable engineering\neffort was required to adapt the installation to\ntake continuous traffic imposing much heavier\nloads. Nevertheless C. 46 aircraft started to\noperate on this route on the 2nd February.\nNo. 7 R.A.M.O., incidentally had no Air Des-\npatch Company allotted to it but, using pioneer\nlabour only, achieved the very fine average of\nover 700 tons per day in April.\n\n358. In February there occurred an expan-\nsion of the Army Air Transport Organization,\nwhich had existed since October, 1944. The\nexisting system of air supply had clearly been\nstretched to the utmost, and would not bear\nthe strain of future operations unless expanded.\nAs a result of investigations, I decided to\nappoint a Commander, Combined Army Air\nTransport Organization (C.A.A.T.O.), respon-\nsible for the co-ordination and executive con-\ntrol of the entire Army aspect of air transport,\nand under the direct control of my -Head-\nquarters. Brigadier J. A. Dawson was\nappointed to this important command. In\nmore detail, his responsibilities included the\ncommand and control of the existing R.A.M.Os.\nthe co-ordination of demands from formations\nfor the transport by air of personnel, supplies\nand equipment, and for the allocation of these\ndemands to the appropriate R.A.M.Os.\nduties also included giving advice and assist-\nance to units who were preparing for air-\ntransported operational réles and keeping my\nHeadquarters informed of the air transport and\nsupply situation.\n\n359. To ensure that this new organization\nworked smoothly, I established it alongside\nHeadquarters, Combat Cargo Task Force\n(Brigadier-General F. W. Evans), which was\nthe Allied Air Forces’ organization in charge\nof all the transport aircraft in the theatre.\nSubsequent events showed that this arrange-\nment was on the right lines and that\nC.A.A.T.O. had played a vital part in the\noperational successes achieved by Fourteenth\nArmy, 15 Indian Corps and Northern Combat\nArea Command. The closest cooperation and\nliaison with the Air Force is essential at all\nlevels for the efficient working of an air trans-\nport and supply system and in this I was par-\nticularly fortunate in having General G.\nStratemeyer, Commanding General, Eastern\nAir Command, to work with. The harmonious\ntelations established between ws, and the close\nand friendly working of our respective staffs,\ndid much to dissolve the difficulties which, on\noccasion, are bound to arise when one Service\nis largely dependent on another for all the\nessentials of its existence under adverse\nconditions of climate and terrain.\n\nHis -\n",

One thing is vital for an organization\nsuch as C.A.A.T.O., and that is first-class\ncommunications. Not only must the aircraft\ndeliver the correct loads at the right places,\nbut the system must be sufficiently flexible to\nallow of demands being changed at very short\nnotice—for instance, ammunition may suddenly\nbe required instead of petrol where unexpected\nOpposition is met. It must be possible for\ndemands from forward formations to be sent\n‘back at top speed so as to allow the proper\nsorting of these demands by C.A.A.T.O.’s staff\nand for the correct instructions to be sent out\nto the R.A.M.Os. Information must also be\nsent back to allow the correct briefing of pilots\nso that supplies are landed at the right airfield\nor dropped over the right dropping zone. The\nsituation forward is a constantly changing one,\nand in the case of supply-dropping where\nunits are in the jungle away from roads and\ntracks, the use of a central dropping zone is\nimpracticable and deliveries have to be made\nto each brigade or unit.\n\nIt was in this matter of communications that\nC.A.A.T.O. was insufficiently well provided,\nand such mistakes as occurred were in the\nmain attributable to this cause.. Unfortunately\n\ni personnel and equipment were among\nthe most serious shortages in the theatre and\nso it was not possible to bring C.A.A.T.O.’s\ncommunications up to the standard required.\n\n361. As Fourteenth Army’s advance pro-\ngressed and the capture of Rangoon became\nlikely, so the necessity for increasing the air\nsupply lift and getting the air supply bases\nforward became more pressing. The Imphal\ngroup of airfields was particularly unecon-\n\n~\n\nF.AM.Os at\nforward airfields\n\nMaintenance areas.\n\nomical as not only were they the most distant,\nwith a bad mountain crossing en route, but all\nstores sent from them were a charge on road\ntransport from Manipur Road forward. This\nsituation had been improved by the opening\nof the petrol pipeline on the 2nd March (see\nparagraph 332), but by this time the airfields\nwere already too far behind to allow operation\nat economic ranges.\n\nThe original plans for Akyab and Ramree\nAdvanced Bases were that all-weather airfields\nwould be completed at Akyab by the 30th\nApril for three transport squadrons, and at\nKyaukpyu for the same number by the 15th\nMay. These dates were, however, not nearly\nearly enough to support Fourteenth Army’s\nrapid advance and it became necessary to\ndevelop fair-weather airfields and to put them\ninto operation simultaneously with the construc-\ntion of the all-weather ones. Two squadrons\nof C.47 aircraft began supply operations from\nAkyab on the 20th March, with No, 1\nR.A.M.O. which had been switched from\nImphal, and a further two squadrons by- the\nend of the month. Half a squadron operated\nfrom Kyaukpyu during April for the supply\nof troops in Arakan only. The all-weather\nairfields were in fact completed in both places\nin early May, when each base operated three\nsquadrons of C.47 transport aircraft.\n\n362. The extent of all this development and\nthe effect of the increased number of aircraft\nwe eventually received are shown in the ton-\nnage figures. The table given in paragraph\n352 showed a total average daily tonnage of\n247. This average rose each month until in\nMarch, 1945, the figure of 1903 tons daily was\n",

On the contrary, on occasions very high\npeak performances were made when conditions\nwere right, aircraft flying as many as five\nsorties. It was the need to handle these\npeaks, which had to compensate for other days\nwhen flying was bad, that really tested the\nsupply organization and its capacity.\n\n363. The development of air supply as\noutlined above made heavy demands on air-\nfield engineer construction effort, both for the\nsupply bases and for the forward landing\ngrounds. That forward airfield construction\nmore than kept pace with requirements is\nshown by the fact that the percentage of\nsupplies dropped—as ‘opposed to landed—\ndecreased from 28% in November, 1944 to\n14.6% in March 1945. Rear airfields for supply\npurposes required extensive development if high\npeak tonnage figures were to be achieved. It\nwas found that the ideal to aim at was two\nstrips each 2,300 yards long, complete with\nloading bays. Over a hundred aircraft on the\nground may have to be catered for, flying up\nto five sorties daily. Airfield construction for\ntransport as well as for tactical purposes will be\ndealt with in more detail later in this part of\nthe Despatch.\n\n364. Casualty evacuation was linked with\nthe organization of air supply. The medical\naspect will be dealt with later when the ser-\nvices under the control of the Adjutant-\nGeneral’s branch are considered. Here it is\nenough to note that casualties were evacuated\nfrom formations by light aircraft (L.5), piloted\nby U.S.A.A.F. and R.A.F. personnel, back to\nthe forward airfields where there were Casualty\nClearing Stations with the F.A.M.Os.—usually\n\na distance of 30-50 miles. Such cases as\nrequired further evacuation were then carried\nby C.47 transport aircraft to forward base\nhospitals which in turn were situated near the\nR.A.M.Os. The extent to which air evacua-\ntion was used is shown by the fact that in\nMarch 1945, 13,000 casualties were transported\nby air. In some sectors evacuation by road or\nair was for periods impossible, and the medical\ncentres had to be entirely supplied by air\ndropping.\n\n365. With the capture of Rangoon, the need\nfor air supply iby no means ceased. Our forces\nwere scattered down the whole length of Burma\nand internal communications were still only\nfragmentary. Moreover the port itself had\nto be repaired and stocked, installations brought\nround from the other Ls. of C., and the land\nLs. of C. morthwards from Rangoon re-\nhabilitated and developed. Although the period\nafter the capture of Rangoon falls outside this\nDespatch, it should be noted that the supply\nof the forces in Central Burma in monsoon\nconditions presented considerable difficulties,\nand deliveries fell short of the tonnage\nrequired. Nevertheless, the capture of Rangoon\nwas the beginning of the end of a system of\nsupply which was nothing short of amazing,\nconsisting as it did of a fantastic single overland\nToute, costing immense resources in men and\nmaterials and paying very small dividends,\nwhile by far the greater part of the Army’s\nrequirements were brought in by air supply\ndeveloped as never before.\n\nThus the plans for the quickest possible\ndevelopment of Rangoon Port were of prime\nimportance. Some indication of how this\nproblem was tackled is given in the next\nsection.\n",

Experience in Africa and Europe had\nshown repeatedly the importance of really good\nplanning and organization where the reopening\nof a captured port was concerned. In the case\nof Rangoon we were more than ever working\nagainst time, since the monsoon was almost on\nus and it was essential to relieve the air trans-\nport system of the heavy load it was carrying,\nas this load was being canried partly at the\nexpense of aircraft serviceability.\n\n367. The project for the reopening of Ran-\ngoon and the development of the Advanced\nBase was known as operation “Stanza.” An\nadministrative appreciation was [prepared at\nmy Headquarters and in March it was handed\nover to the Commander, No. 1 Area, South-East\nAsia Command, who had been designated for\nthe Rangoon Advanced Base Area. The\nAdvanced Base Commanders of all three Ser-\nvices together with essential staff had been\nassembled in Calcutta. Jt was agreed that\nplanning should be co-ordinated by the Army,\nin the person of the Commander, No. 1 Area,\nas Rangoon was from the administrative angle\npredominantly the Army’s concern.\n\n368. When it was decided that a seaborne\nexpedition would be put in to assist Four-\nteenth Anmy in their advance to Rangoon\nnew complications arose, In all plans for the\ndevelopment of a port and advanced base it is\nessential that the reconnaissance party gets in\nimmediately after the place is captured. But\nin this particular instance it was going to be\nimpossible until a few days before the event\nto forecast whether Fourteenth Army or 15\nIndian Conps would enter Rangoon first. There\nwas a strong possibility that either formation\nmight be held up short of the city itself while\nthe other got in from the opposite direction,\nand that the occupation of the city by one\nwould not necessarily open the way at once for\nthe other. If the reconnaissance party was com-\nmitted with what turned out to be the wrong\nformation, it might not be able to function dur-\ning the first few vital days following the fall\nof the city, which would inevitably result in\ndislocation of the rehabilitation plans.\n\n369. It was therefore decided to split the\nTecomnaissance party into three groups. First\nthere was the Road Party. This was the main\nreconnaissance party and consisted of such staff\nand administrative services as would be needed\nto carry out the detailed reconnaissance for\ndepots, etc. Its task was to organize the open-\ning of the port as soon as the first ships arrived.\nThis party left Calcutta early in April and,\ntravelling by road via Manipur Road and\nJmphal, succeeded in catching up 4 Corps in\ntime to enter Rangoon with them from the\nnorth, after the link-up with 15 Indian Corps\nhad been effected.\n\n370. The second group of the reconnaissance\nparty was the Sea Party. This was envisaged\nas the substitute for the Road Party, and its\ncomposition was sufficiently strong to enable it\nby itself, to carry out the same tasks. It was\nheld in readiness to go in with one of 15 Indian\n\n60332\n\n1945\n\nCorps’ convoys as soon as it was clear that the\nfall of the city was imminent. Finally, there\nwas the Air Party, consisting of the three Ser-\nvice Advanced Base Commanders each with his\nsenior staff officer. This party remained behind\nto complete the final details, and then was\nflown an as soon as the Rangoon airfield\n(Mingaladon) was clear.\n\n371. The second main problem which arose\nwas how advantage could be taken of an early\nfall of the city. If 15 Indian Corps met heavy\nopposition—and it had to be assumed that\nit would—build-up convoys, including the\nfollow-up division would be required. If the\ncity fell quickly or if it fell to Fourteenth Army,\nthe most urgent requirements were all the units\nand stores for the quick development of the\nAdvanced Base. It was therefore essential to\nhave a Stanza (Advanced Base Development)\nconvoy, containing the necessary transportation\nand engineer stores, together with the units,\nfor the immediate reopening of Rangoon Port,\nready to replace one of the later Dracula opera-\ntional convoys, should it be found possible to\nreduce or defer the Dracula build-up. This\nnaturally involved considerable manipulation of\nthe shipping and stores concentration pro-\ngrammes; but this Stanza convoy was suc-\ncessfully prepared, and did in the event go in on\nD plus 21 in place of one of the later Dracula\nconvoys.\n\nSECTION XXIV (paras. 372-393)\nAIRFIELD CONSTRUCTION\n\nThe organization of Air Forces: The air-\nfield engineer organization: Work on Base\nairfields, airfields for air supply and the\nChina lift: Forward airfield construction:\nFourteenth Army’s advance: Airfields in\nArakan: The development of Akyab and\nKyaukpyu.\n\n372. The airfield construction work carried\nout under the control of my Headquarters was\nso extensive and varied that it deserves treat-\nment in a section to itself. This operational\ncommitment of the Army has proved to be\na major factor, both strategic and administra-\ntive, in any theatre of war. In such an un-\ndeveloped theatre as South-East Asia, where\nair transport was used on an unprecedented\nscale the commitment was correspondingly\neven greater.\n\n373. The presence in the theatre of both\nBritish, including Dominion, and United States\nAir Forces with widely varying functions re-\nsulted in a highly complicated organization.\nUntil the end of November, 1944, Fourteenth\nArmy was supported by 3 Tactical Air Force,\nand the Headquarters of both formations were\nat Comilla. When 15 Indian Corps was sepa-\ntated from Fourteenth Army and came under\nmy direct command, the R.A.F. Groups with\nthese formations (221 Group with Fourteenth\nAmy, 224 Group with 15 Indian Corps),\nbecame in effect separate tactical air forces. At\nthe same time 3 Tactical Air Force ceased\nto exist as such, its operational echelon being\nmerged into Headquarters, Eastern Air Com-\nmand (which, as I have mentioned before,\nwas an integrated operational Headquarters\nformed from Headquarters, US.AAF,,\nIndia/Burma Theatre and elements from Air\n\nE\n",

The Strategic Air Force, with its Head-\nquarters in Calcutta, operated the strategic\nbomber squadrons, some of which were based\non airfields in the Allied Land Forces, South-\nEast Asia area, for whose construction and\nmaintenance my engineers were responsible.\nThe air supply part of air operations was con-\ntrolled by the Combat Cargo Task Force which\nwas formed shortly after my arrival. The air\ntransport service to China was operated by the\nU.S. Air Transport Command, but a consider-\nable proportion of my Allied Land Forces,\nSouth-East Asia engineer resources was devoted\nto the construction of airfields and associated\ninstallations in North-East Assam. The ground\noperations of Northern Combat Area Com-\nmand were supported by 10 U.S.A.A.F., and\nthe airfield engineer works in this area were\nlargely constructed by American engineer avia-\ntion battalions, although the Divisional en-\ngineers of 36 British Division provided their\nown light aircraft strips.\n\n375. To meet the air forces organization\ndescribed above, my Chief Engineer (Major-\nGeneral K. Ray, seconded from the U.D.F.),\nworking under the Engineer-in-Chief, South-\nEast Asia Command, through the Deputy\nEngineer-in-Chief (Air), exercised technical\ncontrol over the Deputy Chief Engineer, Four-\nteenth Army, and formed the link on airfield\nmatters with Headquarters, Eastern Air Com-\nmand and Combat Cargo Task Force. When\nI moved my Advanced Headquarters from\nDelhi to Barrackpore, the Deputy Engineer-\nin-Chief (Air) also moved there from Comilla,\nand the air elements of the Allied Land Forces,\nSouth-East Asia engineer staff came under his\ncontrol. He worked with Headquarters, R.AF.\nBengal/Burma, which as I have stated above\nwas the administrative echelon of the R.AF.\nHeadquarters. When the development of Akyab\nand Ramree airfields was undertaken, special\nengineer forces were formed for airfield de-\nvelopment under the direct control of my\nHeadquarters.\n\n376. In describing the engineer work carried\nout I have divided work into various categories.\nFirst, the Base airfields for both strategic and\ntactical squadrons, next the transport airfields\n(excluding those for the China supply lift), then\nthose built for the China lift, then some mis-\ncellaneous airfield work in the rear areas, and\nlastly and in greater detail, the forward air-\nfield construction, including the development\nof the Advanced Bases at Akyab and Ramree.\n\nDescription\nRunways\nTaxi tracks tee\nAircraft standings we\nAircraft parking aprons\nRoads... we an\nAccommodation\nCovered Storage\n\nThe effect of these works on the air supply\nlift to China is indicated by the fact that the\nlift was trebled between June, 1944, and\nMarch, 1945, as shown by the following figures.\n\nJune 1944 March 1945\nNo. of completed sorties\n3,702 11,347\n\nper month ... tee\nTons lifted to China... 14,150 41,580\n\nSUPPLEMENT To tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\n377. Of the Base airfields, the bulk of those:\nwhich were intended for the Strategical Air\nForce were sited in India, but thirteen bomber\nairfields had been constructed by the Chief\nEngineer, Fourteenth Army. Three of these\nwere later transferred to the Engineer-in-Chief,\nIndia Command, and of the remaining ten, five\nwere used by medium and light bombers during.\nthe period covered by this Despatch, and the\nother five were converted for use by transport\naircraft and fighters. During the early stages\nof Fourteenth Army and 15 Indian Corps’\noffensive, base airfields were used by tactical\nsquadrons, fighters operating from Imphal and\nPalel, and also from the bomber fields at Kum-\nbirgram, Chittagong, Chiringa, Cox’s Bazaar\nand Comilla, which were adapted to meet\nfighter requirements.\n\n378. Initially, the air supply lift for Four-\nteenth Army was flown from bomber airfields.\nwhich had been converted for this purpose.\nThe airfields used were Sylhet, Comilla, Fenny\nand Chittagong, and supplies were carried to\nthe airfields in the Imphal Plain. The increase\nin the tonnage carried has already ‘been\ndescribed. All this had to be met by more\nmaintenance, development and construction by\nthe airfields engineers. The building of the\nadvanced air bases will be described under\nforward airfield development. I will only add\nhere that during the year ending the 31st\nMarch, 1945, 550,000 tons of supplies and\nstores had been carried by air to forward areas\nfrom airfields constructed by Allied Land\nForces, South-East Asia engineers.\n\n379, The American air lift to China reached\ngigantic proportions considering the difficulty\nof the route, and it has received world-wide\npublicity. What is not so generally realised,\nand certainly received less publicity, is that the\nairfields in North-East Assam to support this\ntraffic, were built almost entirely by British\nagency, first under the Chief Engineer, 11 Army\nGroup, until November, 1944, and thereafter by\nthe Chief Engineer, L. of C. Command. One\nUnited States engineer battalion assisted in the\nlater stages. Owing to the diversity of the\nworks, it is not practicable to give full details of\nthe construction undertaken during the period\ncovered by this Despatch, but the following\ntable shows the situation at about the time I\ntook over command in November, 1944, giving\nthe work completed. and ‘the amount in hand as\nregards the eleven all-weather airfields in\nNorth-East Assam:\n\nCompleted Under Construction\n13 miles _\n25 miles 7 miles\n486 20\n37 acres 23 acres\n80 miles 23 miles\n33,106 men _\n63 acres 44 acres\n\n380. A considerable amount of other rear\nairfield work was undertaken in the L. of C.\nCommand area, in addition to what has been\nmentioned in the preceding paragraphs. For\nexample, twenty-one fair-weather satellite air-\nfields had to be maintained. These had been\nout of action during the monsoon and subse-\nquent drainage and repair work was heavy.\n",

These raids had repercussions over\na wide area and there was a marked reluctance\nby civil labour to work on airfields. Although\nI have not covered the whole field of rear air-\nfield consteuction work, I hope I have said\nenough to show that it represented a very con-\nsiderable engineer effort, requiring organization\nand a high peak cate of output.\n\n381. In dealing with forward airfield con-\nstruction, it is, I think, best to take the advance\nof Fourteenth Army first. The first group of\nfour forward airfields, apart from the recon-\nditioning of the strip at Tamu, were constructed\nnear Kalemyo. These strips were all developed\nto operate transport aircraft as well as fighters ;\nand were constructed by a Forward Airfield\nEngineer Group. The other axis of Four-\nteenth Army’s advance, that of 19 Indian\nDivision via Pinlebo and Wuntho, was at first\ncovered by fighters operating at extreme range\nfrom the Imphal airfield group. Later, three\nJapanese airstrips in the Indaw oilfields area\nwere developed. These, when captured, were\nfound to be short and built toa very poor speci-\nfication. Much work was required to render\nthem adequate for the operations of our own\naircraft.\n\n382. For the main advance into Central\nBurma and southwards, the Shwebo group of\nairfields became of paramount importance.\nThese were captured at the end of December,\n1944. The group consisted of five Japanese air-\nstrips which all gave considenable trouble in\ndevelopment. Owing to the enemy’s denial\nmeasures, it was found quicker to develop the\ntaxi-tracks as strips than to repair the runways.\nThe volume of air traffic and the friable nature\nof the soil in this area made the dust problem\nacute, which shortage of water made is diffi-\ncult to remedy. With the capture of Monywa in\nJanuary a further group of four enemy airfields\nwas developed. Little work was required as\ndenial measures had been slight. A noticeable\nfeature of these as of other Japanese airfields\nwas the elaborate nature of the dispersal areas\n—a tribute to our air attacks. Another group\nlay near Myingyan, important because it was\nthe southern terminal of the I.W.T. link from\nKalewa. Here five airfields were developed, two\nof which were Japanese. The latter had been\ndenied in the most effective way yet met by\nour engineers, nine inches of hand-packed stone\nhaving been spread over the surface.\n\n383. In February 1945, four airfields were\nconstructed to support 33 Corps’ crossings of\nthe Irrawaddy. These were sited at Sadaung,\nOndaw (two) and Allagappa. The work was not\nonly extensive and technically difficult owing\nto the soil, but much of it had to proceed under\nobserved artillery fire. Meanwhile, 4 Corps was\nadvancing down the Gangaw Valley towards\nPakokku. The airfields here were essential to\nthe advance since the road could not carry the\ntraffic required by a Corps of two divisions and\na tank brigade. By analogy with the railhead,\nfrom which the road traffic proceeds forward,\nairheads were constructed. One was constructed\nabout halfway down the Gangaw Valley at Kan,\nwith a subsidiary airfield at the top of the\nvalley at Tilin, while another was made near\nthe Irrawaddy at Sinthe. These airheads each\nconsisted of two 2,000 yard airstrips and a\n\n1947\n\n700 yard casualty evacuation strip, complete\nwith unloading bays, taxi tracks, etc. The\nTilin airfield had one 1,500 yard strip and a\n700 yard casualty strip. These airfields held the\nfighters to cover the Irrawaddy crossing and\nin addition some 200 transport aircraft landed\ndaily with supplies and stores. They were con-\nstructed in record time by the forward air-\nfield engineers, assisted by Corps and Divisional\nengineers and infantry working parties. Sinthe\nis of particular interest for two reasons. It was\nmade operational in five days, and completed\nin ten, by a Forward Airfield Engineer Group\nwhose motor transport had only had one day\nfor maintenance while covering 2,300 miles\nfrom Cocanada on the Madras coast of India.\nThe other is that to alleviate the bad dust con-\nditions, a six mile ditch had to be bulldozed\nfrom the nearest sources to bring water to a\nchannel between the airstrips, whence it could\nbe pumped onto them.\n\n384. Directly our forces had broken out of\nthe bridgeheads, a group of six airfields were\nconstructed south of the river, while to the\nnorth, 19 Indian Division was supported from\nthe reconditioned Japanese airfields at Singu\nand later at Mandalay. The siting of these air-\nfields had to be in accordance with the tactical\nsituation, which often increased the engineering\ndifficulties. Most of them were built under fire.\nOne of them, at Tada-U, had to be operational\nfor C.46 aircraft in 48 hours, and the job was\ncompleted within this incredibly short space of\ntime.\n\n385. The capture of Meiktila gave us a group\nof five important Japanese airfields. Moreover,\nowing to the speed of our advance, the enemy’s\ndenial measures were comparatively ineffective.\nOne airfield was in five hours made ready,\nunder fire, to receive transport aircraft bringing\nreinforcements, By the irony of fate it was not\nthe Japanese denial measures which caused us\ntrouble, but the Japanese efforts to maintain\nthe airfields in action. Bomb craters caused\nby our attacks had been so inexpertly filled in\nthat when heavy rain fell, water penetrated to\nthe subgrade to such an extent that some fields\nhad to be abandoned.\n\n386. For the final advance to Rangoon\nthere were three well defined groups of airfields,\nsited respectively in the Pyinmana, Toungoo\nand Nyaunglebin areas. All consisted of light\nJapanese airfields damaged to varying degrees.\nTn addition to rendering these operational, other\nfair-weather strips had to be constructed. The\nadvance was so rapid that at times it out-\nstripped the physical movement of the forward\nairfield engineers. An additional complication\narose in that we were now in the season when\nheavy pre-monsoon storms had to be expected,\nand in fact some exceptionally heavy storms\noccurred. A special organization had to be\nadopted to meet these particular circumstances.\nAn advanced reconnaissance party of airfield\nengineers accompanied the armoured spear-\nhead; the C.R.E. (Commander, Royal En-\ngineers) followed as closely as possible with\na forward echelon of two field companies and\na mechanical equipment platoon; while with\nthe following brigades came the rear echelon\nconsisting of an engineer battalion and a Corps\nmechanical equipment platoon. Forward air-\nfield engineers had to carry seven days’ rations\nand petrol, owing to rapid changes between\nformations and the fact that they were usually\n",

Army con-\ntrol was maintained by continuous visits by air,\nbut was extremely difficult to keep up to date.\n\n387. The great distances covered, and the\nlJeap-frogging of formations on a single-way\nroad, with close convoy timings, imposed a\ngreat strain on the forward airfield engineers.\nOn one occasion the convoy timings were so\ntight that the last grader took its final run over\nthe last apron, and drove direct to the starting\npoint with only a few minutes to spare. Loss\nof this timing would have delayed the group\nfor twelve hours. Under these conditions, the\nopening of nine airstrips over a distance of 200\nmiles in eleven days must be accounted a\nmagnificent achievement.\n\n388. The forward airfield construction\ndescribed in the preceding paragraphs amounts\nto nearly 60 airstrips built or reconditioned,\napart from light aircraft strips, but it only takes\ninto account the principal airfields. As I said\nin the description of Base airfield work, many\nmore airfields were used at various times than\nthose actually specified here.\n\n389. Turning now to 15 Indian Corps, it will\nbe remembered that support was provided by\n224 Group, R.A.F., whose five tactical wings\noperated from the all-weather airfields from\nCox’s Bazaar northwards, and in the dry season\nfrom fourteen fair-weather strips to the south.\nAfter the 1944 monsoon the first task was to\nTesuscitate these strips, which had been out of\naction during the rains, as soon as possible.\nSix of them had also to be lengthened by 600\nyards (to 2,300 yards) to take P.47 fighters,\nand all the accommodation associated with the\nairfields required heavy repairs. The first of\nthese fair-weather airstrips was ready on the\nigth November and the last on Christmas Day,\n\n390. Directly Akyab Island was occupied,\nwork began on expanding the existing all-\nweather airfield so that it could accommodate\nthree transport and three and a half tactical\nsquadrons, with a target completion date of the\n15th May.. At the same time, to meet the\nimmediate and pressing needs of Fourteenth\nAnny, a fair-weather transport field for two\nsquadrons was constructed and opened on the\n17th February. Two tactical strips were also\nmade. Fourteenth Army’s rapid progress, how-\never, made further demands on the airfield\ndevelopment of Akyab. A second fair-weather\ntransport strip was called for, and an advance\non the completion date for the all-weather\nairfield, and finally an increase in the opera-\ntional capacity of the latter was required.\nDespite many difficulties this programme of\nwork was completed ahead of schedule. The\nworks on Akyab Island were begun by the\nChief Engineer, 15 Indian Corps, but early in\nFebruary, the responsibility was taken over by\nthe commander of an Army Group Royal\nEngineers, working directly under my Chief\nEngineer. ‘\n\n391. After the capture of Kyaukpyu, on\nRamree Island, the existing Japanese fair-\nweather airstrip was repaired by Divisional\nengineers, despite heavy denial measures by\nthe enemy. Work was begun immediately on\nthe advanced Air Supply Base, at Akyab, which\nincluded the construction of an all-weather air-\nfield for three transport and three and a half\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\ntactical squadrons. These works were con-\ntrolled by a Deputy Chief Engineer working\ndirectly under my Headquarters. :\n\n392. Apart from the transport airfields on\nAkyab and Ramree mentioned above, 15\nIndian Corps engineers constructed nine fair-\nweather fields for the air supply of 81 and 82\n(West African) Divisions in the Kaladan, and\n25 Indian Divisional Engineers constructed one\ntransport strip at Myebon. In addition 42 light\naircraft strips were made during the Arakan\noperations,\n\n393. This section does not pretend to be\ncomprehensive. No mention has been made\nof the more technical problems, or the pro-\nvision and transport of the many stores and\nmaterials which airfield work required, nor of\nthe methods used to overcome natural and\nenemy-created difficulties. The principal air-\nfields have been mentioned, and in the above\naccount eighty-six strips, apart from light air-\ncraft strips, have received notice, but there\nwere others. This will give a fair indication of\nthe extent of the task performed.\n\nSECTION XXV (paras. 394-419) ADJUTANT-\n\nGENERAL STAFF AND SERVICES MATTERS\n\nReinforcements: Organization matters:\nLeave, repatriation and release: Morale:\nRecovery of Allied prisoners of war: “ Indian\nNational Army”: The work of the Medical\nServices: The work of the other services\ncontrolled by the Adjutant-General’s Depart-\nment of the Staff.\n\n394. Before dealing with the services under\nthe control of the Adjutant-General’s staff, I\nwill deal with the direct responsibilities of that\nstaff itself ; that is, provision of reinforcements,\nfaising of units, leave, repatriation, release,\nmorale, recovery of Allied prisoners of war and\nmatters in connection with the Japanese-\nsponsored “Indian National Army.”\n\n395. There were twelve Reinforcement\nCamps in the Allied Land Forces, South-East\nAsia area ; six at Comilla, four at Gauhati, one\nat Chittagong and one, for 36 British Division\nwhile they were operating with Northern\nCombat Area Command, at Dibrugarh. Up\ntill the end of November, 1944, the flow of\nreinforcements through these camps was satis-\nfactory, except in the case of British infantry.\nFrom December onwards, however, as the land\nL. of C. lengthened, the main reinforcement\nproblem became one of movement rather than\nof provision, since the air L. of C. became\nthe only practical means of transport. In\nDecember, for example, although 10,618\nTeinforcements were received from India, the\nonward flow was limited to about 150 men per\nday, the total flown forward during the month\nbeing 4,641. This was solely due to shortage\nof aircraft and to the fact that other forms\nof transport were required for other purposes,\nincluding the lifting forward of men other than\nteinforcements. The numbers flown forward,\nhowever, steadily improved from February,\n1945, onwards ; in April, for example, 10,066\nreinforcements were fiown in to Fourteenth\nArmy during the month, including 5,473 to 4\nCorps in eight days to replace losses in the\nMeiktila fighting. But the intake of reinforce-\nments from India Command, together with\nthe men discharged fit from hospitals and\nreturning leave details, continued to exceed\n",

An innovation occurred in February,\nwhen I accepted into Allied Land Forces,\nSouth-East Asia 3,000 British infantry rein-\nforcements direct from the ship for two months’\ntraining at the reinforcement camps at Comilla.\nThis was done at the request of India Com-\nmand, who were unable to cope with the\nsudden increase in reinforcements who had\nonly received unit training in the United King-\ndom. The majority of these men had been\ntransferred from the Royal Navy, Royal\nMarines, and the Royal Air Force, and ex-\ncellent material they proved.\n\n397. Battle casualties caused a sharp increase\nin the demands for both British and Indian\ninfantry reinforcements in March, particularly\nOfficers. India Command responded promptly,\nsending forward large drafts, some of which\nwere drawn from British battalions employed\nin internal security and frontier defence rdles.\nThese were augmented at the end of the month\nby a special draft of some thirty majors and\ncaptains who were flown to Allied Land Forces,\nSouth-East Asia from battalions in India at\nmy urgent request.\n\n398. I have already mentioned in various\nPlaces in this Despatch the major changes in\norganization which took place and I do not\npropose to go into more detail except in regard\nto the formation of areas, etc., in L. of C.\nCommand. The following figures, however,\nare of interest as indicating the amount that\nwas done in this direction. Between the 12th\nNovember, 1944 and the 3rd May, 1945, the\ntotal number of units of all types raised was\n753, reorganized 627, and disbanded 407. As\ntegards L. of C. Command, its organization\ncontinued to expand as the liberation of Burma\nprogressed, The Headquarters had been raised\nin November. In January and February, five\nadditional L. of C. Sub-Areas were established\nin Burma. No. 505 District for North Burma\nand No. 1 Area, South-East Asia Command,\nfor Rangoon, were raised in March. The H.Q.\nfor 505 District moved into Shwebo early in\nApril, while the move of No. 1 Area into\nRangoon has already been described in Section\nXXIH of the Despatch. In April No. 2 Area,\nSouth-East Asia Command and No. 555 Sub-\nArea were raised in anticipation of the require-\nments of future operations.\n\n399. Several new leave schemes were intro-\nduced .during the period under report, in\naddition to the normal leave system already\nin force in the theatre. In November 1944, a\nscheme was started under which British Service\npersonne] could be granted 28 days’ leave in\nthe United Kingdom, and, in the following\nmonth, this was extended to include British\npersonnel of the Indian Army. In December,\ntoo, a scheme providing for 61 days’ leave in\nthe United Kingdom, in lieu of reversion to\nthe Home Establishment on long service\ngrounds, was introduced, eligibility being the\nsame as for repatriation. In February, leave\ntravel by air to the United Kingdom was\nstarted in cases where operational require-\nments demanded the quick return of the men\nconcerned. This air trave] was extended in\nMarch to apply to all leave schemes.\n\n+1949\n\n400. A scheme for the repatriation of\nSouthern Rhodesian troops was approved in\nFebruary, and in April a similar scheme came\ninto force, whereby all East and West African\nother ranks with between two and a half and\nthree years overseas service could either be\nrepatriated or granted home leave.\n\n401. In April a warning order was issued to\nformations that release would start any time\nafter the Ist May. This order gave the phasing\nof Groups 1 to 11.\n\n402. The outstanding factor affecting morale\ngenerally was that both British and Indian\ntroops now felt a complete sense of mastery\nover the Japanese. It was this confidence,\nborn of success in battle, that carried them\non so triumphantly. Various other factors\nhad their effects, differing with the nationality\nof the troops concerned.\n\n403. In the case of British troops, the in-\ncreased publicity given to the theatre was\nwelcomed, but certain announcements by\npoliticians and in the Press, were received with\nmisgivings. The 28 days’ home leave scheme,\nmentioned above, came in for considerable\ncriticism, which was not in fact justified. The\noperational and transportation (shipping and\naircraft) situations were such that unfortunately\nonly a small proportion of those entitled could\navail themselves of the scheme. Moreover,\nmen due for repatriation, who had completed\nmore than years’ overseas service, felt\nthat they had a prior claim on the accommoda-\ntion absorbed by the leave personnel who had\na good deal less overseas service. The Earl of\nMunster’s report was favourably received. The\nreduction in and final abolition of postal\ncharges on letters was appreciated. The\nGovernment’s post-war gratuity proposals had\nan unfavourable reception. The supply and\nquality of cigarettes was bad. .\n\n404. Although the morale of Indian troops\nwas maintained at a very high level, the in-\nefficiencies of the Indian postal system, the\nnon-receipt of family allowances by relatives,\nand various examples of victimisation and\npetty extortion by village officials continued to\nworry the Indian soldier.\n\n405. West African morale was good and the\ntroops gave a good account of themselves in\naction. Repatriation and home leave became\nthe main topic of interest of the West African\ntroops, but a clear statement of policy on the\nsubject was still awaited when I relinquished\ncommand. The increase in expatriation\nallowance, and the extension of the free\npostal concession to West Africans, were.\nappreciated.\n\n406. The morale of the East African troops\nwas good and the introduction of the home\nleave scheme was welcomed. Relations with\nEuropeans, which had deteriorated somewhat\nin the middle of the period under report,\nimproved again later.\n\n407. During April, 1945, it was learnt that\nthere were about 350 Allied prisoners of war\nin Rangoon gaol. Plans were immediately\nmade for their evacuation in anticipation of the\nearly capture of Rangoon. Actually the first\nprisoners to be released were a Party of 350\nBritish, Indians and Americans whom the\nJapanese were trying to march out of Burma\n(see Para. 255). This party was discovered\nnear Pegu on the 30th April, having peen\n",

These were liberated when we\nre-entered Rangoon on the 3rd May. The\ngeneral condition of these prisoners of war was\nsomewhat better than was expected, there being\nonly some 50 stretcher cases. Their morale\nwas high, despite the fact that they had been\nill-treated and underfed for three years, All\nAllied prisoners of war were immediately\nevacuated by returning transport aircraft to\nAllied Land Forces, South-East Asia Advanced\nBase Hospitals at Comilla. After a week’s re-\ncuperation, they were transferred to Base\nHospitals in India.\n\n408. As the Japanese retreat from Burma\nprogressed, they left the “Indian National\nArmy ” behind, totalling about 16,000 strong.\nThese formations surrendered as we\napproached, incidentally providing a useful\nlabour force. The units of the LN.A. were\nmade up of Indians locally enlisted in Malaya\nand of prisoners of war captured by the\nJapanese. The prisoners of war joined the\nLN.A. for various reasons. Some joined under\nduress, in the hope of escaping to India ; some\njoined it honestly believing that by doing so\nthey would be fighting for the freedom of\nIndia ; some because they felt that the creation\nand presence of an Indian Army under Indian\nofficers might prevent Japanese atrocities and\ncruelties when they entered India; others\njoined solely as followers of Subhas Chandra\nBose, and still others joined in order to avoid\nthe hardships of a prisoner of war’s life. But\nall members of the organization were treated\nby us as prisoners of war until they had been\ninterrogated in India and classified as\n“ Black” or “ White.” This caused a serious\nadministrative problem. Initially the rate at\nwhich we could evacuate them was limited by\nIndia’s ability to receive them; later it was\nrestricted by shortage of transport aircraft and\nshipping. Large numbers, therefore, had to be\nheld forward, and we had to accept the burden\nof feeding and guarding them. There was a\nvery strong feeling against these men among\nthe members of the Indian Army and special\nprecautions had to be taken to prevent clashes.\n\n409. Turning to the services administered by\nthe Adjutant-General’s branch of the staff, it\nis impossible in this campaign to over-\nemphasise the importance of the work of the\nmedical services. As I have said elsewhere,\nwithout the modern developments of medical\nscience, the campaign could not have been\nfought at all. The degree of success attained\nis shown in the figures that I will quote. From\nNovember, 1944, to April, 1945, both months\ninclusive, the number of casualties from sick-\nness totalled 69,713, while battle casualties\namounted to 17,693. Thus, during the period\nunder report, the ratio of medical to battle\ncasualties was 3.93 to one. Even during the\nperiods of hardest fighting in February and\nMarch, the ratio only fell to 2.4 and 1.8 to one\nrespectively. Nevertheless the sick rate during\nthis same period was surprisingly low. In early\nMarch, for example, it was only 0.96 per 1,000\nper day ; in late April it was 1.42 per 1,000 per\nday, that is, about one-third of the rate ia\nOctober, 1944.\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nSuch low figures among troops fighting and\nworking in an unhealthy tropical climate, in\nareas where malaria, dysentery, scrub typhus,\nsmall-pox and cholera are endemic, are in\nthemselves a tribute to the medical services.\nThey can be attributed in part to the more\nextensive use of comparatively new drugs, e.g.,\nmepacrine and sulphaguanidine, and to that\ninvaluable insecticide, D.D.T. But I would\nlike to lay stress on the important part played\nby good discipline, particularly in regard to\nanti-malaria measures and hygiene. Without\nthis discipline, modern medical science and\nthe efforts of the officers of the medical ser-\nvices are largely ineffective.\n\n410. The difficulties of surface communica-\ntions in the theatre resulted in two particular\nlines of development, namely, the evacuation\nof casualties by air, and the necessity for for-\nward treatment being carried out in light\nmedical units, since hospitals could not be\nmoved in. These factors produced the “ Corps\nMedical Centres,” which consisted of one (or\ntwo): Indian Malaria Forward Treatment\nCentres, and one (or two) Casualty Clearing\nStations, with ancillary units, such as\nX-ray, laboratory, transfusion units, etc.\nCasualties from forward formations, usually\n30-50 miles distant, were carried to these\nCentres in light aircraft (L.5), piloted by\nUS.A.A.F, and R.AF. personnel. As a\ngeneral rule, cases requiring more than three\nweeks’ treatment were evacuated from these\nCentres by C.47 (Dakota) aircraft to forward\nbase' hospitals, but geography and climate im-\nposed certain restrictions. In crossing the high\nmountain ranges often obscured by cloud, air-\ncraft, flew at 13,000-15,000 feet altitude, some-\ntimes being forced up to 17.000 feet. Since\noxygen was not available, this imposed limita-\ntions on the types of cases which could be\nevacuated. During the Irrawaddy crossings,\nfor ¢xample, there was a sharp increase in the\nm of chest wounds. Such cases had to\nbe retained in forward areas until convales-\ncence was well established.\n\n411. In Fourteenth Army, some 75 per cent.\nof medical cases were returned direct to units\nfrom the Corps Medical Centres. With regard\nto surgical cases, the establishment of these\nCentres also resulted in an immense saving\nof manpower and suffering. Thorough and\ntimely forward surgery was rendered possible,\nfollowed by rapid evacuation to base.\n\n412. In the Arakan, the series of assault\nlandings made amongst mangrove swamps, in-\nland creeks and other ground unsuitable for\nadvanced landing grounds, made early evacua-\ntion difficult. | Hand-carriages, jeeps, assault\nlanding craft and small river steamers had to\nbe used as far as the advanced Janding\ngrounds, which prevented early evacuation of\ncasualties to Casualty Clearing Stations. This\ndisadvantage was partially offset by locating\nMobile Surgical Units .forward with Field\nAmbulances, to carry out emergency life-saving\nsurgery.\n\n413. In certain sectors, air and overland\nevacuation were alike impossible over long\nperiods. A medical centre in the Tiddim area,\nfor example, was supplied entirely by air-drop,\nand it held and treated a large number of\nwounded and sick, with excellent results.\n",

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\n414. There can be few campaigns in history,\nfought under such adverse conditions, in which\nthe general health of large armies was main-\ntained at such a high level. It must not be\nforgotten that the primary function of the\nmedical services is officially defined as the\nmaintenance of health and prevention of\ndisease, a function which in popular esteem\ntends to get lost sight of or overshadowed by\nthe glamour of their other duties in tending the\nsick and wounded.\n\n415. Turning to the other services, our\nProvost resources were seriously strained\nduring the period under review, and great diffi-\nculty was experienced in the provision of\ntrained personnel and of certain items of stores,\nparticularly traffic control and signal equip-\nment, also of vehicles of the correct type. With\nthe rapid advance over difficult terrain, and\nthe opposed crossings of the Chindwin and\nIrrawaddy, the control of traffic became a\nmajor problem. It was largely solved by the\nuse of light aircraft under the direction of the\nAssistant Provost Marshal. - Communications\nbetween ground and air were successfully main-\ntained and outstanding results were achieved.\n\n416. The question of Welfare was one to\nwhich I devoted much time and thought. Its\nimportance was great, particularly owing to the\ntotal lack of amenities or even civilization to be\nfound in the majority of the operational areas.\nFurthermore, short leave was a greater rarity in\nthis theatre than in others owing to the length\nof time it took to send parties to and from\nIndia. Its importance was great for the\nnumerous Indian troops, but even more so for\nthe British and African soldiers serving in a\nland other than their own.\n\nLeave hostels and camps were established for\nall ranks at suitable centres in India, through\nthe efforts of India Command and the numer-\nous voluntary workers who helped to run them.\nFurther, many residents in India extended the\nhospitality of their homes to both officers and\nother ranks. I should like here to pay tribute\nto all those who helped in these ways.\n\nLeave centres and clubs were planned for\nfuture establishment in Burma at such places\nas Maymyo, Mandalay and Rangoon, as were\nAmenity Store Depots which enabled troops\nwhether British, Indian or African to purchase\nessential and other articles, which the country\nin which they were fighting could not supply.\nA great deal of welfare work was necessary in\nRangoon ; and careful forethought and plan-\nning was needed to ensure that sufficient per-\nsonnel and equipment were brought in at once,\nby sea and air, to open several welfare centres\nwithin a few weeks of the capture of the city.\n\nA large and increasing number of officers\nwere employed by the Welfare Service, and re-\nsults were continually more apparent. The\nintroduction of the various women’s services\nwas both popular and successful, and the work\ndone by the Women’s Voluntary Service, the\nWomen’s Auxiliary Service (Burma) and by\nwelfare workers of the First Aid Nursing Yeo-\nmanry was greatly appreciated by the troops of\nall the Allies.\n\nMany philanthropic bodies sent their repre-\nsentatives to this theatre of war and did ex-\ncellent work catering for \\the needs of the\ntroops. Units of the Soldiers’, Sailors’, and\nAirmen’s Families Association and of the In-\ncorporated Soldiers’ Sailors’ and Airmen’s\n\n60332\n\n1951\n\nHelp Society looked after the troops’ personal\ninterests in connection with their family affairs\nin the United Kingdom. I would like to mep-\ntion, in particular, the Y.W.C.A. without whose\nwork it would have been impossible to bring\nmany women helpers of other organizations\nconcerned into Rangoon.\n\nThere was a steady increase in the number of\nartistes sent out by E.N.S.A. for “live” enter-\ntainment and the standard was improved.\nThat many “ Stars” came out, was usually the\nresult of personal letters to them. The Faiye\nDilbust Shabah organized by India Command\nprovided live entertainment for Indian troops.\nThe transport for entertainment parties, includ-\ning air transport represented considerable effort.\nIt was difficult to bring cinema shows up to\nthe standard I should have liked, for many\nTeasons. Indian films were provided for the\nIndian troops.\n\nRadio distribution vans were of value in\nbroadcasting music and records to isolated\nunits. Broadcasting was supplied at first from\nDelhi and later from Radio SEAC, but unfor-\ntunately the supply of wireless sets failed by\nthousands to reach the entitlement figure fixed\nby the War Office.\n\nAn adequate supply of reading matter was of\nfirst importance. Daily news was catered for\nby the newspaper SEAC, whose paid sales ex-\n\nled 20,000 a day in Fourteenth Army\nalone. A weekly magazine “ Phoenix ” started\npublication in February. The first consignment\nof 11,300 copies of Sunday newspapers from\nthe United Kingdom was flown in in the Spring\nof 1945, and was very popular, troops being\nable to zead their home papers only 7 days after\npublication. Reading matter for Indian troops\npresented special difficulties owing to differ-\nences of language.\n\nOf welfare equipment generally, sports gear\nwas satisfactory as a great amount was made\nin India, but gramophones, wireless sets (as\nalready mentioned) and musical instruments\nwere always in short supply and were many\nthousands below the target figure laid down.\n\n417. The work of registration and concentra-\ntion of the graves of battle casualties was kept\nwell up to date. The Graves Registration Ser-\nvice had the important task of tracing missing\nand deceased prisoners of war, and a start was\nmade to clarify the situation regarding Ran-\ngoon gaol, in which many Allied prisoners were\nheld captive.\n\n: 418. Army Educational Corps personnel\nhave been primarily concerned with the pro-\nduction of daily news-sheets including some in\nthe vernacular, which have kept the troops\ninformed about their own and other war fronts,\nand in touch with home news and developments.\nTackling the important task of the primary\neducation of Indian troops has, of course, only\nbeen possible when formations have been with-\ndrawn from active operations. A start was also\nmade on post-war education to assist the soldier\nin learning or re-learning trades for civil life.\n\n419. Finally, I will add a note on the work\nof the Royal Army Pay Corps and its Indian\nequivalent. Their task has been no easy one.\nDuring the Burma campaign, neither banks .\nnor treasuries were available, and all the cash\nrequired for the Forces had to be taken into the\ncountry. The bulk of this was flown in and\n\nF2\n",

A revised Field Service ration scale for\nIndian troops was introduced in November\n1944. This was followed by a revised scale for\nBritish troops on the Ist March, 1945, and for\nAfrican troops on the Ist May. These scales\nwere not only of great calorific value but pro-\nvided a more varied and palatable diet. Starting\nin November, 1944, 585 tons of frozen meat per\nmonth were delivered into Assam, Eastern\nBengal and Arakan by nine aircraft sorties\nsix days a week. A large proportion of British\nand African troops benefited from this scheme,\nthough local distribution was still somewhat\nrestricted by the full quota of insulated lorries\nnot yet being available. From November also,\n40 tons per month of frozen meat were being\nshipped to Chittagong, where two 16 ton cold\nstorage plants had just been installed, and six\nothers were in course of erection. Rail delivery\nof frozen meat into Assam began in January,\nand the fly-in of this commodity could then be\nstopped. Rail delivery into Eastern Bengal\nalso began directly the cold storage plants in\nthat area were ready (15th February). A 3,000\nton refrigerated store ship arrived from the\nUX. in February, and was located at Chitta-\ngong as a floating store. A 500 ton cold storage\nplant was also installed at this port in March.\n\nThe above arrangements greatly improved the\nsituation as regards British and African troops.\n\nSUPPLEMENT tro tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nMeat issues to Indian troops were also increased,\nbut not to the same extent. They rose from\n2.87 issues per month in December to over eight\nin February. I should have liked to have im-\nproved on this figure, but several factors pre-\nvented further increase ; the large number of\nIndian troops in the theatre compared with the\navailable supply of goats, the apparent impossi-\nbility of increasing the supply of dehydrated\nmeat from India, and, lastly, the religious sus-\nceptibilities of the Indian troops themselves.\n\n422. Little opportunity has arisen so far in\nthis Despatch to give any account of the work\nof the Ordnance services, and J will now\nremedy this omission. In November, 1944, the\nmain Ordnance depots for the maintenance of\nthe Allied forces were located as follows:—\nat Manipur Road, for the Northern L. of C., a\nBase Ordnance Depot and a Base Ammunition\nDepot, and at Chittagong for the Southern L.\nof C., similar depots. The position of these\ndepots remained unchanged until February\n1945, when instructions were issued for the\nswitch of ordnance stores from Manipur Road\nto Chittagong, for the maintenance of Four-\nteenth Army and 15 Indian Corps from airfields\nin the Chittagong area. Large quantities of\nstores and ammunition were consequently\ntransferred by rail to Chittagong, and_also\ndiverted to Chittagong from depots in India.\nAll vehicles and heavy equipment still continued\nto be despatched through Manipur Road.\n\n423. In March, two ammunition depots, each\ndesigned to support a Corps of two divisions,\nwere switched from Manipur Road-to Akyab\nand Ramree, and, from the Ist April, the\nammunition supply of Fourteenth Army became\ndependent on these two depots. It was decided\nto close the Manipur Road Ordnance depot as\nsoon as possible, in order to enable it to be\nreopened at Rangoon. To allow this, the forma-\ntion of a Central Burma stockpile was begun\nat Myingyan. This was to consist of 15 days’\nreserve of certain essential ordnance stores. By\nearly April, the Manipur Road Depot was con-\nsiderably reduced and the Chittagong Depot\nassumed all responsibility for issues after the\n15th. During this month no fewer than 7,800\nvehicles were sent forward from Manipur Road\nto Fourteenth Army, to create the necessary\nreserve in Central Burma before the monsoon\nclosed the road L. of C.\n\n424, The following table shows the tonnages\nhandled and vehicles issued from the main\nDepots on the Northern and Southern Ls. of C.\nin November 1944, and for comparison, April\n1945. .\n\nTonnages and Vehicles Handled\n\nNovember, 1944—\nNorthern L. of C.\nSouthern L, of C.\n\nApril, 1945— .\n\nNorthern L, of C,\n\nSouthern L. of C.\n\nAmmunition\n\"4,000\nno record\n\n8,500*\n17,000\n\n‘ 2 * Surplus tonnage backloaded to India.\n",

The work of the Electrical and\nMechanical Engineers has already been men-\ntioned in the early parts of the Despatch. I\nwould like to draw attention to a few miscel-\nlaneous points which carry valuable lessons for\nthe future. Just before the crossing of the\nIrrawaddy, most formations concentrated their\nworkshops forward. The necessity for work-\nshop personnel being trained to defend them-\nselves became immediately apparent. Japanese\n“jitter-parties ” crossed the river every night,\nwhile other parties of enemy stragglers, often\nquite large, attacked our E.M.B. recovery\nparties ; enemy patrols laid mines actually in\nour workshop areas.\n\n426. When it was decided to fly 2 British\nDivision out of Burma, arrangements were\nmade to collect their vehicles. Unfortunately\nthe lessons which should have been learnt from\nsimilar circumstances in the Kabaw Valley were\nforgotten, and again it was not appreciated\nthat elaborate precautions are necessary to\nguard vehicle parks. The result was that\nseveral hundred vehicles were rendered tem-\nporarily useless within 24 hours of being col-\nlected because valuable parts were stolen ; con-\nsiderable repair resources had to be diverted\nto make them serviceable again.\n\n427. Another lesson learnt during this period\nwas that when a force is dependent on air\nsupply, careful consideration must be given to\nthe provision of heavy spares such as tank\n\nType of Unit\nIndian Pioneer Corps ...\nIndian State Labour Units...\nCivil Pioneer Force Battalions\nAssam Civil Porters Corps... aes ws\nLabour provided by the Indian Tea Association\nMadras Labour Units ... we wee ase\nCeylon Auxiliary Pioneer Corps\nItalian Auxiliary Pioneer Corps .\n5 (East African) Pioneer Corps\n\nTotal\n\nThis large force was mainly concentrated on\nthe Northern L. of C. from Manipur Road to\nImphal and southwards, and from Assam\nsouthwards down the Ledo Road with the\nUnited States forces. There were, however, also\nconsiderable numbers in the Chittagong area,\nand with the forward elements of Fourteenth\n\nry.\n\n430. By the end of April, 1945, the labour\nemployed in Burma had reached the half-\nmillion mark, of which about half was unregi-\nmented civil labour. Some 53,000 of the regi-\nmented part of this labour force were employed\non building and maintaining the Ledo Road\nto China. The Americans provided technical\ntroops and recruited civilians, but organized\nmilitary labour was commanded by Indian\nPioneer Corps Group Commanders. There was\na British Pioneer and Labour Staff on the incre-\nment with American H.Q., and the arrange-\nment whereby the British provided the main\nlabour force for the effort worked smoothly.\nThe advance of Fourteenth Army entailed close\nsupport by Pioneer units, and there was a\nsteady flow of Pioneer companies from the L.\nof C. into the Army area, especially during\nMarch, 1945. Civil Labour Control teams,\ncomposed of 150 officers who had received\n\n1953\n\nparts. A reserve of essential parts must be\ncreated as far forward as possible by the time\nthe advance begins. There were occasions when\nheavy tank parts could not be brought in when\nrequired, because at the time the air lift needed\nwas too great in proportion to their value.\n\n428. Fourteenth Army took over 30,000\nvehicles into Burma. Although the advance\nwas over roads previously considered impas-\nsable for mechanical formations, only one sixth\nof these vehicles failed to reach their final\ndestination. But the wear and tear was heavy ;\non an average, each vehicle passed through\nE.M.E. second or third line workshops once\nevery three months. An additional load was\nplaced on the EME. by the long road\nL. of C. Replacement vehicles had to travel\n600 miles from Manipur Road railhead to the\nIrrawaddy, and at least half the distance was\nover extremely bad roads. Nearly a third of\nthese replacement vehicles required extensive\nrepairs, and all of them required careful over-\nhaul, before they could be issued to units.\n\n429. It is not surprising, from what has been\nsaid so far of the enormous administrative\neffort which the Burma campaign entailed, that\nthe labour force required was very consider-\nable. As far as military labour was concerned,\nthe Pioneer and Labour formations in the\nAllied Land Forces, South-East Asia area in\nNovember 1944 consisted of the following\nunits :—\n\nNumber of Units Total working strength\n.234 71,872\n59 42,100\n20 20,480\nll 10,560\n—_ 78,796\n13 12,480\n13 4,290\n2 groups 1,520\nal P 480\n242,578\n\nspecial training, were flown into Burma in\nMarch, and they were most successful in obtain-\ning local civilians to work for the Army. At\nMandalay and Shwebo in particular, the arrival\nof these teams to organize civil labour avoided.\nthe necessity of transporting large labour forces\nover the already strained L. of C. The labour\naspect of the development of Rangoon was\nwell handled. Pioneer companies and Civil\nLabour Control teams were included in the\nearliest convoys, and the result was that at no\nstage was the port development hindered by\nshortage of labour.\n\n431. The work done by the Pioneers and\nother labour units was both strenuous and\nvaried. Their many duties included the build-\ning of roads, railways and airfields, and the\nhandling of all military stores at docks, stations,\ndepots and airfields. Pioneer companies took\npart in all the amphibious “right hook” opera-\ntions on the Arakan coast, and they went well\nforward portering with Fourteenth Army and\n36 British Division. They formed, moreover, a\nvital part of the great air supply organization,\nproviding the working parties at both the Rear\nand Forward Airfield Maintenance Organiza-\ntions ; in the case of 36 British Division, they\n",

Large numbers of animals\nwere collected and returned to India, while, of\ncomplete units, it was found possible to with-\ndraw five Animal Transport companies and\nfive Field Ambulance troops to India in April.\n\nOn the veterinary side, the only contagious\ndisease of major importance which occurred\namong animals was Epizootic Lymphangitis.\nEnergetic control measures were taken and\nalthough cases were fairly numerous, the\ndisease did not interfere with operations.\nSuccessful results were obtained from plastic\nsurgical operations, which enabled animals\nsuffering from saddle injuries to be quickly\ntaken into work again with special saddle\nfittings.\n\n433. The efficient working of the field postal\nsystem is a very important factor in the main-\ntenance of morale. In December 1944, excep-\ntionally heavy Christmas mails were distributed\nwithout delay; a large number of low medical\ncategory British soldiers being lent to the Base\nPost Office to meet the abnormal pressure of\nwork. In January, a daily fly-in of all classes\n\n- of mail from Imphal to Fourteenth Army units\nwas introduced, and, from the experience\ngained, it was decided to allot special aircraft\nfor mail conveyance, flying two sorties per day.\nMail deliveries which would have taken many\ndays by road were thus accomplished in one—\nan improvement in service which was much\nappreciated. Free postage concessions were\nintroduced early in February 1945, and con-\ncessional rates for parcels in March, which\nafforded substantial reductions as compared\nwith the old rates.\n\n434. I am glad to be able to report an im-\nprovement in the Canteen Services during the\nperiod of this Despatch, which can be judged\nby the fact that the sales increased from about\n23 million rupees in November 1944 to 54\nmillion in April 1945. This increase is greatly\nout of proportion to the increase in troops and\nwas due to the opening of more canteens and\nthe importation of a wider range of goods for\nsale. There was, however, throughout the\ncampaign a serious shortage of both cigarettes\nand beer. In March 1945, for example, when\nOperations were at their height, the fighting\nsoldier had to be content with a meagre allow-\nance of 100 cigarettes and three bottles of beer\nper month.\n\n435. The problem of disposal of salvage was\ndifficult in this theatre. The policy was to\nconcentrate on the recovery of serviceable or\nsemi-serviceable articles (capable of re-issue as\nfar forward as possible) and to discourage the\ncollection of scrap, which, even when it could\nbe transported, was difficult to sell. In January\n1945, the Salvage service assumed responsi-\nbility for breaking down vehicles written off\nby Ordnance, which by then had risen to many\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nthousands, at the rate of 2,000 per month.\nEngines and batteries were removed and re-\nturned through Ordnance channels, as were a\nlarge number of serviceable spares of other\nnatures, including 21,600 tyres. Other im-\nportant salvage operations included the back~\nJoading of 218,700 parachutes and 180,300\npetrol and oil contamers, both items which\nwere in great demand. Over 15,000 tons of\nmaterial were salvaged between, November\n1944 and April 1945, inclusive ; the estimated\nvalue of which exceeded £1,150,000.\n\n436. Finally, no account of administrative\nmatters in this campaign would be completed\nwithout a brief mention of deficiencies in equip-\nment. These were inevitably many since the\nEuropean theatre obviously had to have\npriority. In many cases lack of equipment\nwas partially overcome by the ingenuity and\nimprovisation of base and field units, and J\ntherefore propose to confine my remarks to\nthe most serious deficiencies.\n\n437. When I assumed command in Novem-\nber 1944 the vehicle situation had become\nextremely serious. This was due to four\ncauses. Firstly, provision action in the past\nhad been inadequate; secondly, there had\nbeen very heavy wastage during the battles of\nthe preceding summer; thirdly, the need to\nequip newly raised transport companies to sup-\nport the coming offensive ; fourthly, the diffi-\nculty of procuring vehicles of lend-lease origin,\nbids for which had to include full operational\njustification and were very carefully screened\nby the American authorities in India and\nWashington.\n\nI had a close examination carried out and\nordered that future estimated production should\nbe allocated in detail only to essential projects.\nAs a result it was found that, provided pro-\nduction and movement kept up to expectation,\n\nessential commitments could be met ex-\ncept for specialist vehicles, especially break-\ndown lorries, the need for which was increasing\nowing to extended Ls. of C. and rough roads\nand terrain.\n\nThe responsibility for equipping units prior\nto moving them into my area rested with India\nCommand. But the industrial capacity of\nIndia was stretched to the limit and many\nunits arrived deficient, or equipped with worn\nout vehicles. This was a constant source of\nanxiety and I directed that a pool of Allied\nLand Forces, South-East Asia vehicles should\nbe held in Calcutta, from which the require-\nments of units could be met as they passed\nthrou, This system worked well and had\nit not been initiated many units would have\ngone forward badly equipped, and it would\nhave been impossible to re-equip 2 British and\n26 Indian Divisions for the Dracula operation\nat such short notice.\n\n438. It became apparent early in 1945 that\nthe restriction of tyre imports to India on\naccount of the world shortage of rubber would\nseriously affect the production of new vehicles\nunless considerable economies were at once\neffected. Tyres in short supply were those re-\nquired for the 3-ton 4 x 4 lorry and the 15-cwt.\n4 x 4truck.* Reduction in the output of these\nvehicles would have had the most sérious reper-\ncussions at 1a time when the increasing mobility\nof operations called for the greatest possible\n\n* A 4 x 4 lorry or truck is one in which the driving\npower is transmitted to all four wheels,\n",

Immediate measures of\neconomy, salvage, repair and control of issues\nwere taken, with the result that demands on\nIndia were progressively and markedly de-\ncreased. Some idea of the effort needed to\nachieve this result may be gained from the fact\nthat, in four months, no fewer than 97,200\ncovers and 51,700 tubes were backloaded for\nreconditioning.\n\n439. During March, complaints were received\nfrom Fourteenth Army regarding the unsatis-\nfactory condition of replacement tank engines\nthat had been reconditioned in Base Workshops\nin India. This situation was aggravated by\nthe fact that we could not await the delivery\nof new engines which were on order from\nAmerica, No fewer than 101 Grant, 47 Stuart\nand 68 Sherman engines had to be delivered\nearly in April, to refit the two tank brigades\nfor their drive on Rangoon. The majority of\nthese engines were in the west of India, and\nit was obvious that they could not now be\nissued without overhaul and test. By agree-\nment with India Command, a senior R.E.M.E.\nofficer was flown to Kirkee to supervise and\naccelerate the tests. By means of special rail,\nsea and air transport arrangements, combined\nwith the fortunate arrival of some Sherman\nengines from America, the demand was met in\nfull and in time,\n\n440. The supply of 25-pr. H-E. ammunition\ncaused anxiety early in 1945, since 500,000\nrounds had had to be backloaded from India\nfor the European theatre. Fortunately stocks\nin my depots were high at that time and supply\nfor the succeeding months was met by back-\nloading from Ceylon, giving priority in manu-\nfacture to the reconditioning of existing stocks\nand iby speeding up indigenous production.\n\nThe only other serious ammunition shortage\nwas in 3.7-in. A.A. H.E., fuze 117. This was\ndue to the increasingly extensive use of these\nguns in a ground réle. The heavy ammuni-\ntion expenditure thus incurred was only met\nby using up all existing stocks in India, and by\ngreatly increasing provision action.\n\nSECTION XXVII (paras. 441-447) Crvit\nAFFAIRS STAFF (BURMA)\n\nThe separation of Civil Affairs Staff (Burma)\nand H.Q. Allied Land Forces, South-East\nAsia; The transport problem: Stores for Civil\nAffairs: The necessity for integration of Civil\nAffairs and Military Staffs.\n\n441. It is possible that no country has\nsuffered more extensively from the destruction\nof war than Burma. Twice has the area which\nconstitutes the heart of the whole country’s\nlife and economy been fought over, and be-\ntween these periods of fighting it was subject\nto a sterile and damaging occupation. As\nCommander-in-Chief, therefore, my responsi-\nbility for restoring civil life behind the battle\narea by means of Military Government was a\nheavy one.\n\n442. When my Advanced Headquarters\nmoved from Delhi to Barrackpore at the end of\nNovember, 1944, the shortage of accommoda-\ntion at the new site made it necessary to leave\nthe Civil Affairs Staff behind. This proved\nmost unfortunate, even though Civil Affairs\ninterests were represented at my Headquarters\n\n1955\n\nby a senior officer. For a very heavy burden\nwas thrown on the former, particularly with\nregard to transport, workshops, signals, and\nthe operation of railway and inland water\ntransport, just at a moment when the Army\nwas seriously short of these services for its own\noperational needs. It was not until the Chief\nCivil Affairs Officer and his staff rejoined my\nHeadquarters in March, 1945, that integration\nbegan and developed to mutual advantage.\nThe Civil Affairs Staff is a military organization\n‘and an integral part of the Staff as a whole\nand can only function properly as such. This\nfact is sometimes lost sight of both by the mili-\ntary Staff proper and the Civil Affairs Staff\nthemselves. If this close integration does not\nexist, Civil Affairs cannot be expected to plan\nadequately, nor to produce their own require-\nments, with the result that the Army in the end\nis compelled to take on commitments which\nit has not foreseen and is not equipped to\nperform.\n\n443. Without attempting to give a full\naccount of the rehabilitation and organization\nof Bunma after its progressive recapture, I in-\ntend to give some account of a few aspects of\nthe subject. How this responsibility increased\nwith our advance is shown by the fact that in\nNovember, 1944, we had 66 Civil Affairs\nofficers operating in Burma. In May, 1945,\nwe had 1,915. We were at first desperately\nshort of experienced men for this work, and\nwhat was eventually accomplished in 1945\nunder the leadership of Major-General H. E.\nRance reflected the greatest credit on all\nconcerned.\n\n444. The provision of transport for civil\nrelief punposes was a matter of difficulty. Since\nno special provision had been made by the\nUnited Kingdom against Civil Affairs (Burma)\ndemand for a total of about 7,000 vehicles, all\ntheir essential requirements had to be provided\nout of Army stocks. By the beginning of\nMay, 1945, some 1,900 new vehicles, the\nmaximum that could be spared, had been\nallocated for this purpose. This transport was\norganized into three groups. No. 1 Transport\nGroup had one company operating in Arakan,\none in the Fourteenth Army sector, forward\nof Mandalay, and one earmarked for Rangoon.\nNo. 2 Group had a company working in\nNorthern Combat Area Command, where two\nmore companies were being raised. No. 3\nGroup had a company on the Manipur Road—\nImphal run, while new companies were being\nraised at Toungoo and Myingyan. Neverthe-\nJess, with only five companies actually in opera-\ntion at the end of the period, the relief supplies\nhandled between November, 1944, and May,\n1945, totalled over 13,000 tons.\n\n445. While the Civil Affairs stores tonnage\nwas small, Civil Affairs Staff (Burma) were\nallotted a tonnage on the L. of C. and sent it\nforward under their own arrangements. As\nlarger areas of Burma were liberated, a new\nsystem was introduced, with effect from the Ist\nFebruary, 1945, whereby all Civil Affairs Staff\n(Burma) stores were demanded and called for-\nward through military channels. The internal\nmovement of Civil Affairs stores, especially in\nNorth Burma, presented several problems,\nowing to the paucity of communications and\nthe shortage of transport. The communication\nsystem developed for the supply of the advanc-\ning armies did not correspond with that\n",

A transport company\nwas raised to assist in bringing the Civil Affairs\nstores from Manipur Road to Imphal, and from\nImphal essential stores for North Burma were\ncarried in transport aircraft, at an average rate\nof 75 tons per day.\n\n446. During the period under report,\ndemands for essential relief stores for the whole\nof Burma were placed by S.A.C.S.E.A. on\nIndia Command, to cover six months’ military\noccupation. Estimated requirements included\nstores in the following categories: food, agri-\ncultural implements, medical and veterinary\nrequirements, hospital equipment, stores and\nequipment for refugee camps, household goods,\nsoap, clothing, footwear and newsprint. To\ntide over the inevitable delay before the\narrival of these stores, a special urgent demand\nwas placed for certain essential commodities.\nThis special demand included food, and also\nsufficient stores for the immediate equipment of\n21 hospitals and 73 dispensaries,\n\n447.

Because we had to enter Burma by the\n“back door” the capacity of the undeveloped\nland Ls. of C. were totally insufficient to main-\ntain the large modern army that was necessary\nto defeat the Japanese. e minimum require-\nments of Fourteenth Army averaged some 2,000\ntons per day. The maximum tonnage that\ncould possibly be carried on the Northern L. of\nC. into Central Burma, despite the tremendous\namount of equipment, material and energy that\nwas expended in its development, was only 700\ntons a day. The balance, therefore, could only\nbe brought in by air, and this fact shows quite\nclearly that the maintenance of operations at\nthe scale finally achieved would have been quite\nimpossible without air supply.\n\nThis air supply was used on a scale greater\nthan in any other theatre of war. Its success\nwas due to the splendid integration, co-opera-\ntion and energy of the air forces concerned and\nthe various ground organizations, all of which\nstarted from scratch with very little previous\nexperience. This success has undoubtedly been\none of the features of the campaign.\n\n450. The capture of Akyab and Kyaukpyu\nand the rapid development of their ports and\nairfields were vital to the successful conclusion\nof the campaign, namely, the capture of\nRangoon. It was only: from the airfields at\nthese two places that transport aircraft, operat-\ning at maximum economic range, could reach\nour forward troops in the railway corridor and\nthe Irrawaddy Valley. Thus, although the\noperations of Fourteenth Army were inevitably\nthe more spectacular, their triumph could not\nhave been achieved without the success of the\noperations carried out by 15 Indian Corps in\nArakan.\n\n451. The capture of Rangoon, prior to the\nmonsoon, was of great administrative impor-\ntance. Not only did it cut the Japanese main\nline of supply into Burma, but it was the first\nstep to enabling me to maintain Fourteenth\nAmny dy sea, thereby releasing the bulk of air\ntransport (now required for essential rest and\nrefit for future operations) and gradually liqui-\ndating that expensive administrative route, the\nNorthern L. of C. The Air and Northern Ls.\nof C. would have been hard put to it alone\nto have maintained our forces in Burma during\nthe monsoon.\n\nIn addition the capture of Rangoon enabled\nme to build up an advanced base from which\nfuture sea, land and airborne operations could\nbe mounted and maintained.\n\nPART If\nSEcTION XXIX (paras. 452-465)\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe Soldiers; Indian, Gurkha, British,\n\nAmerican, African and Chinese: Fourteenth\nArmy: 15 Indian Corps: The Navy: The Air\nForces: Northern Combat Area’ Command:\nIndia Command: The Army Air Transport\nOrganization: General Sir William Slim:\nLieut.-General Sir Philip Christison: H.Q.\nAllied Land Forces, South-East Asia.\n\n452.

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nso many have contributed towards the com-\nbined achievement.\n\nMany Commanders and formations have\nbeen specifically mentioned in the first two\nparts of this Despatch. I therefore propose to\nconfine my appreciation here to the few, whose\noutstanding claims will be sincerely acknow-\nledged by the many, to whom space does not\nallow me to pay individual tribute.\n\n453. First and foremost should be acknow-\nledged the debt which is owed to the fighting\nsoldiers, Indian, Gurkha, British, American,\nAfrican and Chinese.\n\nBy far the greatest part of the fighting units\nin my Command were from the Indian Army.\nT had already had experience of the excellence\nof the Indian formations in Africa and Italy,\nbut the campaign in Burma above all showed\ntheir versatility and ability to assimilate new\nideas and technique, qualities perhaps less\nexpected than the valour which we have come\nto take for granted. The development of which\nthe Indian soldier has proved capable is one\nof the most remarkable features of the war,\nand no praise is too high for those who by\ncommand and training have produced this\ndevelopment. The Indian Armoured Corps\ncame into their own for the first time. They\nfought magnificently, and their gunnery was\nexcellent; their maintenance—without which\narmoured formations can achieve little—was\nfirst class under the exacting test of the dash\nfor Rangoon. The Indian Field Regiments fully\nlived up to the high standard of the Indian\nArmy. The Sappers and Miners Engineer\nBattalions, Signallers, R.I.A.S.C. and all the\nother arms and services did sterling work under\noften extremely hard: conditions. Nevertheless,\nthe heaviest burden fell on the infantryman,\nmore so in this campaign than most, and it is\nthe Indian and Gurkha infantryman, who\nmastered and conquered a fanatical enemy, that\nI should like to single out for special praise,\n\nThe appalling climatic and gtaphical\nconditions under which the carpagn was\nfought were perhaps even sterner tests for\nthe British troops than they were for the troops\ndrawn from India, Africa and Nepal. But\ndespite this the British soldier proved once\nagain that he is second to none. The dogged-\nness which will not allow reverse to become\nfinal defeat, his genius for improvisation and\nhis adaptability to constantly changing con-\nditions were all demonstrated. Separated by\nhundreds of miles, and for many long years,\nfrom all contact with the civilization which\nhad hitherto been an integral part of his life\nand outlook, he nevertheless remained cheerful,\nundaunted and determined to inflict upon the\nenemy the defeat which he now knew lay\nwithin his power to accomplish. And especially\nit was the infantryman again, his hardships\nmore often than not increased by the lack\nof numbers in his platoon and company, who\nbore the chief burden. The British who served\nin Burma have indeed deserved well of their\ncountry.\n\nThere were very few American soldiers under\nmy command, and these were withdrawn before\nthe battle for Central Burma and the dash for\nRangoon. Nevertheless, the Mars Brigade\nfought with conspicuous success in difficult\n\nin the operations which led to the\nre-opening of the Burma Road. It was a\n\n1957\n\nmatter of great regret to me that I was not\nable to retain this formation in the Command\nlonger.\n\nThe African soldier was making history. For\nthe first time divisions from East and West\nAfrica were fighting as complete formations\nwith the British Commonwealth forces. They\nshowed outstanding ability to endure terrible\nconditions of terrain and climate, and to\noperate with limited resources and slender\ncommunications with the outside world.\n\nThe Chinese were well trained and good\nfighters. They inflicted many defeats on the\nJapanese in Northern Combat Area Command\n\n‘ore the were finally withdrawn, after they\nhad reached Lashio.\n\n454, Having praised the fighting man himself,\nI will next say a few words about the great\nformations which won the battles, Fourteenth\nArmy and 15 Indian Corps.\n\nThe great battles fought in 1944 in Arakan,\nand at Kohima and Imphal under the leader-\nship of General. Sir George Giffard laid the\ngroundwork for our subsequent achievement.\nIn those battles of annihilation, Fourteenth\nArmy and 15 Indian Corps found their souls,\nand, whilst redeeming the days of adversity of\n\n1942 and 1943, they destroyed a great part of,\n\nthe Japanese army.\n\n455. After these decisive successes, Fourteenth\nArmy pressed on with the pursuit of the\nwithdrawing enemy throughout the monsoon\nseason. By its close the enemy were back at\nthe Chindwin, and the offensive to gain a hold\nin the dry belt of Central Burma was launched,\nwith the object of bringing the enemy to\ndecisive battle. Following an advance which\ngave the Japanese no time to recover their\nbalance, the wide Irrawaddy River—a most\nformidable military obstacle—was forced at\nfour opposed crossings, and bridgeheads held\nagainst fierce counter-attacks.\n\nThen followed the brilliant Meiktila battle\nin which the enemy was out-manoeuvred, out-\nfought and so severely mauled that never again\nwas General Kimura able to regroup his forces\nso as to fight as an army. This success was\nexploited in the dash to capture Rangoon with\nmechanised columns and armour, re-inforced\nand maintained by air transport. In any\ntheatre such an exploitation of success would\nbe noteworthy; in the peculiar and difficult\nconditions of the Burma war, it was a brilliant\nfeat.\n\nThese are achievements of which any army\nshould be proud; an _ excellent plan\ntriumphantly executed. The troops displayed\noutstanding endurance against severe physical\ndifficulties and fought magnificently. The\nversatility and all-round efficiency of the army\nwas fully displayed in the later stages, when,\nafter many months of success in the jungle, it\nwon decisive victories in open and mobile\nfighting.\n\n456. 15 Indian Corps deserves separate\nmention. The Arakan was an extraordinarily\ndifficult terrain, with its wide tidal chaungs,\nhuge areas of mangrove swamp and jungle\nwhich often stretched without a break from the\nmountains inland to the sea itself. Improvisation\nand initiative were the order of the day. It\nwas a remarkable feat to establish in the short\ntime available both fair- and all-weather\n",

On these depended both the ability\nof Fourteenth Army to make its final dash for\nRangoon and the safety of that army’s supplies\nif the monsoon came before Rangoon was\nreached. Finally it was 15 Indian Corps which\nmounted the very hazardous operation for the\ncapture of Rangoon by the “sea gate,” and by\nits successful accomplishment, to open the port\nat least fourteen valuable days earlier than\nwould otherwise have been possible.\n\nThe operations of 15 Indian Corps and\nFourteenth Army were inter-dependent and\nonly by the combination of these geographically\nseparated campaigns was the reconquest of\nBunma made possible.\n\n457. This campaign was above all a com-\nbined operation, in which command of the sea\nand air was vital to the land battle. The\ndestruction of the Japanese armies, and there-\nfore the main responsibility for the success or\nfailure of the campaign, fell to the Army’s lot.\nBut since we were compelled to do this by the\nworst natural line of approach, and against the\ngrain of the country, we were forced to depend\nheavily on the sea and air for our supply lines.\nThe Royal Navy and Royal Indian Navy\nprotected and kept open the one, while the\n\n.Royal Air Force and U.S. Army Air Force\n\ndominated the other. The Army’s debt to the\nother Services is large.\n\n458. Under Admiral Sir Arthur Power,\nCommander-in-Chief, East Indies Fleet, the\nRoyal Navy and Royal Indian Navy played an\noutstanding part throughout the campaign. I\nwish to express to him the Army’s gratitude and\nadmiration for the gallantry, enterprise and\nseamanship displayed by all ranks and ratings\nunder his command. The series of combined\noperations leap-frogging down the Arakan coast\nwere carried out with limited resources, against\nthe hazards of an exceptionally treacherous and\nintricate shore. I should like to pay a special\ntribute to those men of the Royal Indian Navy\nwho manned the landing craft. It was appro-\npriate that the final assault of all—that of\nRangoon—should also have been the highest\ntest of seamanship and skill, since both the\nweather and the navigational problems were\nexceptionally severe.\n\n459. Air power was a vital element and\ndominating factor in our strategy. The resources\nwere never able to meet the demands without\nexacting the utmost from both man and\nmachine. The achievements of the Air Forces,\nboth those of the British Empire and those of\nthe United States’ were of the highest order and\nour success is due in great part to their efforts.\nTo Air-Marshal Sir Guy Garrod and Air-\nMarshal Sir Keith Park, his successor in com-\nmand, I would like to express the Army’s\ngratitude and admiration for the gallantry and\ndevotion to duty of all ranks under their\ncommand.\n\nIn particular, I would like to pay tribute to\nGeneral Stratemeyer, the Commanding General\nof Eastern Air Command, who had control of\nthe tactical air battle and of all the aircraft\ntaking part in it. While Air Command, South-\nEast Asia was at Kandy, near the Supreme\nCommander, Eastern Air id was close\nbeside my Advanced Headquarters at Barrack-\npore, 2,000 miles away. Inevitably I spent most\nof my time here, and the co-operation between\n\nSUPPLEMENT To tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951\n\nGeneral Stratemeyer’s staff and my own was\nboth continuous and successful, and Eastern\nAir Command provided us with invariable\nassistance and unfailing support.\n\nI cannot speak too highly of the work done\nby the squadrons which swept the Japanese\nfrom the skies, disrupted their land communi-\ncations, and provided our troops with close fire\nsupport which was all the more valuable owing\nto the restricted amount of artillery available.\n\nAir transport was used on a scale hitherto\nuprecedented in modern war. In the adminis-\ntrative part of this Despatch the tonnages\nhandled daily are recorded, but to get the true\nmeasure of the effort, it should be remembered\nthat the air-crews who delivered the goods often\nmade three or four journeys a day over\nhazardous jungle country, often flying in\nappalling conditions of weather ; many casual-\nties were caused by these fearful conditions,\nbut the risks were unflinchingly faced. The\nground crews worked unceasingly by day and\nnight in the open, sometimes in torrential rain,\nto keep ‘the aircraft in commission and to\nenable the very high rates of service to be\nmaintained. :\n\n460. I should like to pay tribute to the allied\narmy forces, American and Chinese, which\noperated under Liecutenant-General Dan. I.\nSultan. Although they did not take part in\nthe later phases of the conquest of Burma they\naccomplished the politically important task of\nopening the Ledo/Burma Road to China. Par-\nticularly I thank General Sultan for his loyalty\nand whole-hearted co-operation throughout the\ncampaign. I also pay tribute to General Sun\nLi Jen and General Liao Yo Hsiang for the\nway in which they inspired and led their forces.\n\n461. On behalf of my own staff, and of the\nwhole of the Allied Land Forces, South-East\nAsia, I should like to express our gratitude\nto His Excellency General (now Field-Marshal)\nSir Claude Auchinleck and the staffs, troops\nand workers of the India Base for their unfail-\ning and whole-hearted support throughout our\noperations. Since India was our base, the\nimmense administrative task of supplying and\nmaintaining our forces fell on India Command.\nThe speed at which the campaign moved meant\nmany alterations and our requirements some-\ntimes necessarily came at short notice. Despite\nthe difficulties which India’s transportation\nsystem imposes, they never let us down.\n\n462. To single out any branch of the Army\nfor particular mention would be invidious, when\nall contributed so notably to the common\nvictory. Their achievements have, I hope been\nmade clear already in the Despatch. I will,\nhowever, mention the Army organization\ncreated to deal with the problems of air supply,\nthe Army Air Transport Organization, com-\nmanded by Brigadier J. A. Dawson, since it\nwas new and achieved such striking results.\nThis is a field in which all have much still to\nlearn. But enormous credit is due to this\npioneer organization, not only for its solid\nachievements, but for the speed with which it\nimprovised fresh methods and strove constantly\nto improve the technique of air-dropping. This\nmethod of supply will, I am sure, be greatly\ndeveloped in the future, and the work of\nA.A.T.O. will have laid valuable foundations.\n\n463.

Throughout the\ncampaign he led his Army magnificently. His\nis the credit for the planning and execution of\nthe battle in Central Burma which finally\ndefeated the Japanese armies. Having early\nsecured the initiative, he forced General Kimura\nto conform to his strategy until he was driven\nout of Rangoon. He made an excellent plan,\nand pushed it resolutely through.\n\n464. Lieutenant-General Sir Philip Christison\ncommanded 15 Indian Corps in Arakan in an\nindependent réle, directly under H.Q., Allied\nLand Forces. His planning, in conjunction\nwith Rear-Admiral Martin and Air Vice-Mar-\nshal the Earl of Bandon, of a series of intricate\ncombined operations, worked smoothly and\nwell, and were a model of inter-Service co-\n\n1959\n\noperation. His personality and drive were an\ninspiration to his troops and played an impor-\ntant part in the success of his command.\n\n465. Finally, I would like to place on record\nthe splendid work done by my own staff officers,\nNCOs, and men at H.Q., Allied Land Forces.\nIn particular I bring to notice the work of\nMajor-General G. P. Walsh, my Chief of\nGeneral Staff and of Major-General E. M.\nBastyan, my Major-General - in - Charge,\nAdministration. During the period on which I\nam reporting, they carried out a great measure\nof reorganization of their respective divisions\nof the staff and carried very heavy respon-\nsibilities. I cannot speak too highly of the work\nof these officers and their staffs, and J consider\nthat the success achieved by my forces was\nto a great extent made possible by the work\nand ability of these two officers.\n",
