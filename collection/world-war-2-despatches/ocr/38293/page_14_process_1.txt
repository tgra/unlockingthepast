39. Kalamata. The first report from this beach was from HERO at 2207 that the harbour . Was occupied by the Germans and that British

troops were to the south of the.town. I sent 

 ashore to ask General Wilson to come on board ORION where he could receive the latest. in, formation from Kalamata as it arrived and

advise me on the military aspect of a possible .

further evacuation from Kalamata.the following . night. At 2234 a signal was received from HERO stating that troops were  collecting on the beach south east of the town, that-all firi had ceased in the town and that evacuation was considered .possible from the beach. At 2240 information was received from HERO that the Germans, appeared to have  no artillery. and requesting .PERTH's Position so that. he could close and report the situation. At 2250 J instructed. PERTH to use his discretion but to make no promises for the following night, , unless  he heard from me. I impressed on him that he was to sail at the time ordered. . However, at 2315/28 I received PERTH'S 2231/28 that the town was occupied by Germans, that

he. had abandoned the operation and was

steering 175 degrees 29 knots with the whole of his force in company except HERO.

General Wilson advised me that most of:the troops would probably be forced to surrender on the morning of 29th April and asked me that 2 or 3 destroyers only should be sent on the night of .2gth/3oth to emibark such small parties as might have moved down fhe rocky coast towards Cape Matapan.
