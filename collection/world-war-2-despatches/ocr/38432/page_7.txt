SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 18 OCTOBER, 1948

13. Having been unable to plot the enemy
movements with the radar echoes, I altered
course to parallel with the enemy, speed 10
knots, thus comparing our speeds and in the
meantime picking out the main target, which
was rather difficult as the longest silhouette
that could be seen was rather low and I was
expecting something higher for that size of
ship. After close scrutiny it was decided that
the silhouette mentioned was the main target,
but heavily laden, a three island ship. At
approximately 0400 course was altered to port.
Orders to attack the main target were shouted
to M.T.B.s 204 and 231, who were in advanced
single port cruising line, and the estimated
speed of the enemy passed—g knots.

14, The enemy convoy consisted of a big
merchant vessel, 6 to g E or R-boats ahead,
two coaster type vessels on the starboard quar-
ter of the main target, and astern were 6 or
more other trawler size vessels. The screen on
the port side, being of no interest to us, was
not observed properly. No outer screen was
present on the starboard side. At 0403,’ I
observed a bright flash and a dark smoke
cloud just abaft the funnel of the main target
and a distinct shock was felt in M.T.B. 202.
Immediately afterwards a siren was heard.

15. The Commanding Officer of M.T.B. 202
had just fired his starboard torpedo and turned
to port to disengage according to his instruc-
tions. Speed was increased—when very heavy
gun and machine gun-fire was opened on us.
Starshell was again used with great accuracy;
apart from the usual starshell the enemy used
floating luminous flares coming down ahead of
us, and several grape-shots exploded fairly
close ahead and to starboard. Although no
hits were received enemy fire was extremely
heavy and accurate, causing numerous near
misses. Quite a lot of fire went just over.

16. At 0426 M.T.B. 202 was stopped and
an investigation was carried out as to the cause
of a misfire at the port torpedo tube. When this
was cleared I ordered M.T.B. 202 at 0443 to close
some lights and an occasional small searchlight
which had been observed in the bearing where
the action had taken place, to fire her second
torpedo. After having closed in at varying
speeds for reasons of wash I ordered M.T.B.
202 to stop at 0451, when radar range was
1,200 yards to the centre of activity, where
three ships were lying stopped. I considered
it unnecessary to reduce the range more as
the targets were lying stopped and an outer
screen of E or R-boats were circling slowly
around them, only 700 yards away, and the
attack might have been spoiled if sighted.
After two disappointing attempts to fire the
port torpedo I ordered M.T.B.202 to return to
harbour as it was obvious that the firing system
was defective.

Conclusions.

17. Attack from inshore has been proved to
be possible at this point of the enemy convoy
route. Close co-operation with gunboats to
create a diversion, strongly enough armed to
fight off a pursuing enemy, again proved its
value, particularly under circumstances like
these where an attack from the inshore side
can be made. The diversion created by the
gunboats is of great value, partly because of
the starshells fired at them silhouetting ‘the
enemy for the inshore attack. Against such a

heavy escort, owewets it = too risky to do so
for a long time. nae the same result as
from starshell it would of great value if the
M.G.B.s could drop floating luminous flares to
seaward in a case like this, not just abreast of
the enemy, but starting from a mile or half a
mile ahead; this making a line of flares which
the enemy has to pass, giving the M.T.B.s a
fair chance to attack. The possibility that the
enemy expects an attack from inshore in this
case is acceptable as they probably have no
time in the confusion to divert their escorts to
their inshore side.

ENCLOSURE 3 TO F.O.C. Dover’s LETTER.

From Senior Officer, M.G.B.s.
Date 2oth September, 1943.
To Flag Officer Commanding, Dover.

I have the honour to submit the following
Teport on the action on the night 26th/27th
September by a combined Motor Torpedo Boat
and Motor Gun Boat force on an escorted
enemy convoy.

General Narrative.

2. Combined forces were stopped in posi-
tion ogo° Berck Buoy 1 mile at 0203. Owing
to low visibility to shoreward and good visi-
bility to seaward, forces moved 14 miles in-
shore, stopping in position roo° Berck Buoy
2% miles at 0250. ngines were cut, and
M.G.B.117 set radar watch, while MT.B.s
kept hydrophone watch.

3. At 0306, some flashing from a blue light
was observed, bearing south-west, and imme-
diately afterwards one large vessel and several
smaller could be seen. S.O. Force A was
informed. At 0310, combined forces pro-
ceeded north-east at 12 knots, gradually in-
creasing speed, At 0314, starshell were fired
over the forces. It could not be seen whether
they were fired by the convoy or from ashore,
oe it is probable that the convoy sighted our
wakes.

4. The combined forces altered course north-
west and increased speed. Force B altered
course to port at 30 knots and engaged the
leading enemy escort on opposite courses, open-
ing fire at 0317. The enemy fire was believed
to be from 4-inch and all calibres below. It
was intense and mainly accurate, especially
from the larger calibre guns. Many near misses
were observed by all boats. The enemy star-
shell also were intense, but promiscuously
placed. The blinding effect of the starshell
and enemy tracer made it difficult to distin-
guish targets. M.G.B.117 observed the nearest
escort to be almost stopped with a small fire
aft, and her guns temporarily silenced. The
Commanding Officer of ick B.117_ assumed
that this had been caused by the fire of
M.G.B.108. | M.G.B.117 engaged this target
at a range of 300 Mesiag and observed several
hits with Oerlikon shells

5. At 0330, 2 grinch (?) shell missed
M.G.B.108’s port quarter by two yards, and
the starboard engine stopped. M.G.B.s, who
were in line ahead, disengaged to north-west
and stopped at 0335 to investigate damage and
casualties. The after Oerlikon gunner of
M.G.B.108 was wounded and his place was
taken by the radar operator. The other boats
