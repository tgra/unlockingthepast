The first of these disadvantages might have been overcome, the second was insurmountable, Therefore, despite the fact that on 27th July information was received that H.M.S. UNICORN, acting in the capacity of a light Fleet Carrier, and four Escort Carriers could be made available from outside my Command, it was decided that the landings must take place in the Gulf of Salerno. Here the beaches were superior to those of the Gulf of Gaeta but the area immediately inland could be covered by artillery fire from the adjacent hills, Further, the roads to Naples led through narrow defiles, which could be easily defended. These disadvantages had, however, to be accepted."
