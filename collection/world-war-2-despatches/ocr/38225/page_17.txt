SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 4 MARCH, 1948

- 48. With regard -to the remarks on H.M.
Ships, I understand that their reports are all
sent to DEVONSHIRE and so presumably none
ware cailed for from me, but this report would
-be incomplete without them.

Very great responsibility lay in’ the hands of
‘FREESIA (Acting Commander T.C.P. Crick)
who led in through the minefield in unswept
water, drawing 16 feet, accurately and stead-
fastly, The navigational responsibility for the
whole’ force rested largely on DEVONSHIRE
(Captain R. D.. Oliver) although the inital
anxiety was LAFOREY’s (Captain R. M. J.
Hutton).

The offensive spirit shown by PAKENHAM
(Captain E. B. K. Stevens) and LAFOREY
ably supported by LIGHTNING (Commander
H. G. Walters) was a pleasure to watch although
I had many moments of anxiety when they were
passing through swept channels, However, I
tealised they knew more of that immediate
local situation than I. .

All three post captains mentioned are senior
-to me and I deeply appreciate their full and
generous acceptance of being placed under my
orders, .

GROMER (Commander R. H. Stephenson)
ably supported by CROMARTY (Lieutenant
‘Commander C. G. Palmer, R.N.V.R.) were the
outstanding ships in the gallant r4th M/S
Flotilla.

The A/S. corvettes performed their task in
guarding the anchorage from submarine attack,
and GENISTA (Lt.-Cdr. R. Pattinson, D.S.C.,
R.N.R.) may have had a contributory share in
the sinking of LE HEROS. .

‘49. The task assigned to the cutter LINDI
was carried out successfully and provided that
one crucial aid to navigation which Captain
D.19, from his report, was very glad to get
at 2040/D-—1. Great credit is due to Lieutenant
A. G_ Booker,.R.N.V-/R., her Commanding
Officer, for his very successful navigation

50. Of the masters and crews of ships of the
Merchant Navy taking part, it is impossible to
speak too highly. In every way they gave of
their best. Their ship handling was superb:
groups were composed of ships varying from
20,000 to 5,000 tons and they anchored in
station in the swept channel as if they had
done it all their lives.

Unstinted help came from all concerned.
Docks Operating Groups were backed up by
ships’ companies; ships’ motor boats were run
as landing craft; stewards, cooks and boat-
swains’ parties and all took their full share.
When volunteers were called for for special
engineering parties, the entire engine room
staffs volunteered including one old greaser who
fought as a cavalryman in the South African
war. :

51. There is one lesson, however, which is
so important and at the same time so common-
place to us all, that it nearly became overlooked.
That is the perfect co-operation and friendship
that exists between General Sturges and his
Headquarters, Brigadier Festing’and the 29th
Independent Brigade Group Staff and my own
Staff. - This was not confined to the Commands
and Senior Officers; but went right down
through io stewards and batmen, all of whom

learnt to forget the word ‘‘ my ”’ and referred.
to the Force as.‘! our’’. This state of affairs
became crystallised when we joined the Flag
of the Commander-in-Chief who turned the
Force into a formidable fighting unit.

APPENDIX,

THE CAPTURE OF DIEGO SUAREZ

The following Report was submitted on 15th
june, 1942, to the Secretary of State for
War by LIEUTENANT-GENERAL SIR
ROBERT G. STURGES, K.B.E., C.B.,
D.S.O., General Officer Commandmg 121
Force,

Sir, F

I have the honour to forward herewith an

account of Operation ‘‘ Ironclad’’ for the

capture of Diego Suarez.

PLANNING AND EMBARKATION
Operation “ Bonus ’” 7

-1. I first received information on 23rd Decem-
ber, of the project to capture Diego Suarez,
when I was mformed that I had been nomi-
nated as Joint Commander, with Rear-Admiral
T. B. Drew, R.N., for this operation, which
was to be known by the code word ‘ Bonus ’’.
The military forces allotted were H.Q. R.M.
Division, 102 R.M. Brigade, 36 Infantry
Brigade, two commandos, and a normal com-
bined operational allotment of supporting and
These included a detachment
of the M.N.B.D.O.* to erect coast defence and
A.A. guns for the consolidation of the naval
and air base. Sufficient assault, personnel, and
motor transport shipping was allotted to carry
the formations and units with their vehicles
on a reduced scale, similar to that used on
various exercises carried out in the previous
year. This Force was reasonably well found.
The infantry bngades, 102 R.M. Brigade and
36 Infantry Brigade, had been water trained
and had exercised on shore over long distances
and with little or no transport. Signals were
just adequate.. All units were tactically stowed
and a minimum of personnel was allowed to
enable signals to function after capture of ob-
jective. The provision of one squadron of
aircraft only, fifteen Lysanders, subsequently
reduced to six, appeared to me a little peculiar,
but the decision by the Chief of the Air Staff
was that this was perfectly adequate for the
occupation of the objective.

Planning at once commenced, and, by 31st
December, the draft operation order, the main-
tenance project, the detailed order of battle,
the allotment of personnel and vehicles to
ships, and the landing tables were complete
and had been handed to the Q.M.G. Move-
ments Branch at the War Office for the
preparation of loading tables and the issue
of movement orders for embarkation. Subject
to the final decision of the Chiefs of Staff
Committee, the expedition was planned to em;
bark at the end of January, to carry out a
rehearsal exercise in Loch Fyne in early
February, and sail on 20th February.
