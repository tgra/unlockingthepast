            "date": "23rd August",
            "description": "was no difficulty in accumulating large reserves in the initial stage, since distances were short and we had both rail and road transport available to as great an extent as we could require. But it must be remembered that any advance would be into a desert, completely barren of any kind of resources beyond some rather indifferent water, and all supplies would have to come still from the same base. This would mean that very large quantities of motor transport would be needed. In previous campaigns there had never been sufficient third-line transport to support a strong advance over a long distance. We were better off now and by 23rd August Eighth Army was provided with the equivalent of forty-six General Transport  companies to carry stores, ammunition, petrol and water, and six tank transporter companies: seven more General Transport companies were held in reserve.* I shall deal with the particular problems of administration as they arose in the course of our advance but IJ will say at once that, in spite of all difficulties of geography and enemy demolitions, the provisions made were so ample and the problems so well appreciated that the rate of development of ports, roads, railways and pipeline nearly always exceeded estimates and we were never obliged to pause longer than had been calcuated for lack of supplies, equipment or reinforcements.",

            "description": "felt certain that there would be no serious German resistance and that the Italians would do no better than in Sicily. This proposal was accepted at a further conference of Commanders-in-Chief on 1st August; we agreed that   a lodgement im Calabria was necessary but. hoped to be able to achieve it without using ro Corps at all. In any case our strategy was flexible enough to allow us to switch 10 Corps - to either objective and this was laid down in a directive issued after another Carthage cont ference on gth August. The relevant paragraph directed:   every effort will be made to seize a. bridgehead in Calabria with the resources available after the allocation of the necessary landing craft to 10 Corps.  I informed General Montgomery on 23rd August that he would almost certainly have to undertake the operation with his existing resources and withon ay caer ae an bigger peat",

By the 4th September an outline plan had been prepared which showed that the operation ;could  be undertaken, subject to certain modificahons, with the forces needed for the assault on Akyab.",
