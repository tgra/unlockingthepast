            "description": "3. On the 7th March, just before the fall of Rangoon, I cabled to the Chiefs of Staff a short appreciation. I expressed grave doubts of my ability to hold Burma, and anticipated a subsequent attack by the Japanese on N.E. India, J considered at this time that an undue proportion of our very inadequate land and air resources in the East was being allocated to the defence of Ceylon. In particular the diversion to Ceylon of a brigade of the 70 British Division, the only British division available in India, caused me concern. Ceylon already had two Indian Brigades and two brigades of local troops; two Australian brigades were being lent to its defence and an East African brigade was on its way there. My view was that if we lost command of the sea and air around Ceylon an additional brigade would be of no avail to secure the naval bases at Trincomalee or Colombo, which the Japanese could destroy without landing, in the same manner as at Pearl Harbour or"

The importance of this bridgehead to our subsequent operations cannot be overestimated; the enemy reaction to it was immediate, and a considerable number of surviving enemy formations soon became committed in the sector."

Progress was slow owing to minefields and road-blocks. Four miles east of Neghelli opposition was met and overcome, and Neghelli itself was occupied at 0830 hours on 21st March. No administrative arrangements could be made at that time to maintain troops in Neghelli, so the column returned to Dolo on 26th March. On 23rd March the Commander rath (A) Division had been ordered by me to do what he could to keep the enemy forces north of Neghelli engaged. By making a show of force in this area it was hoped to delay the withdrawal of enemy forces on the route Neghelli-Addis Abeba and thus to contribute to the success of operations being undertaken by rrth (A) Division in the Harrar-Auasc River area. ' Unfortunately this message was delayed and before receipt the Neghelli columns, which had never  been intended to stay, had been withdrawn. Accordingly, re-occupation was decided upon provided the necessary administrative arrangements could be overcome. A column of 3rd G.C. Regiment less two companies, one troop of E.A.A.C. Regiment and a section of 51st G.C. Light Battery left Dolo early on 30th March and reached Neghelli on ist April. In the meantime, however a patrol of r/and K.A.R. from the 21st E.A. Infantry Brigade at Iavello had already re-occupied Neghelli on 30th March. The 3rd G.C. Regiment remained in Neghelli and the 1/and K.A.R. patrol returned to Iavello. No enemy were reported near Neghelli but local riots were taking place-between Boran-and:Somaii tribesmen and punitive patrols had to be sent out to round up offenders. The enemy were believed to be holding a position in the area Uaddara and a patrol was accordingly sent out to investigate. The patrol returned on 5th April"

She failed to locate it, but succeeded in sinking a straggler, the I-JORA, from the westbound convoy (Q.P.8)  on the 7th March."
