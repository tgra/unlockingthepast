            "description": "156. Once the operations had started and the troops which had been staged there had been ferried to Sicily, Malta's role diminished. The dumps of supplies, petrol and oil, ammunition and Ordnance stores were partially despatched. Supplies of bread, approximately 18,000 Ibs. daily, were shipped from 22nd July to 13th August. Apart from that, little was done by the island except to meet small urgent demands."

            "date": "13th August",
            "description": "East of Etna the country offered many obstacles to a rapid advance. It is a thickly inhabited narrow strip, confined between the mountains and the coast, and the cultivation, especially the walls of the vineyards and olive groves, makes it excellent defensive terrain. 5 and 50 Divisions could make only slow progress, although the enemy had by now decided to evacuate and was seeking only to impose the maximum delay. Thanks to the difficulties of the terrain which I have already mentioned, he was able to extricate a high proportion of his troops, though not, of course, their heavy equipment. The Messina area was very heavily defended; anti-aircraft fire, for instance, was described by our pilots as worse than over the Ruhr. General Montgomery was anxious to bring a Corps into reserve to prepare for the invasion of Italy and on 13th August he pulled out 5 Division and 13 Corps Headquarters to join the Canadian Division in preparation for the new assault, 50 and 51 Divisions continued the pursuit. An attempted landing in rear of the enemy on the night of 15th August, in the style of those carried out on the north coast, was very nearly successful but the enemy were retreating too fast for any to be cut off."

At 12.30 hours on gth August he encountered our forward delaying detachment, consisting of one Company Northern Rhodesia Regiment with one machinegun section of the Somaliland Camel Corps. This position was quickly overrun by three tanks which are reported to have been led round the mines, which had been placed in front of the position, by Somalis who knew their location. These tanks were reported as medium tanks, their type has not been definitely established, but they were certainly larger than light tanks. Since the force at this time possessed no weapon to deal with medium tanks, Captain Howden of H.M.A.S. Hobart sent a 3-pdr. naval gun with three ratings up to the battlefield where it was placed at Observation Hill in the Tug Argan position. On 13th August two Bofors guns also arrived at the front."

The plan of the attack, as given in orders issued on 13th August, Provided for a simultaneous assault by three Corps in line. 2 Polish Corps, on the tight, was to attack and seize the high ground north-west of Pesaro; this was all the Poles could do in their present weak state and after completion of this task they would revert to Army reserve, x Canadian Corps, in the centre, was to attack on the left of the Poles to capture the high ground west of Pesaro and from there, squeezing out the Poles, to reach the main road at Cattolica and drive up the road along the coast directed on Rimini. 5 Corps, on the left, was to advance on an axis to the west of Rimini, directed on Bologna and Ferrara. The movement across to the east coast began on r5th August on a heavy scale and was completed by,a triumph of organization, by 22nd August. 25th August was decided on as D-day. It was not expected that we should be in contact with the   Gothic   line on that date but this was no disadvantage as we intended to press up to and through the line in one motion. This would be of assistance in the matter of surprise. 13 Corps came under command of Fifth Army on 18th August. Between its right and the left of 5 Corps the mountainous central sector was the responsibility of ro Corps, commanding only ro Indian Division and a scratch brigade group, mainly of dismounted armoured car regiments."

            "description": "When the attack opened the forces under Kesselring's command totalled twenty-six German divisions and two Italian; they were fairly well up to strength, for drafts in June, July and August amounted to some sixty thousand. There had been certain changes in the order of battle, At the end of July the Hermann Goering Panzer Division, which had been active in the Mediterranean theatre ever since it was formed, and first saw service in Tunisia, had been withdrawn to the East Prussian front. To replace it Kesselring received, in August, 98 Infantry Division which had been re-forming in the Zagreb area after its severe losses in the Crimea. In August two more mobile divisions, 3 and 15 Panzer Grenadier, were withdrawn for the western front; the two infantry divisions to replace them did not arrive until September. The Allied invasion of Southern France added two more German divisions to the order of battle in Italy, 148 Infantry and the 157 Mountaint Divisions. These were originally in Nineteenth Army but the rapid advance up the Rhone cut them off from their parent formation and they fell: back on the Maritime Alps, coming under Kesselring's command, This invasion had, in its early stages, had the effect of weakening the forces opposing us. On getting wind of the preparations for the assault, which it was impossible to conceal, Kesselring decided that the blow was about to fall on the Ligurian coast. He therefore hastily moved go Panzer Grenadier Division to Genoa. It arrived there on 13th August, but when the real invasion came, two days later, it was re-directed to the FrancoItalian frontier."

The situation in regard, to communications in North East India at this time and its relation to the various projected operations, was communicated to the Chiefs of Staff on the 13th August 1943."
