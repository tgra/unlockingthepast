SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

formations-—-was not lost sight of: Not only
did I need the troops for post-monsoon opera-
tions, but it was also essential to cut down the
administrative commitment in Arakan itself,
so that the maximum tonnage could be built
up in Akyab and Kyaukpyu for Fourteenth

. Our resources, particularly in harbour-
craft, severely limited the rate at which these
stocks could be built-up, and we were working
to a very small margin of time before the
monsoon broke.

187. The next step in the extension of the
campaign was, then, the capture of Ramree
Island, which lies some 70 miles to the south-
east of Akyab. The acquisition of Ramree
would deprive the enemy of a vital link in his
inland water communications, on which he was
so dependent, and furnish us with a valuable
forward sea and air base. The harbour of
Kyaukpyu, at the north end of the island,
provided sheltered anchorage for large ships,
and an all-weather airstrip to operate transport
squadrons for the maintenance of Fourteenth
Army could be constructed. The particular
importance of the establishment of an air
supply base on Ramree Island lay in the follow-
ing facts. It shortened the air-lift journey as
already stated, thus allowing more sorties by
the available aircraft, The mountain barrier
between Ramree and Fourteenth Army’s lines
of advance was lower than that which had
to be crossed in the flight from Akyab, a
matter of great importance with the approach
of the monsoon. The airfield capacity of Akyab
alone was not great enough, as the fair-weather
fields had to be put into action as soon as
possible to relieve the present air supply situa-
tion, while with the approach of the monsoon,
all-weather airfields had to be built so that
air supply could continue as far as possible
during the rains.

188. The plan was to launch a seaborne
assault against Ramree, using 26 Indian
Division, which had been trained, but not
used, to carry out a similar operation against
Akyab, and then to effect a landing on Cheduba
Island, 12 miles to the south-west, with a
force of Royal Marines. The timing of this
operation in relation to the rest of the opera-
tions in Arakan is worth noting. On the 21st
January we assaulted Ramree, on the 22nd we
landed at Kangaw, while the Myebon operation
was still in progress. Three days later the West
Africans (81 Division) captured Myohaung in
the Kaladan Valley. Under such pressure the
Japanese command must have been in no
small difficulty.

189. Strong Naval Forces under the com-
mand of Rear-Admiral B. C. S. Martin trans-
ported 71 and’ 4 Brigades (26 Indian Division)
from Chittagong, and landed the troops at
Kyaukpyu on the 21st January under cover
of a heavy Naval and Adr bombardment. The
Naval bombardment force consisted of the
QUEEN ELIZABETH, fiying the flag of
Vice-Admiral H. T. C. Walker, PHOEBE,
RAPID, NAPIER, FLAMINGO and
KISTNA. For the first time an Aircraft
carrier, the AMEER, took part in Burmese
operations, her aircraft spotting for the
QUEEN ELIZABETH. The whole of
Kyaukpyu village was in our hands by night-
fall. On the next day, the Brigades started
to move south, and, by the 24th, they had
advanced 30 miles down the west coast, to

60332 .

within three miles of the formidable Yanbauk
Chaung. Although the Japanese fought
tenaciously, we recaptured a number of British
25-pounder guns. It was apparent, however,
that the northern part of the island was ‘not
being held in strength. Incidentally, the local
inhabitants gave our advancing troops the
greatest welcome they had had since the com-
mencement of the campaign.

190. On the 26th January a force of 500
Royal Marines, supported by a Naval Squadron
consisting of the NEWCASTLE, wearing the
flag of Rear-Admiral A. D. Read, KENYA,
NIGERIA, PHOEBE, AMEER and four
destroyers, landed’ on Cheduba Island. The
Marines met with no resistance. It had not
been expected that the Marines would be able
to clear the whole island and they were to be
relieved after landing by 36 Brigade (26 Indian
Division) ; but this actually proved to be un-
necessary. The other tasks allotted to 36
Brigade were to capture the small island of
Sagu Kyun, south of Ramree, which it accom-
plished on 30th January under cover of the
fire of NORMAN and RAIDER, who
silenced enemy guns, and then to assault the
southern end of Ramree itself, and exploit
northwards.

191. On the night of the 26th, and again on
the 28th, 71 Brigade made two unsuccessful
attempts to cross the Yanbauk Chaung. The
enemy were obviously determined to hold this
excellent natural obstacle. It was, therefore,
decided to leave a holding detachment on the
northern bank and to switch the axis of ad-
vance north-eastwards, towards Sane on the
east coast. On the Ist February, 36 Brigade
landed on the southern tip of Ramree against
only slight opposition. The same day, the
Japanese in the Sane area were subjected to
heavy bombardment by the Royal Indian
Navy. On the 2nd February, leading elements
of 71 Brigade drove the enemy out of Sane.

192. In the meantime 22 (East African)
Brigade were transferred from Akyab to
Kyaukpyu, thus releasing 4 Brigade of 26
Indian Division for more active operations
further south. 4 Brigade forced a crossing of
the Yanbauk Chaung on the 6th February.
The enemy were now trapped by the
three-pronged advance of 71 Brigade due
south from Sane, 4 Brigade south and east
from the Yanbauk Chaung, and 36 Brigade
north and north-west, after its landing in the
south. They were being driven towards Ramree
town, in the south-east corner of the island,
whence their escape was cut off by the Naval
blockade under the orders of Captain E. W.
Bush, R.N. On the 8th February, 71 Brigade
had reached the hills north of Ramree. There
they were heavily engaged, though a patrol
which entered the town itself that afternoon
was informed that it had been evacuated. The
enemy were, however, unable to stop our tanks
and, by the 9th, they were driven from their
positions overlooking the town—the Japanese
defence, determined as it had been, had failed,
but they made a final effort to break the sea
blockade and extricate their garrison. On the
evening of the 11th February, they launched an
air attack on our two destroyers, which were
guarding the sea approaches. Under cover of
this diversion, forty powered craft left Taung-
up to rescue their troops in Ramree. The
