            "description": "in May, 1941, when’ the greater part,,of the German, air forces were transferred to the Russian front. After May there were a few major raids (e.g., on Birmirigham on 4-5th June, Southampton on 21-22nd June, and Hull on 17-18th July). The scale of attack, however, gradually decreased, and for the:rest of the year, apart from occasional attacks on other targets, the remaining German forces in the West were thrown mainly into the Battle of the Atlantic by attacks on ports and shipping and by heavy minelaying: ‘The position in the Atlantic was still most precarious and the ,attacks made were designed to increase our \"shipping difficulties,",

On 16th July Arezzo fell, on the 18th IV Corps reached the Arno east of Pisa, on the same day the Poles captured Ancona and on the roth the Americans entered Leghorn. The Poles had had heavy fighting at Loretto and Filottrano; it took six days of fluctuating attack and counter-attack to clear the latter and the main attack was delayed thereby till the morning of the 17th. IV Conps had to beat off a final counter-attack on Resignano on roth July, and for the next two days progress to the east of the town was still slow. From the 13th to the 15th the advance was more rapid as the Germans fell back to their next delaying positions. gi Division was the first unit in IV Corps to reach the Arno, capturing Pontedera on 18th July, but on the’ left 34 Division was held further south in thé hills behind Leghorn and first entered the city at oz00 hours on the rgth. The Germans had devoted greater efforts than ever to render the port unusable. The dock area was heavily mined and boobytrapped, all the quays had been cratered and the harbour entrance was almost wholly blocked by sunken ships. By 23rd July 34 Division had captured the southern part of Pisa. All bridges over the Arno had been destroyed and the enemy was firmly posted on the north bank all along the Corps front. Leghorn harbour remained under fire from long-range artillery.",
