SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 16 OCTOBER, 1947

(b) ARETHUSA was sailed to join MAN-
CHESTER and BIRMINGHAM in the Ice-
land-Faeroes passage. These ships were dis-
posed by MANCHESTER in equal areas
between 61° N. 10° 30’ W., and 64° N.
15° W. Five trawlers were on their normal
patrol west of these areas. F

{c) The Vice-Admiral Commanding, Battle
Cruiser Squadron, with his force then on

e to Hvalfiord, was instructed to cover
the patrols in the Denmark Strait and the
Iceland-Faeroes passage, operating north of
62° N,

(d@) KING GEORGE V, VICTORIOUS,
GALATEA, AURORA, KENYA, HER-
MIONE and seven destroyers sailed from
Scapa at 2245 to cover the passages, operat-
ing south of 62° N. LANCE (Lieutenant-
Commander Ralph W. F. Northcott) was
compelled to return to Scapa with boiler
trouble, but REPULSE and three destroyers
of the Western Approaches Command joined
north-west of the Butt of Lewis on the fore-
noon of 23rd May. I had intended to detach.
two cruisers to patrol the Faeroes-Shetlands

ge, but I finally decided to keep all four
in company with me.

(e) Air reconnaissance of all the passages
between Greenland and the Orkneys and of

the Norwegian coast was asked for, as well-

as reconnaissance of forces approaching Ice-
, land. An additional air patrol line about
260 miles west of the Iceland-Faeroes pas-
sage was also established by the Admiral
Commanding Western Approaches,

g. It was desirable that the cruiser patrols
in the passages, and the heavy ships ag well,
should be as nearly complete with fuel as pos-
sible when the BISMARCK was located. The
problem involved in ensuring this, during the
long period between her location at Bergen and
the report of her dep: , was not an easy one,
If the BISMARCK had chosen the Iceland-
Faeroes passage, the cruisers which were sent
to refuel at Skaalefjord would only just have
been in time to intercept her when they resumed
their patrol, The force in company with me
was likewise sailed at the latest possible
moment, for it was obvious that fuel would
become a vital factor before the operation was
completed.

Io. The battlefleet proceeded to the north-
westward until reaching latitude 60° N., far
enough north to be in a position to deal with
an attack on Iceland or a possible break back,
and then steered west. There had been an
interval of 29 hours between the time the enemy
was last seen at Bergen and the time they, were
found to have left, so no accurate estimation
of their ‘‘ furthest on ’’ position could be made;
but the time of their first sighting by SUFFOLK
showed later that they must have sailed on the
evening of 21st May, soon after they had been
photographed at Berger and long before their
departure was discovered.

First Sighting.

11. The air patrols arranged for 23rd May
were seriously depleted by weather conditions.
Two sorties were carried out in the Iceland-
Faeroes gap, the more westerly one backing it
up was maintained only from 1300 to 1700,
while the Denmark Strait patrol did not fly at
all, though I did not learn of this until Jater.

12. The Rear-Admiral Commanding, First
Cruiser S@fiadron, had issued the following
signalled instructions to NORFOLK and
SUFFOLK :—

‘‘ SUFFOLK is to patrol within R.D.F.*
distance of the ice-edge on line running north-
east and south-west. Southern end of 3 hour
beat to be on line 310° from Staalbierg Huk.
The time at southern end to be at 2200 and
every.6 hours thereafter. When clear inshore
NORFOLK will patrol about 15 miles abeam
of you. When thick inshore NORFOLK will
patrol to cover inshore passage. NORFOLK
will make contact with you at 1300B/24th
May in position 66° 45’ N. 26° W. to check
position. Investigate ice up to minefield on
parting company to-day Friday.’’

13. On the afternoon of 23rd May the atmo-
spheric conditions in the Denmark Strait were
unusual, being clear over and close to the ice,
and misty between the ice and the land.
SUFFOLK took advantage of this to move
further to the eastward across the top of the
minefield than would otherwise have been
prudent and kept close to the edge of the mist
so as to have cover handy if the BISMARCK
were sighted at close range. NORFOLK
patrolled 15 miles on the beam of SUFFOLK’s
patrol.

14. Shortly after turning back to the south-
westward on completing her investigation of
the ice-edge, SUFFOLK at 1922 sighted the
BISMARCK, followed by the PRINZ EUGEN,
7 miles on the starboard quarter, steaming the
same course as herself. SUFFOLK made an
enemy report, increased to full speed and
altered to 150° to take cover in the mist and to
make for the gap in the minefield if unable to
round its northern edge. She was able, how-
ever, to keep under cover and to follow the
BISMARCK round the minefield, maintaining
touch by R.D.F. Her alert look-out and the
intelligent use made of the peculiar weather
conditions enabled SUFFOLK, after this short
range sighting, to avoid being engaged. At
2028 she sighted the enemy again, reported

them and once more retired into the mist. At -

the same time, NORFOLK, who had mean-
while been closing, also made contact, this time
at a range of 6 miles. The BISMARCK opened
fire, but NORFOLK retired safely under a
smoke screen, though some salvos fell close
enough to throw splinters on board.

15. This report from NORFOLK (2032/23rd
May) was the first intimation that I received
of the enemy being sighted, as none of
SUFFOLK’s reports up to date had been re-
ceived in the battlefleét. The two cruisers pro-
ceeded to shadow with great skill in very diffi-
cult conditions. There were rain storms, snow
storms, ice floes and mirage effects, which occa-
sionally deceived SUFFOLK into thinking that
the enemy had closed to very short range.
SUFFOLK took up a position on the starboard
quarter of the enemy within R.D.F. range of
the edge of the ice, to ensure that the enemy
could not turn back unseen between her and
the ice; NORFOLK on the port quarter covered
any possible turn to the southward. The Rear-
Admiral Commanding, First Cruiser Squadron,
reports that a third, smaller, ship was thought

Admeealty. footnote:—
