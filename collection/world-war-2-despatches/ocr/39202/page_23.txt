SpeciaL Dury OPERATIONS.

An Integral Part in the War Strategy of
South East Asia.

273. Operations by S.D. aircraft of my Com-
mand contributed very materially to the success
of the highly organised guerilla forces of this
Theatre which, themselves, were an integral
part of the strategy of the Supreme Allied
Commander, South East Asia.

274. In the initial stages, S.D. operations
were primarily in support of our own forces
operating in the enemy-occupied territories, con-
cerning which our Intelligence from ground
sources was exceedingly scarce. In the closing
stages of the war, however, operations by air-
craft in introducing personnel to the Japanese-
occupied areas of Burma, Siam, French Indo-
China, Malaya, Sumatra and Singapore Island,
and supplying them as well as the guerilla for-
mations under their control, grew to propor-
tions which called for the maximum effort of
aircraft and crews engaged on this special work.
Indeed the true picture was that our Liberator
position in the Command was exceedingly
tight, since the S.D. effort was carried out
largely by this type of aircraft.

275. By May, 1945, guerilla organisations in
the Theatre had become firmly established, so
much so, that the Burmese Guerillas played
a prominent part with our Air and Ground
Forces in the killing of ten thousand Japanese
troops during an attempted mass escape from
the Pegu Yomas in July.

276. A brief account of their activities in co-
operation with the Tactical Air Forces is
covered in another chapter.

Control of the Guerilla Organisations.

277. The control of the Guerilla Organisa-
tions in this Theatre was vested in the Supreme
Allied Commander, South East Asia, with a
branch, known as “P” Division, which dele-
gated part of its functions to special staff officers
at various lower formations.

278. Guerilla operations in South East Asia
took on an entirely different character from
the work of the underground forces in Europe,
where patriots speedily organised themselves
as a resistance movement. In South East Asia
the sympathies of Asiatics had first to be won
over to our cause by special agents and leaders,
and parties of guerillas organised among the
iocal inhabitants and often fanatical hill tribes-
men. Aircraft made flights of 2,000 and 3,000
miles regularly on these expeditions for on air-
craft almost entirely did the build-up of these
secret forces depend.

279. Briefly, the Guerilla Organisations
operating in the Theatre were as follows: —

{a) Force 136. This was a British Organi-
sation mainly responsible for raising, train-
ing, arming and controlling guerilla forces
and sabotage teams. It also had a tactical
intelligence role and operational control of
“Z” Force which had a more limited but
similar function.

{b) O.S.S. The American Officers of
Strategic Services had a similar object to that
of Force 136, and also collected and distri-
buted strategic intelligence.

(c) LS.L.D, The Inter-Service Liaison De-
partment was a British Organisation and was

2149

concerned mainly with the collection and dis-

tribution of strategic intelligence from many

sources.

280. In addition to the above, there were also
miscellaneous organisations which had
guerilla functions, and sometimes called upon
Special Duty aircraft to assist them.

Allied Air Force Units Involved.

281. Liberators, Dakotas, Catalinas,
Lysanders and L.5 (Sentinels) were used for the
S.D. operations. The principal units employed
were: —

(i) No. 357 Squadron. This squadron was
the one permanent complete S.D. squadron
in this Theatre. It consisted of 10 Libera-
tors, 10 Dakotas and a detached flight of
up to 10 Lysanders. The role of the

Lysanders was the infiltration and with-
drawal of men and mail by landing in enemy
territory. The Dakotas were also available
for similar landings, as well as for parachute
operations.

Gi) No. 240 Squadron. This G.R. Cata-
lina squadron included three Catalinas for
Special Duty Operations in alighting in enemy
waters. These Catalinas were also capable
of minor parachute operations.

iii) No. 358 Squadron. This heavy
peliber squadron was transferred indefinitely
from 231 Group to the S.D. role, and con-
sisted of 16 Liberators which were modified
to S.D. standards.

iv) 10th U.S.A.A.F. Until the withdrawal
by the American Army Air Forces from the
Command on Ist June, 1945, a proportion
of the effort of the 10th USAAF., by
arrangement with the O.S.S., was allocated
to §.D. operations.

{v) Tactical Groups. By local arrange-
ments between the Guerilla Organisations and
No. 221 Group, Tactical squadrons some-
times carried out S.D. operations authorised
by the Group Headquarters.

(vi) S.D. Air/Sea_ Rescue Operations.
Special Duty Air/Sea Rescue operations were
carried out from time to time by A.S.R. Cata-
linas under the control of No. 222 Group.
These operations were concerned with instal-
ling dumps of foodstuffs and equipment for
missing aircrews on coasts in enemy waters,
and were arranged by “E” Group.

282. As the S.D. squadrons during the closing
stages of the war in South East Asia were
operating regularly at an intensive rate of effort
on these missions, other units were also brought
in to supplement the $.D. work.

Planning of S.D. Air Operations.

283. The training of aircrews and army per-
sonnel to the R.A.F. standards took as high
priority as the operations themselves. Where
practicable, and when the Guerilla Organisa-
tions agreed, the training of army personnel
and aircrews was combined. This was par-
ticularly essential during training for night
landing operations on enemy territory, and
for ground-to-air special radar and signals
equipment.

284. It was estimated that a sustained rate
of five successful sorties per aircraft per
month could be maintained by an S.D.
squadron of twelve aircraft, giving a total of
