salient they had created, in the face of the
heaviest and most determined attacks, contri-
buted greatly to General Ritchie’s eventual
victory.

The Enemy’s Stand at Gazala.

The enemy’s withdrawal from the neighbour-
hood of Tobruk marked the beginning of a third
stage in the offensive. Had the Eighth Army
been able to launch the attack on E] Adem, it
was anticipated that future operations would
fall into two distinct phases, a short period of
attack followed by the clearing of the Tobruk
area, and then pursuit.
orderly retirement, which the 13th Corps,
though well placed, was unable to disrupt owing
to lack of reserves, allowed him to extricate the
Italian divisions besieging the western face of
the fortress without serious casualties, and to
develop and occupy a line running south from
Gazala in some strength. Defeating the enemy
now resolved itself into a matter not of clearing
the country round Tobruk and then pursuing
the remnants of a shattered army, but of dis.
lodging a beaten but still organised force from
an entrenched position resolutely held, and of

‘preventing its escape.

So far, the maintenance of the Army had pre-

sented some hard problems, but it had been,

possible to solve them; henceforward, it became
increasingly difficult and began seriously to limit
the size of the force that could be kept in contact
with the enemy. For the moment there was a
short check in the pursuit, as the 30th Corps
had outrun its supplies. But the plans had been
well laid, and the order had gone out for the
first convoy taking stores for the development of
the port to sail to Tobruk as soon as the 7oth
and New Zealand Divisions joined hands at Ed
Duda. Work on the port had begun, and there
were reserves sufficient to tide the Eighth Army
over the period until regular supply by sea
could be instituted. There was therefore a
minimum of delay in changing the supply base
from desert railhead to Tobruk, and our main
forees were able to take up the pursuit.twenty-
four hours after they had called a halt.

General Ritchie had decided to entrust the
conduct of the pursuit to the headquarters of
the x3th Corps and to send the headquarters
of the 30th Corps back to direct operations on
the frontier. The chief reasons for this decision
were that one headquarters would suffice to
control the operations of the limited forces
which could be maintained forward; and that
the 13th Corps, being already in Tobruk whence
the advance was to be supplied, was conven-
iently placed to assume control at once.
Accordingly on the rath December General
Norrie moved back to the frontier, with orders
to eliminate the isolated enemy garrisons with
the least delay, so that direct road and, event-
ually, rail comunication might be established.
This was a matter of considerable importance
as it was known that supplies by sea would have
to be supplemented from railhead, and the long
detour by the desert was absorbing much trans-
port urgently needed for the subsequent stages
of the advance. The 1st South African Infantry
Brigade was to follow as soon as the 13th Corps
could spare it.

Shortly after midday on the 11th the 13th
Corps began its advance. The 5th New
Zealand Infantry Brigade, which General
Ritchie had ordered to join the 13th. Corps,
moved astride the coastal escarpment, its left

flank protected by. the 32nd Army Tank
Brigade, and masked Gazala where the enemy
had developed strong positions. The 4th Indian
Division was directed south of Gazala on Tmimi
and Bir Halegh el Eleba. The principal task
of the 7th Armoured Division (4th Armoured
Brigade and 7th Support Group) was to protect
the left flank of the Indian Division, but it
was also to send columns and armoured cars to
raid the enemy communications near Tmimi and
to patrol towards Mechili. The movements of
the 4th Armoured Brigade continued to be
restricted by supply difficulties until the morn-
ing of the 13th December. The 22nd Guards
Motor Brigade was placed under command of
the Armoured Division and held in reserve near
Knightsbridge. The 7oth Division was left in
Tobruk to round up scattered parties of the
enemy lurking in the deep coastal wadis.

The New Zealand Brigade and the Indian
Division came up against the enemy positions
on the evening of the 11th December, and hy
the 12th it was clear that the enemy was firmly
established on a defensive line running south-
west from Gazala to the Trigh el Abd. A strong

‘well-prepared position straddling the escarpment

to the east of the Gazala inlet was occupied in
strength by Italians, and another prepared
position on the ridge at Alem Hamza was also
held iby Italians. From Alem Hamza the line
ran due south and then turned west along the
Trigh el Abd; this sector was not so well pre-
pared or so strongly manned, but the superior
fighting qualities of the German defenders and
the superiority of German heavy anti-tank guns
made it formidable. What remained of the
German and Italian armoured formations were
held in rear.

The 13th Corps began to attack this line on
the 13th December. In the north the 5th New
Zealand Infantry Brigade, which had already
captured an important locality on the coast
overlooking Gazala, could make no progress.
In the centre the 5th Indian Infantry Brigade
attempted to capture the Alem Hamza position
and was repulsed, but later one battalion occu-
pied a position to the south-west without opposi-
tion. The 7th Indian Infantry Brigade were
forming up to attack further south when they
were themselves attacked by tanks. After a
sharp encounter the enemy was beaten off with
heavy loss, but no new ground was captured.
Meanwhile the Support Group, reinforced by an
armoured regiment, succeeded in making the
enemy fall back on the southern flank, although
the armoured regiment lost one-third of its tanks
in an action fought to the rear of the enemy
positions.

Realising that practically all that remained of
the German and Italian formations were facing
the Eighth Army at Gazala, General Ritchie
instructed Genera] Godwin-Austen to use his
armoured brigade with the utmost boldness to
strike a decisive blow. Accordingly the 4th
Armoured Brigade, covered by the Support
Group, was ordered to move wide round the
enemy's southern flank. The 5th New Zealand
Infantry Brigade and the Polish Brigade Group,
which General Godwin-Austen had already
drawn into reserve, were then to capture the
Gazala position, while the 4th Indian Division,
assisted by the 32nd Army Tank Brigade,
attacked Alem Hamza. :

The combined attack in the north started late,
but went well. Only makeshift transport could
be provided for the Polish Brigade which was
