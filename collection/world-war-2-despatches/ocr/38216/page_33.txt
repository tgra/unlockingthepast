SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

Two, and sometimes three, attacks were de-
livered by formations of 27 to 54 enemy
bombers escorted by fighters. The main targets
were our aerodromes, but a number of attacks
were delivered against Singapore harbour, the
naval base and other military objectives. Raids
were made in perfect formation despite A A.
fire, and the accuracy of bombing from heights
over 20,000 feet was marked.

341. This continual pounding made it diffi-
cult to keep aerodrome surfaces serviceable.
Kallang was built on reclaimed salt marsh,
which oozed up through the bomb craters. The
drainage at Tengah had never been satisfactory.
Effective repairs were thus difficult. Rainfall
at the time was exceptionally heavy, which in
itself was a further handicap to repair work.

342. To complicate matters further,
practically all native labour, which had many
disabilities to face under air bombardment, dis-
appeared. On the 7th January the Director
General of Civil Defence had appointed a
Director of Labour who was to organise and
control all labour, allotting it to the services in
accordance with an arranged priority pro-
gramme.

There was also an acute shortage of M.T.,
without which labour, and the material for
labour to use, could not be transported to the
places where it was needed. The collection and
allocation of M.T. was also placed under the
Director General of Civil Defence.

Both these measures had become acutely
necessary—to provide and organise labour in
the face of repeated air raids, and in order to
make the best use of limited supplies of motor
transport.

343. First priority for what labour there was,
was given to the repair of aerodromes. The
'G.O.C. Malaya diverted some of his reserves, at
the expense of the construction of defence work,
to reinforce R.A.F. labour parties. Later,
parties of 100 sailors, survivors from H.MLS.
“Prince of Wales’’ and ‘' Repulse ’’, were
‘stationed at each of the 4 airfields in the Island.

344. Heavy attacks on our aerodromes on
the Island had been anticipated some weeks
beforehand by A.H.Q. In order to augment
the number of airfields on the Island, six sites
for landing strips had been selected, and work
‘on them was put in hand on various dates
during the latter half of December. Labour
difficulties slowed up their construction, and,
as will be narrated later, they had all to be
‘demolished before they could be brought into
use.

345. A considerable number of aircraft was
destroyed, or rendered unserviceable on the
ground largely because dispersal points had not
been widely enough scattered in the first in-
stance, whereas, time and labour had not been
sufficient afterwards to rectify this shortcoming.

Operations by Fighters in the defence of Singa-
pore

346. During the second half of January our
sdepleted fighter squadrons did their utmost to
ward off the enemy’s attacks. No. 2r (F)
“Squadron R.A.A.F. and 453 (F) Squadron were
-mainly employed in operations in support of the
-army (paras. 323-330), leaving Nos. 243 and
.488 (F) Squadron in a defensive role. To their
assistance now came the newly arrived
quadron of Hurricanes (paras. 314-316). .

347. The Hurricanes’ first day, 20th
January, was most successful, Twenty-seven
bombers came over unescorted and 8 were shot
down without loss. It appeared as if confidence
im their decisive influence was to be justified.
This was the last occasion, however, on which

* Japanese bombers came over unescorted. The

following day 5 Hurricanes were shot down,
including the C.O., S. L. Landells and a Flight
Commander, against no loss to the Japanese.

348. From then on the Hurncanes were con-
stantly airborne, carrying out 3 to §
‘scrambles ’’ daily. Owing to their being con-
stantly outnumbered by the escorting fighters,
which were well handled, bombers could seldom
be attacked. But with the realisation that
“ dog-fighting ’’ did not pay, the revised ‘‘ in
and out’’ tactics adopted gradually gave in-
creasing success.

349. The Hurricane pilots had been informed
of the characteristics of the Navy “‘ Os’’ and
particularly warned of the inadvisability of
getting involved in “‘ dog-fighting ’’ owing to
the Navy ‘‘O’s ’’ small turning circle. Despite
this, some of them had become involved in
“ dog-fights ’’, which led to casualties.

350. The limitations of the warning system
for Singapore have already been described
(para. 302). Some help was obtained at this
stage from Army G.L. sets; but the short time
of warning, I0-I5 minutes, remained a great
handicap to efficient fighter defence. Opera-
tional control remained restricted owing to the
lack of V.H.F. and to the unreliability of R/T.

351. These new aircraft were Hurricane IIs.
They were fitted with desert oil filters because
their original destination had been the Middle °
East. These deprived them of some 30 m.p.h.
They were not quite so fast as the Navy ‘‘O”
near the ground, but as height increased the
Hurricane gradually overhauled the Navy
“OQ? until at 20,000 feet it had an appreciable
advantage in speed and climb. The Hurricane
could always dive at higher speeds, but at all
heights the Navy “O” was the more
manoeuvrable,

352. It must be admitted here that too much
had been expected of this handful of Hurri-
canes, Civilians and the armed forces alike
had anticipated that these modern aircraft
would carry all before them. That this was not
achieved was no fault of the pilots, who under
$/L. R. E. P. Brooker, D.F.C., achieved, in
the face of overwhelming numbers, results
which stand greatly to their-credit, Neverthe-
less the false hopes which had been placed
in them reacted keenly when they were not
tealised.

353. The average daily serviceability of
Hurricanes from the 21st January to 28th
January was 16, and by the latter date the
position as regards the 51 crated aircraft was:—

17 destroyed (some of them at their bases).
2 repairable at Unit.
7 repairable at Depot.
ar available + 4 more in 24 hours.
On the 2gth and 30th January, 20 were avail-
able.

354. During this-period the Buffaloes of Nos.
al R.A.A.F. and 453 (F) Squadrons were
employed mainly om operations in support of
the Army. Nos, 243 and 488 (F) Squadrons
had continued in their role, in co-operation
