Routeing of Troop-carrying Aircraft.

30. The routeing of aircraft carrying air-
borne troops to the attack was, from the
beginning, recognised as presenting an
awkward problem. Allowance was made in
the naval approach plan, in conference with
Air Plans, for a gap between assault convoys
north of Malta through which the troop-
carrying aircraft could approach and return
without fiying over convoys. These routes
were promulgated in my operation orders.

In fact these attacks were delivered without
interference between naval and air forces
involved ; but it was not until D — 3 that the
airborne troops’ plans became firm and that
troop-carrier command were able finally to
confirm the suitability of routes passing
through the corridor laid down so long before.

These late décisions were in large measure
due to the fate crystallisation of the military
tactical plan already referred to in paragraphs
5 to 7 above. .

31. Later, airborne troop missions were
flown on the night 10th/11th July to the Gela
area and on the night 13th/14th July to the
Catania area. .

In the first instance, an ingress corridor over
a deserted portion of coast between the two
task forces was allotted and promulgated by
signal. The aircraft were to fly inland by this
corridor and withdraw passing to the north and
west of Licata, well clear of the Western Task
Force. In fact, owing to heavy ground A.A.
fire and possibly due to bad navigation, large
numbers of aircraft forsook the route and flew
over the Western Task Force assault areas
concurrently with an enemy air attack. Con-
siderable losses resulted.

In the second instance, decision to carry out
the operation was taken too late to enable
routeing to be certainly promulgated to all
ships. The airborne troops’ representative at
my H.Q. was apprised of this danger at the
time. This late decision in combination with
the unexpéctedly late sailing of a convoy from
Augusta led to a number of aircraft being shot
down by merchant vessel gunfire. In this
instance too, enemy aircraft were present to
complicate the issue.

32. These incidents led to an enquiry being
held by Allied Force Headquarters with a view
to eliminating such incidents in future. I con-
cur in the recommendations of committee which
are forwarded separately.

‘Though not easy, the routeing of troop-
carrier aircraft prior to the main assault, while
ships are moving in pre-arranged tracks and
in perfect timing, presents a clear cut problem
readily susceptible to solution by careful plan-
ning as was shown on the night of D-1/D
day in “ Husky”.

The major problem arises in the routeing of
aircraft to make drops to fulfil military tac-
tical requirements arising after the main
assaults, when the situation has become fiuid,
convoys are being cleared as they unload, and
signal communications are inevitably congested.
It was under these conditions that the incidents
quoted above occurred.

33. The work of the main covering force,
the hinge pin of the operation, was dull and
unspectacular as must ever be the case.against a

passive enemy. Force “H ” was faced with the
Prospect of steady patrolling in waters within
easy reach of the enemy’s air bases, in condi-
tions of moonlight and weather peculiarly
suited to air attack and with a growing U-boat
threat.

It was not until July 17th (D + 7) that the
reduced congestion of Malta and my apprecia-
tion of enemy intentions combined to allow
this force to be withdrawn into harbour at
Malta. In the interval the INDOMITABLE
had, not unexpectedly, been torpedoed and
severely damaged. Force “H” achieved its
object. '

34. The effect of the diversionary operations,
“Fracture "* by Force “Z” and “ Arsenal ’f
by Force “Q” and coastal forces, cannot be
accurately assessed. It is presumed that they
contributed to the confusion of the enemy.
Both were satisfactorily carried out in precisely
the manner ordered.

35. The operations of Force “ Q” patrolling
nightly northward of the landings, were as
nece: as they were unspectacular, and
lacked incident. The torpedoing of CLEO-
PATRA by a U-boat, anl the sinking of a
U-boat by ILEX and ECHO were merely in-
cidents of passage unconnected with the
operational function of this force.

36. The operations of coastal forces, and,
at a later stage, of the American P.T. boatst
in the Straits of Messina were most gallant and
determined. They nightly faced an unpleasant
volume of gunfire and inflicted losses on the
enemy.

37. The anti U-boat operations, both air and
surface, which were instituted as soon as a
U-boat concentration on the east coast of Sicily
became apparent, did not succeed in making
any kills, But the U-boat activity achieved
little, and that this was the case was probably
in no small measure due to the active measures
which were taken to discourage their presence.

The U-boat kills which were made were
fortuitous, notably the capture of BRONZO
by the 13th Minesweeping Flotilla off Syra-
cuse, and LAFOREY’s rapid revenge for the
torpedoing of NEWFOUNDLAND off
Catania.

38. An outstanding feature of the operation
was the rapidity of progress of the left wing
U.S. 7th Army once they were firmly ashore.
The whole of these operations both before and
after the capture of Palermo was a model of
amphibious tactics by the Western Task Force.

In particular, after the capture of Palermo
on the 22nd July (D+12) U.S. generalship
showed that it had nothing to learn of the
value of sea power and Task Force 86 under
Rear-Admiral Davidson, U.S.N. that it had
nothing to learn of the rapid planning and
execution of outflanking operations.

The three “end runs” executed in the ncrth
coast of Sicily saved days of costly fighting.
