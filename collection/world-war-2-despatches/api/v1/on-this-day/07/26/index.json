            "description": "On the night of the 26th July, General Ramsden launched his attack against the enemy's positions to the south of the Tel el Eisa salient with the object of breaching this front and, if conditions permitted, of passing our armoured and motorised formations through the gap to take the enemy in rear and roll up his position from the north. The gth Australian Division attacking southwards secured Sanyet el Miteiriya by first light, while the rst South African Division lifted enemy mines to the south of this point, thus enabling the 69th Infantry Brigade to drive westwards with the object of gaining the track running from Miteiriya through Deir el Abyad. The 2nd Armoured Brigade moved during the night from its position south of the Ruweisat Ridge to an assembly area south of the perimeter of the E] Alamein fortress, ready to exploit success. The qth Light Armoured Brigade, comprising light tanks and armoured cars with motorised infantry and artillery, followed the 2nd Armoured Brigade from the 13th Corps front and was given the task of exploiting further, should opportunity offer. The 13th Corps meanwhile carried out vigorous patrolling and feint attacks to deceive the enemy as to the real front of attack and prevent him reinforcing it."

That. ,Badoglio had declared   The war continues   deceived nobody and proposals for a capitulation were confidently awaited. But the Allied side need not wait until Badoglio felt secure enough to move; the optimism of the early days of the Sicilian invasion, which had become dashed with more sober reflections as the deadlock before Catania continued, was reborn. At a conference at Carthage next day, 26th July, attended by General Eisenhower, Admiral Cunningham, Air Marshal Tedder and myself, we decided  that greater risks might now legitimately be taken. Accordingly on 27th July General Clark, commanding the Fifth Army, was directed to prepare plans for seizing the port of Naples   with a view to preparing a firm base for further offensive operations.  The target date was to be 7th September and an outline. plan was to be submitted by 7th August. The September date was the earliest we could possibly hope"

            "date": "26th July",
            "description": "On 26th July I sent an appreciation on future operations to both Army Commanders. My genera] plan was divided into four phases and described as follows :   To penetrate the centre of the  Gothic  line roughly between Dicomano and Pistoia; to thrust forward over the Apennines to secure the general line ImolaBologna-Modena; to complete the destruction of the enemy forces south of the Po by rapid exploitation across the Po valley; to secure a bridgehead over the Po north of Ferrara, and if possible at Ostiglia as well . Plans for Eighth Army's attack were unchanged and the main subject for decision was the task of Fifth Army, for the weakening of that Army was the chief new factor which had been introduced. General Clark would be unable to produce more than a Corps of two divisions plus for the attack. If Eighth Army was to attack up the main routes north from Florence on Bologna Fifth Army must clearly attack towards Modena, from either Lucca or Pistoia. On full consideration of topographical factors, which I need not detail here, the latter axis was clearly preferable. I calculated that Fifth Army would probably be strong enough to seize and secure Modena but that it could not be called on for any more than to exploit to a radius of some . ten or fifteen miles from that objective. Eighth Army would therefore have to be responsible for the advance up to and across the Po. After bearing the brunt of the attack in the mountains it would probably only be able to exploit to the Po on one axis, to Ferrara, though it would be most desirable, if at all practicable, for it to seize a bridgehead also in the Ostiglia area."

This was undoubtedly the case in the Western Desert, where our armoured forces were appreciably inferior to those of the enemy. Moreover three of the areas essential to this system of defence already existed, namely, Tobruk, Matruh and Bagush; and General Wavell had already given the order to prepare a fourth situated in the defile between the Qattara Depression and the sea at El Alamein."
