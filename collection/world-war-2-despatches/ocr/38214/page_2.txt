4 The question of fighter protection and re-
connaissance was discussed with Royal Air
Force Headquarters before the Force sailed.
The Air Officer Commandmg, Royal Air Force,
Far East, stated that he hoped to be able to
provide air reconna:ssance, but was doubtful
about fighter protection off Singgora at daylight
on the roth December. After full investigation,
he confirmed later to the Chief of Staff, Eastern
Fleet, that such protection could not be pro-
vided.*

Composition of Force Z.

5. Force Z consisted of H.M Ships PRINCE
OF WALES (Captam J. C. Leach, M.V0O.,
D.S.O., R.N.) flymg the flag of Admiral Sir
Tom S. V. Phillips, K.CB, REPULSE
(Captain W. G. Tennant, C B., M.V 0, R.N),
ELECTRA (Commander C. ‘W. May, R.N.),
EXPRESS (Lieutenant Commander F. J
Cartwright, R.N.), HM.A.S. VAMPIRE
(Commander W. T. A Moran, RA.N.), and
H.M.S. TENEDOS (Lieutenant R. Dyer,
R.N.).

JUPITER and ENCOUNTER were under
repair and STRONGHOLD had to be used for
meeting a division of U.S. destroyers expected
at Singapore pm. gth December.

DURBAN was available but, the Com-
mander-in-Chief decided not to take her.

Movements of the Fleet up to the time of Asr
Altacks.

6. Force Z sailed at 1735 on 8th December
and proceeded at 17} knots to pass to eastward
of Anamba Islands thence to the northward.
The Commander-in-Chief informed the Force
that the enemy Battle cruiser KONGO
together with Cruisers and Destroyers were sup-
porting the transports he intended to attack off
Smggora and Pattani and that the landing* was
probably supported by submarines and mining.

7. In signal 2253GH/8 Chief of Staff in-
formed Commander-in-Chief that fighter protec-
tion on roth would not be possible.

8. Weather conditions during most of Tues-
day, gth December were favourable for
evasion, with frequent ramstorms and low
cloud. There was an unconfirmed report of
sighting an enemy aircraft at 0620 on gth
December by VAMPIRE, the machine being
seen for one minute by one lookout only. This
was disregarded,

Between 1700 and 1830 the weather cleared
and three Japanese naval reconnaissance air-
craft in swift succession were sighted from the
PRINCE OF WALES.

SUPPLEMENT ‘to tu—E LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1048

9 TENEDOS was ordered to return to Singa-
pore at 1834 on the gth December on account
of her low endurance.

to. Before these sightings, the Commander-
in-Chuef had intended to detach the remaining
destroyers at 2200 on gth December and make
a high speed descent on Singgora with the
heavy ships only. He considered the destroyers
would be very vulnerable to air attack and
their:low endurance was an anxiety. The
Admiral intended to rely on the speed and
surprise of the heavy ships’ attack to avoid
damage to these ships sufficient to slow them
down, believing that Japanese aircraft en-
countered would not be carrying anti-ship
bombs or torpedoes and that the Force on
retirement would only have to deal with hastily
organized long range bombers from bases in
Indo-China

xz. On knowing that the Force had been
sighted the Commander-in-Chief decided that
the risk of attackmg Singgora was no longer
justified, as the ships would be expected, their
targets might well have been withdrawn and
a very large scale of air attack must be faced.

12. As soon as the reconnaissance aircraft
had been shaken off after dusk, Force Z there-
fore turned to southward with the intention of
returning to Singapore.

13. The situation was however altered iby the
receipt of Chief of Staff, Eastern Fleet’s mes-
sage timed 1505Z/9 at about midnight, which
stated ‘‘ Enemy reported landing at Kuantan.”’
Jt seemed improbable that the enemy would
expect Force Z, last located steering to the
northward in the latitude of Singgora to be as
far south as Kuantan by daylight. Kuantan
was not far off the return track to Singapore,
was 400 miles from Japanese aerodromes in
Indo-China and was considered a key military
position which every effort must be made to
defend.

At 0052 on the roth December, therefore,
the Force turned for Kuantan and increased
speed to 25 knots.

14. Between 0630 and 0730 enemy recon-
naissance aircraft were sighted (PRINCE OF
WALES and REPULSE flew off aircraft for
reconnaissance and A/S patrol.*

15 Force Z arrived off Kuantan at 0800 on
1oth December. No enemy forces were sighted
and EXPRESS, who was sent to investigate the
harbour, reported “‘ complete peace.’’

16. One hour before reaching Kuantan,
Force Z had passed at extreme range what
appeared to be one small ship with a number
of barges or yunks. On finding Kuantan all
quiet, the Commander-in-Chief decided to go
back and investigate these barges before re-
turning to Singapore. It was while steaming
to the eastward to do this that Force Z was
attacked by enemy aircraft.

17. The only signal from the Commander-
in-Chief addressed to his base at Singapore was
his 1455GH/g which he directed TENEDOS to
transmit at o800 on 1oth December. This
stated that 0630 on the 11th December was the
earliest time Force Z was likely to pass through
position 3° 28’ N. 106° 4o’ E. on return and
asked that all available destroyers should be
sent out to meet hirn
