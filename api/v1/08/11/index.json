            "description": "Between 7th and 11th August it became clear . that the enemy had decided to fight the battle of France on our side of the Seine. On the 7th a major counter attack, employing up to six armoured divisions, was launched on Hitler’s orders against the American forces in the area of Mortain.. The brunt of it fell on 30 United States Infantry Division which held the onslaught sufficiently long to enable two American divisions who were moving south between Avranches and Mortain to be switched to the danger area. The counter attack was designed to cut off the forces operating south of Avranches by a drive to the sea. In the face of this counter-attack the Americans, assisted by the full weight of the tactical air forces, stood firm. . : ;",

            "description": "294. To the outstanding success of these attacks on the enemy armour, the weather effectively contributed, not only because it cleared and remained fine during the critical days from 7th to 11th August, but also because it had been so bad earlier. This bad weather had drastically restricted air operations and, there seems reason to suppose, had dulled the enemy into a sense of false security.",
