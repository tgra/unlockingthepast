            "description": "General Montgomery’s plan was to attack up the main road with 50 and 51 Divisions and make a wide outflanking movement through the desert to the left with 7 Armoured and 2 New Zealand Divisions, all under 30 Corps. He was very anxious, however, not to scare the enemy off his present ne prematurely, for a withdrawal would multiply our problems. Accordingly the main bodies of this force were left right back and the enemy observed only with an armoured car screen from 4 Light Armoured Brigade. 7 Armoured Division was forty-five nules further east, the New Zealand Division a hundred miles and 51 Division, except for 154 Brigade on the Wadi Bey el Kebir, two hundred miles behind the front. This, of course, had the additional advantage of easing the problem of maintenance. Advance parties were brought forward to reconnoitre the proposed routes of attack and some artillery registration was carried out. The intention was to attack on 15th January if the enemy showed signs of withdrawing and on the 9th if he was prepared io stand. It was soon clear that the former was the more likely; the infantry began moving off, Pistoia and Spezia on the 3rd and 4th and the Young Fascists shortly afterwards. At this point, however, an unexpected difficulty arose. On 4th and 5th January very heavy gales at Benghazi caused severe damage; the outer mole was breached, four ships, one containing over two thousand tons of ammunition, were sunk and the capacity of the port was reduced by two-thirds. The intake of stores had to be supplemented by road from Tobruk. In order to make up for this while still sticking to the proposed date General Montgomery decided to drop 50 Division from the attack and leave it and the rest of 10 Corps, which he had intended to bring forward to the Agheila area, back in Cyrenaica",

Confidence was raised iby this and by the news of expected reinforcements—British, Australian and American—and still further by the actual arrival, towards the end of January and early February, of the first of them.

By the 19th, Teinnyo had been occupied, and our forward troops were established six miles north of Myohaung.

            "description": "343. Due to the combined results of our own bombing, the Japanese denial measures and general neglect during the occupation, the port, and accommodation facilities at Akyab and Kyaukpyu were found to be almost negligible. At Akyab the main stone jetties and approaches required extensive repairs, and the removal of two ships sunk alongside was necessary. In addition considerable new construction was required. Development began on the 15th January. By the 12th February, seven pontoon jetties had been built, and a fortnight later the stone jetty had been sufficiently repaired to be used for personnel. A new solid timber piled wharf 600 feet long and twelve feet wide was built in a space of six weeks, and by the end of April, not only had a wreck at the main jetty been removed ‘but the jetty itself had been completely repaired, all the stone for which had had to be imported. For all this work, only one Port Construction Company was employed, which carried out its task more efficiently, despite shortages of material. The target set for the development was 1,200 tons daily before the monsoon and 800 tons daily during it. By the beginning of April, the target had been exceeded and on the 3rd April a record discharge of 2,406 tons was achieved. The initial working of the port in the early stages was by 41 Beach Group ut the responsibility was handed over early in February to a Port Commandant.",

            "description": "91. Before going on to the next phase of operations and the Japanese reactions to our crossings, which are described in the next section, I will draw attention to the progress made in Northern Burma on the Northern Combat Area Command front since my last mention of it (paragraphs 43-47). Nambkam fell to 30 Chinese Division on the 15th January. 38 Chinese Division entered the village of Muse on the 22nd, linking up with the Chinese Expeditionary Force which had just captured Wanting, thus reopening a through route from Burma to China. The American “Mars” Brigade were operating in the area 30 miles north-west of Hsenwi, into which 56 Japanese Division from the ‘Wanting area was withdrawing. The main body of 36 British Division (26 and 72 Brigades) was advancing south on Mongmit and, at the end of January, it had teached a point on the Shweli River 18 miles to the north of that place. One detached brigade (29 Brigade) of this Division had made considerable progress down the east bank of the Irrawaddy, capturing Twinnge, 15 miles north of 19 Indian Division’s bridgehead at Thabeikkyin on the 24th January. It then turned due east along the main road to Mongmit.",

During the first half of January there had been little sign of enemy activity against Burma. The maximum scale of Japanese attack was still estimated as one division against Moulmein and one division against Kentung with possibly brigade groups against Toungoo and Mongpan. I admit that I did not at this time consider the threat to Burma serious; I over-estimated the natural difficulties of the wooded hills on the Burmese frontier. Nor did I realise the unreliable quality of the Burma units nor the lack of training of the British and Indian troops.",
