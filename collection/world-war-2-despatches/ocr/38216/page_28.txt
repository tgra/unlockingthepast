To resume the narrative of events

Arrival at Singapore of Reinforcement Conuvys

272. With effect from the 26th December,
arrangements for the reception of reinforcc-
ment convoys at Singapore became of over-
riding importance, not the least factor being
the urgent necessity to maintain the secrecy
of their arrival. This was successfully accom-
plished, it is beheved. .

273. In view of the importance of these con-
voys to the defence of Malaya, G.H.Q. issued
an instruction on the 27th December that ‘‘ air
protection for convoys bringing reinforcements
we now take precedence before the other
tasks ’’,

274. Reinforcements wer2, if anything, more
important to the Army even than to the R.A.F.
All the fighting since the beginning of the
campaign had fallen on the IIlrd Corps, par-
ticularly the rth (Indian) Division, and the
troops badly needed a rest; and as the rein-
forcements contained a complete fresh Division
(z8th) as well as anti-aircraft regiments, it was
vital from the Army point of view that the
Air Force in Malaya should do everything in
their power to ensure that the convoys got
through.

275. Air protection for these convoys was
provided by means of widespread reconnais-
sance sweeps into the S. China Sea, close anti-
submarine patrols from the Banka Straits on-
wards and fighter escort for the final approach
to Singapore. An extremely vulnerable part
of the route was that which lay through the
Banka Straits off E. Sumatra. For the pro-
tection of the convoys in this area, the Dutch
Fighter Squadron based at Kallang was moved
to Palembang on the 2gth December, and again
on the gth January. Apart from the fighters,
operations for shepherding these convoys, for
periods of three days for each convoy, employed
at least 2 Catalinas, 6 Hudsons and 4 Glenn
Martins daily, In addition, during these 3-day
periods, all other available aircraft in the
Command were kept at short notice in case the
convoys were attacked by enemy naval or
air forces. In this situation the absence of
effective Naval strength in Malayan waters was
aggravated by the insufficiency of air forces
to reinforce the Navy, and at the same time
to: meet the needs of the battle on the land.
In these circumstances there was no alterna-
tive but to withdraw appreciable numbers of
out aircraft, and to make them stand by for
the protection’ of convoys when they might
otherwise have been participating in the battle
on land.

276. The task was successfully accomplished.
The first convoy arrived in Singapore on 3rd
January and a second on 13th Januaty. The
_latter included the first brigade of the 18th
Division to arrive. It also contained 51 crated
Hurricanes accompanied by more than 20
Hurricane pilots.

It- is difficult here adequately to convey the
sense of tension which prevailed as these con-
voys approached: Singapore, and the sense of
exultation at their safe arrival, The feeling
spread that at least the Japanese were going

to be held on the ground if not driven back,
whilst many confidently expected that the Hur-
ricanes would sweep the Japanese from the-
sky.

Withdrawal of the Army to Johore

277. But by the time that the first reinforce-
ments arrived the position of the Army had
seriously worsened. On the ‘West coast a with-
drawal from the strong Kampar position had
been forced upon IIIrd Corps by an out-flank-
ing landing at Telok Anson on, the West coast.

and further landings in the Kuala Selanger
region led to the evacuation of Kuala Lumpur
and Port Swettenham on the roth January; and

were back to the northern frontier of Johore,
little more than 100 miles from Singapore.

279. On the East coast, the Bngade that
had originally theld the Kota Bahru area had
fallen back, without serious losses, to Central
Malaya. The Brigade Group defending
Kuantan, which had been attacked from the
north on 30th December, had also to be with-
drawn to prevent its communications being cut.
as the result of the West Coast withdrawal.

280. Thereafter, the Japanese on the East
coast began to move steadily down towards.
Mersing. There had been no attacks in this
area up to the middle of January, but a major
Japanese landing was expected daily.

281. Thus the progress of the Japanese Army
was quicker than had been anticipated, chiefly
as the result of its possession of an armoured
component, its superiority in jungle warfare,
its superiority in the aw, and its ability to
pass parties in boats down the ‘West coast

troops and formed road blocks on their lines.
of communication which proved difficult, and
sometimes impossible, to clear. Our own
demolitions were swiftly repaired or circum-
vented by the enemy; and in general the speed
and aggression of ‘this follow-up came as a
surprise.

Co-operation with the Army on the West coast

282. The heavy commitments of the air forces
for reconnaissance, convoy protection and the
air defence of Singapore, reduced the number
of aircraft available for the direct support of
the Army during this period. But, within the
limitations thus imposed, air action was carried
out on both West and East coasts, increasing
in quantity as the battle area came within
range of aircraft based on aerodromes in.
Singapore.

283. In response to requests from H.Q.M.C.
and IlIrd Corps, ‘action was taken against
Japanese landing parties on the West coast.
Daily offensive reconnaissances were carried out
by 4 to 6 Glenn Martins or Blenheims, un-
escorted at first, but later, after 4 aircraft had
been shot down in one day, with fighter pro-
tection. Five Shark aircraft were moved up
to;Batu Pahat on 2nd January: they also took

“part in this type of operation.

284. Barges off Port Swettenham were
attacked by Blenheims on the 2nd, 3rd and
4th January: several near misses were observed.
