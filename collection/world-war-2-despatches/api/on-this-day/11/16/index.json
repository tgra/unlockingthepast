My Headquarters, however, assumed full control with effect from the Ist May, 1944, with the exception of some administrative matters which were more conveniently handled by G.H.Q. India."

By this date, also, the enemy had been cleared from the area north of Kamaing, Mogaung and Myitkyina by the ChineseAmerican forces under General Stilwell,t and a re-adjustment of our dispositions to meet monsoon conditions had been made in Arakan. Thus a definite phase of the campaign may be said to have ended. The Despatch also gives an account of the administrative situation and certain major changes in our organization during the period."

Hardly had this excitement died down when a search in the Jewish settlement of Hulda, for Polish deserters, uncovered a cache of weapons, and on 16th November another search with the same purpose in the village of Ramat Hakovesh resulted in a fracas. This was followed by a campaign of misrepresentation and threats on the part of the Jewish Agency, which left no doubt that any future searches would be met with strong resistance. The policy in regard to searches, reaffirmed in 1943, has been that only if reliable information is received should searches be made, and then with particular care to avoid any incidents. After this search, His Excellency the High Commissioner informed the General Officer Commanding in Palestine that for political reasons it was regarded as most important that action likely to lead to major incidents with the Jewish population should be avoided at the present.time,"

There was an even more pressing reason for capturing the coastal group of landing grounds. No convoys had sailed to Malta since the previous April owing to the impossibility of providing air protection and the garrison and people of the island were now on the verge of starvation. The situation would be beyond control unless a convoy putting out from Alexandria on 16th November arrived safely and of that there was little hope without strong fighter protection from the coast of Cyrenaica. It might very well have proved impossible to supply any further advance, seeing that 10 Corps had advanced two hundred and twenty miles in six days and that heavy demolitions had been carried out both on the road and the railway. But the administrative arrangements stood the strain, stores were landed at Sollum and the harbours of Matruh and Bardia were opened within two days of their capture so  fat enough supphes were available to allow y Light Armoured Brigade to continue.

By the evening of 16th November they had reported Mechili clear and were operating within forty miles of Msus. Rain now began to fall again and it took the two columns twenty-four hours to struggle through sixty miles of waterlogged ground to the escarpment which  the enemy rearguard was holding to cover the evacuation of Benghazi. On 18th November they engaged the rearguard at Sceleidima and Antelat, the two main passes in the escarpment, but were unable to force their way past. During the night the enemy withdrew and the advance of the two columns was again delayed by bad going. On the zoth xr Hussars entered Benghazi* and found the town and neighbourhood clear of enemy, and it was not until midday of the 21st that the Royals made touch with the enemy rearguard again at Agedabia. The admunistrative position was now becoming easier and the vanguard of 22 Armoured Brigade, having raced across two hundred and sixty miles of desert, at once began to turn the enemy's flank. Thus threatened he lost no time in abandoning Agedabia. The road southwards was heavily mined and the advance was much impeded; but by 25th November patrols were in contact with the next enemy position at Agheila. The whole of Cyrenaica was now in our hands."

On rrth November, while the New Zealand Division was occupying the frontier area, our fight rs caught up with the enemy air force and had a specially successful day, shooting down enemy aircraft not only over the frontier but also on the enemy's own landing grounds at Gambut and El Adem. By the 13th our own aircraft were based on these same two airfields, bombing and machine-gunning enemy transport in the Gebel Akhdar. On the same day two squadrons of fighters made a bold move, completely by air transport, to a landing ground only a hundred and eighty mules east of Agedabia; well ahead and to the south of our forward troops, and inflicted considerable damage on the enemy's columns retreating tourid the bend of the Gulf of Sirte. By 16th November the main fighter force was operating from Gazala and destroyed thirty-seven enemy transport aircraft by the use of which the enemy was desperately trying to relieve his fuel shortage. After this the air force, like the main body of the Army, was temporarily chained to the Tobruk area until the supply situation improved and for a few days enemy aircraft were able to attack our light columns in the desert on a scale to which we had long been unused. By 26th November, however, two wings of fighters were established at Msus and our air superiority over the forward area was restored."
