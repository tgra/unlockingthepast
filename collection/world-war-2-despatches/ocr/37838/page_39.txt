370. Our rapid advance through France
forced the enemy to abandon his launching sites
in the Pas de Calais; in consequence fhere was
no fiying bomb activity over the United King-
dom after the oth September for a period of
ten days. When it recommenced, the launch-
ing was from carrier aircraft, chiefly Heinkel
III, operating over the North Sea. The scale
of activity of these air-launched flying bombs
was never heavy; nevertheless a fully organised

defence scheme, involving nine squadrons of
fighters, had to be maintained to combat the
menace.

372. It is very difficult to estimate the suc-
cess of these counter attacks; the number of

flying bombs launched per day varied con-.

siderably, as also did the number and location
of the sites used. It can, however, be stated
that these attacks hampered and kept in check
the launching rate; the average number launched
per day over the period 13th June to 31st
August was 95 against the estimated possible
number of 6,000 per day, had the German plan
not been upset by Allied bombing. It has
already been noted that the air bombing in
the preparatory period was so successful in
countering the enemy’s preparations for the use
of the flying bomb, that it was no longer a
direct threat to the preparations for, or the
carrying out of the Allied assault and subse-
quent land operations. In the event, the flying
bomb was launched mainly as a “‘ terror”
weapon against the civilian population of
Southern England and not as a counter to the
plans for the invasion of the Continent. I do not
propose, therefore, to make any wider comment
beyond emphasising the cost to the invasion
operations by virtue of the diversion of avail-
able air effort that had to be made in order
to secure this degree of immunity. An indica-
tion of the scale of this diversion is given by
the statistics in the paragraphs above. Another
less calculable cost was the fact that a number
of Tempest and Mustang fighters—which had
been allocated to re-arm squadrons in Second
British Tactical Air Force—had to be trans-
ferred to A.D.G.B. for duties on flying bomb
interception patrols. We thus lost the use of
these very valuable and latest type of fighters
over the battlefront.

Operation ‘‘ Market ’’—First Allied Airborne
Army,

373. On r7th September, airborne forces of
the First Allied Airborne Army, comprising
United States 82nd and xrorst Airborne Divi-
sions, st British Airborne Division and a Polish
Parachute Brigade were dropped and landed in
the Eindhoven—Nijmegen—Arnhem areas of
Holland. The lift of these airborne forces ex-
ceeded that made during the initial landings on
the Continent. The operation was designed to
facilitate an advance by the northern group of
armies up to and over the rivers Waal and
Lower Rhine. With this end in view, the chief
objectives of the airborne troops were the
bridges at Arnhem and Nijmegen.

374. The initial drops were successful, being
carried out accurately and with very few casual-
ties. During the subsequent nine days, as
weather permitted, reinforcements and supplies
were flown in to the airborne troops and
to the supporting ground troops which had
linked up with them. Despite an heroic
struggle: by the troops of the ist British
Airborne Division the bridge at Arnhem,
although secured initially, could not be
retained. The bridge at Nijmegen, however,
was secured and the operation paved the way
for a subsequent advance up to the river Waal
and beyond. It provided many lessons for the
future and marked a definite step in the evolu-
tion of airborne operations.

375. The planning for and execution of these
operations, which were carried out under the
code name “‘ Market ’’, was the work of the
First Allied Airborne Army, to which the opera-
