(c) The Y.M.C.A., which had remained
open throughout the battle, also had an
average daily attendance of a thousand. IJ
wish to pay tribute to the Reverend Walter
Corbett and his wife for the devoted service
they rendered to the troops.

@ I also wish to mention the splendid
work of the Women’s Auxiliary Service
(Burma). This Service operated mobile and
static canteens in the forward areas and on
many occasions worked right up with the
leading formations. The value to morale
of a women’s service operating canteens in
the interests of the troops in forward areas
and under monsoon conditions was in-
estimable.

160. Indian Troops. The discipline and
fighting spirit of Indian troops has been
throughout of the highest quality.

The re-opening of leave on a large scale, and
the improvement in economic conditions in
the villages, did much to relieve the Indian
soldier's mind, but there are still complaints
of the irregularities of the postal services, the
failings of the family allotment system and
graft and exploitation by petty local officials.

The Commander-in-Chief, India, has taken
all possible steps to put these matters right.

161. African Troops. The morale of both
East and West African troops has been satis-
factory. They require more training. i
to the shortage of formations, they had to be
committed to action before they were entirely
ready for war.

Supplies, Transport and Maintenance.

162. Movements and Transportation. A full
description of the lines of communication was
given in my first Despatch. The main tasks
of the Movements and Transportation Direc-
torates during the period of this Despatch
were: —

(@) The maintenance of Fourteenth Army
in Assam and.

(6) The building up of stocks on both the
Imphal and Arakan fronts for the post-
monsoon offensive.

(c} The movement of formations under
the relief programme.

163. Tonnages Handled. (a) Assam Line
of Communication. The average monthly
tonnage of stores for Fourteenth Army,
excluding P.O.L., carried between June and
November was 31,200, an increase of some
3,000 tons over the monthly average for
the previous six months. This increase was
creditable in view of the difficulties caused by
the monsoon. The completion in August of
the American 6-inch pipeline from Calcutta to
Dibrugarh has released wagons needed
formerly for aviation spirit. I hope that the
Assam line of communication will now be able
to carry all the traffic, and that the tonnage
which can be handled in railheads and depots
will be the limiting factor, rather than the
capacity of the river, rail and road systems of
the lines of communication.

(@) Chittagong Port.

The average monthly import of stores, ex-
cluding bulk P.O.L., was 51,000 tons. This
figure is lower by 10,000 tons than the

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 3951

average of the previous three months, and is.
explained by the smaller number of ships using.
the port. On the other hand, the average.
tonnage discharged per ship per day increased.
(c) Arakan Ports.

The average monthly imports into Cox’s.
Bazaar, Ultaklali and Maungdaw totalled
23,600 tons, which was an increase of 4,500:
tons over the average of the previous three.
months. This increase in tonnage, m spite of
the difficulties of working in the monsoon at.
these small ports, is noteworthy.

164. Opening of Maungdaw Port. A new
channel into the mouth of the Naf River was.
discovered, and it was found possible to bring.
ocean-going ships for the first time to
Maungdaw. This saved much overland trans-
port. .

165. Monsoon Reliefs. The following is a
summary of the major moves completed, or in
process during the monsoon :—

(a) Divisions.

{i) One division from Assam to India.
Gi) One division from Ceylon to Assam.
(iii) One division from India to Assam.
(iv) One division from India to Arakan.

(b) Brigades.

G) Six brigades from Assam to India.
Gi) One brigade from Arakan to India.
Gii) One brigade from India to Assam.
(iv) Two brigades from India to Arakan.
(v) One brigade from Ceylon to Assam.
(vi) One brigade from Ceylon to Arakan.

The details of these moves are given in
Appendix “A”, as the times and methods are
interesting and instructive.

166. An interesting experiment in transpor-
tation was the use made of “jeep trains” by
36 British Division in their advance down the
railway.

This new method of haulage was first tried
in July on the Myitkyina - Mogaung section of
the line, as no locomotives were available. It
was found that a jeep, fitted with flanged
wheels, could draw some 40 tons of freight
and “jeep trains” have since formed part of
the transportation organization in that area.

167. Air Supply. When discussing “ Organi-
zation” in my first Despatch, I stated the
need for a permanent organization to handle
the movement by air of troops and supplies,
and I mentioned that my proposals were,
at that time, being considered by the
Air Commander-in-Chief, South-East Asia
Command, and the Commander-in-Chief,
India. The last six months has seen the
birth of the Army Air Transport Organi-
zation, with headquarters at Comilla along-
side the recently formed Headquarters, Combat
Cargo Task Force. These two Head-
quarters, the one Military and the other
RAF, and U.S.A.AF., worked as a whole,
the Army staff being under command of 11
Army Group and the Air staff under Eastern
Air Command. The main duties of the Com-
mander of this new organization were :—

(a) To control ail the Rear Airfield Main-
tenance Organizations in South-East Asia
Command.

(6) To ensure that the requirements of
forward formations for air supply or air
