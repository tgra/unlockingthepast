            "description": "meant a further reorganisation of my force and a readjustment of my slender resources. Although very few reinforcements had arrived as yet, and my pilots and air crews were beginning to feel the strain of heavy and continuous operations throughout the winter months, an additional burden was now thrust upon us. I still had to provide air support for the Greeks who were being ferociously attacked in Albania by the Italians, spurred on by the presence of Mussolini himself. I had to provide air escorts for incoming convoys, also some form of air defence for the ports of disembarkation of British troops which were becoming alarmingly congested. I had to deliver occasional attacks on the Dodecanese Islands to reduce the scale of enemy attacks on convoys which were becoming embarrassingly frequent, and finally, I had to allocate a portion of my force to support the position in process of occupation by British troops. I attach as Appendix   A  * to this report a memorandum which I issued on 18th March, pointing out the very parlcus condition we were in at that time and describing how I proposed to attempt an almost impossible task. Apart from the fact that all my squadrons were much below strength in serviceable aircraft, due to the heavy casualties we had suffered and the unavoidable inability to keep us supplied with replacements, the re-equipping of my fighter squadrons with Hurricanes was not proceeding as rapidly as I had hoped. Furthenmore, the arrival of reinforcing squadrons was not keeping pace with the programme decided upon and those that did arrive were much below establishment in aircraft and equipment. In spite of these difficulties and disappointments, however, I still hoped that time would be on our side and that, when the German attack developed, we would ibe in a reasonable state of preparedness to meet it."

            "description": "5. Embarkation of vehicles and stores in the four assault ships was to commence on 18th March, and all planning had to be completed to this schedule. After examination of the new intelligence available, which did not as yet include the air photographs, we decided that our previous plans were sound and could be carried out with the reduced forces available. On the military side, new topographical information suggested that the beaches were far better than was originally reported, The postPponement of the operation from April to May placed it at the beginning of the dry season, which considerably reduced anticipated difficulties of advance along the only. very doubtful, road which was available. Thanks to this  and   Bonus   Captain Garnons-Wilhams and myself were able to meet Brigadier Festing and Brigadier G. W. B. Tarleton, commanding 29 Independent Brigade and 17 Infantry Brigade respectively, and my advisers and heads of services, all of whom arrived in London on the morning of 15th March, with a completed outline-plan and an outline draft of the Force operation order."

These were all essential preliminaries to the launching of a major, assault towards Tunis and Bizerta. To help 5 Corps I placed x Parachute Brigade, the Corps Franc and one Tabor of French Goumiers under their orders."
