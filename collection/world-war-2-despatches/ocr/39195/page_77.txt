SUPPLEMENT To THe LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

so many have contributed towards the com-
bined achievement.

Many Commanders and formations have
been specifically mentioned in the first two
parts of this Despatch. I therefore propose to
confine my appreciation here to the few, whose
outstanding claims will be sincerely acknow-
ledged by the many, to whom space does not
allow me to pay individual tribute.

453. First and foremost should be acknow-
ledged the debt which is owed to the fighting
soldiers, Indian, Gurkha, British, American,
African and Chinese.

By far the greatest part of the fighting units
in my Command were from the Indian Army.
T had already had experience of the excellence
of the Indian formations in Africa and Italy,
but the campaign in Burma above all showed:
their versatility and ability to assimilate new
ideas and technique, qualities perhaps less
expected than the valour which we have come
to take for granted. The development of which
the Indian soldier has proved capable is one
of the most remarkable features of the war,
and no praise is too high for those who by
command and training have produced this
development. The Indian Armoured Corps
came into their own for the first time. They
fought magnificently, and their gunnery was
excellent; their maintenance—without which
armoured formations can achieve little—was
first class under the exacting test of the dash
for Rangoon. The Indian Field Regiments fully
lived up to the high standard of the Indian
Army. The Sappers and Miners Engineer
Battalions, Signallers, R.I.A.S.C. and all the
other arms and services did sterling work under
often extremely hard: conditions. Nevertheless,
the heaviest burden fell on the infantryman,
more so in this campaign than most, and it is
the Indian and Gurkha infantryman, who
mastered and conquered a fanatical enemy, that
I should like to single out for special praise,

The appalling climatic and gtaphical
conditions under which the aceon was
fought were perhaps even sterner tests for
the British troops than they were for the troops
drawn from India, Africa and Nepal. But
despite this the British soldier proved once
again that he is second to none. The dogged-
ness which will not allow reverse to become
final defeat, his genius for improvisation and
his adaptability to constantly changing con-
ditions were all demonstrated. Separated by
hundreds of miles, and for many long years,
from all contact with the civilization which
had hitherto been an integral part of his life
and outlook, he nevertheless remained cheerful,
undaunted and determined to inflict upon the
enemy the defeat which he now knew lay
within his power to accomplish. And especially
it was the infantryman again, his hardships
more often than not increased by the lack
of numbers in his platoon and company, who
bore the chief burden. The British who served
in Burma have indeed deserved well of their
country.

There were very few American soldiers under
my command, and these were withdrawn before
the battle for Central Burma and the dash for
Rangoon. Nevertheless, the Mars Brigade
fought with conspicuous success in difficult

in the operations which led to the
re-opening of the Burma Road. It was a

1957

matter of great regret to me that I was not
able to retain this formation in the Command
longer.

The African soldier was making history. For
the first time divisions from East and West
Africa were fighting as complete formations
with the British Commonwealth forces. They
showed outstanding ability to endure terrible
conditions of terrain and climate, and to
operate with limited resources and slender
communications with the outside world.

The Chinese were well trained and good
fighters. They inflicted many defeats on the
Japanese in Northern Combat Area Command
before the were finally withdrawn, after they
had reached Lashio.

454, Having praised the fighting man himself,
I will next say a few words about the great
formations which won the battles, Fourteenth
Army and 15 Indian Corps.

The great battles fought in 1944 in Arakan,
and at Kohima and Imphal under the leader-
ship of General. Sir George Giffard laid the
groundwork for our subsequent achievement.
In those battles of annihilation, Fourteenth
Army and 15 Indian Corps found their souls,
and, whilst redeeming the days of adversity of

1942 and 1943, they destroyed a great part of,

the Japanese army.

455. After these decisive successes, Fourteenth
Army pressed on with the pursuit of the
withdrawing enemy throughout the monsoon
season. By its close the enemy were back at
the Chindwin, and the offensive to gain a hold
in the dry belt of Central Burma was launched,
with the object of bringing the enemy to
decisive battle. Following an advance which
gave the Japanese no time to recover their
balance, the wide Irrawaddy River—a most
formidable military obstacle—was forced at
four opposed crossings, and bridgeheads held
against fierce counter-attacks.

Then followed the brilliant Meiktila battle
in which the enemy was out-manoeuvred, out-
fought and so severely mauled that never again
was General Kimura able to regroup his forces
so as to fight as an army. This success was
exploited in the dash to capture Rangoon with
mechanised columns and armour, re-inforced
and maintained by air transport. In any
theatre such an exploitation of success would
be noteworthy; in the peculiar and difficult
conditions of the Burma war, it was a brilliant
feat.

These are achievements of which any army
should be proud; an _ excellent plan
triumphantly executed. The troops displayed
outstanding endurance against severe physical
difficulties and fought magnificently. The
versatility and all-round efficiency of the army
wags fully displayed in the later stages, when,
after many months of success in the jungle, it
won decisive victories in open and mobile
fighting.

456. 15 Indian Corps deserves separate
mention. The Arakan was an extraordinarily
difficult terrain, with its wide tidal chaungs,
huge areas of mangrove swamp and jungle
which often stretched without a break from the
mountains inland to the sea itself. Improvisation
and initiative were the order of the day. It
was a remarkable feat to establish in the short
time available both fair- and all-weather
