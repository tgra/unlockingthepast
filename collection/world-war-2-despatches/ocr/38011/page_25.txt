SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON

+ 75. Arrangements were therefore made to
send two destroyers to embark 500 men each
at 2300 hrs. 2gth May and three destroyers
on each of the two succeeding nights 30th and
31st May, to embark two further parties of
1,500 men each. Early on 26th May when the
orders to prepare for the evacuation reached
Brigadier Gubbins, the main position held by
his Force was -some 40 miles from Bodo, in
the neighbourhood of Fauske.

Orders were issued by Brigadier Gubbins for
two Independent Companies and administrative
details to concentrate at Bodo at once and for
the withdrawal from the position north of
Fauske to start next day.

76. The general plan was that the 1st Bn.
Trish Guards and three Independent Companies,
which were all under the command of Lt.-Col.
Stockwell, should withdraw from the position
held north of Fauske and pass through the
Scots Guards who were to be placed in position
on a neck of land between the sea and a lake
near Hopen. ‘

Having passed through the Scots Guards the
Irish Guards and the Independent Companies
were to move straight to Bodo and embark.

The third battalion of the 24th Guards
Brigade, namely the znd Bn. The South Wales
Borderers, was to be placed in position across
the Bodo peninsula further to the west astride
Lake Soloi.

The withdrawal of the Irish Guards and the
Independent Companies was carried out with-
out interference from the enemy’s land forces,
though the rear party passed through the Hopen
position less than an hour before the enemy’s
advanced troops, consisting of cyclists and
machine guns, made contact with the Scots
Guards.

The enemy were at once engaged and the
bridge at Hopen was destroyed. This checked
the pursuit and the Germans made no move-
ment during the next day.

During the withdrawal on the last night the
enemy again followed up with cyclists and
machine guns, but no serious pressure
developed and no delay occurred,

One company from the Scots Guards and
one company from the South Wales Borderers
with four 25-pr. guns were placed in position
some 4 kilometres east of the town and formed
the final rearguards. These companies with-
drew to the quay without difficulty by
previously reconnoitred routes.

* 497, Daring the three days covering the period
of the re-embarkation several bombing attacks
were carried out ‘by the enemy on Bodo and its
vicinity, but during none of the three periods
when the actual embarkation of troops was in
progress was there any interference from enemy
aircraft in spite of the fact that there
was continual daylight. This was probably due
to unfavourable flying conditions during the
first two days. On-the last day however, the
weather cleared.

. The times chosen were round about midnight
when enemy air activity was normally at its
lowest.

Fortunately the quay at Bodo had not
suffered from enemy air attacks and this en-
abled destroyers to go alongside without diffi-
culty. The embarkations were carried through
with great rapidity, 500 men of one battalion
embarking with their kits in less than ten
minutes.

78. The swiftness and efficiency with which
the evacuation was carried out reflects great
credit on Brigadier Gubbins and his staff. The
destroyers of the Royal Navy were very well
handled and carried out the programme laid
down to the minute. Four 25-pr. guns, four
Bofors guns, and three Bren carriers which had
been salved from H.M.S. Effingham had to be
abandoned together with such material as could
not ‘be moved by the men, but some wireless
sets and all the arms and equipment, including
Bren guns and anti-tank rifles, which could be
carried by the men, were brought away.

479. The first echelon to be embarked were
transferred at sea from the destroyers to H.M.S.
Vindictive and conveyed direct to the United
Kingdom. Owing to the fact that transports
for the second and third echelons had not
arrived in time to admit of their direct tran-
shipment, the troops comprised in these were
landed at Borkenes to the east of Harstad and
re-embarked later as part of the general
evacuation programme.

General considerations in the evacuation of

Norway.

80. As mentioned already His Majesty’s
Government’s orders to evacuate Northern Nor-
way were received by Lord Cork and com-
municated at once by him to me. The informa-
tion was passed on by me to a few selected
senior staff officers. General Bethouart was
informed by me in Lord Cork’s presence.

The news was not imparted to my heads of
services or to junior staff officers until May
agth. In the meanwhile, though many steps
were taken in preparation for evacuation, such
as the loading of arms and stores in ships and the
embarkation of certain personnel, the deception
was maintained and fostered by all possible
means that these activities were concerned with
the reinforcement of Bodo, the establishment
of the Tromso base or the occupation of Ham-
merfest and the landing ground in the far North.
Thanks to the loyalty and discretion of those
concerned, the secret was well kept, and even
those who might have suspected were kept
constantly confused by conflicting rumours and
bogus instructions sedulously circulated by
those staff officers in the know.

8x. The successful French operations round
Narvik resulted in there being three Polish
battalions in the area Ankenes-Beisford in touch
with the enemy north east of the latter place.
East of Narvik the Foreign Legion had made
steady progress toward Sildvik and had
met with increasing enemy resistance. <A
Norwegian battalion was in Narvik. On the
north shore of the Rombaks Fjord a battalion
of Chasseurs was in close touch with German
outposts opposite Stromsnes, while General
Fleischer’s 6th Norwegian Division (5 battalions)
were holding from the left of the Chasseurs to
the Swedish frontier north of Bjornefjell, also
in touch with the enemy.

General Bethouart was particularly anxious
that the withdrawal of his troops should not
compromise or endanger the Norwegian troops
in his sector. The original programme of
evacuation was timed to begin on the night
and/3rd June, but was postponed 24 hours at
the urgent request of Sir Cecil Dormer in order
to enable the Norwegian Government to try to
implement the so called ‘“ Mowinckel Plan ’”’
through the Swedish Government and so ensure
that Narvik should become a neutral area under
