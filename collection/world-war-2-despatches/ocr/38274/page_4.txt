and in this, physical considerations limited the
plans for an advance into Burma from the
Imphal-Tiddim area to two possibilities :—

An advance to the area Kalewa-Kalemyo,
and thence to Ye-U.

' An operation for the capture of the Indaw
area (with its airfields) by airborne assault,
followed by an advance overland to consolidate
the capture. This force would depend on air
supply until the Chinese advance from the
horth opened a route for maintenance by land.

In both plans the use of long range penetra-
tion forces was included; but more particularly
did they figure in the second as a means to
distract the enemy and disrupt his communica-
tions—thus reducing the hazards of the tem-
porarily isolated force at Indaw.

Initially I favoured the first alternative, but
the Chiefs of Staff inclined to the latter plan,
stressing the following considerations : —

(a) The importance of the early seizure
of a locality directly enabling us to join
hands with the Chinese advances from Ledo
and Yunnan,

(b) The element of surprise and the greater
scope for employment of long range penetra-
tion groups.

(c) Greater economy in lift on the Assam
1. ob, ,

Further and more detailed examination was
therefore made, and as a result, and in view
of the weight attached to (a) above, I agreed
that the second plan was preferable,

On the 27th September, I cabled to the Chiefs
of Staff a report on the progress made to date,
and the conclusions reached.

The chief features of the plan at this stage
were as follows. The Indaw airfields were to
be seized by parachute troops, and thereafter
a division (less one brigade) was to be flown
in in seven days. A third brigade group with
mules and jeeps was to advance overland from
Imphat to Indaw. This was to be coupled with
a limited offensive/defensive operation south-
wards from Tamu, as well as with the Chinese
advances from Ledo and Yunnan on Myitkyina,
Bhamo, and Lashio, Offensive operations in
Arakan were also to be timed to take place
so as to have the maximum distracting effect
on the enemy, Finally (and of great import-
ance) the advance of the main forces towards
their objectives was to be preceded and assisted
by long range penetration forces.

The plan involved the use of transport air-
craft on a very large scale. It was thought
that this would amount to between 18 and 23
squadrons, depending on the treatment found
necessary for the surface of the Indaw airfields.
The Chiefs of Staff, however, cabled on the
7th October that provision .of aircraft on this
scale was quite out of the question, and that
a total of 151 transport aircraft (six squadrons)
was all that were likely to be available.

Accordingly, the matter was further
examined, and on the 13th October I sent the
Chiefs of Staff a modified plan, which, while
not so satisfactory as the original, nevertheless
appeared to ibe feasible.

The main modifications were : —

{a) Fighter squadrons would be located at
Indaw during the dry weather only.

(b) The original air landing force of one
division, less one brigade, would be flown in
over a fortmght instead of a week.

(c) The parachute force would be retained,
in order to strengthen the garrison, until the
operathonal situation permitted it to be flown
out.

(4) The delivery of engineer stores would

Ute spread over a longer period by com-
mencing delivery earlier.

Even with these modifications, however, the
requirements of transport aircraft, while much
less than they were in the orginal plan, were
still greatly in excess of 151. In fact, 290
would be required in the worst case, and 263
in the best case—t.e., 12 and Ir squadrons
respectively, as against 23 (maximurp) in the
old plan.

I continued to look for means to make further
reductions in the requirement of troop aircraft,
but any such reductions could only be small
unless the plan was still further radically
altered. It became clear that, unless the addi-
tional aircraft could be provided, the capture
of (Indaw should not be attempted, and I sug-
gested as a means to augment the supply that
some aircraft might be made available from
the ferry route.

As regards the enemy forces that might be
disposed to meet our offensive operations in
the Burma Theatre, a summary in,regard to the ,
situation in November, 1943, is given in Part LI
“Operations and Intelligence ’’.

Briefly, there were five Japanese Divisions.
The bulk of one (55th) was in Arakan; one
(33rd) was in the Chin Hills; one held the
Mawlaik Homalin area; and two (z8th and
56th) covered the area of North Burma to the
Salween. .

5. Plans for Operations on the Avakan Coast.

At the Washington Conference of 12th to
25th May, 1943, it was resolved to capture
Akyab and Ramree Island by an amphibious
operation; also, possibly, to exploit any success
gained. This was part of the general pattern
of offensive operations in the South. East Asia
Theatre, and plans were being formulated accor-
dingly, It will be remembered, however, that
at this time first priority on our resources was
still allocated to the air ferry to China.

In my view the success of the attack on
Akyab was of great importance both from the
point of view of the Army and public in India,
and of public opinion in Europe, America and
China. The island was already strongly for-
tified and formidable. I considered two assault
brigades would ‘be necessary in the first flight,
and a third, loaded with its own assault ship-
ping and craft, as a follow-up, Three to four
(land fbased) fighter squadrons would be re-
quired over Akyab during daylight, and con-
voys would be protected by carrier-borne
aircraft.

Additional to the above plan, I considered
that to ensure success we should operate offen-
sively by land down the Arakan coast with up
to two divisions. One long range penetration
group would operate in the Kaladan River area.

A further important reason for this land
advance was the capture of the Maungdaw air-
field. With this in our hands shore-based
fighter support could be given to the amphibious
attack on Akyab.
