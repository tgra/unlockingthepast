            "description": "bases and shipping was limited by the weather and the temporary unserviceability of our Cyrenaican landing grounds owing to rain. The enemy, on the other hand, taking full advantage of the proximity of his air bases, was able to make our reinforcements of Leros difficult. The dropping of flares at night hin- dered unloading operations on certain occa- sions, and the laying of minefields also added to our difficulties; in spite of all this enemy activity the strength of the Leros garrison was built up to the strength of a brigade. The original garrison, which had arrived between the 17th September and the 2nd October, was the 234th Brigade Headquarters, and the 2nd Royal Irish Fusiliers, with a company from the 2nd Royal West Kents, the remainder of the battalion being on Samos. This was re- inforced by 4th November by the 4th Buffs, although their Headquarters Company was lost at sea, and early in November the Ist King\u2019s Own completed the Brigade."

Between then and the even- ing of roth November when they arrived in the Cos/Calino area they moved only by day under heavy fighter protection, dispersing and lying up during the night, first in the Paros/ Naxos area and later in Amorgos, Levitha and Stampalia. Every effort was made by the Royal Navy and R.A.F. to intercept the force, but our efforts met with small success due by day to the heavy scale of enemy fighter pro- tection and by night to the difficulty of spotting the craft, which were probably beached an certainly camouflaged in the many bays avail- able. During the afternoon of gth November, our troops moved to their battle stations to await the enemy attack."

We esti- mated enemy casualties as ten thousand killed and fifteen thousand wounded; over thirty thousand prisoners were taken, ten thousand of them Germans, and nine Generals were included m the bag.

Large quantities of ammunition, stores and equipment of all natures fell into our hands intact in the early stages of the pursuit. The hostile force with which we now had to reckon amounted to little more than one composite division. 90 Light Division, upon whom fell the burden of covering the retreat, had been reduced to about a strong regimental group. The survivors of 164 Division equalled about another regimen- tal group. Of the hundred and fifty tanks re- maining about seventy belonged to the Ariete Division and shortly fell out along the road. The remnants of 15 and 21 Panzer Divisions, mustering some eighty tanks between them, formed the armoured component of the force.

The New Zealand Division, which had some difficulty in extricating itself from the confusion of the battlefield, also moved off at dawn on its way to Fuka, passing from 30 to 10 Corps; it had 4 Light Armoured Brigade under command. The importance of Fuka lay in the fact that the road here passes up a three hundred foot escarpment which is almost impassable except on the axis of the road and railway. If we could get there across the desert quicker than the enemy could along the road we should be able to cut off a good deal of his rearguard. 30 Corps, with 51 and 9 Australian Divisions, was held in reserve and ordered to clear up the coastal area; the task of clearing the main battlefield was entrusted to 13 Corps."

The beginning of November saw the capture of Vital Corner and the final breakdown of all enemy resistance northwards from Milestone 14 to Sialam Vum inclusive, the enemy suffer- ing heavy casualties. We resumed our advance down the road and finally stormed Kennedy Peak, the 9,000 foot mountain just south of Milestone 15, on the 4th November after two attacks had failed. A sharp action was then fought for the positions dominating the road between Milestones 22 and 23. Point 8225 was successfully assaulted on the 7th November and Fort White occupied without further opposition. In spite of the mountainous country, tanks were able to play an important part in the fighting."

The operation, which led to the capture both of Monte Massico and Monte Santa Croce to the north, began on 28th October and was successfully completed by 4th November, at which date 46 and 7 Armoured Divisions reached the lower Garigliano between the bend opposite Monte Tuga and the sea, The enemy had intendea to offer delay on this line, th\u00e9 southern extremity of the \u2018\u2018 Barbara\u2019 line, as shown by his reinforcing; but the dangers inherent in standing for long with a broad river immediately in rear, coupled no doubt with apprehensions of a seaborne outflanking move, decided him to pull: back his right, when pressed, behind the Garigliano. In the mean- time VI Corps had pushed forward up, and then across, the Volturno and driven the left wing of XIV Panzer Corps back to the \u201c Bernhardt \u2019\u2019 line based on Monte Camino, Monte Maggiore and the hills on the north . side of the Mignano defile from above Venafro (captured on 4th November) to above Tsernia."
