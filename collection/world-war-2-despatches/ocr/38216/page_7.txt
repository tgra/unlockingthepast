SUPPLEMENT to tar LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

_Burma, artangements had been made for re-
organising the Public Works Department so
that it could undertake supervision. of construc-
tion, which was immediately begun. |

~ 53. In March, 1941, H.Q. No. 221 Group
(Commander, Group Captain E. R. Manning)
‘was established at Rangoon to develop these
bases and to command the Air Forces located
in Burma. Although the Group staff was very
small, progress was so good that all bases were
completed by the end of 1941 with accommoda-
tion at each for some 450 all ranks. Facilities
for dispersal were reasonable, pens being pro-
vided, as were some satellite strips. There was
a measure of A.A. protection in the Rangoon
area but none elsewhere,

54. Co-operation with the Army in Burma
was excellent. Army H.Q. in Burma and
No. 221 Group R.A.F. were in close proximity
and the G.O.C. and his staff could not have
done more to assist the R.A.F. in its prepara-
tions. From the outset of planning in
November, 1940, the G.O.C. was in the pic-
ture of R.A.F. development. The raising and
training of aerodrome defence troops was con-
sequently conducted in parallel with construc-
tion.

55. During 1940, an air observer system was
developed by the G.O.C. under the active
direction of the Postmaster-General. From the
outset, its functions were made clear and, de-
spite difficulties of training, it developed and
operated usefully on the outbreak of hostilities;
control of it passed to the R.A.F. on the forma-
tion of 221 Group Headquarters. One Radar
Station was completed at Moulmein and two
others in the Rangoon area were nearing com-
pletion when war broke out, A Fighter Con-
trol Operations room was designed and con-
structed in Rangoon.

56. No. 60 (B) Squadron (Blenheim I’s) ex
India, was located at Rangoon from February,
1941. G.H.Q. considered it; important to
ensure some measure of fighter defence at
Rangoon; consequently, pending the availa-
bility of an established fighter squadron, half
of No. 60 was re-equipped with Buffalo fighters
for the period August-October, 1941, somewhat
handicapping the squadron’s operational effi-
ciency. As soon as No. 67 (F) Squadron
(Buffaloes) in Malaya was fully trained it was
transferred to Rangoon; the transfer took place
in October, 1941.

Heavy demands on No. 60 (B) Squadron for
communication flights occupied much of its
flying effort; and although it had‘a very high
standard of flying in monsoon conditions over
Burma, it became desirable to transfer the
squadron to Malaya to bring it operationally
up-to-date in practice. All its aircraft and
crews were therefore sent to Kuantan, the new
Air/ Armament Station of the Commarid, where
they arrived shortly before the Japanese’
attacked Malaya. .

57. In addition there was a flight of six
Moths used for training Burma’s Volunteer Air
Force. The aircraft of this flight were allotted
the role of maintaining communications and
carrying out certain limited reconnaissance.

58. A plan was drawn up in co-operation
with the Army in Burma, the object of which

_ Siamese Isthmus.

1353

was to destroy communication facilities in the
Land forces were to advance
across the isthmus and conduct a ‘‘ burn and
scuttle’? raid on port, rail and air facilities
at Prachuab Kirrikand, Their arrival was to
synchronise with air attack from Malaya under
A.H.Q. arrangements. ©

59. The question of the Command of the

‘forces in Burma had been raised on more than

one occasion. Those who considered it from
the angle of India’s defence recommended that
control should be by India. A.H.Q. supported
the opposite view, namely the retention of
Burma in the Far East Command, because it
considered that effective co-ordination of the
air forces operating from Burma. and Malaya
in defence of the Far East could only be
achieved by unified command. This view was
accepted. In the actual event, however, the
control of Burma had to pass to India seven
days after war broke out—at 0630 hours on
15th December, 1941.

60. Finally, reference must be made to the
American Volunteer Group under Colonel
Chennault, who .was given all possible assist-
ance, particularly in relation to maintenance,
training and accommodation. R.A.F. Base,
Toungoo, the training aerodrome for the Force,
was visited by the A.O.C, and Staff Officers
from A.H.Q.; officers who had had fighter
experience in Europe were sent to lecture and
to assist in training. Excellent work was later
done by this Force, in co-operation with the
R.A-F., in the defence of Burma. 2

DEVELOPMENTS IN N.E.I.

Dutch Borneo. .

61. ‘In accordance with the mutual reinforce-
ment plan, the Dutch allocated Sinkawang and
Samarinda in Dutch Borneo for use as bases
for four-R.A.F. bomber squadrons. Each of
these bases was to be provided with accommo-
dation for two bomber squadrons and to be
stocked in peace with supplies peculiar to the
Royal Air Force. Their only method of supply
was by means of transport aircraft provided
by the Dutch, who deliberately avoided making
roads to them -through the dense jungle in
which they were situated, and which thus re-
mained an undisturbed defence. By December,
Sinkawang was ready and had been inspected
by the C.O. and Flight Commanders of one
of the squadrons allocated to it. Samarinda
was not ready. yo ®

Sumatra. .

62. Permission was also obtained from the
Dutch in the summer of 1941, to reconnoitre
all aerodromes in Sumatra. This was required
because A.H.Q, anticipated that, in the event
of war, Sumatra would be required for: — -

(a) An alternative air reinforcement route
from India owing to the vulnerability of the

old route to Singapore via Burma and N.

Malaya once the Japanese -had penetrated

into Siam. 2 Bs

(b) Potential advanced landing grounds for
operations against the, flank of a Japanese

advance down Malayai 2

The main preoccupation -was therefore -with
those aerodromes which were situated in the
Northern half of Sumatra, -. 2 +).
