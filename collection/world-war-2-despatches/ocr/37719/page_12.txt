Germans which made them very deadly oppon-
ents. The first Polish Squadron (No. 303)
in No. 11 Group, during the course of a month,
shot down more Germans than any British unit
in the same period. Other Poles and Czechs
were used in small numbers in British
Squadrons, and fought very gallantly, but the
language was a difficulty, and they were prob-
ably most efficiently employed in their own
National units. Other foreign pilots were em-
ployed in British Squadrons, but not in appre-
ciable numbers. The American “‘ Eagle ’’
Squadron was in process of formation during
the Battle.

165. The Auxiliary Squadrons were by this
time practically _indistinguishable _ from
Regulars. It will be remembered that the
Scottish Auxiliaries were responsible for the
first Air success of the War in the Firth of
Forth. To set off against the discontinuity of
their training in peace time they had the great
advantage of permanency of personnel, and
the Flight Commanders at the outbreak of the
War were senior and experienced. At the same
time, this very permanence led to the average
age of the pilots being rather high for intensive
fighting, which exercises a strain which the
average man of 30 cannot support indefinitely.
This point has now ceased to be of importance
because of fresh postings. It is mentioned
only because it is a factor to be kept in mind
in peace time. ‘No praise can be too high for
the :Auxiliaries, both as regards their keenness
and efficiency in peace time and their fighting
tecord in war.

166. I may perhaps mention the question of
the Long Range Guns which were mounted
along the coast of France near Cap Grisnez.
They were within range of our coastal aero-
dromes, which they occasionally: subjected to
a desultory shelling. Their main targets, how-
ever, were Dover and the Convoys passing
through the Straits. So far as I am aware,
neither they nor the guns which we installed
as, counter measures, had any great influence
on the air fighting, but they did of course
make it impossible for any of our warships
to approach the French coast in clear weather,
and might have had an important effect if it
had been possible for the Germans to launch
an invading army.

167. About the end of the second phase, the
problems of keeping units up to strength and of
relieving them when exhausted began to assume
formidable proportions. It was no new experi-
ence, because the drain of units and pilots to
France, coupled with the Dunkerque fighting,
had created similar problems in the Spring.

168. The comparative relaxation in the inten-
sity of the fighting in June and July had
afforded a little respite, but units had only par-
tially recovered and were neither fresh nor up to
strength when the fighting again became
intense.

169. When Squadrons became exhausted,
obviously the most satisfactory way of rein-
fotcement was by means of moving complete
units, and this was done when time allowed.
Serviceable aircraft were transferred by air,
and Operational Aircraft Crews (about 35 men
per Squadron) were transferred by Civil Air-
craft put at my disposal for the moves. The
remainder of the personnel travelled by train
or motor transport according to circumstances.

SUPPLEMENT to tHz LONDON GAZETTE, 11 SEPTEMBER, 1946

Some of the distances involved were consider-
able, as for instance when a Squadron from
Wick had to be brought down in the London
Area.

170. The First-line strength of a ‘Squadron
was 16 aircraft, of which not more than 12
were intended to be operationally available
at any one time. The other 4 would normally
be undergoing Inspection or Overhaul, In
addition to this there was a small reserve. of
three to five aircraft per Squadron available
on the station.

171. There was a limit to the number of
trained pilots which could be kept on the
strength of a Squadron even in times of opera-
tional passivity, because not more than about
25 could be kept in full practice in Flying
Duties.

172. A fresh squadron coming into an active
Sector would generally bring with them 16
aircraft and about 20 trained pilots. They
would normally fight until they were no longer
capable of putting more than g aircraft into
the air, and then they had to be relieved. This
process occupied diferent periods according to
the luck and skill of the unit. The normal
period was a month to six weeks, but some
units had to be replaced after a week or Io
days.

173. Air Vice Marshal Park found that the
heaviest casualties were often incurred by
newly-arrived Squadrons owing to their non-
familiarity with the latest developments of air
fighting.

174. It soon became impossible to main-
tain the to-and-fro progress of complete unit
personnel from end to end of the country, and
the first limitation to efficiency which had to be
accepted was the retention of the majority of
personnel at’ Sector Stations and the transfer
only of flying personnel and aircraft crews.
This limitation was regrettable because it
meant that officers and men were strange to
one another, but worse was to come.

175. By the beginning of September the
incidence of casualties became so serious that a
fresh squadron would become depleted and ex-
hausted before any of the resting and reform-
ing squadrons was ready to take its place.
Fighter pilots were no longer being produced
in numbers sufficient to fill the gaps in the
fighting ranks. Transfers were made from the
Pleet Air Arm and from the Bomber and
Coastal Commands, but these pilots naturally
required a short flying course on Hurricanes
or Spitfires and some instruction in Formation
Flying, Fighter Tactics and Interception
procedure.

176. I considered, but discarded, the
advisability of combining pairs of weak units
into single Squadrons at full strength, for
several reasons, one of which was the difficulty
of recovery when a lull should come. Another
was that ground personnel would be wasted,
and a third was that the rate at which the
strength of the Command was decreasing
would be obvious. :

177. 1 decided to form 3 Categories of
Squadron:

(a) The units of 1: Group and on its
immediate flanks, which were bearing the
brunt of the fighting.
