On 16th May I was informed that it had been further postponed till mid-June. This removed almost all the value of the operation as by that time our troops, advancing overland, would be almost level with the island and on rath June I asked whether the forces earmarked for Elba could not rather be used for a landing on the’ mainland in support of Fifth Army. However, this was considered unacceptable as the French would not consent to the use in Italy of ‘g Colonial Infantry Division, which they wanted to keep for the landings in France. The operation therefore went in as planned in the early morning of 17th June; the occupation of the island was complete by the afternoon of the roth. Steps were taken to emplace medium guns in the north-eastern corner of the island to command Piombino but the town fell on 25th June without the necessity for their use.",
