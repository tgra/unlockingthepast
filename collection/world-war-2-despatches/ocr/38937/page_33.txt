SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

II United States and ro British, with six divi-
sions in line and one in reserve; VI Corps,
landing at Anzio, had two reinforced divisions,
to be followed shortly by elements of two more.
There was one division in Army Group reserve.

Total enemy strength was between twenty
and twenty-one divisions. On the main front
Tenth Army had thirteen divisions (facing ten
to twelve on our side) under LXXVI Panzer
Corps in the east and XIV Panzer Corps in
the west. The remainder were in North Italy
under Fourteenth Army; some of the eight
there were still in process of forming. In view
of the weak state of some of these the German
High Command considered it necessary to re-
inforce Italy with the equivalent of three good
divisions, and allow the retention of a fourth,
in order to meet the threat presented by Anzio.

The operations to which the Anzio landing
was to be the climax began with the attack
of 10 Corps across the Garigliano on 17th Jan-

‘wary. This was delivered by three divisions,
the 5th, 56th and 46th but the last played only
a minor réle in the opening phases; the object
was to crush the enemy’s extreme right behind
the lower Garigliano, and then turn northwards
and, breaking through the hills between Min-
turno and Castelforte up the valley of the
Ausente river, to appear in the Liri valley at
San Giorgio. The attack began well. The
German 94 Infantry Division, a relatively in-
experienced formation, had not been expecting
an attack and was surprised by the weight of
its delivery, for the arrival of 5 Division had
been well concealed. The Gegmans reacted
rapidly to what they imagined to be our main
effort, finding confirmation of this appreciation
when II Corps attacked across the Rapido on
zoth January. go Panzer Grenadier Division
was brought down from the Eighth Army front
and 29 Panzer Grenadier Division from the
Rome area; the latter move was rather gratify-
ing and unexpected, for it was the division
which had been expected to oppose the Anzio
landing; in addition the Hermann Goering
Division was also put in on the lower Garigliano
in spite of orders which had been received to
transfer it to France on 2oth January to prepare
for the invasion battles of the coming summer.

The 10 Corps attack looked the more danger-
ous to the enemy; by the roth 5 Division had
captured Minturno and the 56th was in the out-
skirts of Castelforte. General von Vietinghoff
decided to rely on the strong defences of the
Rapido to hold off the frontal attack of Ii pei a
In this he was justified although the attack by
36 Division was pressed with great gallantry.
A small bridgehead was seized on the 21st but
it was eliminated on the 22nd. Meanwhile the
Germans were preparing a powerful force to
counter-attack 10 Corps. On the morning of
the 22nd all the three newly-arrived mobile
divisions, 29, 90 and Hermann Goering, were
thrown into the attack; every division of the
Tenth Army was thus actively committed at
the moment when VI Corps was landing at
Anzio.

The assault force had sailed from Naples at
0500 hours on 2rst Jan in perfect weather
conditions and with the prospect that the weather
would continue fine. The convoy was made
up of two hundred and forty-three warships,
transports, landing craft and various other
vessels of the United States and Roya) Navies,
supplemented by Dutch, Greek, Polish and

French ships. The assault force consisted of
some fifty thousand American and British troops
and over five thousand vehicles. The voyage
was uneventful and the force was neither
observed nor intercepted by the enemy. The
first assault troops touched down on the beaches
at 0200 hours on the 22nd; opposition was negli-
gible and it was clear that complete surprise
had been obtained. The enemy defences, except
for a few coastal artillery positions, were un-
manned and it was soon discovered that the
only German unit in the area was a battalion
‘of 29 Panzer Grenadier Division which had been
so severely reduced in the recent fighting that
it had been sent there the day before to rest
and refit and to acquire some training in demoli-
tion by blowing up, at its leisure, the small
harbour of Anzio*. Fortunately it had made
no progress with the task before its training
was interrupted. The failure of enemy recon-
naissance is undoubtedly to be ascribed at least
in part to a heavy air raid we had laid on for
the purpose against the enemy’s long-range
air reconnaissance base at Perugia on 19th Jan-
uary. This was so successful that no recon-
naissance was flown between Toth and zand
January. A local diversion was made by the
Navy who bombarded Civitavecchia and
simulated landings there on the night of the 21st;
the feint was taken sefiously at first by the
enemy who flew a reconnaissance over the area
—the pilot asked where the landing was. Army
Group ‘‘C”’ informed the German High Com-
mand at o600 hours that a landing had taken
place directed at Rome and requested the
reinforcements which had been agreed for that
case; but the first real news that the landing
was taking place at Anzio was given by a
Messerschmidt at 0820 hours, six hours after
the assault troops landed.

Consolidation of the Bridgehead.

The first phase of the operation had thus
gone better than we had reason to hope; we
had gained both strategical and tactical surprise
and had got our forces ashore with scarcely any
fighting. The exploitation inland, however, was
slower than I had planned and failed to reach
our objective, the Alban Hills. This is in part
to be ascribed to what is always a potent factor
in all military operations, the delayed effect of
preconceived ideas on a situation to which they
no longer apply. At the time when the orders
for the operation were issued Fifth Army’s In-
telligence Staff estimated that enemy resistance
would be in the strength of one division (viz.
29 Panzer Grenadiers), four parachute batta-
lions from Rome, a tank and an anti-tank
battalion and other miscellaneous units, to a
total of fourteen thousand three hundred men.
VI Corps was therefore expecting to have to
fight an assault landing and have some trouble
in consolidating its beach-head. Although the
enemy dispositions assumed in this apprecia-
tion had been radically altered, and VI Co:
had, of course, been apprised of this fact before
the landing, the effects of the original concep-

+ tion of the task undoubtedly remained. The fact

that the whole nature of the operation had fairly
recently been changed from a relatively small
flanking assault designed to join up quickly with
the advance of the main body of Fifth Army
