The loss of Cos deprived us of our only airfield from which single-engined fighters could operate over the Aegean, As a result, no adequate daylight cover could be given to our shipping, which now became exposed to attack iby a greatly strengthened German Air Force based in Greece and Crete, which had been rapidly expanded until it was at least equal to that in Italy; sea transport was henceforth confined to darkness. The disposition of our forces in the Aegean was Teadjusted on 5th October, when the small garrison which we had established in Calino, the neighbouring island to Cos, was withdrawn; but patrols were maintained there and on Gairos, Kythnos, Stampalia and Simi."

Arrangements were also made for dropping by air; this method was used mainly to meet urgent demands for ordnance stores and in the latter stages of the operation for various natures of ammunition, as there was no other teliable and fast method of meeting such demands, Initially, one aircraft was used each night, but ultimately as many as eighteen were used, During the period, 5th October to rgth November, 334,000 Ibs. and 200 personnel were dropped by 216 Group, Royal Air Force. A greater effort was attempted but thwarted by adverse weather,"

On 3rd October the Royal Navy landed 2 Special Service Brigade (Commandos) at Termoli ahead of the advance of 78 Division and captured the town and port intact, together with a number of prisoners. They made early contact with the leading brigade of 78 Division across the Biferno but the difficulties of the crossing rendered this contact precarious. A brigade of 78 Division was therefore landed in the bridgehead area on the night 3rd/qth October and a further brigade was taken in by sea on 5th October. The enemy reacted violently and rushed over 16 Panzer Division from Army reserve in the western sector. Fierce fighting continued for some days. The Biferno rose in flood and cut communication by road, but by the 7th the enemy had accepted defeat and drew off westward to his next line behind the River Trigno.*"

By the 25th the enemy was generally back behind the Usa but not in very good order and advances were made all along the Army front. In the plains we had cleared the whole eastern bank of the Fiumicino by 29th September but the enemy was still holding out in the foothills south of Route 9 when the rain descended with great violence for four successive days. All the fords over the Marecchia and Uso became impassable and the approaches to the bridges, necessarily more congested, were in very bad condition; the Fiumicino, normally a shallow trickle, swelled to a width of thirty feet and its speed and depth made it impossible for infantry patrols to cross. Going off the roads became quite impossible. The enemy took heart from this to maintain a steadfast resistance and it was not until 5th October that the"

It had been originally imtended that formations, as soon as they had completed their reorganisation in the assembly area, should move to a concentration area in the North of France, and remain there in readiness to occupy the line not earlier than 5th October. General Georges decided, however, that it was inadvisable to await the arrival of the whole British Expeditionary Force in  the concentration area and expressed a wish that 1st Corps should move without delay into the sector north of Maulde. I accordingly informed General Georges that Ist Corps would take over its sector on 3rd October and that 2nd Corps would be able to%o into the line about 12th October,"
