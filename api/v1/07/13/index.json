            "description": "gins on the\u2019coast, This plan had always seemed to us to have great advantages from the. point of view, but there were difficulties from the fighters\u2019 point of view in that their scope was thereby limited by having to break off an engagement on approaching the coast and start it again if the target got through the gun zone. It was, however, now very clear that without some very radica] re-arrangement, two-thirds of the V.1s would continue to get through to London. The fighters were still having only a limited, success, though that success was much better than the guns were experiencing, _ | Fighter Command were evidently thinking on the-same lines, for at a meeting called on the afternoon of 13th July, at their H.Q.,.atter a lengthy discussion the C.-in-C. Fighter Command decided that the guns should be moved to the coast, and orders to that effect were given. % ."

The outline plan was that M.T. /Stores ships were to begin loading at Beirut, Haifa and Alexandria early in June. Personnel ships were to load at Suez at the beginning of July. Half of the L.S.Ts. (tank-landing ships, with a capacity of fifty vehicles, or twenty-two tanks and twenty vehicles) were to load half at Suez and half at Alexandria. L.C.Ts. (tank-landing craft, with a capacity of ten vehicles or six tanks) were to load at Benghazi. The M.T./Stores convoys were planned to arrive as follows: the assault convoy on roth July, first follow-up convoy on 13th July, amd second follow-up convoy on 24th July. Thereafter reinforcements and maintenance convoys would be sailed every fourteen days until 22nd August, when they would be sailed every ten days."
