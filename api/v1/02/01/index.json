General Tuker had previously obtained permission to withdraw further to Cirene and El Faidia, and the qth Indian Division retired to that line without delay. At El Faidia the rth Indian Infantry Brigade was once more heavily attacked by lorried. infantry and suffered a number of casualties, but held its ground. The 4th Indian Division completed its withdrawal to the Derna line during the same night.",

The weakness of our armour was particularly disturbing, and I doubted whether we might not have to withdraw to the frontier positions. When I got back to Cairo, however, I found that the prospects of rebuilding our armoured force reasonably quickly were better than I had supposed, and I decided to try to hold Tobruk, since to possess it would undoubtedly make it very much easier to resume the offensive. I therefore sent General Ritchie preliminary instructions to hold the enemy as far west as possible without risking the destruction or isolation of the Eighth Army west of the Egyptian frontier.",

On 1st February, No. 2 M.M.G.
