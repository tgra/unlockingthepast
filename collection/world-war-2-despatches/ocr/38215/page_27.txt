SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

charged on the 8th December but several of
which subsequently failed to operate.

137. On the Singora road the advance of the
enemy column was delayed by the engagement
at Ban Sadao and by demolished bridges and
it was not until 0430 hours roth December that
contact was again made about the frontier a
few miles north of Changlun. Our forward
troops withdrew and the 1/14 Punjab Regt.,
with some artillery and engineers attached,
took up a position behind a stream a little
south of Changlun Cross Roads. The Com-
mander 15 Brigade was told by the divisional
commander that he must hold the enemy north
of Asun at least until the mormng of 11th
December. He asked for an additional battalion
and was given the 2/1 Gurkha Rifles from the
28 Brigade. This battalion took over the Asun
outpost position.

138. During the roth December the covering
troops of 6 Brigade withdrew to Kodiang with-
out incident, carrying out important demolitions
on the railway before they went. This with-
drawal entailed the evacuation of the State
of Perlis, as a result of which Britain was
accused by one of the Perlis Ministers of State
of violating her treaty by abandoning the State.

139. ‘At about o800 hours 1th December
the 1/14 Punjab Regt. was attacked in the
Changlun position but succeeded in driving the
enemy back, By midday, however, the enemy
attacking from the right flank had penetrated
into the middle of our position and the Com-
mander of the Covering Force decided to with-
draw behind the Asun outpost position, cal-
culating that he would be able to reach there
before the enemy tanks could negotiate the
damaged bridges. At 1430 hours, however,
he was ordered by the divisional commander to
occupy a position 14 miles north of Asun with a
view to imposing further delay on the enemy.
At about 1630 hours, when the force was moving
back, covered by a rearguard, occurred the
first of many incidents which showed the in-
fluence of the tank on the modern battlefield,
especially against inexperienced troops. Sud-
denly with little warning twelve Japanese
medium tanks followed by infantry in lorries
and other light tanks attacked the rear of the
column. Few of the troops had ever seen a
tank before. The tanks advanced through the
column inflicting casualties and causing much
confusion and approached the bridge in front
of the Asun outpost position. The demolition
exploder failed but the leading tank was
knocked out by anti-tank rifle fire and blocked
the road The blitz was temporarily stopped,
but at considerable cost in men and material.
Some 200 men of the.1/14 Punjab Regt. with
the Brigadier, all of whom had been cut off,
rejoined the following day, but the battalion
was temporarily rendered ineffective.

140. By 1830 hours the tanks, followed by
infantry, had come on again and broken into
the outpost position held by the 2/1 Gurkha
Rifles. Shortly afterwards the Battalion Com-
mander decided to withdraw all his three com-
panies. But communications had been broken
and of the forward companies only 20 survivors
ever rejoined, The losses of the battalion in
this action were over 500.

141. On the Perlis road, as may often happen
with inexperienced troops, a demolition was
prematurely exploded behind the covering. and

Tepaired in time although there was no contact
on this front and all the transport, guns and
carriers of the covering and outpost troops and
seven anti-tank guns in the main Jitra position
were lost.

142. Withdrawals are admitted to be among
the most difficult operations of war even for
seasoned troops and the above incidents, which
have been described in some detail, serve to
ilustrate the great difficulty of conducting them
successfully with inexperienced troops. They
had a profound influence on the Battle of Jitra.
At the same time I am of the opinion that some
of the trouble might have been avoided had the
commanders reacted more swiftly to the prob-
lems created by the appearance of tanks on the
battlefield.

143. The Kyroh Front —The advance was
continued early on the gth December. Our
column was still opposed by the detachment of
the Thailand Armed Constabulary which was
now some 300 strong and which adopted
guerila tactics. As the leading troops ap-
proached Betong, however, in the afternoon all
opposition ceased. Here the column stopped for
the night.

144. At first light on the roth December
Krohcol embussed in the 2/3 Australian
Reserve M.T, Coy. and moved forward towards

fhe Ledge position. When about 4 miles short
,of its objective the advanced guard came under
fire from Japanese troops. It continued to ad-
vance rapidly for 14 miles and then was held
up. An encounter battle developed in which
there was heavy fighting with considerable
casualties on both sides, but again the issue was
decided by Japanese tanks which made a sur-
prise appearance on this front. The 3/16
Punjab Regt. fought splendidly in this engage-
ment as it did also the following day. The 10
Mountain Battery and 5/14 Punjab Regt. (less
one Company) had now arrived at Kroh and the
Commander Krohcol ordered them up to a
position about ro miles north of Betong. He
also reported the situation to the Commander 11
Indian Division saying that he might have to
withdraw. The latter in his reply imposed on
him the réle of stopping, and not merely delay-
ing, the enemy.

145. During the afternoon of the t1th Decem-
ber the enemy made repeated attacks on the
forward troops of Krohcol but were repulsed
with heavy losses. The battalion casualties,
however, after three days’ and nights’ fighting
were past the 200 mark. The commander
Krohcol estimated that he was opposed by four
enemy battalions and reported accordingly to
Headquarters 11 Indian Division. It was the
night after the affair at Asun recorded above
and in reply the Commander 11 Indian Division
sent a personal’ message to the effect that the
object of Krohcol must now be to ensure the
safety of the whole division by preventing the
enemy from debouching on to the L. of C.
about Sungei Patani. The Commander Krohcol
was given full permission to withdraw as neces-
sary to the Kroh position, where his stand must
be final.

A detachment of anti-tank guns was sent to
this front. .

146 The Kelantan Front —Civil plans
during the first day of war had gone smoothly
under the capable direction of Mr. Kidd, the
British Adviser. During the 8th December all
European women and children were withdrawn
