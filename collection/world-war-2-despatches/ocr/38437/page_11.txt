SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 20 OCTOBER, 1948

74. Another change which General Pile
found necessary at an early stage- was the
zemoval to higher ground of the radar sets be-
longing to the heavy guns. At the start these
were placed in hollows because the ‘‘ Over-
lord/Diver ’’ Plan had been made in anticipa-
tion of attempts at ‘‘ jamming ”’ by the enemy.
‘Successful bombing attacks during the “ Over-
lord’? preparations had, however, virtually
deprived the Germans of this resource, and so

it was possible to move the sets to more exposed .

positions in which the contours of the ground
‘caused less interference.

75. Another variation from the plan concemmed
the light guns. Originally these were to have
been deployed on searchlight sites, but after
the attacks had begun, General Pile came to
the conclusion that better results would be
achieved by concentrating them in front of the
heavy gun belt. He also found that by linking
troops of four guns each to a heavy-gun pre-
dictor and G.L. radar set he could use the light
A.A. guns against “‘unseen”’’ as well as
“* visual ’’’ targets.

76. Towards the end of June we began to
teceive the S.C.R. 584 radar sets and improved
predictors which we had been eagerly expect-
ing since February. These two items of equip-
tment were destined to contribute very largely
to the ultimate success of the guns. An inten-
sive training programme which had to be
organised with such resources as could be
spared from operations was, however, indis-
pensable before they could be used on any
considerable scale.

77. With the balloon barrage the problem
was largely the arithmetical one of achieving
a sufficient density to give a reasonable chance
of success. We found, however, that in prac-
tice the theoretically computed rate of success
was not always attained: somehow more
bombs slipped through the barrage than should
have done so according to the laws of proba-
bility, if our assumptions were correct. One
difficulty was that the “double parachute
links ’’* used to arm the balloon cables in normal
barrages had not been designed to cope with
aircraft travelling much faster than 300 m.p.h.
For this reason we did not arm the cables of
the balloons deployed during the first few days
of the attack. But we soon came to the con-
clusion that an imperfect arming device was
better than none; and by the 21st June all
cables were armed. I received a large number
of suggestions for increasing the effectiveness
of the barrage in other ways, such as by adding
“* whiskers ’’, nets, kites, and other forms of
drapery. Many devices of this kind were tried,
and some were of value, but as most of them
increased the physical difficulty of handling
the balloons in one way or another, I had to
adopt a somewhat cautious attitude lest the
best should prove the enemy of the good.

- 78. A slight re-disposition of the barrage
Proved necessary in order to prevent bombs
which penetrated to its northern edge from be-
ing brought down in built-up areas. The notion

* The “double parachute link’’ was a device
whereby, as soon as a balloon cable was struck, it
‘was automatically severed near the top and bottom,
so that the aircraft which struck it carried away the
central portion. Parachutes then opened at each
end of this portion and exercised a drag intended to
make the aircraft stall.

of keeping the balloons up in all weathers—
which was contained in the original ‘ Over-
lord/ Diver ’’ Plan but afterwards abandoned
—was considered a second time after the attack
had begun, but once more found impracticable.
We therefore used a system of control which
was less flexible than that used for normal
barrages, but served its purpose adequately.
In order that our pilots should not lose their
lives by colliding with the barrage we perpetra-
ted a pious fraud on them by allowing them to
believe that the balloons would fly continuously.

79. So much for the problems that con-
fronted the individual arms of the defence and
the chief measures taken to solve them, There
were, of course, many smaller problems with
which I have not space to deal. But the
biggest problem of all was not confined to one
arm: it was of wider consequence and con-
sisted in securing the right kind and degree of
co-operation between guns and fighters. Since
in a sense these were rival weapons, the task
had always been a troublesome one from the
eatly days of the war; nevertheless, so far as
operations against orthodox aircraft were con-
cerned, with experience a satisfactory working
solution had been found. During the “ Baby
Blitz,’”’ for example, the co-operation between
guns and fighters had been most satisfactory.
I found, on the other hand, that as the Ger-
mans must have intended, the novel problem
presented by the flying bomb created a host
of new difficulties. For example, it was some-
times hard for a pilot to realise that he was
approaching the gun belt in time to avoid in-
fringing the rule against entering it. Con-
versely, gunners in the belt who were engaging
a flying bomb did not always realise in time that
a pilot was legitimately entering the belt in
pursuit of this or another missile, and would
go on firing to the peril of the pilot’s life.
The crews of the guns on the coast and else-
where outside the gun-belt were in a still more
difficult position, for except in bad weather
they always bore the onus of ensuring that no
fighters were about before they could open fire.
In the excitement of the moment, when the
attention of the gunners was concentrated on
their targets, it was only too easy for a fighter
travelling at six miles a minute to slip un-
noticed into the field of fire. Consequently
numerous infringements of the gun-belt by
fighters, and many unintentional engagements
of our fighters by the guns, were reported,
especially in middling weather when guns and
fighters were simultaneously in operation.
Charges and counter-charges mounted; and
with deep misgiving I began to sense a rising
feeling of mutual distrust between pilots and
gunners.

80. I felt very strongly that this state of
affairs could not be allowed to continue.
the causes of friction were not removed, the
situation would inevitably grow worse. As the
first four weeks of the attack went by, the
overall achievement of the defences improved.
To all appearances, the machine was growing
more efficient. But this improvement brought
me scanty satisfaction. I knew that the point
would soon be reached at which this friction
would become the limiting factor, and no fur-
ther improvement would be possible. Looking
further ahead, J realised that, whatever tem-
porary advantages our existing practice might
bring, we eguld not afford to sacrifice the spirit
