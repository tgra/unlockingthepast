Outline Plan of Operatinn.

7. On the 13th July, I informed the Com-
mander-in-Chief, Mediterranean and _ other
authorities that in view of the priorities
assigned by the Admiralty and the routes ad-
vocated by Vice-Admiral, Malta, I considered
that M.G.z should sail a.m. D.3, splitting into
three groups after dark, each group proceeding
at best speed. The route to be followed to
be close inshore by Cape Bon and subsequently

_ through the Galita Channel.

Subject to no enemy forces being present,
cruisers and Hunts of Force X* to part com-
pany from ‘‘ Substance ’’ at 0700 on D.4 and
proceed to Malta so as to discharge and refuel
before arrival of ‘‘ Substance ’’.

The destroyer escort of ‘‘ Substance ’”’ to
be refuelled by 2000 on D.4 at latest and sailed
so as to reach the eastern end of Skerki Channel
about 0430 on D.5, the remainder of Force
X having passed this point about o4o0.

Force Ht to withdraw to the westward on
reaching the entrance of the Skerki Channel
on D.3 remaining if possible out of range of
shore-based fighters during D.4 but with the
object of distracting attention from M.G.r1.

Forces H and X to rendezvous shortly after
dawn on D.5. Providing no enemy surface
forces were in the vicinity, 6 Swordfish to be
flown off to Malta, early a.m. on D.5.

Preliminary Movements.

8. The first movement of destroyers from
Gibraltar in connection with the operation took
place on the r4th July. These movements,
which it is unnecessary to describe in detail,
were designed to enable all personnel to be
transferred under cover of darkness, all
destroyers to have the maximum amount of fuel
on board after passing through the Straits, and
for the cruiser escorts to arrive at Gibraltar in
pairs relieving one another on successive nights
in the hope that the change of ships would not

‘be too noticeable.

g. All these movements were carried out
according to plan and by 2000 on the 2oth July,
the situation was as follows: —

(a) In harbour at Gibraltar—

PASTEUR atcommodating balance of
troops for transfer to H.M. Ships. MAN-
CHESTER, ARETHUSA, LEINSTER,
COSSACK, MAORI, SIKH, waiting to
embark troops after dark and then sail to
eastward to join convoy.

Force H consisting of RENOWN, ARK
ROYAL, HERMIONE, FAULKNOR,
FEARLESS, FOXHOUND,  FIRE-
DRAKE, DUNCAN.

(b) Due in at Gibraltar at 2130—

FORESIGHT, FURY, FORESTER to
refuel and sail to the eastward.

Departure from Gibraltar,

ro. At 0140 on 21st July just before ships
in harbour were due to sail, heavy Levant
squalls sprang up combined with dense fog.
These conditions made departure difficult and
the programme was considerably delayed
Force H destroyers should have slipped at
0240, but at this time MANCHESTER and
LEINSTER were still at their berths, though
ARETHUSA had slipped from the, north end
of the detached mole. Fog was very patchy
and MANCHESTER at the south end of the
detached mole was invisible from RENOWN
at the north end of the south mole.

rz. About 0320 the squalls decreased in in-
tensity and the fog cleared sufficiently to allow
MANCHESTER to sail, followed by
LEINSTER. RENOWN, preceded by ARK
ROYAL and destroyers, slipped at 0426, 1}
hours late on the programme arranged. By
this time the harbour and bay were clear of
fog though it persisted south of Europa.

12. Owing to the fog, ships were ordered
at 0412 to proceed independently to the east-
ward until daylight. The course and speed
of advance of all ships were laid down in the
Operation Orders, a copy of which had been
supplied to the Naval Liaison Officer in
LEINSTER. At 0530 a merchant ship passed
two miles to starboard of RENOWN on oppo-
site courses. Half an hour later all ships
which were to form on RENOWN were in
station and proceeding eastward at 20 knots
to draw abreast of the convoy in order to
exchange destroyer screens.

Movements on 21st July (D.1)..

13. Three Swordfish from North Front
arrived over ARK ROYAL at 0630, but before
landing on were ordered to search ahead: to
a depth of 40 miles to locate and report the
position of all ships taking part in the opera-
tion These aircraft reported having sighted
all units including LEINSTER.

14. Hereafter ships formed’on RENOWN will
be referred to as Group 4, and those formed
on the MT. ships as Group 5. The three
Tribals, COSSAICK, MAORI and SIKH, who
should have escorted LEINSTER to join
Group 5 overtook and joined Group 4. Having
failed to locate LEINSTER in the fog they
proceeded independently in accordance with the
instructions referred to in paragraph 12. Speed
was increased to 20 knots at 0830. Visibility
improved and by noon was normal.

15. At 0915 information was received from
the Vice-Admiral Commanding, North Atlantic
that the personnel ship LEINSTER was ashore
near Cape Tarifa. This seemed an improb-
able positiontand since LEINSTER had been
reported by tHe air reconnaissance it was not
