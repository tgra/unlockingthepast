SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 OCTOBER, 1951

the Po at an early stage of the battle before dis-
organisation was too great for a controlled
retreat. But the German Commander, von
Vietinghoff, did not give the order to pull back
until the Eighth Army had broken through the
Argenta Gap and was across the Idice River
near Budrio, and Fifth Army troops had
reached Route 9 west of Bologna. By then, an
orderly withdrawal would in any case have been
difficult as all reserves had been committed to
the battle; and the attempt that was made was
completely smashed by the power of the Allied
Air Forces.

298. On the 21st April, Bologna was cap-
tured, Polish troops of the Eighth Army enter-
ing it from the east at the same time as Ameri-
can troops of the Fifth Army entered it from
the south-west. The main part of the German
garrison had withdrawn during the previous
night.

299. On the Eighth Army’s right flank, the
drive to the Po along Route 16 was completed,
leading elements reaching it on the 23rd, and
on the 24th Ferrara was captured. The situa-
tion was then that some five German divisions
were being contained against the Po east of
Ferrara, and were fully occupying the Eighth
Army troops in that area. But west of Ferrara
to Bondeno the way was clear of the enemy,
so it was decided to make a crossing there. By
the 25th a secure bridgehead had been obtained,
and the division making the crossing later
revealed that the total forces opposing it con-
sisted of 14 men.

300. In the meantime Eighth Army troops,
advancing westwards south of Route 16, and in
the central sector, had linked up with the Fifth
Army troops advancing north between the
Rivers Reno and Penaro. Meetings were made
near Bondeno and Finale, and again near
Cento.

3or. The Fifth Army had reached the Po
River at San Benedetto on the evening of the
2and and a crossing was made at this point
on the 23rd. On the 24th, the bridgehead was
enlarged and Fifth Army troops began to pour
across the River.

302. Meanwhile, another Fifth Army column
was racing west along Route 9, capturing
Reggio and approaching Parma. On the west
coast, La Spezia was occupied on 23rd April
without ‘opposition.

303: In this period many thousands of
prisoners were taken and the complete dis-
organisation of the German Armies was
.achieved.

Summary of the Air Effort from 21st to 24th
Apnil

304. Since September, 1944, constant recon-
naissance of the Po River had been maintained,
and an assessment made of the crossings which
would most probably be used by the enemy
if and when he tried to retire across the river.
When, therefore, aerial reconnaissance carried
out.on the night of the 20th /2zst April revealed
that practically the whole stretch of the Po
from Ostiglia to Crespini (halfway. between
Polesella and Berra) was active with pontoon
bridges and other crossing activity, plans which
had previously been prepared were carried into
effect, and the full power of the Tactical Air
Force was concentrated-on the task of making
fhe German retreat a shambles.

305. Constant attacks by the medium
bombers made it impossible for the Germans
to use the pontoom bridges and the ferries for
heavy armour and motor transport. During
the four days, 21st to 24th April, B-25 aircraft
of the 57th Bombardment Wing made 38
attacks on active sites flying 605 sorties, At
the same time, fighter-bombers of XXII T.A.C.
and D.A.F. kept constant patrols above the
river, and destroyed all craft which they found
trying to cross during the day. In the same
four days, some 220 boats and barges were
destroyed or damaged.

306. In addition to attacking all attempted
traffic across the river, the Tactical Air Force
fighter-bombers paid great attention to search-
ing out enemy movement on the roads and
destroying the vehicles when they were found,
and to cratering roads to impede the retreat.
For instance, in the middle of the morning of
April 24th, a collection of enemy armour, motor
transport and guns was seen between Polesella
and Berra—at that time the stipulated bomb-
line. A special bomb-line was immediately laid
down, and under ‘‘ Rover”’ control, fighter-
bombers attacked the target until late in the
evening. In all, there were some three hundred
vehicles in the area, and by the end of the
day the majority of them had been destroyed.

307. It was in this period too, that the night-
intruders put out their greatest effort of the
offensive, maintaining during the night the inter-
diction of traffic across the river established by
the medium and fighter-bombers during the
day. They attacked pontoon bridges, ferries,
boats and barges and concentrations of troops
and vehicles assembled near the crossing points.
For example on the night of 2and/23rd April,
the Bostons, Baltimores and Mosquitoes of
D.A.F. flew a record number of sorties—174.
Almost every aircraft was flown twice during
the night and some crews made three sorties.
The results achieved were also a record—55
motor vehicles destroyed, and 105 damaged,
together with six barges. In addition, many
direct hits were seen on bridges, wharves, ferry
points and pontoons.

308. There can be no doubt that the efforts
of” the Tactical Air Force played a very im-
portant part in the crippling losses in armour
and equipment which were inflicted on the
enemy south of the River. During the four
days 21st to 24th April 3735, mote vehicles
were destroyed or damaged by Tactical Air
Force. At the same time, claims pati! occu-
pied buildings fell to 414 destroyed or damaged
as compared with over 1,300 during the pre-
vious four days, which is indicative of the
greatly lessened resistance put up against our
advancing troops.

309. The air attacks carried out on the cross-
ings during this period undoubtedly caused
the enemy to abandon most of his equipment
on the south side of the river. In the stretch
between Pontelagoscuro (due north of Ferrara)
and Polesella, for instance, where 76 Panzer
Corps crossed, goo vehicles, 100 guns of all
calibres, and 59 Mk.4 Tanks, were counted
left abandoned on the South side of the river,
and this Corps was believed to have suffered
fewer losses than other German formations.
The air attacks against the Po crossings played
a major part in rendering the enemy too weak
