SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 28 APRIL, 1950

B. Bark SOUTH.

(i) Between 0308 and 0420, three L.C.T. (R)*
carried out pre-arranged shoots on flank targets
at the beaches.

(ii) After daylight H.M.S. WHADDON and
EGGESFORD gave close support and three
L.c.G. also fired a few rounds. H.MS.
LAFOREY also joined in the silencing of
machine-guns at Portopalo Bay.

iii) Later in the day ships of the Bombard-
ing Squadron (H.M.S. NEWFOUNDLAND,
ORION, LAFOREY, LOYAL, LOOKOUT)
fired direct shoots at areas five miles inland
including Rosolini and Spaccaforno.

C. Bark East. «

L.CS. and L.CF. replied with effect to the
machine-gun fire and sniping encountered by
the assault craft on beaching.

H.N.M.S. SOEMBA and FLORES engaged
a battery 2,000 yards north of Pachino at 0533,
which with five guns of 100 mm. had been firing
at the rate of one round per gun per minute a
defensive barrage on a line about 200 yards off
the beaches. The two ships under way and keep-
ing station on dan buoys, at ranges of 7,000
and 7,800 yards respectively, fired in periods
until 0645 when the battery was virtually
neutralised.

D. Acid SouTH and Norta.

Bombardments were carried out as fol-
lows :—
@) By H.M.S. MAURITIUS.

(a) at 0600, fire was openéd on a coast
defence battery which had been worrying
How and Jic beaches. After thirty-six
rounds had been fired no further shelling
occurred from this direction although
great difficulty was experienced in locat-
ing the target.

(b) at 0840, in response to a call, a de-
fended area was bombarded for five
minutes, the shells appearing, from visual
observation, to hit the required area.

Gi) By H.M.S. ESKIMO.

(@) at 0545 at a range of 10,000 yards,
five salvos were fired at a battery con-
cealed among trees north-east of Avola
which had been dropping shells on How
sector. The battery ceased fire.

(5) at 0610, at another battery shelling
How beaches. The battery quickly ceased
fire but opened up again soon after. The
bombardment was resumed at 0715 and
after the sixth salvo there was an explosion
and fire at the position of the battery from
which nothing further was heard.

Gii) By H.M.S. TETCOTT. .

(@) at 0510, opened fire at a battery
which had been shelling Jic beaches, and
drew its fire which was very inaccurate.

(8) at 0559, changed target to another
battery giving trouble at the beaches, but
as H.M.S. MAURITIUS opened fire at
about the same time, reverted to first tar-
get so as not to confuse her, the first
battery having again come into action.
The battery ceased fire as a result.

(c) at 0641, opened fire at a third bat-
tery of three guns, which ceased fire.

(iv) By H.M.S. TARTAR.

(a) at 0410, fire was opened at two
searchlights in the vicinity of Avola, which
were extinguished.

(v) By H.M.S. EREBUS.

@ at 1415, fire was opened on an in-
fantry defended post with six pill boxes.
Target reported destroyed after twelve
rounds at 12,600 yards had all been
spotted and corrected upon the target, in-
cluding two direct hits and seven within
one hundred yards of the centre of the

et.

(6) at 1945 at a range of 18,700 yards,
six rounds fired at another infantry de-
fended post. Five direct hits and target
reported by Forward Observation Officer
as destroyed.

Enemy Air Activity.

Prior to the landings enemy air activity
against the expedition was non-existent and it
was only slight throughout D day. Some
details were as follows: —

A. Bark WEsT.

Shortly after 2200, an attack was made on
the anchorage in the course of which a stick
of bombs fell close between H.MS.
HAMBLEDON and HM.S. WALLACE.
Flares dropped by the aircraft were effective
but the anchorage was heavily protected by
smoke and no damage was sustained.

B. BaRK SOUTH.

There were indications of air activity, but
no bombs were dropped. One low-flying air-
craft was shot down after dark.

C. Bark East.

@ At 0550 two Me. 109 made a cannon-
fire attack on RED beach; one stoker of an
L.C.S. was wounded. :

Gi) From 2010 to midnight there were inter-
mittent attacks on the ships and H.MS.
ALYNBANK was near missed by a dive
attack, two ratings being killed.

D. Actp NortH and Sours.

While waiting to cover the later flights two
L.C.S. (QM) were machine-gunned by an air-
craft and some minor casualties were suffered ;
the aircraft was seriously damaged. Then
between 0630 and 0700 fighter bombers
appeared overhead but no bombs were
dropped. ‘Next, at 1015 about ten Ju. 88 and
some F.W. 190 dropped bombs in the vicinity
of shipping. During the afternoon two L.C.T.
were damaged by near misses and in further
intermittent attacks, including an attack by
forty aircraft at 1630, near misses on S.S.
BERGENSFIORD and L.S.T. 407 were the
only incidents of note.

Night attacks began soon after 2100 and a
considerable number of bombs scored no
direct hits until 2200, when the hospital ship
TALAMBA, lying illuminated five miles to
seaward of GEORGE sector, was sunk in a
deliberate attack. Another hospital ship,
ABA, was attacked at the same time, but
escaped damage.
