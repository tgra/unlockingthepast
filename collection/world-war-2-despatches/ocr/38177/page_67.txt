SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 1948

9. The defence system Sollum—Capuzzo

—Halfaya—Sidi Omar is well constructed
and strong in anti-tank defence. Frontal
attack should therefore be avoided
initially. It should, however, not

difficult or costly to cut this area off from
the rear arid ‘to sever the Bardia pipeline on
which it depends for water. Any attack on the
rear of these positions will have to be accom-
panied or supported by armoured formations in
view of the presence of the enemy ist
Armoured Division in that area.

It will be necessary to reduce these defences
in due course to open up the direct route, but
once they are isolated this problem should be
easier.

Io. Lines of advance open to us:—
(i) Along coast.
‘@i) Hamra—Sidi Suleiman.
(iii) Bir Sheferzen.
(iv) Fort Maddalena.
{v) Giarabub.

(i) Any advance along the coast is under
observation from the escarpment, and entails
aa enemy positions at their strongest
points

(ii) ‘Was used before, was easily outflanked,
and leaves the forces at Sidi Omar in a position
to act either way, unless other forces are moving
wider south,

(iti) Too close to Sidi Omar ‘for any but a
direct attack on Sidi Omar, etc.

(iv) Advance by Maddalena gives
opportunity of enveloping enemy defences.
This line is, however, within forty miles of Sidi
Omar and, therefore, if used as a line of supply,
as long as the enemy mobile forces remain in
the forward area, Maddalena must be covered.

(v) 450 miles from Bengasi, 180 miles from
west of Tobruk. It offers best opportunity for
surprise, and L. of C. not so vulnerable to air.

11. Broad Plan.

(i) Southern Force—under command
Armoured Corps, to advance from south of
Maddalena. .

7th Armoured Division.

Ist S.A. Division.

zand Guards Brigade.

One extra anti-tank regt.

One medium regt.

Object—

(a) To destroy enemy armoured formations
in region Tobruk.

(b) To relieve Tobruk in conjunction with
an attack by forces in Tobruk.

(ii) Centre Force—initially under command
13th Corps, to advance from Maddalena area.

4th (or 2and) Armoured Brigade.
One sqn. or more armoured cars.
One field regt.

One bty. anti-tank guns.

This force will operate between the northern
and southern forces. Its object will be to find
and .draw off and, if in a position to do so,
attack the enemy armoured formations (at
present enemy 21st Armd. Div.) which may try
to interfere with the operations of the northern
force. Ifthe enemy are met in superior armoured
strength, the object of this brigade group would
be to draw off the enemy armoured formations
in the direction ‘of the southern force, where a

concentration of our armoured forces could be

brought to bear on him.
E2

375-
(iii) Northern Force—x13th Corps.
N.Z. Div.

4th Indian Div.

1st Army Tank Brigade.

One or two army field regts.

Two or three medium regts.

Objects— :

(a) To isolate the enemy forward defences.
by an advance in rear of them from the
south on a north and south axis, and to pin
them from the east.

(b) to clear the enemy from the area be-
tween the forward defences and excl.
Tobruk, thereafter joining hands with our
forces at Tobruk.

(c) In due course to reduce any pockets of:
the enemy left in the forward area.

12. The above plan would be associated with
the formation of a ‘' phantom ’’ force operating
from Giarabub towards Bengasi.

Wireless deception to represent the presence
at Giarabub of a force equivalent to the south-
ern force shown above will be put in hand. A
skeleton force consisting of one or two armoured
car regts. supported by a small composite force
will advance from that area, and bombers will
also be flown down and operated from the
southern route.

13. Opportunity will be taken for exploitation
westwards at the earliest possible moment, é.e.,
as soon as Tobruk and the area east-of it are
secure, and supply arrangements allow. In the
latter connection, it is estimated that a mini-
mum of forty days’ supply will be in Tobruk,
which should allow of the advance westwards
being continued as soon as Eastern Cyrenaica
is secure.

Commanding Eighth Army.

Commander, Ninth Army.

Commander, British Troops in. Egypt.

1. Our primary object at present is to clear
the enemy out of Libya, and to establish our-
selves up to the Tunisian frontier. This object
must be achieved before we have to turn and
resist an attack from the north, which may
eventuate next April.

2. To enable this object to be attained in the
time available, every possible step which can
be taken, and every possible need which can
be foreseen, must be taken and foreseen now.

3. General Cunningham must be given now
all the forces and resources he needs, and he
must retain these for so long as he requires
them.

4. Should the attainment of our object be
retarded, for reasons now unforseeable, until
such time as it becomes evident that we must
turn and prepare to resist attack from the
north, then we may have to stop short in our
offensive in the west. In this event, Genera]
Cunningham will retain the minimum necessary
to enable him .to establish a defensive front in’
Cyrenaica or Bastern Tripolitania, and ithe
maximum force’ which he can release will be-
withdrawn from his command to reinforce the’
Northern Front. “This step will be ‘necessary’:
