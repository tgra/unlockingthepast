3924 SUPPLEMENT to .tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1941

some sectors were held jointly with the French.
The virtual closing of Dunkirk as a port of
entry was making the supply situation ever
more difficult, and the ammunition situation
permitted only of very restricted expenditure.

The Plan for Withdrawal.

. 44. Later, on 26th May, I discussed the plan
for withdrawal with the Corps Commanders, and
issued orders for the operation in accordance

with the agreement reached with General :

Blanchard that morning. The plan, as agreed
with the French First Group of Armies, envisaged
the reservation of certain roads for the exclusive
use of the B.E.F. In fact, however, French

troops and transport continued touse them, and ,

this added very considerably to the difficulties
of the withdrawal of British troops. The roads
were few and for the most part narrow, and for
the next three days they were badly congested
with marching troops and horsed transport of
French formations, and with refugees.

On the night 26th/27th May, rst and and
Corps, leaving rearguards in the frontier defences,
were to swing back to the old divisional reserve
position with their right at Fort Sainghin
(5 miles south-east of Lille), while the French
prolonged this line from Thumeries to the canal
at Pont-4-Vendin, linking up there with 2nd
Division. The following night (27th/28th May),
main bodies were to withdraw behind the Lys,
leaving rearguards on the Deule canal up to its
junction with the Lys at Deulemont: these
rearguards were to stay there until the next night
(28th/2gth May). The immediate effect of
these dispositions would be to shorten the total
perimeter by some 58 miles, but on the other
hand I had to face the possibility of having to
occupy the front from Ypres to the sea, some
25 miles long, which was still the responsibility
of the Belgian Army.

"There remained the question of the future.
I had not so far discussed with General
Blanchard a further withdrawal to the sea.
However, the possibility could not have been
absent from his mind; nor was it absent from
mine, for, although up to now no instructions

been given authorising me to undertake
such an operation, I had, as I have said, foreseen

the possibility of such a move being forced ©

upon us.

I returned from the conference at General
Blanchard’s headquarters at about 10.30 a.m.
on 26th May to find a telegram from the
Secretary of State which read :-—

“JT have had information all of
which goes to show that French offensive
from Somme cannot be made in sufficient
strength to hold any prospect of functioning
with your Allies in the North. Should this
prove to be the case you will be faced with a
situation in which the safety of the B.E.F.
will predominate. In such conditions only
course open to you may be to fight your way
back to West where all beaches and ports
east of Gravelines will be used for embarka-
tion, Navy will provide fleet of ships and
small boats and R.A.F. would give full support.
As withdrawal may have to begin very early
preliminary plans should be urgently prepared.

. Prime Minister is seeing M. Reynaud
to-morrow afternoon when whole situation
will be clarified including attitude of French
to the possible move... .

I replied that a plan for withdrawal north-
westward had been agreed with the French
that morning ; I added that the news from the
Belgian front was disquieting, and concluded
by saying :—

“T must not conceal from you that

a great part of the B.E.F. and its equipment

will ‘inevitably be lost even in best circum-

stances.”

Later in the day, I had a further teregram
from the War Office which read as follows :-—
“|. . Prime Minister had conversation
M. Reynaud this afternoon. Latter fully
explained to him the situation and resources
French Army. It is clear that it will not be
possible for French to deliver attack on the
south in sufficient strength to enable them to-
effect junction with Northern Armies. In
these circumstances no course open to you
but to fall back upon coast. M. Reynaud
communicating General Weygand and latter
will no doubt issue orders in this sense
forthwith. You are now authorised to
operate towards coast forthwith in con-
junction with French and Belgian Armies.”

The Situation of the Belgian Army.

45. The situation on the Belgian’ front was
causing me ever increasing anxiety. At the
conference at Ypres on the evening of 21st May,
His Majesty the King of the Belgians had agreed
that, if forced to abandon the positions on the
Lys, he would withdraw to the Yser, maintaining
touch with the left of the B.E.F. Now, however,
signs were not wanting that the Belgian Army
were being forced to withdraw northwards and
away from the Yser canal. If so, the task of
defending the whole line as far as the sea
appeared likely to fall on ourselves and the
French, as actually did happen.

Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes, who
had been carrying out liaison duties with
HLM. the King of the Belgians since the opera-
tions began, came to G.H.Q. on the morning of ©
26th May, and I expressed to him my earnest
hope that the Belgian Army would fall back
towards the Yser. Sir Roger Keyes took this
message back to the Belgian G.Q.G. at Bruges,
where he saw His Majesty. Later he telegraphed
to me saying that the Belgians would do their
best, but that His Majesty considered that the
only method of avoiding immediate and com-
plete disaster was a strong and immediate
counter offensive between the Lys and the
Escaut. Such an operation was, however, quite
out of the question since, now that 5th and
50th Divisions had been committed, my reserves
were again reduced to one weak cavalry
regiment.

The indication that the Belgian Army would
withdraw northwards and not to the Yser, was
confirmed in a note, a copy of which I received,
sent on 26th May by General Michiels, pe :
Chief of the Staff of the Belgian Army, t
General Neissens, head of the Belgian Mission

_ with G.EQ.

This note contained the following passage :—

. . "To-day, 26th May the Belgian Army

is being attacked with extreme violence on
the front Menin—Nevele,* and since the

. battle is now spreading to the whole of the
area of Eecloo, the lack of Belgian reserves

- * Eight miles west of Ghent.
