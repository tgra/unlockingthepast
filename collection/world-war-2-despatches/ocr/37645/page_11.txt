SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON

Throughout the hours of daylight no movement
of man, beast, or vehicle was possible unseen
from at least one and usually many enemy view
points. The valley was of sand and gravel,
with sparse scrub and occasional tebeldi trees
affording, in places, some cover from direct
observation to men at rest and guns.

The valley varies in width from half-a-mile
to a mile-and-a-half. The road runs along the
south side until opposite M. Dologorodoc where
it turns sharply north over a bridge, and, after
climbing the lower slopes of this hill, enters the
Dongolaas gorge. Up this narrow slit in the
hills, nowhere more than 300 yards wide, the
road climbs to the higher level of the plain of
Keren.

Below Fort Dologorodoc and east of where
the road crosses the valley is a wide amphi-
theatre known as the Happy Valley. The only
entrance for wheeled-traffic is over the bridge
at the commer where the road turns north. In
the north wall of this cup is the Acqua gap,
really only a lessening of height and steepness,
down which the rain water from the plain of
Keren makes its way. This gap is flanked
on the east by M. Zelale, a thigh, rocky
hill known from its shape as ‘‘ The Sphinx ’’.

Fort Dologorodoc, guarding the entrance of
the Dongolaas gorge is itself overlooked on the
east, north-east and north-west by’? Mts.
Falestoh, Zeban and Sanchil. From all of these
fire could be brought on to the Fort. Troops
on M. Dologorodoc could never be out of sight
of at least one of these.

North-westwards from M. Sanchil the series
of features, Brigs Peak, Sugar Loaf, Saddle,
Near Feature, Hogs Back, Flat Top Hill,
Molehill, M. Samanna and North of
Saddle, M. Amba, were all the scenes
of serious fighting. These mountains are very
steep. Their slopes are covered with large
boulders and scrub. There were no paths up
them when the troops first arrived. As an indi-
cation of their size and steepness, it was a good
hour-and-a-quarter’s walk to the gunner O.P.
on Rajputana Ridge which is itself only half
way up Brigs Peak. The railway from Agordat
to Keren runs along the north side of the valley,
and by the time it reaches Dongolaas gorge has
climbed a third of the way up the lower slopes
of M. Sanchil. A man standing in the valley
sees the railway clinging, high up, to the hill-
sides above him. This railway was subse-
quently of great assistance to 4th Indian
Division in maintaining the troops ‘holding the
heights.

At the time of the fall of Agordat the garrison
of Keren was known to be one Colonial Brigade,
and it was hoped that by moving rapidly, the
town might be reached before reinforcements
could arrive. By 2nd February it was dis-
covered that one other Colonial Brigade and
part of the Grenadier Division from Addis
Ababa had been brought up. In the first rush
Gazelle Force reached the road-block in the
Dongolaas gorge. This was a formidable
demolition covered by fire, and situated on the
west side of Fort Dologorodoc. Once the
enemy were in position it was difficult to get
a view of this road-block from any point in the
battlefield, except Cameron Ridge (a sub-feature
of M. Sanchil). A detailed reconnaissance was,
thereafter, only possible inside an ‘‘I’’ tank.
rrth Indian Infantry Brigade was moving

behind Gazelle with 2 Camerons embussed.
On 3rd February the ‘‘ I” tanks made a deter-
mined attack upon the road-block but were
unable to' get past. 2 Camerons went up the
hill on the left towards Brigs Peak and secured
Cameron Ridge. Skinner’s Horse secured the
right flank and a battalion was sent into Happy
Valley to try and find a way round the right.

Factors Affecting the Decision to Fight at
Keren.

The storming of the Keren position was no
light task. Its natural strength, the difficulties
of maintenance and the climatic conditions had
to be faced. Every day the temperature was
rising. _A numerically superior enemy had
chosen Keren as the ground on which to fight
what might prove to be a decisive battle. The
enemy had every advantage of observation and
possessed a still strong and active air force.
Gaining surprise was unjikely. The forcing of
Keren was bound to mean hard fighting and
casualties which would be difficult to replace.
The desirability of finding a way round was
obvious. From almost the day of the first
contact at Keren continuous and wide recon-
naissances were made to north and south
seeking an alternative way through the escarp-
ment wall. 3 Central India Horse searched
south for 60 miles until.making contact with
No. 2 Motor Machine Gun Group S.D.F. which
was facing Arresa. At Arresa was a possible
gap, but the route had proved so difficult that
the retreating: Italians from Barentu ‘thad been
forced to abandon all their vehicles. Now, not
only were there the natural difficulties, but the
way was blocked by enemy forces. No road
capable of maintaining a force strong enough to
fight its way through existed from Barentu, and
the time it would take to build one would allow
the enemy to make the Arresa position as for-
midable as Keren, A successful attack here
would not return the same dividend as at
Keren. Rain would bring M.T. moving
between Barentu and Arresa to a stand-still, No
way was found to the north either. It became
clear that Keren is the only practicable
approach to the higher levels of the escarpment
for a force of any size.

First Attack on Acqua Gap.

By 6th February, as the situation in Agordat
was quite calm, 5th Indian Infantry Brigade,
less one battalion, was moved forward to the
Keren area with the intention of attacking
round the right flank through Happy Valley
and Acqua gap. The difficulties of this opera-
tion will be appreciated when it is realised that
throughout the entire battle the enemy had
the high ground, and all movements, whether
in M.T. or on foot, were clearly visible to his
O.Ps. O.Ps. on Fort Dologorodoc and M.
Sanchil have the road almost in enfilade for
miles. O.Ps. on M. Samanna and M. Amba
overlooked all administrative areas of the for-
ward brigades. During the night 4/5th
February, 3/14 Punjab Regiment went through
2 Camerons on Cameron Ridge and occupied
Brigs Peak, but were driven off on the after-
noon of the next ‘day. “1/6 Rajputana Rifles
occupied the extension of Cameron Ridge south
of Brigs Peak, and although severely counter-
attacked, held on. Throughout all this early
period of the battle, the enemy wes being
rapidly reinforced, and was counter-attacking
