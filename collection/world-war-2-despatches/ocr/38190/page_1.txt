OPERATIONS IN HONG KONG From 8TH TO 25TH DECEMBER, Ig4I

The following Despatch was submitted to the
Secretary of State for War, on aist
November 1945, by MAJOR-GENERAL
C. M. MALTBY, M.C., late G.O.C., British
Troops in China.

Sir,

I have the honour to address you on the
subject of the operations in Hong Kong in
December, 1941, and to forward herewith an
account of the operations which took place at
Hong Kong between 8th and 25th December,
Ig4r.

2. In normal circumstances this despatch
would have been submitted through Head-
quarters, Far East, but in the circumstances in
which I am now placed I consider that it would
be better, after this long lapse of time, to sub-
mit it to you direct.

3. Before beginning my account of the opera-
tions themselves, I feel it to be my duty, both
to myself and the forces under my command, to
place on record certain points. Of these you
will ‘be fully cognizant, but to compilers of
history they may not be so obvious.

4. The defences of this.Colony were on a
limited scale, -with the object of denying the
charbour ‘to an enemy rather than retaining the
“harbour for the use of our fleet. ‘This object,
scorabined: with the! forces available, necessitated
a plan to defend the Island of Hong Kong only.
The arrival of two Canadian battalions on the
16th November, 1941, caused me to alter my
plan to a certain degree. I placed one brigade,
with a proportion of mobile artillery under com-
mand, on the mainland to prepare and defend

the so-called ‘‘ Gindrinkers’ Line,’’ with the
hope that, given a certain amount of time and
if the enemy did not launch a major offensive
there, Kowloon, the harbour and the northern
portion of the island would not be subjected to
artillery fire directed from the land. Time was
also of vital importance to complete demolitions
of fuel stores, power houses, docks, wharves,
etc., on the mainland; to clear certain food
stocks and vital necessities from the mainland
to the island; to sink shipping and lighters and
to clear the harbour of thousands of junks and
sampans. It will be appreciated that to take
such irrevocable and expensive steps as men-
tioriéd*"in the foregoing sentence was impossible
until it was definitely known that war with
Japan was inevitable.

5. That war was inevitable seemed clear to
me {{ had all my forces deployed in their battle
positions in ample time, but it was hard to
make that definite statement on the informa-
tion available, with the result that the civil
authorities felt that they were not in a position
to put into full force all the-numerous measures
required during the preliminary or the pre-
cautionary period of .the Civil gRefence lan.
For this state of affairs¥1 ritStWolangé Wire

(a) The -general sa@itibt that Japan would
ee war against: the Allied wowers.

(b) The weakness of diir ‘intelligence
system.

(c) The belief that Japan was bluffing and
would continue to bluff to the last. The
true gravity of the state of affairs was not
reflected in the embassy despatches from
Tokyo.
