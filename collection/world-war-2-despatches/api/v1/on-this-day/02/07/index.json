From an early hour on the 6th February the enemy main columns began to appear, and severe fighting occurred throughout the day as successive enemy groups, including a large number of tanks, attempted unsuccessfully to break through the 4th Armoured Brigade, later reinforced by 7th Armoured Brigade (rst R.T.R.) as more and more enemy tanks continued to appear 84 were put out of action during the day's fighting. By nightfall the situation was unchanged. The enemy's position was desperate, with a confused mass of vehicles almost 20 miles in length pinned to the roads between our Armoured Brigades in the South and the Northern detachment in the Soluch area, now beginning to turn South-West. Certain enemy groups had, however, managed to evade the 4th Armoured Brigade by moving through the sand dune area between the main road and the sea. One group in particular, consisting of tanks strongly supported by infantry, repeatedly attacked the Southern detachment, now reinforced by a third R.H.A. battery, during the night 6th/7th February and early morning 7th February, In all nine attacks were delivered against 2nd Rifle Brigade, and"

In actual fact the stubborn resistance of 1 Division and counter-attacks by 45 United States Division meant that five days of heavy fighting were necessary before the objective was secured on the x2th. VI Corps was now back on its   intermediate   line astride the Anzio-Albano road and it was clear that this road would be the axis of the enemy's main attack. To meet it VI Corps relieved 1 Division and handed over the sector to 56 and 45 United States Divisions. On. 17th February General Truscott, Commander of 3 United States Division* was appointed Deputy Commander of the Corps. He directed, with great success, the defence against the great Gemman counter-offensive and on the 23rd succeeded General Lucas as Corps Commander. It was a new r le, for General Truscott had made his reputation, and continued to increase it, as a dashing commander of hard-hitting offensives; indeed the defence was a new r le altogether for our armies in Italy. The troops showed, however, that they were fully equal to the demands made on them, encouraged by the massive support of our concentrated artillery fire, which was augmented by the big guns of the Allied Navies and the bombs and machinegun fire of the Air Forces,"
