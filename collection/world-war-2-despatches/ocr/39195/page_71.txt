SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

414. There can be few campaigns in history,
fought under such adverse conditions, in which
the general health of large armies was main-
tained at such a high level. It must not be
forgotten that the primary function of the
medical services is officially defined as the
maintenance of health and prevention of
disease, a function which in popular esteem
tends to get lost sight of or overshadowed by
the glamour of their other duties in tending the
sick and wounded.

415. Turning to the other services, our
Provost resources were seriously strained
during the period under review, and great diffi-
culty was experienced in the provision of
trained personnel and of certain items of stores,
particularly traffic control and signal equip-
ment, also of vehicles of the correct type. With
the rapid advance over difficult terrain, and
the opposed crossings of the Chindwin and
Irrawaddy, the control of traffic became a
major problem. It was largely solved by the
use of light aircraft under the direction of the
Assistant Provost Marshal. - Communications
between ground and air were successfully main-
tained and outstanding results were achieved.

416. The question of Welfare was one to
which I devoted much time and thought. Its
importance was great, particularly owing to the
total lack of amenities or even civilization to be
found in the majority of the operational areas.
Furthermore, short leave was a greater rarity in
this theatre than in others owing to the length
of time it took to send parties to and from
India. Its importance was great for the
numerous Indian troops, but even more so for
the British and African soldiers serving in a
land other than their own.

Leave hostels and camps were established for
all ranks at suitable centres in India, through
the efforts of India Command and the numer-
ous voluntary workers who helped to run them.
Further, many residents in India extended the
hospitality of their homes to both officers and
other ranks. I should like here to pay tribute
to all those who helped in these ways.

Leave centres and clubs were planned for
future establishment in Burma at such places
as Maymyo, Mandalay and Rangoon, as were
Amenity Store Depots which enabled troops
whether British, Indian or African to purchase
essential and other articles, which the country
in which they were fighting could not supply.
A great deal of welfare work was necessary in
Rangoon ; and careful forethought and plan-
ning was needed to ensure that sufficient per-
sonnel and equipment were brought in at once,
by sea and air, to open several welfare centres
within a few weeks of the capture of the city.

A large and increasing number of officers
were employed by the Welfare Service, and re-
sults were continually more apparent. The
introduction of the various women’s services
was both popular and successful, and the work
done by the Women’s Voluntary Service, the
Women’s Auxiliary Service (Burma) and by
welfare workers of the First Aid Nursing Yeo-
manry was greatly appreciated by the troops of
all the Allies.

Many philanthropic bodies sent their repre-
sentatives to this theatre of war and did ex-
cellent work catering for ithe needs of the
troops. Units of the Soldiers’, Sailors’, and
Airmen’s Families Association and of the In-
corporated Soldiers’ Sailors’ and Airmen’s

Help Society looked after the troops’ personal
interests in connection with their family affairs
in the United Kingdom. I would like to mep-
tion, in particular, the Y.W.C.A. without whose
work it would have been impossible to bring
many women helpers of other organizations
concerned into Rangoon.

There was a steady increase in the number of
artistes sent out by E.N.S.A. for “live” enter-
tainment and the standard was improved.
That many “ Stars” came out, was usually the
result of personal letters to them. The Faiye
Dilhust Shabah organized by India Command
provided live entertainment for Indian troops.
The transport for entertainment parties, includ-
ing air transport represented considerable effort.
It was difficult to bring cinema shows up to
the standard I should have liked, for many
reasons. Indian films were provided for the
Indian, troops.

Radio distribution vans were of value in
broadcasting music and records to isolated
units. Broadcasting was supplied at first from
Delhi and later from Radio SEAC, but unfor-
tunately the supply of wireless sets failed by
thousands to reach the entitlement figure fixed
by the War Office.

An adequate supply of reading matter was of
first importance. Daily news was catered for
by the newspaper SEAC, whose paid sales ex-
ceeded 20,000 a day in Fourteenth Army
alone. A weekly magazine “ Phoenix ” started
publication in February. The first consignment
of 11,300 copies of Sunday newspapers from
the United Kingdom was flown in in the Spring
of 1945, and was very popular, troops being
able to zead their home papers only 7 days after
publication. Reading matter for Indian troops
presented special difficulties owing to differ-
ences of language.

Of welfare equipment generally, sports gear
was satisfactory as a great amount was made
in India, but gramophones, wireless sets (as
already mentioned) and musical instruments
were always in short supply and were many
thousands below the target figure laid down.

417. The work of registration and concentra-
tion of the graves of battle casualties was kept
well up to date. The Graves Registration Ser-
vice had the important task of tracing missing
and deceased prisoners of war, and a start was
made to clarify the situation regarding Ran-
goon gaol, in which many Allied prisoners were
held captive.

: 418. Army Educational Corps personnel
have been primarily concerned with the pro-
duction of daily news-sheets including some in
the vernacular, which have kept the troops
informed about their own and other war fronts,
and in touch with home news and developments.
Tackling the important task of the primary
education of Indian troops has, of course, only
been possible when formations have been with-
drawn from active operations. A start was also
made on post-war education to assist the soldier
in learning or re-learning trades for civil life.

419. Finally, I will add a note on the work
of the Royal Army Pay Corps and its Indian
equivalent. Their task has been no easy one.
During the Burma campaign, neither banks .
nor treasuries were available, and all the cash
required for the Forces had to be taken into the
country. The bulk of this was flown in and
