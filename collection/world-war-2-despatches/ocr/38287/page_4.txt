LH. M. S. ST. ANGELO.
rzth April, I94I.

I have the honour to submit the: following
report in regard to the ‘circumstances which
Jed up to the sinking of H.M.S. MOHAWK at
0241 on 16th April, 1947.

2., At 0045, MOHAWK was in company with
JERVIS (Captain (D), Fourteenth Destroyer
Flotilla), JANUS and NUBIAN, ‘steering 330
degrees, speed 20 knots.:

At 0130, suspicious objec were sighted on
the port bow and course was altered to close
from northward, speed, being increased to 25
knots.

3. At 0145, these objects were made out to
be a convoy of five merchant ships, screéned
by three destroyers, and JERVIS led round
_s0 as to close on the starboard quarter, opening
fire on the. nearest screening destroyer at 0205.

This destroyer was' quickly hit and disabled
and MOHAWK engaged the rear merchant
ship, opening fire a few minutes later.. This
ship was, hit at the second salvo and burned

fiercely and fire was checked after firing about’ *

eight salvos.

4. Fire was opened spasmodically for the
next few minutes, as the merchant ships were
being repeatedly hit by the destroyers ahead
of MOHAWK and J did not wish to waste
ammunition.

At 0243, an enemy destroyér of. the
Navigatori class was sighted on the starboard
bow, steering an opposite and parallel course
at high speed. She was immediately engaged
by NUBIAN and MOHAWK, hit and set on
fire and ‘was last seen atopped and on fire about
a mile astern.

. 5. At 0230, NUBIAN led round to port across
the bow of the ‘leading merchantman, who

immediately altered .course to starboard and:

tried ‘to ram MOHAWK. This ship appeared

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 MAY, 1948

to be quite undamaged and’ on avoiding her
and crossing over to the port side, I turned to
starboard with the object of engaging and sink-’
ing her.
- 6. As the ship was still under helm and turn-
ing to starboard, a torpedo struck on the star-
board side abreast ‘‘ Y ’’ gun, blowing away -
the after part of the ship from just forward
of. this gun. The ship was at once stopped
and I ordered the Engineer Officer to report
to me as to the extent of the damage.

The foremost group of guns then opened fire
on the merchant ship in Director firing and
hits were at once obtained, the ship catching

_fire‘and stopping. No ship could bé seen in

the vicinity which could have fired. this tor-

“pedo, apart from’ the enemy destroyer who was

stopped and on fire over a mile astern of ©
MOHAWK, and I came to the conclusion that

“it must have been a’ stray torpedo fired by

this, vessel, possibly with the object of getting
tid of top-weight.
7. The Engineer Officer then reported to

-me that although most of the stern had been

blown away, the propeller shafts, and propellers
were still in place and’ that he would try to
move them and get way on the ship.

About five minutes after the first torpedo had
struck, a second one struck MOHAWK on the
port side approximately on the bulkhead
separating Nos. 2 and 3 boilerrooms. The ship
commenced to settle rapidly on an even keel
and I ordered all hands on deck..

Less than a minute after this order had been
given,.the ship took up a very heavy list to
port and settled on her beam ends with the
after parts submerged as far as the after end
of the torpedo tubes. The order was then given
to abandon ship as I considered that it was only
a matter of. minutes before the ship. sank. .

8. Six Carley floats were got out and manned,
the remainder of ‘the hands jumping into the sea.
Tt was not possible to lower the boats owing _
to the rapid listing of the ship. but the hands -
abandoned ship in an orderly manner and I
consider-that under the .circumstances it was
not possible to get out the rémainder of the |
Carley floats. :

. The approximate position in which ‘the ship
was torpedoed was 34 degs. 56 ming. North, 11
degs. 42 mins. East. The depth of water, in
ms position was seven fathoms.

The survivors were eventually picked up
~s JERVIS and NUBIAN and the forepart of

-the forecastle of the MOHAWK which still re-

mained above water was sunk by JANUS.

zo,.I cannot pay too high a tribute to-‘the
way officers and men behaved. during the
action. The foremost group fired rapidly and
accurately after the ship had been torpedoed
and the spirit of the men in the water was
admirable.
