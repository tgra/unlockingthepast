Torpedoes were observed to be dropped from
a greater height than that in most of the day
attacks. '

116. Gunfire—On several occasions the
cruisers leading the columns were prevented
from firing a barrage by the destroyers
adjacent to them."

Gun flashes probably showed the convoy up
to aircraft manceuvring to attack. Flashless
charges would be most useful for barrage fire
at night.

ZULU sustained superficial damage from
splinters, but no casualties,

Loss of M.V. IMPERIAL STAR.

117. When IMPERIAL STAR was torpedoed
at 2032 it is probable that the explosion blew
away both propellers and her rudder; in addi-
tion No. 6 hold and the after engine room were
both flooded.

118. HEYTHROP, the rear ship of the port
screen, proceeded alongside, but did not
attempt to take IMPERIAL STAR in tow as
she did not consider she was a suitable vessel
to do so.

11g. About 2045 EURALYUS ordered
ORIBI to go to the assistance of IMPERIAL
STAR. When ORIBI closed, HEYTHROP
was already standing by, and while HEY-
THROP took off IMPERIAL STAR’s pas-
sengers, ORIBI proceeded close alongside to
obtain reports from the Master and the
N.L.O.f

They were first insistent that an attempt
should be made to tow the vessel back to
Gibraltar, but the Commanding Officer of
ORIBI (Lieutenant-Commander J. E. H.
McBeath, D.S.O., R.N.) realised that the only
chance of saving the ship was to tow her the
220 miles to Malta, and prepared to do so.

120, HEYTHROP parted company at 2200
to rejoin the convoy. By 2235 ORIBI had
IMPERIAL STAR in tow with go fathoms of
special 5-inch wire hawser provided by
IMPERIAL STAR.

121. For two hours the most determined
attempts were made by ORIBI to tow IM-
PERIAL STAR towards Malta. Although a
speed of 8 knots through the water was made
nothing would prevent her steering in circles,

IMPERIAL STAR’s normal displacement
was 17,000 tons; in her damaged condition she
was drawing 38 feet aft, and it is possible that
her damaged stern was acting asa rudder. ,

122. Eventually, at orzo, ORIBI foand
herself being dragged stern first by her tow
sheering off, and was forced to slip the tow.

ORIBI then went alongside to consult again
with the Master and N.L.O. It was reluctantly
decided that 1t was impracticable to tow the
ship without tugs, which were not available at
Malta, and that the remaining 141 persons
aboard should be taken off by ORIBI and the
ship scuttled.

Scuttling arrangements were not in place,
and most of the flooding valves were jarmmed
by the torpedo explosion; ORIBJ therefore
Placed 3 depth charges lashed together just

below the waterline abreast a bulkhead, and
these were fired by a safety fuse.

123. ORIBI cast off at 0340 and the charges
fired 11 minutes later, starting a large fire aft.
As this did not spread quickly, ORIBI
shelled IMPERIAL STAR with 4.7-inch
S.A.P. shell*, and left her at 0452, heavily on
fire fore and aft and listing badly.

Aircraft from Malta sent to search for
IMPERIAL STAR the next day failed to find
any trace, and there can be no doubt that she
sank or blew up.

route at 32 knots, and came up with them off
Malta at 1215, having passed unmolested within
7 miles of the Sicilian coast in daylight.

Passage of Force X and Convoy through the’

Narrows.

125. Meanwhile Force X proceeded through ,
the Narrows by the route previously arranged,’
t.e., along the south coast of Sicily. During
the afternoon I had suggested to Rear-Admiral
Commanding, xoth Cruiser Squadron the
advisability of taking the Tunisian route owing
to the presence of enemy forces in the
vicinity. Rear-Admiral Commanding, 1oth
Cruiser Squadron replied that he preferred the
Sicilian route, and in view of the enemy’s
hurried withdrawal to the -north-east I agreed.

126. HERMIONE parted company from the
convoy at 2030 to carry out a bombardment of
Pantellaria harbour. A detailed account of this
operation, which was very skilfully planned and
executed by HERMIONE (Captain G. N.
Oliver, R.N.) 1s contained in HERMIONE’s
report. Rear-Admiral Commanding, roth
Cruiser Squadron reports that the bombard-
ment caused a most spectacular diversion which
was clearly visible from the convoy and escort,
then distant 50 miles.

127. No opposition was encountered by the
convoy after the conclusion of the T/B attacks
at 2040. The following lights on the Sicilian
coast were seen to be exhibiting normal charac-
teristics:—Admiralty List of Lights No. 1928
Cape San Marco, No. 1930 Cape Granitola,
No. 1962 Cape Grosso.

128. At some time between’ 2000/27 and
0030/28, HERMIONE lost her port paravane.
From the state of the end of the wire recovered
there is little doubt that it was cut by an
explosive cutter or other anti-sweep device.
The route followed was identical with that taken
by HERMIONE during Operation ‘‘ Sub-
stance’’, on which occasion the starboard
paravane towing wire when recovered at Malta
was severely crippled and showed signs of
having fouled a mine mooring. It therefore
appears possible that a minefield exists on the
Talbot Bank, the depth there being consider-
ably less than too fathoms. This occurrence
was reported in my message 0931 of 6th
October.

129. HERMIONE rejoined at 0615/28. At

daylight HEYTHROP and FARNDALE were
detached to proceed ahead to fuel at Malta.
_ 130. Although several formations of enemy
aircraft were detected between dawn and the
arrival of the convoy at Malta, the excellent
protection given by shore-based fighters from
Malta prevented any attack from developing.
