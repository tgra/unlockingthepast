4010 SUPPLEMENT ‘to tut LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JULY, 1948

6. At 0837 DEVONSHIRE fired two salvos
spread to the right and left My object was—

(a) to provoke a return fire and so estab-
lish her identity beyond doubt, or

(b) to induce her to abandon ship in order
to avoid bloodshed, particularly as she might
have a number of British prisoners on board.

The enemy stopped and turned round and at
0840 transmitted a raider report on 500 kc/s in
the form ‘‘RRR RRR RRR de FOLY-
PHEMUS 04 degs. 20 mins. South, 18 degs.
35 mins. West 0940 GMT.’’

It was noted that—

(a) no signal letters were included. and

(6) that three “‘R’’s were transmitted in
a group and noi four.

7. The possibihty of the ship being in fact
the POLYPHEMUS had now to be considered.
Talbot Booth showed a ship ¢” similar appear-
ance but with a counter stern Admuralty’s
signal timed 1134A/22nd October indicated that
she was at Balboa on 21st September, and
therefore within reach of my position To re-
move what little doubt remained I signalled
at 0905 ‘‘Is POLYPHEMUS genuine? ’’ and
at 0934 received your reply ‘‘ No repetition
no”. In the meantime a signal was passed
to the aircraft—‘* What type of stern has she
gol?’’ and the reply “Cruiser stern—-hull
similar to ATLANTIS ’’ was received at 0931.

8. At 0935 DEVONSHIRE opened fire to
destroy the enemy raider. The range was
17,500 yards The fourth salvo scored a hit
in number two hold setting it on fire and
subsequently blowing up the magazine. Thirty
salvos were fired in all. The enemy turned
away and started a very efficient chloro-
sulphonic smoke screen from her stern and
from ‘both sides abreast the bndge. She also
abandoned ship. No attempt was made to
return my fire. Owing to the smoke I checked
fire at 0939 and altered course to the east-
wards to regain bearing and get clear of the
smoke. Indirect fire using R.D.F.* ranging
was attempted but failed owing to the break-
down of the R D.F. .transmitter through gun
blast and of the aircraft’s W/T generator
owing to a short circuit. At 0943 the target
was again visible and fire was re-opened and
maintained until 0956 when the ship was seen
to be badly on fire forward and down by the
stern. The necessity for this latter burst of
fire was a report by the aircraft that she was
still proceeding at 15 knots.

g. DEVONSHIRE turned away on ceasing
fire. The raider had consistently attempted
to draw me in a south easterly direction and
I was determined to make no more ground
in that direction than I could help. At roo2
her magazine blew up and it was clear that
no further offensive action was necessary. At
1005 the situation was reported to you There
was another heavy explosion at 1014 and the
raider sank at 1016.

Io My next action was to recover the air-
craft. She had been in the air for two hours
with a damaged propeller, temporarily repaired
on board, which I knew was causing excessive
vibration and which might precipitate a forced
Janding at any moment. The wind and sea

Admiralty footnote —
* RD F—radar

were on the increase. The ship proceeded to
the north west and made a successful recovery
at Io40.

ur. After receiving verbal reports from the
pilot and observer I had no further doubt
regarding the identity of the raider and was
almost certain that a U-Boat had been present.
Unquestionably it was impossible to rescue the
survivors without grave risk of being
torpedoed.* The reasons for abandomng the
boats were as follows:—

(a) the identity of the raider and
Admuralty’s signal timed 1218A /2tst Novem-
ber reporting that U-Boats had been used as
escorts for returning raiders;

(0) two large patches of oil on the water,

(c) a lifeboat filled with oil drums cast
adrift shortly after my arrival,

(d) the movements of the raider. She
was head to wind when sighted and sub-
sequently made good no more than 2$ miles
to the south east although she was reported
to have steamed as fast as 15 knots;

(e) the character of the Captain descnbed
in the supplement to Weekly Intelligence
Report No. 64, page 8, paragraph 13, and
the fact that he did not return my fire;

(f) the unreliabihty of my aircraft and
lack of any other A/S protection.

REPORT OF THE SINKING OF THE
GERMAN SUPPLY SHIP PYTHON.

The following Despatch was submitted to the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on
the 29th December, 1941, by Vice-Admiral
A. U. Willis, .C.B., D.S O., Commander-m-
Chief, South Atlantic Station.

South Atlantic,
29th December, 1941.

Forwarded for the information of Their
Lordships.

2. The strategical effect of this sinking com-
bined with that by H.M.S. DEVONSHIRE
on 23rd November thas been considerable, for
the submarine threat to shipping in the Cape
area has—at any rate temporarily—been
removed.

3. After DORSETSHIRE had, quite rightly,
left them, efforts were made to regain touch
with the survivors’ boats by means of the
corvettes ASTER and MARGUERITE who
were ordered to pass through the area of the
sinking on 8th December, on passage to the
Cape. This came to nothing and no positive
information has been obtained as to the fate
of the suryivors.

4. The U-Boats, known to have been in the
vicinity by the attacks on S.S. CLAN MAC-
BEAN on the 3rd December and on the U.S.
ship SAGADAHOC on 3rd December, were
tracked on their northward passage by Ad-
miralty estimated dispositions and by D/F

Admuralty footnote —

* After the raider had sunk, the survivors in her
Jaden boats were met by submammes and later by the
supply ship PYTHON so that, in the event, they were
rescued, though not as prisoners
