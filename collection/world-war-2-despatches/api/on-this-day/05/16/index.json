            "description": "The prospect of securing the reinforcement of the Armoured Division had likewise become remote.  I had been advised that two Armoured Brigades. of this division would disembark at Havre on 16th May, and were to concentrate at Bolbec, and I had therefore sent instructions by the hand of a staff officer to the Commander (Major-General R. Evans). He was to move the leading brigade on disembarkation with all speed to secure the crossings of the Somme west of Amiens, from Picquigny to Pont R my, both inclusive, with a view to the concentration of the remaining -brigade behind the Somme and the move of his division to join the main body of the B.E.F. However, in the meantime, orders had been issued locally to concentrate the Division south of the Seine, and the plan to cross the Somme and join the B.E.F. proved impossible to execute. The division therefore remained in the Lines of Communication Area and never came under my effective command.",

For this reason the accounts of the operations on the two fronts cannot but be intermingled at certain points in the narrative. Broadly speaking, however, three distinct phases can be distinguished. First, the advance to the Dyle from roth-16th May ; then from r7th-26th May the withdrawal from the Dyle to the Escaut, the defence of the ian frontier and of the southern and western flanks ; and finally the withdrawal and embarkation of the Force from 27th-31st May.",

H.Q. Frontier Battalion reached the outskirts of Debra Tabor on 7th May and from then until arrival of 4 Company on 16th May, in spite of continual rain, inadequate clothing and cover, and much lameness caused by jigger sores, they maintained systematic nightly bombing attacks on the Debra Tabor garrison, which consisted of two Blackshirt and two Colonial battalions and a regular Banda group. 4 Company continued the work with mortar support until 2oth May, when the battalion was ordered to Dessie, much to the regret of the commander, who, after an exchange of correspondence with Colonel Angelini, commanding the Debra Tabor garrison, believed, that in spite of his instructions to hold out to the last man, Angelini would have surrendered with a little more pushing. Major Simonds was withdrawn at the same time. Debra Tabor did not fall until the beginning of July 1943, but it remained isolated throughout the intervening period as a result of the work of Beghemder Force and the Frontier Battalion.",

The problem of command was difficult, particularly in regard to artillery support, while the South Africans were advancing from the south side of the hill. Throughout 14th May the South African Brigade advanced towards Triangle, the big feature overlooking the pass from the south-east. Assisted iby the Patriots, who, in this area, did excellent work, the Triangle was captured by o800 hours on 15th May, finally closing the circle. This made further resistance by the enemy merely useless waste of life, and, on 16th May, an armistice was asked for and granted. Subsequent negotiations resulted in the unconditional surrender of the Italian garrison who were granted the honours of war. .",

A fanatical sect of Moslems known as the Hurs had long terrorised a considerable district through which the main line from the port of Karachi runs. On the 16th May, r942, a gang of Hurs derailed the mail train from Karachi and then attacked it. It was impossible to tolerate such dangerous lawlessness on one of the principal lines of communication in India. Since the police and civil authorities were unable to deal with the situation, a military force was sent and martial Jaw declared. Major-General R. Richardson, M.C.. was appointed Military Administrator. Under his able direction the situation soon improved, but so deep-seated was the terrorism of the Hurs, and so difficult the country, which contains large areas of marsh and of desert, that the troops were still employed at the end of the year.",

It proved quicker to repair existing installations than to erect new ones, and further repairs were continued; although not completed by the end of the Tunisian campaign, a total of 26,000 tons of petrol storage was in use by the end of May. In addition, a tin factory was despatched to Tripoli and erected there, but was not in use until 16th May. By that date it was too late to be of use in the Tunisian campaign, but proved of great value for subsequent maintenance of the line of communication and for building up reserves in preparation for the invasion of Sicily.",

On 16th May I was informed that it had been further postponed till mid-June. This removed almost all the value of the operation as by that time our troops, advancing overland, would be almost level with the island and on rath June I asked whether the forces earmarked for Elba could not rather be used for a landing on the  mainland in support of Fifth Army. However, this was considered unacceptable as the French would not consent to the use in Italy of  g Colonial Infantry Division, which they wanted to keep for the landings in France. The operation therefore went in as planned in the early morning of 17th June; the occupation of the island was complete by the afternoon of the roth. Steps were taken to emplace medium guns in the north-eastern corner of the island to command Piombino but the town fell on 25th June without the necessity for their use.",
