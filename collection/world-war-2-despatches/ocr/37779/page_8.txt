SECOND PHASE.—PERIOD 26TH DECEM-
BER, 1942--27TH MARCH, 1943.

On ist January, 1943, I outlined to 5 Corps
its future policy as under: — P
(2) To contain the enemy by constant pres-
sure and, by limited attacks, to seize ground
required to facilitate a later offensive; plans
for which were to be prepared. All attacks
to have maximum artillery support. To be
ready to advance, even without armour, if
the enemy moved troops away southwards.
(0) To help the French as far south as
Pont du Fahs in every way possible.
(c) To push on with the construction of
airfields.

Widespread enemy parachute activities
against my lines of communication during
December accomplished little damage. On 1st
January, 1943, Allied Force Headquarters
assumed control of the lines of communication
up to inclusive Bone—exclusive Constantine,
thereby affording much needed relief to my
administrative staff.

In the early stages of preparation for the
United States 2 Corps operation against Sfax
I took no active part, though First Army had
to assume full responsibility for all mainten-
ance arrangements, dumping programmes, &c.
The attack was, however, eventually cancelled
by the Commander-in-Chief, about the middle
of January.

Meanwhile, on 3rd January, an attack by 36
Infantry Brigade to capture the dominating
enemy positions on Djebel Azzag and Djebel
Ajred was not ‘very successful and by 5th
January after severe fighting in heavy rain,
we withdrew to our original front. Losses on
both sides were relatively heavy. Again on 3rd
January 6 Armoured Division made a recon-
naissance in force in the Goubellat plain; and
on 11th January followed this by a successful
local attack north of Bou Arada.

On 18th January a strong German attack
was launched against 6 Armoured Division
down the Bou Arada Valley by infantry and at
least fifty tanks of 10 Panzer Division, followed
the same afternoon by an attack against the
French 19 Corps. This was made by newly-
landed mountain troops supported by 501
Panzer Abteilung, in which the new Mark VI
“ Tiger’ tank made its début. The attack
was directed against the mountain area at the
northern hinge of the two Dorsale ranges,

The attack against 6 Armoured Division was
stopped dead after heavy fighting, with con-
siderable enemy tank losses. 38 (Irish) Brigade
particularly distinguished itself. But French
Tesistance was overwhelmed; the enemy reached
Robaa and Ousseltia on the zoth and the
equivalent of seven battalions of infantry were
cut off in the mountains; also many field guns
together with nearly all their few anti-tank
guns were lost. I went to see General Juin and
found him personally courageous, but tired and
not hopeful. I had in the meantime ordered 5
Corps to send 36 Infantry Brigade Group to
the Robaa Valley and requested 2 United States
Corps to send a Combat Command of United
States 1 Armoured Division to the Ousseltia
area—both to come under General Juin’s orders
on arrival. These reinforcements stabilised the
situation on the general line Bou Arada—
Djebel Bargou—Djebel Bou Dabouss, after
fighting lasting until 23rd January.

SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 6 NOVEMBER, 1946

Meanwhile, as a result of the obvious lack of
co-operation and control between the British,
French ‘and American commanders, I was
appointed by General Eisenhower, at a meeting
with him on 21st January at Constantine, to
“co-ordinate ’’ the whole front in future, with
one executive air commander (General Kuter,
United States Air Corps) for the whole front.
This, especially the appointment of General
Kuter, was a big step forward but that it did
not go far enough soon became evident, and at
a further meeting at Thelergma airfield on 24th
January, the Commander-in-Chief made me
** responsible for the employment of American
troops,”’ though not yet in control of the French
Corps. After a long conference with me that
night General Juin agreed to place his Corps
under my command, and next day this decision
was confirmed by General Giraud.

If chaos were to be avoided, some one person
had to command the whole front. As an
example of the difficulties experienced at this
time, I had to motor over 1,000 miles in four
days to visit the various corps commanders.
Distances were too great for radio telephony,
ordinary telephone was most unreliable, air
travel was impossible owing to weather. ‘‘ Co-
ordination ’’ demanded discussion and often
compromise and this could only be done by
personal visits. ;

At the end of this period the French
were beginning to feel the strain. The
campaign did not look too rosy to them,
supplies and equipment were nearly exhausted,
motor transport was. worn out and scarce and
the troops were unable to face the German tanks
owing to entire lack of anti-tank weapons.

At the end of January the enemy attack on
Robaa was renewed, “‘ Tigers’’ again being
used, this time against 36 Infantry Brigade.
The 5 Buffs stood their ground, five tanks (in-
cluding two ‘ Tigers ’’) being destroyed, and
the enemy withdrew with heavy loss. This local
but successful action had an electric effect on
the Tirailleurs, who were also deeply impressed
by the efficiency of the British artillery. From
this time on to the end of the campaign I gave
French 19 Corps strong artillery support under
a Commander Army Group, Royal Artillery,
loaned, and also gave them 6-pounders and
other equipment, which, with other American
help, greatly raised morale. Thereafter they
withstood remarkably well the effects of the
Kasserine battle and the consequent withdrawal
to the Western Dorsale, under the energetic
leadership of General Koeltz. :

Having been made responsible for the em-
ployment of all Allied Forces in Tunisia on 25th
January, I spent the next week visiting the
French and American sectors, meeting com-
manders and generally getting into the wider
picture.

Two things seemed obvious to me: first, the
mixture of nationalities had again become worse
as a result of the recent fighting and must
urgently be straightened ‘out; second, our dis-
positions were too widely stretched in the
south. In the early days, when forces on both
sides were weak, it had been right to seize all
we could in the attempt to hem the enemy into
a narrow corridor. But a new situation had
arisen. Apart from the large enemy reinforce-
ments brought overseas into Tunisia, a fresh
flow was now arriving from Tripolitania. The
approach of Rommel’s Army was beginning to
be felt; many uninvited guests from opposite
