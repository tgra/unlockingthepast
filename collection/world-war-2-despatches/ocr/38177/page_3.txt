SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 1948

Persian Gulf came under the Commander-in-
Chief, East Indies.

Consequently, although this Despatch deals
with the work of the land forces in the Middle
East, every strategical plan concerned all three
Services, and had to be approved by the three
Commanders-in-Chief, under the general direc-
tion of the Minister of State.

PART I. ‘

(GENERAL NARRATIVE OF EVENTS IN THE |
MIDDLE East.

In my first Despatch on the Middle East I
described how, having arranged for the
Northern Front to be placed in a state of de-
fence, I concentrated on preparing to take the
offensive in Northern Africa. It was primarily
to consider this undertaking that I was sum-
moned to London by the Prime Minister in
August, 1941. The various problems involved
were discussed thoroughly and at length sat
meetings of the War Cabinet and the Defence
Committee, and the records of these meetings
show that His Majesty’s Government in the
United Kingdom considered it essential to take
the offensive in North Africa at the earliest
possible moment.

In any event the Germans were then advanc-
ing rapidly in Russia and it seemed that, pro-
vided this progress was maintained, it would
not be very long before the road to the Caucasus
would be opened to them. They might then
be able not only to strike at Persia and Iraq
from the north, but to invade Turkey from the
north and east as well as from the west. It
seemed not at all impossible that this danger
would take shape early in 1942. It behoved us,
therefore, to rid ourselves of the threat to
Egypt from the west, before we might have to
turn to meet an attack from™the north and
north-east.

By the end of October, 1942, our land forces
in the Command seemed strong enough and
{sufficiently well-equipped to warrant making
an attack. But to make this possible it was
necessary to concentrate practically all the
available air forces in the west, thus leaving
Syria, Palestine and Cyprus unprotected... It
was not necessary to denude these areas of land
forces, although the garrison had to be deprived
of transport in order to equip the Eighth Army.

However, these risks were felt to be justifi-
able. Winter was approaching and the enemy
could not appear south of the Caucasus for some
months. The Germans were heavily engaged in
Russia, and, even if they could spare aircraft
and troops from the Russian‘front to reinforce
Libya, the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force
could be relied on to make this a hazardous un-
dertaking. .

The Offensive in Cyrenatca.

With the approval of His Majesty’s Govern-
ment, I laid my plans and made my prepara-
tions not only to defeat the enemy forces in the
field, but also to occupy the whole of Libya.
This was to be carried out in two stages. -rIn
the first stage it was intended that the Eighth
Army should trap the enemy forces and destroy
them in Eastern Cyrenaica: in the second the
Eighth Army was to occupy Tripolitania!..The
success of the second stage depended upon how
far we managed to achieve our aim in the first
and to what éxtent we were able to overcome the

difficulty of supplying our forces over such great
distances.

When I originally gave orders in September,
1941, for plans to be prepared, I hoped that it
might be possible to launch the offensive about
the xzst November. I was careful, however,
to explain to His Majesty’s Government that the
date on which it could be launched depended
on the arrival of the troops and equipment,
especially tanks, required to give that measure
of superiority over the enemy I considered
necessary to ensure a reasonable chance of suc-
cess, and without which I did not think it right
to try to defeat him.

My original estimate of the armoured forces
needed for the conquest of Cyrenaica was three
armoured divisions. The offensive had to be
launched with one and a half armoured divi-
sions and one brigade of infantry tanks.

For various unavoidable reasons, I had,
most reluctantly, to postpone the opening date
from the rst to the 15th November. The chief
cause was the tardy arrival of the 22nd
Armoured Brigade from the United "Kingdom:
this formation was expected to reach Egypt
between the 13th and 2oth September, but its
disembarkation was not actually completed until
the r4th October. As a result, the brigade
was not fully trained when it took the field.

The offensive had to be postponed for a
further three days as the 1st South African Divi-
sion, which was to play an important part in
the initial operations, had not had enough time
to train for a mobile role owing to the: late
arrival of the bulk of its vehicles.

We were working to very close margins as
tegards equipment and training. The same
conditions applied to the building up of sup-
plies and the construction of pipelines and rail-
ways. The essential preparations were barely
complete when the campaign was launched, and
the standard of training of many of the troops
engaged left much to be desired. This was due
to no fault of their own, but solely to lack of
time and shortage of equipment.

For some time before the offensive opened,
practically the whole of the German and Italian
forces in Libya had been concentrated in the
north-eastern angle of Cyrenaica, and I had
considered striking direct at Bengasi by way of
the desert so as to seize their chief supply port
and cut the land reinforcement route from
Tripoli at one and the same time. Our land.
and air forces slightly outnumbered the enemy’s
(disregarding the formidable Axis air strength
elsewhere in the Mediterranean) but our margin
of superiority was so small that our forces could
not safely be divided, and there were consider-
able maintenance difficulties; so I eventually
rejected this idea as impracticable. Instead I
decided to envelop the enemy in Eastern
Cyrenaica and destroy him there.

The German armoured divisions were the
backbone of the enemy’s army, and to destroy
them was our principal object. The three
armoured brigades were concentrated in the
30th Corps and General Norrie was instructed
to use them to seek out and destroy the enemy’s
armour. When the Panzer divisions had been
well and truly dealt with, the rest of our forces
would carry out their p; in the operation.
The 30th Corps and the garrison of Tobruk

. were then to secure the two ridges of Sidi

Rezegh .and “Ed , Duda which command the
