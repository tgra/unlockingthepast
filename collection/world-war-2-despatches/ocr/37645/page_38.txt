the Navy had been unable to land those commo-
dities on the beach near Gobuen, it would have
been necessary for our forces to return to the
Italian Somaliland border as I would have
been unable to maintain them forward.

49. Under the policy laid down before I
decided to attack the Giuba, the initial forward
moves to the frontier of Italian Somaliland
commenced on 15th January, and zith
February the forward troops of 11th (A) Divi-
sion were at Badada, and those of the 12th
(A) Division had attacked and -taken Beles
Gugani. The 22nd Infantry Brigade and
attached troops carried out the advance on
rath (A) Division front to Beles Gugani with
speed and determination, and their rapid
advance over tracks which quickly became dust
pans, was in all probability instrumental in
causing the Italians to make the decision, which
became known later, to evacuate Chisimaio
without fighting. i

50. On 11th February 22nd Brigade Group,
rath (A) Division, attacked Afimadu which
was in our hands ‘by 0700 hours, the bulk of
the enemy garrison having withdrawn during
the night. 24th Gold Coast Brigade Group
were passed through Afmadu that night direc-
ted on Bulo Erillo and Gobuen respectively.
At this period it was thought advisable to
carry out all moves at night, both to conceal
our lines of advance, and to avoid air action
against our columns.

On the morning of 13th February 24th Gold
Coast Brigade Group attacked Bulo Erillo.
This attack met with considerable resistance
on the part of the enemy, who was entrenched
behind strong wire, and used armoured cars.
After severe fighting the enemy was driven out
leaving a number of prisoners, 5 armoured cars
and some artillery and other weapons in our
hands. The attack was led by the 2nd Gold
Coast Regiment, with great gallantry. Although
the leading troops of this Battalion had prac-
tically all their white personne] killed or
wounded, the attack was pressed home with
unabated vigour and courage.

51. On the evening of this day (13th) in-
formation reached me -which indicated that
some or all of the enemy were evacuating
Chisimaio. Although every effort was made to
accelerate the advance of Ist S.A. Brigade and
cut off the withdrawing enemy, they succeeded
in eluding our advance. On the following
morning (I4th) 1st S.A. Brigade attacked
Gobuen supported by 12 Light Tanks. The
village was held by weak enemy rear guards
which were rapidly driven in, retreating across
the river Giuba and burning the bridge behind
them. During this action the enemy developed
considerable shell fire from Giumbo on the far
bank of the river against our forward troops.
Consequently the crossing of the river was not
accomplished at once as I had hoped.

Meanwhile I received information that
Chisimaio harbour in front of the oil tanks
was covered with oil; that aircraft flying low
drew no fire, and that Commander ‘‘ Force
T” had gone in with H.M.S. Shropshire to
bombard the forts at point blank range and
had drawn no reply. I was therefore con-
vinced that Chisimaio had been wholly evacu-
ated. In consequence I ordered 12th (A) Divi-
sion to send 22nd Brigade from Afraadu to
occupy Chisimaio immediately as, in accord-
ance with my original plan, 11th (A) Division

were too far back for the purpose. This was
safely accomplished by 1700 hours 14th Febru-
ary, and the forts in Chisimaio Island were
occupied by 1900 hours. All the white popula-
tion had been evacuated and considerable
demolition done. That the evacuation was
hurried, however, was proved by the fact that
we were able eventually to put into commis-
sion three of the eight 4.9 C.D. guns, and ten
of the sixteen 77 mm, A.A. guns. Quantities
of stores and ammunition were abandoned by
the enemy.

The capture of Chisimaio was completed six
days ‘before the date I had given in the time
table for the operation.

52. A remarkable feature of the operation
up to this period was the almost complete lack
of enemy interference from the air. The fighter
ground attacks at Gobuen and Afmadu aero-
dromes, and in the air, preceding the opening
of the campaign had resulted in driving the
enemy out of the air practically altogether.
At this stage enemy aircraft were seldom seen
by day and he confined himself to bombing
on moonlight nights. I was therefore able to
remove all restrictions on daylight movement
and henceforth our columns moved almost
entirely by day.

53. At that time it became apparent that
there was considerable apprehension and dis-
organisation amongst the enemy forces. It
was clear therefore no time was to be lost in
forcing a crossing over the river, a fact which
I impressed on the Commander of 12th (A)
Division. The river was 580 feat broad at
Gobuen, and tidal for 14 miles, but narrowed
and became shallower northwards. At Gelib,
and in some places north of this point, it
could be waded. On both banks was a belt of
tropical growth of varying thickness, north of
Gelib continuous, south of Gelib sometimes
broken by cultivation. The enemy had dis-
posed the greater part of his forces along the
river bank defending all the more obvious
crossing places, but my information was that
he had one fully motorised brigade (15th) in
reserve behind Gelib.

54. I realised that it was quite impossible for
the enemy to defend the whole river and that
to effect a crossing could only be a matter of
time, the only danger being immediate counter-
attacks delivered from the rear. I urged the
Commander of r2th (A) Division to tap in all
along and seize possible bridgeheads, and it
was my intention, had he not been successful
in doing so with his own resources, to bring up
the 11th (A) Division and place the force on a
two-divisional front so as to increase the
chances of finding a suitable crossing place
quickly. On the night of 17th/18th February
however, the 1st S.A. Brigade managed to
effect a crossing at Ionte. During that night
they were. counter-attacked by a force of the
enemy from Giumbo; the counter-attack was
successfully beaten off with great loss to the
enemy. On i9th February the Gold Coast
Brigade also succeeded in forcing a crossing at
Mabungo. This crossing entailed cutting a track
for three miles through the tropical jungle belt
mentioned above, which work was successfully
and rapidly carried out.

To cover the movement to Mabungo and to
delude the enemy into thinking that a frontal
attack was intended, a concentration of field
and light guns was directed against the defences
