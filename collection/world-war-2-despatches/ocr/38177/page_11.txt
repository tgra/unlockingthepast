fence, and positions were es: developed at
Acroma, El Adem and Bir e] Gubi.

This position was held’ by the 13th Corps
(Lieutenant-General Gott) with the equivalent
of three infantry divisions, an army tank bri-
gadé, and an armoured division. The: 30th
Corps (Lieutenant-General Norrie), with two
infantry divisions less a brigade group was en-
gaged in preparing two positions in the frontier
area, and a detachment was occupying
Giarabub.

The New Zealand railway construction com-
panies and Indian pioneer companies had
already begun work again after a well-earned
rest, and the railway line was nearing Capuzzo.

Malta and the Libyan Offensive.

Our position in Cyrenaica had just been
stabilised, when I received three disturbing
pieces of information, none of them entirely un-
expected. On the 17th February came a pre-
paratory order from London to send two more
divisions to the Far East. On the 18th Admiral
Cunningham received a telegram from the
Governor of Malta reporting that the supply
situation in the island was extremely precarious.
And a few days later J learned that an enemy
convoy carrying. a large number of tanks had
reached Tripoli.

Having explained the necessity for asking
for the 7oth Division and the oth Australian
Division, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff
warned me that one of the Indian divisions
from Iraq might also have to go back to India.
He added that it was realised that these with-
drawals might entail abandoning our plan for
regaining Cyrenaica, and adopting a defensive
policy in Libva, and that the forces left on the
Northern Front would hardly be enough even
to keep order there.

The yoth Division did, in fact, proceed to
India and Ceylon, equipped with its full scale
of transport from Middle East resources; but
adjustments in other theatres made it possible
to allow me to retain the other two divisions,
which was fortunate in view of subsequent
events on our Western Front.

Quite apart from its effect on our policy in
Libya, the withdrawal of two more, or possibly
three, divisions from my command would ex-
pose my northern flank to extreme danger in
the event of an attack. The troops allotted to
its defence were already quite inadequate and
our bases and our oilfields, destined shortly to
be the only oilfields left in British hands, would
be at the mercy of the invader. The: forces
‘which it was pow proposed to leave’ in those
‘regions, all of them politically unstable, were
bately sufficient to ensure internal order. Even

if the whole of our available forces were moved .

to that front, they would still have been too
few to defend it. Although the danger was
not imihediaté, since the eriemy still had long
‘distances to cover and great supply problems to
solve, it was nevertheless one which we must
‘be prepared to meet. The Middle East’ Defence
Committee presented these ' views again to
‘London and urged that four infantry divisions
be sent to the Middle Edst without delay.

_ Meanwhile I issued revised instructions for
the defence of the Northern Front.* Since we

‘could no longer hope to stop a hostile advance

in strength through Persia and Syria, I intended
to impose the maximum delay on the enemy
so as to gain time to enable reinforcements to
arrive. The Ninth and Tenth Armies would
now retire before superior enemy forces and
hold them on a rearward line through Dizful,
Paitak, the Lesser Zab River, Abu Kemal on
the Euphrates, Damascus, Ras Baalbek and
Tripoli. They were, however, to fight delaying
actions north of this line whenever a favour-
able opportunity offered.

This meant abandoning extensive defensive
positions round Mosul on which much valuable
work had been done but, as we cduld no longer
hold Mosul with our reduced forces against a
strong attack, there was no alternative but to
concentrate all our efforts on strengthening the
new positions in Central Iraq and Southern
Syria.

The position in Malta was indeed serious.
Until November we had held almost complete
mastery of the air over the island; but since then
the enemy had made increasingly heavy air
attacks and by now had attained virtual
dominance. It had become practically im-
possible for the air force based on Malta either
to interfere with enemy vessels passing to Libya
or to provide air cover for our own ships seek-
ing to replenish it. The Governor of Malta,
Lieutenant-General Sir William Dobbie, now
reported that even on siege rations, supplies
generally would last only until June, while stocks
of diesel oil for submarines were sufficient only
for two months. Yet it seemed useless to
attempt to sail convoys to the island, since out
of three ships which left Alexandria on rath
February none arrived.

The Middle East Defence Committee, there-
fore, asked that the arrival in Malta of fighter
reinforcements should be accelerated.

The Chiefs of Staff were equally concerned
at the situation reported in the Governor’s
telegrams. They were of the same mind that
Malta was vital to operations in Cyrenaica and
were prepared to take the most drastic action to
sustain it. It was impossible to supply Malta
from the west and the only chance of sailing
convoys from the east, they considered, was to
secure the aerodromes in Cyrenaica. Accord-
ingly I was asked to consider carrying
out an offensive in time to enable adequate air
support to be given to a substantial convoy in
mid-April.

There was no doubt that the possession of
aerodromes in Western Cyrenaica would make it
possible to provide aerial protection for con-
voys. But the converse was equally true;
unless Malta could interfere with the enemy
reinforcement of Libya the task of recapturing
Western Cyrenaica would become more and
more difficult. The news “that an enemy
convoy of seven ships, almost certainly bring-
ing many tanks, had reached Tripoli con-
firmed my fears.

I had already: reviewed the whole situation
in the light of this information and my report
to the Prime Minister actually crossed the tele-
gram from the Chiefs of Staff. A forecast of
the relative tank strength of the enemy and our-
selves during the next three months showed
that we were not likely to have the requisite
superiority. in armour to allow us to launch an
offensive with a reasonable chance of success
‘before the rst June.at the earliest. In attempt-
ing an offensive without this margin of
