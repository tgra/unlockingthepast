SUPPLEMENT to THE’ LONDON GAZETTE, 30:OCTOBER, 10947.

defence batteries when these fired on our ship-
Ping or at the beaches. A large but carefully

. controlled amount of ammunition pf all types
was expended; replenishment at the home ports
was carried out rapidly, due to the excellent,
‘ provision made at the ports concerned, and to
the efficient organisation evolved by the
Admiralty departments responsible for plan-
ning and executing the very complicated
arrangements for supply of ammunition and
exchange of ships’ guns. Spotting by fighter
spotters, Air O.P.s, S.F.C.P.s, and F.0.s.B.*,
was very successful, though there were some
failures in communication between F.O.s.B. and
ships, particularly in the early stages. Improve-
ment im F.O.B. communications is stil re-
quired, but failures were in part due to the:
natural tendency to land F.O.B. parties too
early in the assault, which caused damage to
their equipment and also a high percentage of

. F.O.B, casualties. By common consent shoot-
‘ing was uniformly good and it is considered that
the initial advances inland of our armies were
helped in no small measure by the naval
supporting fire.

Build-up Difficulties and Delays.

63. As mentioned in paragraph 57 above,
delays in the turn round of ships and craft
occurred initially’ in the assault area glue to
the abnormal conditions obtaining there. There
were also difficulties in the United Kingdom,
particularly in the Isle of Wight area and in

the port of Southampton, due to the large -

amount of shipping to be handled in a con-
gested area. -The initial congestion in the Isle
of Wight anchorage, which was caused by a
variety of reasons, led to ships that should not
have been there staying there for two or three
days, and there were also some nava] delays in
getting ships up to Southampton to reload. The
problem in the Isle of Wight area wag far more
difficult that anywhere else due to the physical
characteristics of the anchorage, and it is not
considered that the delays which occurred,
although irritating to the army, were in any
respects unreasonable. Energetic measures
were taken to clear the Isle of Wight anchor-
age, and after the first ten days or so, there
were no major delays in the United Kingdom.
The figures of the rate of build-up show the
great quantity of shipping that was sailed to
France each day. When these are examined
any serious adverse criticism of the naval

} organisation, either in the United Kingdom or
in France, would seem unwarranted.

Wide scope of the Operation.

64. It is extremely difficult in a letter of
Teasonable length to deal with any complete-
ness with the many aspects of the operation
as it progressed from day to day. On the
majority. of the early days there were perhaps
three or four incidents that in any previous
operation would have been considered of
outstanding interest, and it is -only possible
here to give my general impression of the naval
operations as. they developed. With 16 con-
voys and about the same number of landing
craft groups at any one time at sea in the
Channel, exposed to attack by enemy mines,
E-Boats, aircraft and U-Boats, with the enemy

active on doth flanks with his light naval
forces and’ his shore guns, with nightly air
minelaying and sometimes air bombing, it was
obviois that each day a number of actions of
different types would be fought against the
enemy forces and that ourships would suffer
casualties and damage. The salient fact, how-
ever, was that no matter how the enemy
attempted to sink our ships, he was fought,
and generally with success. The casualties that
we sustained were relatively light when ’the
very large number of ships taking part is con-
sidered, The build-up proceeded quickly. By
D+9 half a million men had been landed in
France and 77,000 vehicles. The millionth
man was landed on D+28, one day after the
end of the period covered by this report.

Operations by our Coastal Forces.

65. Our coastal forces operating both from
the United Kingdonr and from the assault area
had many successful encounters with enemy
E-Boats. Because it was appreciated that it
would not be possible to provide shore radar
cover for the cross-Channel convoy route and
the covering patrols on its flanks, Commander-
in-Chief, Portsmouth, decided to extend the
radar cover by using frigates fitted with Ameri-
can S.L. search radar to control units of
M.T.B.s attached to them. Four frigates were
allocated for this duty and proved very suc-
cessful in controlling interceptions in over 30
actions. Great spirit{was shown by all the
Coastal Force Commanting Officers concerned,
théigmajority of whom it should be noted were
civilians a few years ago.
Difficulties of Aircraft Recognition.

66. The S.H.A.E.F.* rules for restrictions to
flying and to A.A. fire are considered to have
worked well, but unfortunately casualties to
our own aircraft were caused by naval gunfire
in the early stages of the operation, particularly
in the U.S. Sector. Fire discipline and aircraft
Fecognition in such a diverse fleet of ships and
craft_as was at any one time in the assault
area was obviously extremely difficult to
achieve; andthe situation was much aggravated
by the extremely low cloud base which pre-
vailed on most days, and which, by forcing
aircraft to fly very low, gave the minimum of
time for their recognition. It is strongly re-
commended that in other theatres of war where
cloud base may normally be expected to be
much higher than in the Channel operations,
the restricted height for aircraft should be such
as to keep them outside the effective range of
close range weapons. _ The appointment of .
Royal Observer Corps personnel to merchant
ships to assist in aircraft recognition, which was
a novel experiment, proved most successful and
undoubtedly did something towards helping in
this matter.

q

Buoying and Minesweeping of Channels.

67. Minesweeping was carried out con-
tinuously from D+41 and during the first few
days of the operation channels were’ widened
and permanently established from England
to France and along the French coast in the
assault area. A very large number of light
buoys had to be laid to mark the channels
as quickly as possible and this was expedi-
tiously carried out by the Trinity House vessels.
