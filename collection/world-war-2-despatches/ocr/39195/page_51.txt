SUPPLEMENT To rHg LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

289. During June, 4 Corpsâ€™ formations not
+ engaged in the operations described in the two
preceding paragraphs were engaged with patrols
and sporadic engagements with the Japanese
concentrating in the Yomas. V Force provided
most valuable information, and enabled us to
locate the Japanese and forecast their plans.
4 Corps estimated their numbers at just under
10,000, but this figure was in fact only half the
total. The discrepancy was due to the un-
expectedly large number of non-divisional
Japanese troops caught in the trap, who took
part in the break-out. Finally, on the 4th
July, an operation order was captured giving
the entire Japanese break-out plan; the only
detail lacking was the date selected for D-Day,
but other Intelligence placed D-Day as approxi-
mately the 20th July.

290. With this information at his disposal
General F.LS. Tuker, acting for General
Messervy who was on leave, was able to dispose
4 Corps to block all intended lines of escape.
The Japanese held to their plan to the last de-
tail, and the resulting slaughter was tremendous.
Between the 2ist July and the 4th August over
10,000 casualties were inflicted on the Japanese,
not counting wounded. Of these only 740 were
taken prisoner.

291. The Battle of the Break-out, it trans-
pired, was the last battle of the war. For the
10 days which intervened between the con-
clusion of the battle and the end of the period
covered by this Despatch, a lull ensued during
which little of note occurred. Patrols and small
advances were the order of the day, and the
Royal Air Force continued to add to the
destruction they had caused throughout the
campaign.

Secrion XVID (paras. 292-301) PLans FOR
MALAYA
Joint Planning Staff Paper of the 23rd
February, 1945: Operations Roger, Zipper and
Mailfist: Cancellation of Roger: D-Day for
Zipper: Zipper appreciation and plan.

292. It is now necessary to revert 10
February, 1945, to consider the evolution of
the plans for the recapture of Malaya.
Throughout the post-Rangoon operations to
which the last three sections have been devoted,
planning and preliminary action for subsequent
operations had been continuing, and their
effects on current operations, particularly com-
mand and organization, have been recorded.
The assaults on Malaya and Singapore (opera-
tions Zipper and Mailfist) had absolute priority,
and every unit required for these operations was
either moved to India or concentrated in
Rangoon (which was to be the forward base
for the assault forces) for rest and
reorganization.

293. On the 23rd February the Supreme
Commander had held a conference at Fort
William, and at it approval was given to the
outline plan produced by the Joint Planning
Staff in their Paper No. 88 of the 6th February.
It was appreciated that the Japanese would
endeavour to hold Malaya and in particular,
Singapore, as a barrier to prevent our entry
into the area of the South China Sea.
Similarly, without Singapore we would be un-
able to extend materially our operations east-
watds. The object of the paper was to exaniine
the best outline method of reaching Singapore.

294. It was anticipated that the Japanese
would build up their strength in Malaya, and
therefore it was desirable to mount the opera-
tion as speedily as possible and by the quickest
route. This rendered undesirable an approach
via the Sunda Straits, Sumatra, or the Andaman
Islands, as the establishment of a forward base
in these areas would still leave that base at a
distance too great for a direct assault on Singa-
pore. By various means we attempted
to give the impression that we would
move on Singapore by one or more of these
routes. It was therefore agreed that the for-
ward base should be on the Malay Peninsula,
and an examination was made of the geo-
graphical features of the area.

295. The Tenasserim coast was ruled out as
a suitable area for a landing owing to the mon-
soon conditions. The further south the better
would these conditions become, until, in the
Straits of Malacca, sea conditions were suitable
throughout the year.

The Phuket operation was feasible, but the
very narrow waterway dividing Phuket Island
from the mainland made it necessary to provide
a force capable of withstanding any build-up
against it. The size of this force depended
naturally on the anticipated size of the build-
up, and this in turn depended on the length
of time during which the British force was to
be the only one ashore in Malaya. Another
landing would, of course. divert some of the
build-up, but the scarcity of landing craft meant
@ considerable time lag before the next
amphibious operation could take place, and
for that reason therefore the Army commit-
ment at Phuket had to be considerable if the
proposed airstrips were to be protected from
artillery fire. While relatively near Rangoon,
the seizure of Phuket did not, of course, obviate
the need to make another landing on the Malay
Peninsula nearer to Singapore.

296. A study of the beaches and anchorages
revealed that the Port Dickson/Port
Swettenham area also was suitable, though by
no means perfect, and the distance on to Singa-
pore was reduced to about 200 miles. This
plan would make the maximum use of the
capture of Rangoon, and it was considered that
with the seizure of a bridgehead in this area
it would be possible to disrupt Japanese com-
munications along the Malay Peninsula by the
joint use of air power and guerilla forces. It
was therefore agreed at this meeting on the
23rd February to examine this project in de-
tail, target dates being decided as the Ist June
for Phuket (Roger), early October for the Port
Swettenham/Port Dickson landing (Zipper)
and December for Singapore (Mailfist).

297. Planning accordingly was begun in de-
tail, while the operations in Burma proceeded.
As has been recorded (para. 224), the Roger
operation was postponed by the decision
to capture Rangoon from the sea, as the
only landing craft available were used for
this operation. On the capture of Rangoon
in May, the rapid deterioration of the
Japanese air and naval forces and the avail-
ability of sufficient aircraft carriers, was such
that the Supreme Commander decided
that he could accept the risk of not seizing
Phuket Island at all, and planning thereafter
was concentrated on Zipper and Mailfist.
Furthermore the situation had now developed
