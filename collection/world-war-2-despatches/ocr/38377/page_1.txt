MEDITERRANEAN CONVOY OPERATIONS.

OPERATION ‘ EXCESS ”

The following Despatch was submitied to the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on
the 19th March, 1941 by Admiral Sir Andrew
B. Cunningham, G.C.B., D.S.0., Comman-
der-in-Chief, Mediterranean Station.

Mediterranean,
rgth March, 1941.

Operations M.C.4 AnD M.C.6

Be pleased to lay before Their Lordships the
enclosed reports on Operation M.C 4 (which in-
cluded Operation “ Excess’’) and Operation
M.C.6,* carried out between 6th and x8th
January, I941.

2. These operations marked the advent of
the German Air Force in strength in the Medi-
terranean, and included the damaging of
H.M.S. ILLUSTRIOUS on roth January and
the loss of H.M.S. SOUTHAMPTON on 11th
January.

3. The incident reported in paragraph 7 of
Enclosure No. 6f illustrates the difficulty of
passage through the Narrows during periods
of bright moon when, in order to avoid the
known minefields, it 1s necessary to pass within
gun and visibility range of Pantellaria.

TER and SOUTHAMPTON by the defences of

4. With regard to the dawn action reported
in Enclosures Nos. 6 and g,* it is thought that
this must have been a chance encounter, as
so small an Italian force would hardly have
been sent unsupported to attack a heavily
Gefended convoy. The heavy expenditure of
ammunition by BONAVENTURE, largely in-
curred in an effort to sink a crippled ship,
serves to emphasise the importance of using
the torpedo at close range on such occasions.

5. I fully concur with the remarks of the
Vice-Admiral, Light Forcest concerning the
towing of GALLANT by MOHAWK. (Enclo-
sure No. r1}), and consider that this was a
most ably conducted operation.

It cannot be satisfactorily determined
whether GALLANT was mined or torpedoed,
but the absence of tracks and failure by the
enemy to claim her sinking lend probability
to the suppésition that it was d mine.

6. The dive bombing attacks by German air-
craft were most efficiently performed and came
as an unpleasant surprise. The results of short
range A.A. fire were disappointing, though it
has been subsequently learned that this fire
was in fact more effective than it appeared, and
the Germans suffered considerable loss.
