In spite of all these . difficulties the attack was begun on 3rd May when the znd Gold Coast Regiment made a wide flanking march cutting their way through the belts of thick forest with their pangas. On 4th May xst Gold Coast Regiment supported by artillery attacked two prominent hills which were strongly held by the enemy. A.F.V.s were sent up an old Abyssinian track to support the flank attack by 2nd Gold Coast Régiment but could make little progress. Later in the afternoon 2nd Gold Coast Regiment came in.on the enemy’s left rear and by 5th May had cut the toad behind the position. The enemy however still held his main positions and it was not until roth May that he was finally driven from them on the two hills. In capturing this very formidable position the determination shown by the Gold Coast troops sustained the fighting teputation which they had gained in the first phase of the campaign.",

So far as the naval assault forces were concerned the exercises were satisfactory, but a freshening southwesterly wind in the afternoon of the first day caused the full programme to be curtailed to avoid damage to landing craft. Enemy reaction to ‘‘ Fabius ’’ was negligible, being confined to an aircraft attack on a destroyer in one of the covering forces. That it was not greater, and indeed that our naval preparations proceeded with so little interruption, must be largely attributed to the very high degree of air superiority achieved in the months before D day. .Enemy air reconnaissance was slight and infrequent.",
