The attack went with great dash and speed, capturing Pinacle and Elephant Hill. Beyond this the ridge narrows and is devoid of cover, all approaches being commanded by machineguns from Bald Hill, and other prominent features. The maps had given no indication of the exceeding steepness and narrowness of the tidge beyond Elephant, Further advance in daylight was impossible. At o4r5 hours on 5th May, the attack was resumed and Middle Hill was captured. Between Middle Hill and Little Alagi the ridge again narrows to a razorback about 150 yds. wide, wired, flanked by precipices and under machine-gun fire. I Worcesters reached, and at one place went through, the wire, but became pinned and could not move in daylight. Middle Hill was consolidated and the Worcesters were withdrawn to this area on the night 5/6th May. 2oth Indian Infantry Brigade was now definitely checked.",

So far as the naval assault forces were concerned the exercises were satisfactory, but a freshening southwesterly wind in the afternoon of the first day caused the full programme to be curtailed to avoid damage to landing craft. Enemy reaction to   Fabius   was negligible, being confined to an aircraft attack on a destroyer in one of the covering forces. That it was not greater, and indeed that our naval preparations proceeded with so little interruption, must be largely attributed to the very high degree of air superiority achieved in the months before D day. .Enemy air reconnaissance was slight and infrequent.",

A warning was sent to General Wakely at Kalewa to establish local protection and to block the river approaches As a result of this, a boom was constructed across the Chindwin to the south of Shwegyin and the detachment of Royal Marines, which had done such good work on the Irrawaddy, was despatched with Breda guns to cover this obstruction. G.H.Q. India were also requested to order air attacks on enemy craft moving up the Chindwin. I learned later that such attacks were made on the 3rd or 4th May and I have no doubt that they imposed considerable delay on the enemy's advance up the river. There was also the possibility that the enemy might land at some point short of Kalewa and cut in on the Ye-U Kalewa road. The most likely point for this to happen was at Maukkadaw from which place a chaung gave easy access to the road at Pyingyaing. A detachment of the Bush Warfare School, reinforced by British infantry from the depot at Maymyo, was therefore sent to Maukkadaw. This detachment was later reinforced by two companies of Gurkhas. At this time I assumed that the 1 Indian Infantry Brigade was moving from Palel to Kalewa and I requested G.H.Q. India to hasten this movement, as I still had reason to believe that a Japanese force was advancing on Kalemyo via the Myittha Valley. I learned on 5th May that x Indian Infantry Bngade would not move into Burma, as it was not considered possible to maintain it in Kalewa, in addition to the troops from Burma that would also be in that area.",
