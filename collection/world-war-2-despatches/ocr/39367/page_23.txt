SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 OCTOBER, 1951

272. The bulk of the 766 sorties in the tac-
tical area on the 13th were devoted to direct
support of the amphibious landing on the right
flank. One notable incident during the day
was when Spitbombers saw a Tiger tank dis-
appear into a house. They bombed the house
and produced a large explosion.

273. A Brigade Commander, commenting on
an attack on a strong point by fighter-bombers,
said, ‘‘ The resistance was completely broken.
My own troops were able to advance 1,000
yards without resistance and roo prisoners were
taken after the bombing attack ””

Night 13th/14th April_8th Army Front.

274. Heavy bombers of No. 205 Group were
again airborne to attack the town of. Porto
Maggiore which was another key point on the
route through the Argenta Gap to the Po
River, which the retreating Germans would
have to use. Desert Air Force’s contribution
to the night’s effort was aimed at harassing
enemy movement in and behind the battle area,
Motor transport, barges, the Po River cross-
ings, and the road junction at Consandola were
the targets. During the night a Mosquito
night-fighter destroyed one F.W.190 and
damaged another.

Day 14th April_8th Army Front.

275. At dawn the 2nd New Zealand Division
attacked over the Sillaro River due east of
Massa Lombarda and towards Medicina, and
by mid-day had established a firm bridgehead.
To the north, Conselice was finally occupied,
while to the south, the Polish Corps captured
Imola on Route 9, and swept on towards Castel
San Pietro.

Summary of the First Phase.

276. Thus by the r4th April the first three
of the river lines on which the enemy depended
had been breached, and the Eighth Army’s
advance was gathering momentum. On the
right flank the threat to the Argenta gap was
growing, and the ground forces would soon
be able to break out along Route 16 to the Po
River. On the Eighth Army’s left flank good
progress was being made along Route 9g to-
wards Bologna,

277. The time had therefore come to launch
the Fifth Army into the Po Valley to be the
left thrust of the pincer movement aimed at
encircling the enemy south of the Po. On
the morning of the 14th April the Fifth Army
joined in the general offensive.

Tue Firte ARMy OFFENSIVE.
Day 14th April—Fifth Army Front.

278. The attack was opened by the IV Corps
at 09.45 hours some 20 miles south-west of
Bologna in the mountainous country just west
of Highway 64, which follows the upper valley
of the Reno River. It was aimed at Mt, Pero,
Vergato and Montese. The attack was pre-
ceded by a forty-minute ‘‘ set piece ’’ air attack
by fighter-bombers, and during the day XXII
T.A.C. flew a total of 514 sorties, of which all
but 55 were on army support.

Day 15th April_Fifth Army Front.

279. A tremendous effort was made by the
heavy bombers of 15th Air Force in the after-
noon, Every available aircraft that could

possibly be used—even some which had pre-
viously been considered unfit for operations—
was pressed into service. A total of 1,790
bombers and fighters were airborne. This force
was given two tasks. The first was to attack
az targets nominated by the Fifth Army, such
as command posts, dumps and enemy-occupied
areas, in the area south of Bologna; the second
was to attack communications and stores tar-
gets further north. Some 1,600 tons of bombs
were dropped by the first force, and some 800
tons by the second. The effort by the heavy
bombers was augmented by that of 258 medium
bombers of Tactical Air Force, which attacked
enemy reserve areas at Praduro on Route 64,
and at Medicina, though the latter was more
intimately concerned with Eighth Army opera-
tions. Meanwhile, XXII T.A.C., in missions
against targets along the front, including ground
positions, command posts, occupied buildings
and dumps, flew just under 500 sorties,

280. By the evening of the r5th, Vergato
and Montese had been captured, and during
the, night, the Fifth Army II Corps, on the
right of the 4th Corps, joined in the attack.

Ground and air effort, 16th to 19th April, Fifth
Army front. :

281. During these four days, all the Fifth
Army forces were engaged in heavy fighting
among the mountains which the enemy held so
strongly, but gradual progress was made to-
wards Bologna. Immense assistance was given
in this task by both Strategic and Tactical Air
Force aircraft, and the heights guarding the
approaches to Bologna became universally
scarred and pitted with bomb craters.

282. The planned assistance of the Strategic
Air Force was largely foiled on the 16th by
cloud over the Bologna area which prevented
positive identification of targets, and only some
200 tons of bombs were dropped. In the
meantime, XXII T.A.C, again directed almost
its entire effort of some 500 sorties against
battlefield targets to the south and south-west
of Bologna. On the 17th and 18th weather
conditions were more favourable for accurate
bombing, and in the course of the two days,
XVth Air Force aircraft dropped a total of
2,700 tons of bombs on tactical targets ahead
of the advancing Fifth Army troops. The
objective, as in the preceding attacks, was the
maximum disorganisation of enemy forces, and
the destruction of equipment and installations,
prior to an attack by Allied ground forces.
As in the case of previous attacks, virtually
every building in the areas attacked was
destroyed or heavily damaged. This effort
was supplemented by that of the medium
bombers, while XXII T.A.C. continued to
aie almost all its attention to close support
work,

283. The night of 16th/17th April provided
No. 205 Group with another communications
target of importance. Casalecchio, which is
located three miles south-west of Bologna,
offered an excellent opportunity for the inter-
diction of the flow of German reserves from
Bologna which was attempting to stem the
Fifth Army advance. The raid was successful,
the road bridge in the town being destroyed,
and much other damage being caused.
