            "description": "28. The Military situation, stabilised on D+6, 15th September, gradually improved; indications of a general German withdrawal were seen on D+7. On 19th September, Eboli and, on 20th, Campagna and several other towns in the vicinity were captured. Five days later the port of Salerno was reopened, followed quickly by the capture of Castellammare on 28th and of Torre Annunziata the next day. Naples was entered on lst October and with its capture, Operation \u201c Avalanche \u201d drew to a close. The port of Naples had been carefully and methodically wrecked by the withdrawing enemy, but even so, two days later five Liberty ship berths, six coaster berths and eight holding berths were cleared. By the 6th October discharge over the Salerno beaches was almost completed, the port of Naples was functioning slowly, and on that day Operation \u201c Avalanche\u201d was officially deemed to have been completed."

            "description": "195. I therefore decided on the despatch of small forces to Cos, Leros and Samos, to act as stiffening to the Italians. Cos and Samos were secured by the detachment of the Special Boat Squadron which had occupied Castelrosso, and troop movements began, both by sea and air, on 15th September. Sea transport was almost entirely limited to Royal Navy destroyers going direct to Leros, or to small coasting vessels going as far as Castelrosso; thence the journey to the islands had to be made in small sailing ships. Owing to the shipping difficulties, the limitations of port capacity and disembarkation equipment, and our inability to break down Bofors guns and heavy equipment into small loads, troops could take with them only their personal weapons, rifles, mortars and Bren guns. No anti-tank, field or anti-aircraft guns could be taken, nor could any transport other than jeeps be sent. Reliance for such equipment had to be placed on the Italian equipment already in the islands, which, in the case of Leros especially, was thought to \u2018be reasonably up-to-date and effective. This regrettably was not the case. The defences of Leros were not at all well developed, much of the anti-aircraft material was out of date, and the system of fire control was deplorable; certain natures of ammunition were in short supply, and motor transport was always inadequate. The defences of Cos were on an even lower scale."

The operation was brilliantly successful and the enemy were forced to abandon their strongly prepared positions covering the river. A combination of clever tactics, air supply and hard \u201cfoot slogging \u201d had deprived the Japanese of their opportunity to check our advance."
