Kos and Kalymnos, and it appeared that pre-
parations to mount the assault on Leros were
in train. The afternoon reconnaissance showed
a concentration of landing craft in Kos harbour.

43. The enemy intentions were still not clear.
As the next force of destroyers could not reach
the area until late on the night rath/13th, it
was essential to conserve fuel in Captain (D),
8th Destroyer Flotilla’s force. He was there-
fore ordered to move to an anchorage nearer to
Kos Channel and to send his two Hunts to
attack any landing craft in Kos roads reported
by air reconnaissance.

44. Motor Torpedo Boat 307 (Lieutenant
j. G. G. Muir, R.N.V.R.) on passage from
Casteloriso to Leros was in action with two
unknown destroyers off Kalymnos at 0330/12th
November, and at 0445/12th the motor torpedo
boat force sailed from Alinda Bay at full speed
to search for an enemy merchant ship reported
4-5 miles south-east of Leros. No sighting was
made, but later when sweeping to the north-
ward, two destroyers were sighted off
Pharmaco. These were mistaken for British
destroyers.

45. At approximately 0400/12th November
Motor Launch 456 (Lieutenant-Commander
F. P. Monckton, R.N.R.) on patrol to the east
of Alinda sighted and reported enemy forces
12 miles east of Leros proceeding north and
later engaged a force of two destroyers and ten
landing craft. After a short and gallant action
Motor Launch 456 was damaged and forced to
return to Alinda Bay where she landed
wounded.

46. Between 0600 and 0830/12th November
the enemy succeeded in landing both north and
south of Alinda Bay with the object of ‘‘ pinch-
ing out’’ the bay where he would then be
able to land heavy support weapons. A further
landing was attempted at Blefuti Bay on the
north of the island, but was repelled with the
loss of two landing craft. It would appear that
the Italian C.D.* guns did not open fire until
too late, and this coupled with the fact that
our close range weapons were sited to cover the
more important bays, enabled the enemy to
land forces at Palma, Pasti Di Sotto, Grifo and
N. Appetici with the loss of only one more
landing craft. Landings were counter-attacked
and held by our forces, but at 1340B/12 the
situation was made more difficult by the land-
ing of parachute troops to the west of Alinda,

together with Motor Torpedo Boats 315
(Lieutenant L. E. Newell, D.S.C.,
R.N.Z.N.V.R.), 266 (Sub-Lieutenant J. N.

Broad, R.N.Z.N.V.R.), and 263 (Lieutenant
A. G. Fry, R.A.N.V.R.) swept in the Leros/
Kalymnos/Levitha area to prevent enemy te-
inforcements reaching Leros, and at 2210,
Mount Clido battery, Leros was bombarded
from the eastward at the request of the Army
ashore. They made no sightings. H.M. Ships
DULVERTON, ECHO = (Lieutenant-Com-
mander R. H. C. Wyld, R.N.) and BELVOIR
were picked up by enemy aircraft whilst enter-
ing the Aegean and shadowed, and H.M.S.
DULVERTON was hit by a glider bomb at

0145/13th and sunk. ECHO and BELVOIR,
after picking up survivors, proceeded. Mine-
sweepers and motor launches which had ‘been
sent to Samos from Leros were loaded with
teinforcements and ammunition, but since time
would not permit their reaching Leros that
night, they were held at Samos. :

47. During the night 12th/13th November
a southerly gale blew up which restricted the
operation of light craft on both sides. On 13th
November fighting continued ashore, and in
spite of very heavy bombing by the enemy
and a further parachute landing at og00B/13th
November, which suffered high casualties due
to the strong wind blowing, our forces kept the
enemy pinned down to the eastern shore in the
Alinda Bay area. During the night of 13th/
14th November, H.M. Ships FAULKNOR,
BEAUFORT, and H.H.M.S. PINDOS after
attempting to bombard enemy positions in
Leros, left the Aegean owing to shortage of fuel.
H.M. Ships ECHO and BELVOIR however
bombarded enemy positions on Leros at the
request of the Army, and later carried out a
sweep in the area without making a sighting.
Reinforcements from Samos in the motor
launches and minesweepers were turned back
by the weather. H.M. Ships PENN, ALDEN-
HAM and BLENCATHRA (Lieutenant E. G.
Warren, R.N.) entered the Aegean.

48. At Leros all naval signal publications
were destroyed at 0700/14th November when
an enemy attack threatened to overrun the
naval headquarters and this seriously inter-
fered with communications and therefore with
operations. From then on, signalling with the
Senior British Naval Officer at Leros had to be
done through army channels using army
cyphers. ;

49. During the day of the 14th November,
fighting in Leros continued, our forces counter-
attacking with some success in the forenoon,
but with the growing weariness of our garrison
who had been fighting for 48 hours with no
real rest under heavy scale air attack, fresh
troops and more ammunition were urgently re-
quired. These were collected during the night
from Samos by H.M. Ships ECHO and
BELVOIR. ECHO, by proceeding at 30 knots,
managed to land her 250 troops at Portolago
before daylight, but BELVOIR with her slower
speed was forced to lie up.

50. Enemy positions were attacked from the
seaward by H.M. Ships PENN, ALDENHAM
and BLENCATHRA who arrived at Alinda Bay
at dusk on 14th November. Unfortunately only
three enemy caiques were in the bay, but these
were engaged and targets ashore, pointed out
by our forces, were taken under fire. H.M.S.
PENN and her force then patrolled in this
area being repeatedly attacked by enemy air-
craft including glider bombers. She was search-
ing for landing craft reported by Leros, but
failed to find. They had evidently turned back
as a result of enemy air reports of H.M.S.
PENN’s force.

51. Motor torpedo boats again patrolled the
area and shortly before daylight they joined’
H.M.S. ECHO, who was returning from
Portolago, in attacking an enemy force which
was approaching Alinda Bay, sinking an F-
lighter and two landing barges all laden with
troops.
