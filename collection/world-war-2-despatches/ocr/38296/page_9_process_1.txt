Of. four other aircraft intended to take. part in the attack, two could not be flown off and two returned to the carrier owing to unserviceability. The Albacores achieved complete surprise, destroying two aircraft and damaged others while the Falmars attacked a number of C.R.42s and JU.87s and damaged, a number of them. During the forenoon enemy aircraft were continually being detected.  The eight _ temaining serviceable aircraft in FORMID-

ABLE made 24 flights in the course of the fore-

noon during which there were 20 combats. Two -

enemy aircraft were shot down for certain and two were probably destroyed. One Fulmar was lost. At 1320 Force A was attacked by 20 aircraft which approached from the African coast. In dive bombing attacks FORMIDABLE was hit twice. Her starboard side was blown out between 17 and 24 bulkheads and   X   turret, cable and accelerator gear were put out of action. During the same attack NUBIAN was hit right aft and had her stern blown: off but she -was still able to proceed at 20 knots.

67. Intelligence had shown that the Ger-. mans were using Melos harbour as an assembly point for craft to invade Crete. Orders had been given to Vice Admiral rst Battle Squadron to detach D.1q with NUBIAN, KANDAHAR and JANUS to raid Melos harbour during the night of 26th/27th May. AJAX and DIDO were also to have been detached from Force A to make a feint as though intending to pass Kaso Strait at 2200/26th and then return to Alexandria after dark.  The signal from the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, ordering these movements reached Vice Admiral 1st Battle Squadron during a bombing attack. and at a time when he was occupied with the damage to FORMIDABLE. When the Vice Admiral:saw the signal he considered it was too Jate for D.14 to attack Milo and be clear south of Crete by daylight. He, therefore, cancelled both the operation and the feint.. At 1719 the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean sent a

signal. which also cancelled the Melos operation. -

* 68. After.dark FORMIDABLE with VOYAGER, VENDETTA, HEREWARD and DECOY  (who had joined at 2000) were detached from Force A so as to arrive Alexandria at daylight 27th May. The remainder of the force operated during the night to the pat westward of Alexandria, and at daylight a7t ABDIEL

Although it was realised that there would be considerable risk in sending slow merchant ships to Crete it was so important to maintain . supplies to the island that it was. thought the attempt should be made. Convoy A.N.31, consisting of two ships, escorted by ,AUCKLAND, left Alexandria at 0500/26th May. It was arranged for CALCUTTA and DEFENDER to join the convoy at'0600/27. . 7

70. GLENROY, escorted .by STUART,

. COVENTRY and JAGUAR had left Alexandria

at. 2000/25th May with a Battalion of the Queens Regiment. The force was subjected to  bombing  attacks by reconnaissance aircraft during the forenoon of 26th.May. At x820 there were two  heavy dive bombing attacks by aircraft  formations, and.one appeared to be damaged during these attacks. A final attack by low fiying torpedo

May, proceeded towards Kaso to meet 

One aircraft was shot down:



bombers occutred at 2050.. GLENROY avoided the. torpedoes but. received slight damage and Ir casualties from near misses and machine.gun attacks. Three of her landing craft were holed and a large dump  of cased petrol on the upper deck caught fire. The fire lasted for one  and a

half hours, during which time the ship had to j

steer-south in order to bring the wind aft. On of the landing craft at  the davits had to

cut adrift owing to the proximity of, the flameg. With 800 troops on board and a large cargo  f. petrol, GLENROY was in a nasty situation, but the fire was put out by 1950, -when a northerly .course  for Crete was resumed. Half an  hour later GLENROY - decided: that - the operation. of landing the troops at Tymbaki must be cancelled owing to shortness of time, reduction in. available landing craft and unsuitable weather for landing on'a beach. GLENROY and -escort were accordingly turned back for  Alexandria-at 2115..--   ,

"91. In Crete our troops were compelled to withdraw still further towards Suda and it was felt that it could not  be long before the whole front in that sector collapsed. .  Our troops in the Heraklion sector had fared better. ' Two of the   I  tanks landed by,' A  Lighter Number 2 at Tymbaki and the Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders landed at the same place by GLENGYLE had broken through from the'south. The enemy had landed large numbers of men by parachute and troop carrier but had been. successfully .held  at nearly all : 72. During -the night 26th/27th May, ABDIEL,- HERO and NIZAM landed 750 Special Service Troops and Army stores in- Suda Bay.  This was the last reinforcement that -was sent.into the island. .These ships left for Alexandes with 930 men who were: not required in Tete, . is

(a) Force A, now consisting of QUEEN ELIZABETH, BARHAM, JERVIS, JANUS, KELVIN, NAPIER, KANDAHAR and HASTY, were about 250 miles south east of  Kaso. (AJAX and DIDO were detached at

* 0600 to, Alexandria). .

(6) ABDIEL, HERO and NIZAM had disembarked troops at Suda and were on their way back to Alexandria via the Kaso Strait,

_ cafrying 930 personnel not wanted in Crete.

(c) AJAX and DIDO had been detached

from Force A at 0600 and were returning to ' Alexandria  in accordance, with the Com- " mander-in-Chief, Mediterranean's original in-

tention (see paragraph 67).
