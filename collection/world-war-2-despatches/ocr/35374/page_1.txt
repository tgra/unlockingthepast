NOTIFICATION OF A STATE OF WAR
4 WITH JAPAN. : :

Tue following note was addressed to the
Japanese Chargé d’Affaires on the 8th Decem-
ber: — . .

Sir, .

On the evening of the 7th December His
‘Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom
learnt that Japanese forces, without previous
warming either in the form of a-declaration of
war or of an ultimatum with ‘a conditional
declaration of war, had attempted a landing on
the coast of Malaya and bombed Singapore and
Hong Kong.

2. In view of these wanton acts of unpro-
voked aggression, committed in flagrant viola-
tion of international law, and particularly of
Article 1 of the Third Hague Convention, rela-
tive to the opening of hostilities, to which both
japan and the United Kingdom are parties,
His Majesty’s Ambassador at Tokyo has been
instructed to inform the Imperial Japanese
Government in the name of His Majesty’s
Government in the Uriited Kingdom that a
state of war exists between the two ‘countries.

T have, &c.
WINSTON CHURCHILL.
Mr. Shinichi Kamimura, :

Japanese Chargé d’ Affaires.
