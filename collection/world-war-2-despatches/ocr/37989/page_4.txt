2762 SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 19 JUNE, 1947

“* Torpedoes approaching, they will pass ahead
of you.’’ I decided, however, not to take any
chances, and altered course to 180 ‘degrees,
engaging the enemy on the starboard side, with
the range closing rapidly. So as to blank
ACHILLES’ fire for as short a time as possible,
I directed her by signal to pass under the stern
of AJAX.

35. At 0732 GRAF SPEE turned away to
the west, making much smoke and zigzagging
to throw out the First Division’s gunfire, which,
particularly from ACHILLES, appeared to be
very accurate at this stage. AJAX was also
making very good use of her three available
guns. GRAF SPEE altered to the south-west
at 0736, and again brought all guns to bear
on the First Division.

36. By 0738 the range was down to 8,000
yards. At this time I received a report that
AJAX had only 20 per cent. of ammunition
left and had only three guns in action, as one
of the hoists had failed in ‘‘B’’ turret and
“X” and “ Y’’ turrets were both out of
action.

GRAF SPEE’S shooting was still very
accurate and she did not appear to have
suffered much damage.

I therefore decided to break off the day
action and try and close in again after dark.
Accordingly at 0740 AJAX and ACHILLES
turned away to the east under cover of smoke.

37. One of GRAF SPEE’S last salvos
drought down AJAX’S main top mast and
destroyed all her aerials. Jury aerials were,
however, soon rigged.

38. It subsequently transpired that the re-
port of shortage of ammunition in AJAX re-
ferred only to ‘‘A’”’ turret, which had been
firing continuously for 81 minutes, but this was
not realised at the time.

39. GRAF SPEE made no attempt to
follow, ‘but steadied on.a course of about 270
degrees, proceeding at about 22 knots on a
course direct for the River Plate.

40. After opening the range under smoke for
six minutes, I again turned the First Division
to the westward and ordered ACHILLES to
shadow in Sector “‘ A ’’, on the enemy’s star-
board quarter, and AJAX in Sector ““B’’,
on his port quarter. The range at this time
being about 15 miles, .

41. The general trend of GRAF SPEE’S
retreat at this stage was about 255 degrees. His
very conspicuous control tower made it an easy
matter to shadow him at long range in the
excellent visibility prevailing.

At 0807, as AJAX’S aerials were still down,
I ordered ACHILLES to broadcast GRAF
SPEE’S pesition, course and speed to all
British merchant ships. A similar message was
broadcast every hour from AJAX until the
end of the chase. I also passed this informa-
tion to Admiralty at ror7 and 1700.

42. At og1z, AJAX recovered her aircraft,
the operation being excellently performed
under difficult conditions by Captain C. H. L.
Woodhouse, and the pilot of the aircraft, Lieu-
tenant E. D. G. Lewin, Royal Navy, and
shadowing was resumed.

43. At 0946 I ordered CUMBERLAND, then
at the Falkland Islands, to close the Plate at

full speed. She left at 1200, on the initiative
of her Commanding Officer, Captain W. H. G.
Fallowfield, Royal Navy, who had by then
only received very jumbled messages. On
receipt of my signal she at once increased to
full speed.

At 1005 ACHILLES over-estimating the
enemy’s speed had closed to 23,000 yards.
GRAF SPEE thereupon altered course and
fired two three gun salvos at ACHILLES; the
first was very short, but the second fell close
alongside. She appeared to wait for the first
salvo to fall before firing the second.

ACHILLES turned away at full speed under
smoke and resumed shadowing at longer range.

44. At 1104 a merchant ship was sighted
close to GRAF SPEE. She was stopped and
was blowing off steam. A few minutes later
the following W/T signal was received on 500
k/es: AJAX (pre-war call sign) from GRAF
SPEE—" please pick up lifeboats of English
steamer.”

On coming up with the merchant ship she
turned out to be the British 5.5.
SHAKESPEARE. All her boats were hoisted, -
and in response to my signals she reported that
she was quite all right and did not require any
assistance. By this time she was moving out
to the southern flank.

At 1105 I received a signal from EXETER
who reported that all her turrets were out of
action and that she was flooded forward up to
No. 14 bulkhead but could still do 18 knots.

» I ordered ‘her to proceed to the Falkland

Islands at whatever speed was possible without
straining her bulkheads, She later reported
that one gun of ‘“‘Y¥’’ turret could be fired
in local control. ' .

At 1347 I informed the British Naval
Attache, Buenos Aires, that GRAF SPEE
was heading direct for the Plate.

45. At 1543 ACHILLES signalled ‘“‘ Enemy
in sight 297 ’’, and later reported ‘‘ Suspected
8 inch cruiser.’’ However, at 1559, she nega-
tived the report, and the ship sighted was
subsequently identified as S.S. DELANE,
whose streamlined funnel gave her a similar
appearance to a “‘ Blucher’’ at very long
Tange.

46. Shadowing continued without incident
until 1915, when GRAF SPEE altered course
and fired two salvos at AJAX who immediately
turned away under smoke. The first salvo fell
short and in line, the second in AJAX’S wake
asshe turned. The range at this time was about
26,000 yards.

47. It now appeared that GRAF SPEE in-
tended to enter the Plate, and at r1g02 I ordered
ACHILLES to follow her if she went west of
Lobos, while AJAX would proceed south of the
English Bank in case she doubled back that
way. I also directed ACHILLES to take
every, advantage of territorial waters while
shadowing. My instructions were perfectly
carried out by Captain W. E. Parry who took
ACHILLES inside Lobos Island and close to
the Uruguayan coast.

48. Just after sunset GRAF SPEE fired three
salvos at ACHILLES, the third being very
close. ACHILLES replied with five salvos and
appeared to straddle. ACHILLES at this time
was just clear of Punta Negra.
