APPENDIX  C.  BuiLp-up or Axis Forces.

When the Allied forces landed in Algeria, there were no Axis troops in French North Africa; in Tripolitania there was one Italian division (Spezia) and a substantial number of L of C troops. The German and Italian Armistice Commissions, however, were spread throughout French North Africa, and maintained a considerable measure of control over economic affairs and were very ready to interfere in other matters. The immediate reaction to our landing was the formation of a mainly German force to secure Tunis and Bizerta. This force was formed of units most readily available at that moment, and its impromptu formation is clearly shown in its composition. It began to arrive on the roth November, personnel and light equipment being brought by air and heavy equipment by sea. The landing of this force was not opposed by the French, who were subsequently disarmed and their coastal and A.A. batteries taken over. Having seized the ports, and the important aerodromes

5463

of El Aouina (Tunis) and Sidi Ahmed (Bizerta), this force moved out with the intention of securing the high and mountainous country on the Tunisian-Algerian frontier and preventing the Allies debouching into the Tunisian plains. It made contact with Allied forces to whom a proportion of the French troops in Tunisia had rallied, on the general line Djebel AbiodB ja-Medjez on the 26th Novemer, 1942. By this date the Axis forces in Tunisia consisted of the following units : 

German 

Storm Regiment Koch (Air Force troops).

Barenthin Regiment (Air Force troops).

Marsch Battalions 17, 18, 20 and ai.

Parachute Engineer Battalion Witzig.

rg0 Tank Battalion (69 tanks).

Advance elements of ro Armoured Division.

Miscellaneous Artillery and Anti-tank units. Ttalian 

10 Bersaglieri Regiment.

Elements of Superga Division, including four

infantry battalions.

Some of these units had been intended for Rommel's army; 190 Tank Battalion, for example, had been formed for go Light Division; one company. of Witzig's Battalion had already joined the Ramcke Brigade, and

the Marsch Battalions had been destined to be  reinforcement drafts but were in fact sent to

Tunisia and put into the line, where they fought as infantry battalions. Regiment Koch of the German Air Force was. brought from France by air for which move it was readily available and trained, having been formed originally as 5 Parachute Regiment.

Barenthin Regiment was also formed of Air Force personnel, being chiefly composed of the staff and pupils of the Parachute School at Witstock and the Glider School at Posen.

Thus by the end of November, 1942, the Axis forces which had arrived in Tunisia, exclusive of Services, amounted to approximately 15,500 fighting troops, 130 tanks, 60 field guns and 30 anti-tank guns.

During the first half of December, the remainder of ro Armoured Division and the Italian Superga Division were brought over, but in transit each division lost a substantial proportion of  its heavy equipment transported by sea. As a result, ro Armoured Division never could muster its full establishment of tanks, and both divisions were short of artillery. In addition to these two formations, further German Marsch battalions were brought over at regular intervals, some of which continued to be employed as independent infantry battalions, and were not broken: up as reinforcements. These independent battalions were used either to bring up the original impromptu force to the strength of a division, which was originally called Division Broich and latterly Division Manteuffel after its commanders, or were used to reinforce the Italian Superga Division which had been stationed on the enemy's left flank in mountainous country south of Zaghouan. In addition, the Bafile and Grado Battalions of the Italian San Marco Marine Regiment and a Bersaglieri Battalion were also brought over, The most significant arrival at this time was 501 Heavy Tank Battalion with 43 tanks, of which 20 were the new Mark VIL, which first went into action against the French 19 Corps on the 18th January, 1943.
