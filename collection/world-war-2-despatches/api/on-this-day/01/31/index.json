            "description": "the strength of the and Armoured Brigade was now so low that it could not oppose more than twenty-five German tanks with any hope of success. It fortunately was not put to the test, since the enemy kept his main forces round Msus while pressing the pursuit of the 4th Indian Division. But the weakness of our armour made it necessary to retire rather more swiftly than had been intended, and, having obtained General Ritchie's permission, General Tuker withdrew to Gaf Tartaga and Slonta during the night of the 31st January."

The text of the Agreement which was to achieve this object was prepared by the Political Branch, East Africa Command, after many discussions with the Emperor, and was the subject of two visits to London by the then Chief Political Officer, Major-General Sir Philip Mitchell, K.C.M.G., M.C. As the result of these discussions the Agreement in its final form was presented by Sir Philip Mitchell to the Emperor in December, 1941. The Emperor raised a number of minor points but eventually accepted the text with only unimportant modifications and the Agreement, and its accompanying Military Convention, were signed with due formality on 31st January, 1942."

A note-worthy incident of the fighting on this hill was the gallant bayonet charge by a party of Sappers and Miners led by an Indian Officer in aid of a hard-pressed party of 3/14 Punjabs. On the morning of 31st January, 2 Camerons attacked and stormed the rocky ridge known as Gibraltar. On this being secured, x Royal Fusiliers, supported by  IT  tanks, launched a successful attack against the enemy positions in the plain between Laquatat and M. Cochen. 2 Camerons exploited along the lower slopes west of M. Cochen, knocking-out enemy medium tanks with anti-tank rifles as they advanced. Shortly before mid-day three  I \" tanks and the carriers of 2 Camerons carried out a raid along the west side of M. Cochen towards the main road. In this area they: encountered enemy medium and light tanks and troops which were probably the enemy's counter-attacking force waiting in this area. Five medium and five light tanks were destroyed and large numbers of enemy troops, both Italian and Native, were killed. At 1430 hours 3/1 Punjabs, supported by two  I  tanks, passed through 1 Royal Fusiliers and secured some low hills just to the south-east of Agordat. These were captured just before nightfall, and the enemy's main L. of C. was cut. Artillery O.Ps. on M. Cochen had reported during the afternoon that they could see the enemy withdrawing from the Laquatat feature into the town, and the R.A.F. reported large bodies of enemy streaming through. the gorge north of M. Cochen. Two  I tanks under command of a SecondLieutenant were sent into the gorge after dark in an attempt to create a panic. Next morning Agordat town was occupied by 5th Indian Infantry Brigade, and although the enemy and native population had indulged in a night of looting, destruction of property was not unduly great. A large quantity of war material and guns fell into our hands. A proportion of the enemy infantry escaped by rail and over the hills to the north of the main road,"
