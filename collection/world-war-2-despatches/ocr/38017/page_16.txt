79. The Rear Admiral, Dover, arrived back
from the coast ina M.T.B. and during the fore-
noon a joint Naval and Military conference was
held to devise a plan for the forthcoming night’s
evacuation, The fact that evacuation traffic
was suspended in daylight hours enabled all
transport resources to accumulate during the
day and to be held available for a massed
descent upon Dunkirk Harbour during the
night. By making provision for increased
pier and berthing parties and traffic controlled
‘by motor boat in the harbour channels, it was
hoped to berth all craft that were available
between the hours of 2100/2 and 0300/3.

The times of sailing of all vessels were
adjusted so as to space them out over the
evacuation period at Dunkirk, and allowance
was made for a proportion failing to make the
passage.

The French agreed to make their own
arrangements for embarkation from the Dun-
kirk East Beach and the West Pier on the
new outer harbour.

At 1530 two R.A.F. Motor Boats, 243 and
270, left in company for Dunkirk carrying
Commander J. C. Clouston and an augmented
pier party. When off Gravelines attacks were
made on the boats by eight Junkers 87 with
machine guns and small bombs. No. 243 had
a near miss which damaged her. For ten
minutes No. 270 carried on trying to avoid
attacks. She then returned to No. 243 but
Commander Clouston who was in the water in-
structed 270 to proceed. Destroyers were in-
structed to look for survivors. Two were
picked up only. One stated that he saw Com-
mander Clouston dead in the water.

‘80. At 1030 am urgent request  trans-
mitted ‘‘ en clair’ was received from Dunkirk
for Hospital Ships as follows :—

“* Wounded sitvation acute and Hospital
Ships should enter during day. Geneva
Convention will be honourably observed it
is felt and that the enemy will refrain from

, attacking.’

As this appeared to be ihe only way of
evacuating the wounded, observing that the
whole facilities of the port during the night
evacuation hours would ibe required for fighting
troops, it was decided to send two Hospital
Ships. _The WORTHING sailed at 1300 and
the PARIS at r7oo. At 1440, the A/S patrol
was overheard on R/T reporting that the
WORTHING was being bombed at a point
about two-thirds of the way across the
Channel. She returned to United Kingdom
reporting that she had been attacked by 12
Junkers. The attack caused no casualties,
but plates were started and there was some
superficial damage. She had to return to har-
bour to refuel before commencing another trip
to Dunkirk.

At 1915 PARIS reported that she was
bombed and badly damaged with engines use-
less, at the point where the WORTHING had
been attacked, and at 1947 she sent out an
S.0.S. Tugs were sent to her assistance.

Thus the last attempt to evacuate the
wounded by Hospital Carrier from Dunkirk
was brought to nought.

The PARIS subsequently sank shortly after
midnight at W. Buoy ro miles off the French
coast.

SUPPLEMENT to taz LONDON GAZETTE, 17 JULY, 1947

8r. At 1700 movement towards Dunkirk
commenced. The Armada consisted of 13
personnel vessels, 2 large store carriers, IZ
destroyers, 5 paddle minesweepers 9g fleet
sweepers I special service vessel 9 drifters 6
skoots, 2 armed yachts, 1 gunboat, a large
number of tugs, lifeboats, etc. formed either
in organised tows or free lance. The composi-
tion of the French contingent was unknown,
it was thought to consist of 6 small destroyers,
4 avisos and about 120 fishing craft.

8a. At 1538 the S.N.O. Dunkirk made the
following situation report: —

“ French still maintain front line except

for area east of Bergues where the Germans

have penetrated two miles on a two-mile

front. Counter attack being made at 1500.
In port no movement. Present situation
hopeful.””

83. At 2145 it was learned that the ROYAL
DAFFODIL, the first of the personnel vessels,
had been bombed near the North Goodwin
Light Vessel on the outward passage whence
she returned to Ramsgate. At 2200 it was
learned that loaded vessels were leaving
Dunkirk.

84. At 2330 S.N.O. Dunkirk ‘reported
“ B.E.F. evacuated.”

Monday, 3rd June.

85. The hopes that a large number of French
troops would tbe lifted following the comple-
tion of B.E.F. embarkation, was shaken when
at 0030 Rear Admiral, Dover, reported from
Dunkirk that four ships were now alongside,
that there were no French troops. Reported
again at or15, “‘ Plenty of ships cannot get
troops.’

At 0312, Dunkirk reported that all ships were
leaving and that the block ships had entered.

When the ships returned to United Kingdom,
it was learnt that the flow of French troops
had dwindled away shortly after midnight.
One ship waited 2} hours to embark her load
instead of the normal half hour. A possible
explanation was thought to be that a French
counter attack, which had been arranged for
the afternoon of the 2nd, had had to be post-
poned to the evening, no doubt deranging
despatch of troops to the rear for evacuation.
The result was that between midnight and
0300/3 a lifting capacity of about 10,000 was
left empty.

86. The night’s embarkation at Dunkirk had
been carried out without disturbance by enemy
action. During the forenoon a conference was
held at Dover to improve the arrangements for
the night 3/6-4/6 as a result of experience
gained. The general plan remained unaltered
except that provision was made for the use
by British ships of the west pier in the New
Outer Port, since it appeared that the French
had insufficient ships at their disposal to make
full use of this valuable berth. Similarly a
number of power boats which had been work-
ing off the Malo Beach were, on this occasion,
to be sent in to Quay Felix Faure. No assur-
ance could be obtained that this coming night
would terminate the operation and considerable
anxiety was felt regarding the effect of the
gradual exhaustion of officers and men of the
ships taking part in the ‘‘ Dynamo.” This
exhaustion was particularly marked in the
Destroyer force the remnants of which had been
