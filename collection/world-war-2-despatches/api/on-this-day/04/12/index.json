But before the operations actually started, it was decided to split up the brigade and attach one battalion to each of the 77, 111 and 14 Brigades, to act as a garrison for the stronghold which was to form the base of each of the three above-mentioned brigades. 3 (West African) Brigade completed its fly-in by the 12th April. These formations used airstrips established near Manhton ( * Aberdeen  ), twenty-seven miles north-northwest of Indaw ; Mawlu ( White City  ), twenty. miles north of Katha, and in the Hopin area. During this second phase some 6,000 troops, 850 animals and 550,000 Ibs. of stores were transported with the very slight casualties of 15 killed (all in one aircraft) and six injured."

By this time the German armoured forces, supported by dive-bombers, advancing  Westwards from Bitolj, had overwhelmed the YugoSlav Army and had succeeded in joining y with the Italians in Albania. They then advanced Southward from Bitolj to Florina, threatening to isolate the Greeks in Albania from our own forces further East. The Greeks were thus compelled to withdraw from the Northern front of Albania, while our Armoured Brigade and an Australian Infantry Brigade were moved Westwards to close the Florina Gap, where they were joined by a Greek cavalry division from the Koritza area. On xoth April, as the enemy continued his Westward thrust into Yugo-Slavia, Blenheims attacked enemy M.T. columns and A.F.V s. on the PrilepBitolj road inflicting heavy damage on them. During the night of r1th/12th April, Wellingtons followed up this effort with further attacks on the enemy at Prilep and Kilkis."

            "description": "Meanwhile, our forces holding the Florina Gap had been hotly attacked by the Germans on oth April and compelled, after a strong resistance, to withdraw on 11th April. By the evening of 12th April, our front had been formed roughly on a line extending from the coast near Mount Olympus, along the Aliakmon River to Servia, thence N.W. towards the Albanian lakes. Continued bombing and machine-gun attacks by Blenheims and Hurricanes contributed to the delay of the enemy's advance during the critical periods in which our troops were falling back on new positions. These operations were inevitably accompanied by considerable losses and in one raid on the 13th April, for example, a complete formation of 6 Blenheims of No. 21z Squadron was destroyed by Me.109 s. Wellingtons continued to attack more distant objectives. On the night of 13th/z4th April a force of 10 Wellingtons from Nos. 37 and 38 Squadrons made a further effective attack on the railway goods yard at Sofia, destroying a large number of trucks containing explosives. At the same time - other Wellingtons bombed and machine-gunned M.T. convoys at Yannitsa and Gorna Djumaya. In operations on the following night Wellingtons destroyed the bridge over the Vardar River at Veles and Blenheims dropped bombs on"

            "description": "A new line was therefore decided on, that running from Mount Olympus along the line of the River Aliakhmon. This was a strong position provided that the Yugoslavs and the Greeks were able to close the roads by which the line could be turned. The withdrawal began on the night rrth/12th April and was completed by dawn on the 13th. But during its course it became obvious that the 12th and 2oth Greek Divisions were disintegrating. They soon became thoroughly disorganized and only a few sub-units retained any fighting value. This was due in no way to lack of courage or fighting spirit, but to their lack of modern armament and their ox-drawn transport, which was too slow and unwieldy as soon as it became necessary to embark on a long move. The withdrawal of General Mackay's force from Amynteion had to be covered by the rst Armoured Brigade, who carried out successful counter-attacks on enemy armoured fighting vehicles. During this withdrawal the brigade experienced considerable mechanical trouble, similar to that of the 3rd Armoured Brigade in"
