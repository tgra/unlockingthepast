38 SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 JANUARY, 10947

4. On 17th November, 1943, 1 issued a Direc-
tive to the Air Marshal Commanding, Royal
Air Force Second Tactical Air Force and to
the Commanding General, United States Ninth
Air Force, in which I informed them of my
appointment as Air Commander-in-Chief and
of the respective dates on which their units came
under my operational control. I further
directed that these forces should proceed, with-
out delay, to prepare for operations in support
of two British and two American Field Armies
in an assault on the Continent. I also issued a
Directive to the Air Marshal Commanding, Air
Defence of Great Britain, setting out the func-
tions and organisation of the Air Defence of
Great Britain, following on its conversion from
Royal Air Force Fighter Command.

5. On 6th December, 1943, I issued a further
Directive to the forces under my command,
outlining the ‘‘ Overlord’ plan and defining
the contro] that J would exercise as Air Com-
mander-in-Chief. ‘A table showing these forces
and the chain of command is at Appendix
“A” (not reproduced).

Operation “‘ Pointblank ”’

6. During the preliminary period of prepara-
tion for the assault, in late 1943 and early 1944,
the medium and light ‘bomber forces of the
Allied Expeditionary Air Force continued to
lend support to Operation ‘‘ Pointblank.”” This
was the name given to the combined bomber
plan of the strategical bombing forces which had
as its aims, first, the reduction of the fighter
forces of the G.A.F., second, the general reduc-
tion in the war potential of Germany, and third,
the weakening of the will of the German people
to continue the struggle. The co-ordination of
these operations was effected through a Com-
bined Operational Planning Committee, which
was a joint British/American Fighter and
Bomber Committee responsible for planning
daylight operations when the United States
Army Air Force heavy bombers took part.
During this preliminary period, the operations
by Allied Expeditionary Air Force medium and
light bombers in conjunction with, and in sup-
port of United States Eighth Air Force were
given precedence over any other daylight opera-
tions. A second Committee, known as the 11
Group Planning Committee, co-ordinated opera-
tions of the medium and light bombers of the
Allied Expeditionary Air Force other than those
in the support role mentioned above. The activi-
ties of the fighter forces of the Allied Expedi-
tionary Air Force as escort to, and in support
of, bombing operations were also co-ordinated
sarough these Committees.

Niath Ai Force Released from “ Pointblank ’’
Commitments

7. On roth March, 1944, I forwarded a Direc-
tive to Commanding General, United States
Ninth Air Force, advising him that you, as the
Supreme Allied Commander, had decided that
the time had come for the operations of the
Ninth Air Force to be directed towards the
preparation for Operation ‘‘ Overlord ’’ and
that it would, therefore, operate exclusively
under the Allied Expeditionary Air Force
and ibe released from the
‘to assist the United States Eighth Air
Force in ‘ Pointblank’’ operations. As
an exception to this ruling, such fighters of
the United States Ninth Fighter Command as

commitment.

were suitable and available continued to
operate as escort to the United States Eighth
Air Force when required.

8. At this time also, I advised the forces under
my command that the most important assistance
the Allied Expeditionary Air Force could give
the Army during the preparatory phase
would be by attacking the enemy’s rail com-
munications, with the object of so disorganising
his railway system that he would find it difficult
to supply his divisions in Northern France when
the fighting started and still more difficult to
bring reinforcements into the lodgment area.
Selected rail centres were, therefore, put in the
first priority for attack.

Role of Strategic Air Forces

g. Until March, 1944, strategic air forces
comprising the United States Eighth Air Force
and Royal Air Force Bomber Command, con-
tinued to be employed on Operation “‘ Point-
blank ’’ under the direction of the British Chief
of Air Staff acting as a representative of the
Combined Chiefs of Staff. In March, 1944, as
the completion of the. preparatory tasks for
Operation ‘‘ Overlord ’”’ ‘became more urgent,
the Combined Chiefs of Staff directed that
“* Overlord ’’ should have priority over ‘‘ Point-
blank ’’ and that the direction of strategic air
forces should pass from ‘the British Chief of
Air Staff to yourself as the Supreme Allied Com-
mander, on 14th April, 1944.

Io. You instructed your deputy, Air Chief
Marshal Sir Arthur W. Tedder, G.C.B., to
exercise for you general supervision of all air
forces, particularly in the co-ordination of the
efforts of heavy bomber forces to be em-
ployed on operations ‘‘ Pointblank’’ and
“* Overlord ’’. I was responsible to you for
all air operations in connection with the latter
plan and I accordingly passed to Air Chief
Marshal Tedder my requirements for theavy
bomber effort both in the preparatory and
assault phases. During May, 1944, the
Deputy Supreme Allied Commander decided
that all air operations could be more easily
planned and laid on at a single headquarters,
and the Air Operations Planning Staff of
Supreme Headquarters was moved to my
Headquarters. The Deputy Supreme Allied
Commander and the Commanders of the
strategical and tactical air forces then regularly
attended my daily conferences at Stanmore,
thus enabling all operation orders covering all
air forces occupied with ‘‘ Overlord ’’ tasks, to-
be co-ordinated and given rapidly to the forces.
to be employed.

Formation of Advanced A.E.A.F.

rr. In order to achieve the most economical
and effective employment of the air forces at
my disposal for the assault and its subsequent
development, I considered it essential that the
air operations in immediate and direct support
of the land battle should be specially co-
ordinated and directed. I, therefore, decided
to establish a small operational organisation to
be known as Advanced Allied Expeditionary
Air Force. Under my general direction, the
Commander Advanced A.E.A.F. was given the
task of directing and co-ordinating the planning
for and operations of such forces of the United
States Ninth Air Force and Royal Air Force
Second Tactical Air Force as were allotted to
him from time to time.
