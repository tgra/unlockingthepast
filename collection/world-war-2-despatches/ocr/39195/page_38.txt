prior to the monsoon, for the possible con-
tinued maintenance of Fourteenth Army.

was absolutely essential, since the land com-
munications would prove quite inadequate
during the rains, and I could not gamble,
at this stage, on capturing a South Burma port
and establishing maintenance from it. The
interests of 15 Indian Corps had to tbe sub-
ordinated to those of Fourteenth Army, who
were playing for high stakes. I was reluctantly
obliged to reduce the air supply lift allotted
to 15 Indian Conps from 130 to 30 tons per
day, though I realised that this meant the
abandonment of General Christison’s plan—
which was going well—for the encirclement
of 54 Japanese Division. Orders had, there-
fore, to be issued to all three brigades of 82
(West African) Division to break contact and
make for the An—Tamandu road; but, as
will appear later, this did not mean that the
Japanese in the An area would be Jeft un-
molested.

205. In accordance with the policy for easing
the maintenance situation, 25 Indian Division
was now directed to withdraw to Akyab by
the end of the month (March). 22 (East African)
Brigade, from Ramree, was to relieve 53
Brigade at Ru-Ywa, at once, but, until the
Forward Maintenance Area at Tamandu was
firmly established, 74 Brigade was to remain in
the area under command of 82 (West African)
Division.

206. The achievements of 25 Indian Division
are well summarized in the farewell order
issued to this formation by the Commander,
15 Indian Corps, on their departure : —

“You have to your credit the clearance.

from the Mayu Peninsula of the famous 55
Japanese Division and the capture of Akyab
and clearance of the surrounding districts,
the Myebon operations and the surprise land-
ing and resultant decisive battle of the whole
campaign—Kangaw. You finished off your
campaign to clear the Northern and Central
Arakan of the Japanese 54 Division by the
brilliantly executed landing at Ru-Ywa—
leading to your final capture of the enemy’s
base at Tamandu.

Throughout these operations you have
shown magnificent fighting qualities and the
highest morale. You have to your credit the
successful accomplishment of probably the
most difficult combined operations any
British force has ever attempted.

You have inflicted 8,300 casualties on the
Japanese and taken 37 guns.”

207. On the 13th March, naval forces under
the command of Captain E, T. Cooper, R.N.,
transported 4 Brigade of 26 Indian Division
from Kyaukpyu and landed it unopposed due
east of the village of Letpan, 36 miles south of
Ru-Ywa. The landing was supported by naval
gunfire from the ROEBUCK, ESKIMO,
CAUVERY and JUMNA. This final landing
on the Arakan coast was effected in order to
cut the main road behind the enemy’s forward
troops. It brought us nearer Taungup and the
western entrance to the last pass across the
Yomas into the Irrawaddy Valley. The
advance of 4 Brigade down the road axis to-
wards -Taungup was rapid, despite considerable
opposition, until it was held up, on the 25th
March, by hill positions three miles south of

the Tanlwe Chaung, about five miles from
Taungup.

208. In the meantime, the enemy had
succeeded in establishing a strong block on the
Tamandu—An road, to the west of 2 (West
African) Brigade, and the supply situation of
this Brigade was, for some days, critical. The
toad was, however, reopened on the 26th
March. 2 Brigade was ordered to withdraw
west to the Tamandu area, while 1 (West
African) Brigade, now the most easterly troops
on the An road, readjusted their dispositions
east of Letmauk (seven miles east of
Tamandu). On the 17th March, 22 (Bast
African) Brigade was concentrated at Ru-
Ywa and assumed charge of that area, It
was then ordered to move south in support
of 4 Brigade of 26 Indian Division, which
was advancing towards Taungup. By the 23rd
March, forward troops had reached the north
bank of the An Chaung at Kywegu, meeting
only slight opposition and, by the end of the
month, they had reached Letpan.

209. The time had now arrived, in the begin-
ning of April, to relieve 26 Indian Division, as
the continuation of the phasing out of 15 Indian
Corps. 36 and 71 Brigades had remained on
Ramree Island and thus it remained only to
relieve 4 Brigade in the Taungup area. 25
Indian Division had already been withdrawn,
and so there remained on the mainland, in
addition to 4 Indian Brigade, only 82 (West
African) Division, disposed between Tamandu
and Letmauk (where 1 (West African) Brigade
was in contact with the enemy), and 22 (East
African) Brigade, which was advancing south
from Letpan. In the Irrawaddy sector, the
rapid advance of Fourteenth Army was bring-
ing it appreciably closer to Minbu, at the
eastern end of the An—Minbu road. It was,
therefore, clearly the responsibility of 15
Indian Corps to prevent the Japanese forces
about An withdrawing east to oppose Four-
teenth Army. Since, without air supply, it
would not be possible to despatch a column
to block the enemy’s escape route east of An,
the best alternative was to maintain an offen-
sive force before An, whose réle would be to
keep the enemy facing west, without actually
driving him from his present positions. This
task was allotted to 1 (West African) Brigade.
The Japanese appeared remarkably sensitive
to the activities of this force and the ruse was
entirely successful. This new operation up the
An road released 2 and 4 (West African)
Brigades. 2 Brigade was immediately ordered
south to relieve 4 Indian Brigade, thus freeing
this formation to rejoin 26 Indian Division on
Ramree prior to its departure for India. 4
(West African) Brigade was used to secure the
base at Tamandu, and, when this became no
longer necessary, it too was: transferred to
Taungup.

210. During the second week in April, it
seemed evident that the Japanese were
out north and north-east of Taungup. Re-
ported withdrawals of their troops between
Taungup and Sandoway into the hills east of
Taungup also indicated that the enemy were
now more with preventing our ad-
vance across the Yomas, than in maintaining
their defence of the coast further south. Patrols
of 4 Indian Brigade found Taungup deserted
on.the 15th April. This Brigade was relieved
