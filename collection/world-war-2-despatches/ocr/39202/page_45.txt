Air supply.

557. Burma proved how an Army could
march for a thousand miles through some of
the worst country in the world so long as air
supply was guaranteed by our retaining air
superiority and having adequate-air transport.

558. There is no doubt that the Japanese
fully appreciated how vitally important Allied
air supply was to the success of our operations.
They confessed that all means possible were
used to interfere with Allied air supply, but,
due to the small size of their Air Force, they
failed in their efforts.

559. Burma, I consider, has given us the
classic example of an Army in the field existing
on air supply, and the technique evolved from
these air supply operations must surely com-
mand serious attention.

Lessons which emerged in South East Asia.
560. The war in South Hast Asia, has
immeasurably enriched our experience in air
operations in the East ; quickened our percep-
tion to the dangers of a purely static defence

system for these Empire territories, and shown.
how essential is air power for future defence.

The need for greater squadron mobility.

561. One of the most noticeable features of
our operations in South East Asia was the
clumsy and inadequate method which we had
been forced to employ to maintain the mobility
of our squadrons, their personnel and
equipment.

562. This implies no reflection on the ground
staff and maintenance organisation; who
succeeded in achieving good results with the
equipment and facilities available when moving
the squadrons forward, month after month,
through a country devoid of proper communi-
cations and faced with flooding during the
monsoon, when roads turned into quagmires.

563. But a squadron working in support of
front-line troops must have greater mobility

to enable its ground organisation to move to
its next base, and not find itself on some narrow
inadequate road, choked for miles ahead with
slow moving army transport.

564. It is on record that during April, 1945,
when over 80 R.A.F. units moved forward in
Burma to new bases in keeping with the over-
all plan of advance, one R.A.F. wing, having
insufficient road transport, had to use ” bullock
carts. Against this, there is the more logical
instance of another R.A.F. wing which moved
from Akyab to Rangoon by air, taking with
it all its equipment and personnel and leaving
behind only M.T., since it was picking up a
new allotment of vehicles at its destination.

565. With so many moves by squadrons in
the forward areas—many going ahead with the
bare minimum of staff to keep aircraft operd-'
tional pending the arrival of the remainder
of their ground personnel bringing up essential
equipment—squadrons often found themselves
separated from a proportion of their servicing
echelons for’ several days due to lack of trang-
port. Until the full staff of the echelons
arrived, an enormous amount of work was
thrown upon ground crew, since aircraft at the
time were being pressed into service in support

‘of the advance and had to be loaded with

bombs and with ammunition.
needed daily servicing.

566. This, I consider, is one of the stipe
important lessons which emerged from opera-
tions in South East Asia. Experience has
shown that Air Power, in the movement of its
ground organisations, must have infinitely
greater mobility in future, and be air-lifted by
its own transports.
