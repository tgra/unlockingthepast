This, especially the appointment of General Kuter, was a big step forward but that it did not go far enough soon became evident, and at a further meeting at Thelergma airfield on 24th January, the Commander-in-Chief made me ** responsible for the employment of American troops,  though not yet in control of the French Corps. After a long conference with me that night General Juin agreed to place his Corps under my command, and next day this decision was confirmed by General Giraud.",

As a result General Anderson was appointed by General Eisenhower on ist January to   co-ordinate   the whole front and on 24th January both XIX and II Corps were placed directly under his command.
