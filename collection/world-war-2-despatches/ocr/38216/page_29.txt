SUPPLEMENT 1o THz LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948 375

285. As Japanese activity against the West
‘coast increased, so, from 15th January, air
attacks were made on an increased scale:—

15th Jan.—by 6 Hudsons, 6 Glenn Martins
and 3 Blenheims escorted by 12 Buffaloes
attacked barges in the Linggi River: two

‘barges were sunk and three damaged by the

Hudsons. .

16th Janw.—15 Buffaloes attacked transport
and moveinents on the road Tampin/Gemas
whilst 9 Blenheims and 6 Glenn Martins
followed by 4 Buffaloes attacked barges in
the Muar River where further landings were
taking place.

17th Jan.—g Vildebeestes escorted by 6

Buffaloes continued attacks on ibarges in

the Muar River, whilst fighter cover was pro-

‘vided for a move by road of the A.I.F. in

the area.

18th Jan.—Attacks on barges in the Muar

River and on troop concentrations in the

‘Gemas area continued—a total force of 6

Blenheims, 5 Hudsons and 14 Buffaloes be-

ing employed.

286. In addition, tactical reconnaissance by
one or two sections of Buffaloes was carried
out for IIIrd Corps, chiefly in the Seremban-
Tampin-Gemas area. Special bombing attacks
were carried out by Blenheims on roth Janiary
to destroy trains full of Army stores, which,
owing to the congestion and dislocation of the
railway system, had been stranded at Malacca.
The attacks were at least partly successful,
as were others made on rath January against
some oil tanks which had been left intact at
Port Swettenham.

287. Part of our offensive effort continued
to be made against Japanese-held aerodromes
in order to meet the wishes of G.O.C. Malaya
for reducing enemy air action against our for-
ward troops, which had been carried out con-
currently with attacks against our aerodromes
both in Malaya and on Singapore Island and
against our road and rail communications be-
hind the battle front.

288. Daily flights over Northern Malaya by
our P.R. Buffaloes revealed that aerodromes
“blown ”’ in the withdrawal were quickly re
paired and occupied. Gong Kedah was
occupied ‘by the enemy on the 31st December,
Ipoh on the 4th January and Kuantan on the
oth January

289. Consequently our aircraft made attacks
on aerodromes in Northern Malaya at frequent
intervals during the latter part of December
and the first half of January. They entarled
long fhghts by night, often in the face of
violent tropical thunderstorms. Altogether,
between 20th December and 15th January,
some eighty sorties were carried out against this
type of target. Sungei Patani was attacked six
times, Gong Kedah twice, Ipoh and Alor Star
once. Good results were achieved by Blen-
heims of No. 34 (B) Squadron at Sungei Patani
on 27th/28th December photographic recon-
naissance on the following day confirming that
at least 7 fighters had been destroyed and 5
fighters and 3 bombers damaged.

290. Good results were also obtained at Gong
Kedah on ist/2nd January by Catalinas.
These aircraft had by this time largely been
withdrawn from reconnaissance work, which
wag; instead carried out by Hudsons, owing to
the vulnerability of the Catalina to fighter

attack. The range and bomb load of the
Catalinas proved-very useful for night bombing
operations. Twice in January they attacked
the main enemy base at Singora, a target
‘which by this time was beyond the range. of
any other aircraft in the Command.

2g1. In addition, two attempts were made to
carry out strong fighter attacks against Kuantan
aerodrome; but tropical] thunderstorms on each
océasion forced our fighters to return. ,

ag2. That these operations inflicted losses
upon the enemy 1s certain. It is equally certain
that he had more than sufficient, reserves to
replace his losses without delay.

Aw Activity off the East coast.

293. Off the east coast there was considerable
reconnaissance and activity. On 27th December,
photographic reconnaissance confirmed the
arrival of 34 ships at Singora, which were
proved subsequently to have brought a reinforc-
ing Division. Further reports of enemy
shipping necessitated sweeps by Hudsons to
the Natunas on the 3rd and 4th January.-

294. Daily East coast reconnaissances to the
north from Endau beyond Trengannu occupied
at least 6 Glenn Martins or Hudsons, whilst the
M.V.A.F. continued close reconnaissance for
the A..F. in the Endau-Mersing area.

295. On the 8th January, 9 Glenn Martins
and 4 Hudsons bombed and scored direct hits
on a ship anchored in the South China Sea,
beheved to be used by the Japanese as a
navigational aid for their aircraft. On goth
January, 9 Glenn Martins bombed with success
ships unloading at Kuantan.

296. Meanwhile, Kuantan had been occupied
by the Japanese on the 9th January. Infiltra-
tion down the coast towards Endau and
Mersing immediately commenced. By the 13th
January A.H.Q. became convinced of the
possibilty of a landing in this vital area, and
a general direction was therefore issued to all
squadrons governing their action in such a
contingency. A daily reconnaissance by 6
Hudsons was instituted to detect the approach
of any convoy from Indo-China; recon-
naissance northwardse up the east coast,
although restricted, was still maintained.

Capture of Borneo.

297. Borneo had been lost by this time.
Kuching had been captured on 26th December,
and its garrison of one Indian Battalion forced
to retreat. It was located by our reconnaissance
as it made its way to Sinkawang, where supplies
were dropped for it by three aircraft on 31st
December. Apart from a further recon-
naissance on gth January to ascertain the state
of Kuching aerodrome, no further air action
in the Borneo area was possible.

Japanese air operations against Singapore.

298. During the first half of January the
Japanese extended their air attacks to Singapore
Island, directing them mainly against its aero-
dromes, with the evident intention of neutralis-
ing our squadrons. Tengah, on which the
Blenheim force was based, received particular
attention. Night raids were a constant occur-
rence, but these were mainly of a nuisance value
and “ttle damage was done by them. ,
No. 27 (NF) Squadron, which had been
teorganised at Kallang, and which now had 5
