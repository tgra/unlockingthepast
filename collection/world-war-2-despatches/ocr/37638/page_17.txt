SUPPLEMENT to tae LONDON GAZETTE, 3 JULY, 1946

push a force by the line Of the railway from
Shaibah towards Baghdad as rapidly as pos-
sible. It was decided that India would send
reinforcements to complete a total of two divi-
sions in Iraq.

83. After repulsing the Iraqi counter attack
at Fallujah, General Cick’s. anal force moved
on Baghdad in two columns. After overcoming
the delays due to floods and the enemy’s de-
struction of communications, he arrived within
a short distance of Baghdad on 30th May. His
strength was 1,200 men with eight guns and a
few armoured cars.

Although there was practically the whole of
a division of the Iraqi army in Baghdad and
a further force at Ramadi on the Euphrates, in
tear of General Clark’s force, Rashid Ali and
his supporters had lost heart and fled; and the
Mayor of Baghdad sent out a white flag and
asked for terms for capitulation. After uSs-
sion with the Ambassador, who had been con-
fined to the Embassy for the past four weeks,
satisfactory terms were arranged. The Regent
of Iraq and some of his ministers, who had
escaped to Transjordan at the time of Rashid
Ali’s coup d’etat, returned to Baghdad on ist
June and formed a legitimate Government.

A small force of the Household Cavalry
regiment and one battery with some armoured
cars ‘was at once sent on to Mosul to secure
the landing ground there, which had been used
by German air forces during the revolt. A
Gurkha battalion was then flown up from
Baghdad.

84. ‘We may consider ourselves exceedingly
fortunate to have liquidated what might have
been a very serious commitment with such
small forces and with little trouble. Rashid
Ali and his adherents seem to have lost heart
at the weakness of the support accorded to
‘them by the Germans. The gallant defence
of Habbaniyah and the bold advance of
Habforce discouraged the Ixaqi army, while the
Germans in their turn were prevented from
sending further reinforcements by the desperate
resistance of our troops in Crete, and their
crippling losses in men and aircraft. The
majority.of the Iraq population, especially the
tribesmen outside the principal towns, did not
give any active support to the revolutionary
government but had the Germans sent sufficient
forces to enable the Iraqi rebels to score a
success, the whole country might well haye
risen against us.

The Iraqi army admitted to losses of 1,750,
including 500 killed. Our own losses were slight.

The Syrian Problem.

85. Early in May, while Middle East was
busily engaged with the problems of Crete, the
Western Desert, and Iraq, a fresh commitment
arose from the German infiltration into Syria.
At the end of April the Chiefs of Staff pointed
out the danger of the Germans establishing a
footing in Syria and instructed me to be pre-
pared to send a force into Syria if necessary
to support any French resistance to the
Germans. I replied that my information was
to the effect that General Dentz, High Com-
missioner in Syria, was completely subservient
to Vichy and was most unlikely to resist
German penetration; and that the largest force
I could make available in Palestine was one in-
complete cavalry brigade group. I advised
against an approach to Dentz, which ‘had been

suggested by the Chiefs of Staff, as 1 con-
sidered it would only result in our strength, or
rather weakness, ‘becoming known to the
enemy.

At this time the question of the use of the
Free French forces in Syria came to the front.
Some battalions of the Free French had been
sent to the Middle East early in roqt and had
been used in the Sudan in operations against
Eritrea. After the capture of Massawa, General
de Gaulle requested that all the Free French
forces in the Middle East should be concentrated
in Egypt to be formed into a division under
General Legentilhomme. Some additional units
were on their way to Egypt. I arranged for the
formation of the division in Egypt, and later
agreed to transfer the French troops to Palestine
on General de Gaulle’s representations that he
would like them to be readily available for use
in Syria if the French in Syria resisted German
penetration. By about the middle of May the
Free French forces in Palestine consisted of six
battalions, a battery and a company of about
20 tanks. They were located near Qastima, to
the south of Jaffa. They were incomplete in
transport, and in some instances in weapons.

86. Early in May, as already related, I was
instructed to send the only mobile force avail-
able in (Palestine to Iraq. ‘When this had
departed, the whole of the troops in Palestine
were practically immobile and a great propor-
tion of the civil transport available had been
hired to make up Habforce. Nevertheless I
was still being urged to enter Syria to expel
the Germans from it.

87. Late on the evening of 18th May General
Catroux, thé Free French Commissioner in
Middle East, came to me and said he had certain
information that the French in Syria were with-
drawing the whole of their troops into the
Lebanon and were handing over the remainder
of Syria to the Germans. He declared that the
toad to Damascus was open and that it was
urgently necessary to take advantage of the
opportunity and to send a force into Syria
immediately. He was most insistent that I
should issue orders to this effect there and then.
Previous experience had taught me to regard
the information produced by the Free French
from Syria with caution, and what General
Catroux stated was not confirmed by intelli-
gence I had received from other sources. Quite
apart from this, as stated above, I had not the
troops or the transport available to send a force
into Syria. I therefore refused to take any
immediate action but summoned a meeting for
the following morning to consider the whole
question. At this meeting there was general
agreement as to the desirability of forestalling
the Germans in Syria, but the only means avail-
able was by weakening the defence of Egypt
in the Western Desert. In the meantime, I
insisted on verification of the Free French
information before.acting on it.

88. I reported General Catroux’s request to
the Chiefs of Staff, who again urged me to take
immediate action in Syria, and, if I was unable
to provide a force, to allow the Free French
to enter Syria alone. I pointed out that the
Free French could not move without transport
which I was unable to supply and that they
were unwilling to move without the support of
some British artillery. I gave my opinion that
nothing smaller than a corps with an armoured
