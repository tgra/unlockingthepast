surprising that some of the orders went astray.
As a result part of the 1/13 Frontier Force
Rifles were left behind.

Mention should be made of the splendid
work throughout a very trying day of the anti-
aircraft detachment of the Hong Kong and
Singapore Royal Artillery defending Kota
Bharu aerodrome.

An important railway bridge on the Thailand
side of the frontier was attacked by Hudsons of
No. x Squadron (R A.F.) prior to ther with-
drawal. Reports on this attack indicate that
although the permanent track was damaged the
bridge was not.

133. Thus within 24 hrs. of the start of the
campaign the Japanese had gained their first
major objective, but at considerable cost. It
is beheved that the forces landed in Kelantan
consisted of rather less than one Japanese
division. This force lost its accompanying tank
formation and many of its guns before it got
ashore and subsequent reports indicated that
the Japanese suffered some of their heaviest
losses during the first day’s fighting in Kelantan.

134. A midday air reconnaissance reported
2 cruisers and 15 destroyers moving towards
Besut, 6 transports lying off Patani and 25
transports off Singora.

At about r130 hrs. 8th December I placed
one Battalion of the Command reserve, the
4/19 Hyderabads which was then in the Negti
Sembilan area on the conclusion of brigade
training, under the command of 3 Indian
Corps for duty in Kelantan. It was moved up
at once by rail.

In the 3 Indian Corps area the 28 Indian
Infantry Brigade was ordered on the 8th
December to move forward from Ipoh and
Taiping to the area of the Alor Star aerodrome
and to come under orders of the commander
rr Indian Division.

Secrion XIX.—OPERATIONS 9-IITH
DECEMBER, I94I.

136. The Kedah Front.—The plan for the
defence of the Jitra position was to hold it
with two brigades forward, the 15 Indian
Infantry Brigade on the right and the 6 Indian
Infantry Brigade on the left. Of the two for-
ward battalions of the 15 Brigade the 2/9 Jats
extended from the hills on the right flank” of
the position to a point exclusive of the main
road. On their left were the 1 Leicesters whose
front included both the main and Perlis roads.
West of the latter they hnked up with the
2 East Surreys, the right battalion of the 6
Brigade whose position included the wooded
Pisang salient forward of the Alor Changlih
Canal. On their left the 2/16 Punjab Regt.
was responsible for the whole front from the
railway to the sea. It had permanent positions
on the railway and coast only and patrolled
the several miles of padi and marsh which inter-
vened. The remaining battalion of the 15
Brigade had the role of delaying the enemy
between the frontier and Asun and of occupy-
ing an outpost position at Asun, subsequently
coming into brigade reserve. The outpost posi-
rion of the 6 Brigade at Kampong Imam was
to be' held by the reserve battalion, the 1/8
Punjab Regt. less two companies. The 28
(Indian Infantry Brigade less one battalion
was to come into Divisional Reserve on arrival
in the Alor Star aerodrome area. Its detached
battalion had the role of L. of C. and anti-
paratroop protection between Alor Star and
Sungei Patani. The Divisional Artillery con-
sisted of 155 Field Regiment of two batteries
each of eight 4.5-in. Howitzers,. the 22
Mountain Regiment, less one battery in
Kelantan, armed with a mixed assortment of
weapons, the 80 Anti-Tank Regiment, less one
battery in Kelantan, with thirty-six 2-pounders,
the 16 Light A.A. Battery with sixteen Bofors
and, on its way up, the 137 Field Regiment
with twenty-four 25-pounders. The 3 Indian
Cavalry was on paper the Divisional Reconnais-
sance Regiment. It had recently arrived in
Malaya without its armoured vehicles, having
only recently handed over its horses. It con-
sisted of three squadrons of dismounted men,
many of them recruits who had had little train-
ing. It had very few trained drivers and was
equipped in Malaya with a few unarmoured
trucks. It was totally unfit for its role of divi-
sional reconnaissance unit.

The defences in the Jitra position, although
well advanced, were not complete. In addition,
most of the posts had become waterlogged
after a week’s heavy rain, which still con-
tinued for the next few days. It was in these
conditions that the troops set to work to com-
plete the defences. The rain also had a serious
eflecty on the demolitions, all of which were
