Macforce. The remainder of the division was
moved that night (19/20th) to the same area,
and was thus suitably placed for the counter
attack in which they took part on 21st May.

I also ordered 12th Lancers with a field
battery to move to Arras and carry out necessary
reconnaissances south and south-westwards,
and to gain touch with the outlying portions of
Petreforce.

Arras was heavily bombed for the first time”

on 19th May, but 23rd Division, though in an
exposed position, was not, seriously attacked.
However, at 5 a.m., 6th Royal West Kent, of
36th Infantry Brigade, on the Canal du Nord
north-west of Péronne, had been attacked by
enemy tanks and had been withdrawn to Sailly
on the road to Albert.

General Petre that night issued orders for
23rd Division to withdraw from the Canal du
Nord to the line of the Grinchon river south of
Arras to join up at La Herlitre with 36th
Infantry Brigade which was to hold a line
thence to Doullens. 23rd Division was, how-
ever, caught by enemy aircraft when embussed
and finally occupied posts on the line of the
Scarpe for some six miles East of Arras.

Thus, by the evening of 19th May, the situa-
tion was somewhat relieved in that the defensive
flank had begun to take shape. On the other
hand, the character of the operation had now
radically altered with the arrival of German
troops in Amiens. The picture was now no
longer that of a line bent or temporarily broken,
but of a besieged fortress. To raise such a
siege, a relieving force must be sent from the
south and to meet this force a sortie on the
part of the defenders was indicated.

The attack of 5th and 50th Divisions,

32. On 2oth May, the breach South of Arras
deepened and widened. From _ indications
received during the day the enemy armoured
forces appeared to be directed on two main
objectives ; one down the valley of the Somme
on Abbeville, the other by Hesdin and Montreuil,
doubtless making for the Channel Ports.
12th Lancers, early in the day, reported tanks
‘from the direction of Cambrai approaching
Arras, where they were held off by the Welsh
Guards ; a strong request for bomber support
was therefore made through the War Office to
the Air Ministry. Later in the day enemy
tanks were reported to be ten miles west of
Arras, and all endeavours by 12th Lancers to
reach Doullens had failed. By 6 p.m. they
were back on the line Arras—St. Pol.

Early in the morning General Sir Edmund
Ironside, the Chief of the Imperial General
Staff arrived at G.H.Q.; he brought with him
instructions from the Cabinet that the B.E.F.
was to move southwards upon Amiens, attacking
all enemy forces encountered and to take station
on the left of the French Army. He was also
to inform General Billotte and the Belgian
command, making it clear to the latter that
their best chance was to, move that night
between the B.E.F. and the coast.

Similar information was to be given by the
War Office to General Georges. During the
day however, it appeared that operations were
actually being directed by General Weygand
who later, on 23rd May, announced in a General
Order that he was now Commander-in-Chief
in all theatres of war.

- I discussed --these’ instructions. with, the

C.L.G.S. at my Command Post at Wahagnies

at 815 am.; I put te-him my view. that
withdrawal to the south-westwards, however
desirable in principle, was not. in the circum-
stances, practicable." -

In the first'place, it would involve the dis-
engagement of seven divisions which were at
the time in close contact with the enemy on the
Escaut, and would be immediately followed up.

In addition to this-rearguard action the B.E.F.

in its retirement to the Semme would have to

attack into ‘an area already strongly occupied
by the enemy armoured and mobile formations:
Some of these indeed now appeared to be holding

-the line of the Somme whilst others were already
-within a short distance of the coast, and might

turn northwards at any time. Thus the B.EF.
would be obliged to disengage its seven divisions
in contact with the enemy, fighting a rearguard

‘action, at the:same time to attack south-west-

wards, and finally to break through enemy
forces on the Somme. During this manceuvre
both flanks would have to be guarded.

Secondly, the administrative situation made
it unlikely that sustained offensive operations
could be undertaken. Communication with the
bases was on the point of being interrupted.
The mobile echelons of gun and small arms
ammunition were full, but once they were
exhausted I could not safely reckon on being
able to replenish them.

Lastly, though I was not in a position to
judge, I had the impression that even if I had
decided to attempt this manceuvre, neither the
French rst Army nor the Belgians. would have
been in a position to conform.

Nevertheless, I told the C.1.G.S. that I fully
realised the importance of an attack in a
southerly direction and that I already had plans
in hand to counter-attack with the 5th and
soth Divisions to the south of Arras and that
these divisions would be ready to attack on
the following morning (21st May). These were
the only reserves which I then had available,
apart from one armoured reconnaissance brigade,
and one infantry brigade of 2nd Division. To
create a further reserve I had already begun
negotiations with Belgian G.Q.G. for the relief
of 44th Division on the Escaut, but these were
not yet completed.

The C.I.G.S. agreed with this action and accom-
panied by the C.G.S. he left for Lens to meet
Generals Billotte and Blanchard. At that
interview the C.I.G.S. explained the action to
be taken by 5th and 5oth Divisions. General
Billotte fully agreed to this plan, and said that
the French would co-operate with two divisions.

On return to my headquarters, the C.I.G.S.
sent a telegram to General Georges which made
it clear that, in his opinion, General Billotte’s
Army Group would be finally cut off unless the
French rst Army made an immediate move on
Gambrai or unless General Georges launched a
counter-attack northwards from Péronne. My
liaison officers with Generals Billotte and Blan-
chard conveyed a similar message from me to
those commanders, making it clear that if our
counter-attack was not successful the French
and British Armies north of the gap would
have their flank turned and could no longer
remain in their present positions.

On 21st May I sent a formal acknowledgement
of the instructions brought by the C.1G.S.
adding that, in my opinion, withdrawal to the
