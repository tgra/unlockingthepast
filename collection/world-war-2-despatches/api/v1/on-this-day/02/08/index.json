The War Cabinet accordingly directed that no operations were to be undertaken beyond the frontier of Cyrenaica, which should be held with the minimum possible force necessary to secure the flank of our Egyptian base, and that it was essential to be able to send the largest possible army and air forces from the Middle East to assist the Greeks against a German attack through Bulgaria, At the same time the operations against the Italian Dodecanese, which were in preparation, were to be pressed on and  undertaken at the earliest possible moment."

This Report has already narrated the plans made by A.H.Q. in Singapore for transferring and re-organising in Sumatra and Java, and how these plans were largely frustrated by the speed of the Japanese advance in Malaya and by the dislocation caused at the docks in Singapore by air attack, These plans were further frustrated by Japanese action against shipping at sea en route to the N.E.I. Many ships were sunk and others re-routed at sea to other ports. The cumulative effect was disastrous. Practically all equipment destined for Sumatra went  astray. In particular no M.T. arrived except some light motor cars about the 8th February and a few bomb trailers. There were only three refuellers available. Most important of all on the domestic side, few rations arrived and no tentage and field equipment On aerodromes which were practically without accommodation, the last was a serious loss during the prevailing monsoon weather."

The enemy were now trapped by the three-pronged advance of 71 Brigade due south from Sane, 4 Brigade south and east from the Yanbauk Chaung, and 36 Brigade north and north-west, after its landing in the south. They were being driven towards Ramree town, in the south-east corner of the island, whence their escape was cut off by the Naval blockade under the orders of Captain E. W. Bush, R.N. On the 8th February, 71 Brigade had reached the hills north of Ramree. There they were heavily engaged, though a patrol which entered the town itself that afternoon was informed that it had been evacuated. The enemy were, however, unable to stop our tanks and, by the 9th, they were driven from their positions overlooking the town the Japanese defence, determined as it had been, had failed, but they made a final effort to break the sea blockade and extricate their garrison. On the evening of the 11th February, they launched an air attack on our two destroyers, which were guarding the sea approaches. Under cover of this diversion, forty powered craft left Taungup to rescue their troops in Ramree. The"

On the Ist February, part of 74 Brigade crossed the Min Chaung from the neck of the Myebon Peninsula, and, after establishing themselves on the east bank, launched operations against the Japanese positions two miles north-west of Kangaw. Faced with encirclement by the rapid advance south of 82 (West African) Division (which I will shortly describe), the enemy began to withdraw into the mountains to the east. By the 8th February, the leading brigade {the 2nd) of 82 (West African) Division was in contact with the enemy nine miles north of Kangaw, but the Japanese continued to resist as the jaws of the trap closed. On the 9th, 2 (West African) Brigade passed under command of 25 Indian Division and a series of co-ordinated attacks were made on successive enemy positions. It took another nine days before the whole area was cleared. The toll of captured guns rose to 26, but the enemy threw all their remaining artillery into the chaungs, and gun muzzles protruding from the water bore silent witness to the magnitude of the Japanese disaster."
