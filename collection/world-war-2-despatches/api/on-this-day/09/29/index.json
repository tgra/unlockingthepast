            "date": "29th September",
            "description": "I flew to Diego Suarez on 23rd September to discuss the possibility of landing with RearAdmiral Tennant. After an exhaustive examination, we reluctantly came to the conclusion that such an operation was not feasible. The swell and surf prevalent at that time of the year, and poor beaches, offered no chance of getting ashore, undamaged, even the minimum of mechanical transport. The same conditions obtained at Fort Dauphin. At Tulear in the South-West the situation was slightly better, but it was still not possible, in a reasonable time, to land sufficient mechanical transport. The port had some facilities which, together with the airfield and possibilities of establishing a sea-plane base, would make it of use for patrolling the Mozambique Channel. It was decided to establish a small garrison there. This was effected by H.M.S.   Birmingham,  H.M.S.   Inconstant,  H.M.A.S.   Napier   and H.M.N.S.   Vangalen   landing two companies of the Pretoria Regiment and a few armoured cars from Diego Suarez on 29th September."

If unable to make contact, they were to make for one of the bays off the north coast of Soroy, which, circumstances permitting, would be closed and examined by certain of the patrolling submarines on the nights of the a7th/28th and 28th/29th September."

STUBBORN had still not covered Sandfiord which was on her beat, and during the day she attempted to communicate with TRUCULENT, to request her to cover Sandfiord that night: but she failed to get in touch. However, the weather, wind force 6 from the west and sea and swell 5-6,* decided STUBBORN against attempting to close the land once more: it might have meant losing X.r10: and at o600Z on the 29th September STUBBORN with X.to in tow proceeded by the route ordered to return to base at slow speed;"
