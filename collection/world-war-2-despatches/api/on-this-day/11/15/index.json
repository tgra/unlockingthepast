It gave details of the reinforcements he might expect to receive up to June, 1942, and instructed him that his primary task was the defence of Iraq and Iran against the enemy advance from Anatolia or from the Caucasus. In the defence of Iraq he was to act throughout in the closest co-operation with the Commander Ninth Army (Palestine and Transjordan)."

            "description": "For various unavoidable reasons, I had, most reluctantly, to postpone the opening date from the rst to the 15th November. The chief cause was the tardy arrival of the 22nd Armoured Brigade from the United \"Kingdom: this formation was expected to reach Egypt between the 13th and 2oth September, but its disembarkation was not actually completed until the r4th October. As a result, the brigade was not fully trained when it took the field."

Quinan, Commander Tenth Army, who had been studying  the problem  for some time and had -been able to visit North Persia and see something of the country. By this time the likelihood of a winter campaign in North Persia was receding, the earliest date by which it was estimated the Germans could reach the River Araxes having already been put back to 15th November."

            "description": "The decision to make a dash for Tunis, though bold, was undoubtedly correct. The advance was pressed by land, sea and air; Bougie was occupied by 11th November, Bone on 12th November, by a British parachute battalion, and by 18th November our advanced forces were operating east of:Gebel Abiud on the coast road and B ja on the inland road, about sixty miles from Bizerta and Tunis respectively. At both points we were in contact with German troops. These had begun to arrive, in the first place by air, on oth November, meeting no resistance from the French authorities in Tunisia. On 15th November a United States parachute battalion occupied Youks Les Bains and Tebessa, in south-eastern iAlgeria, and co-operated with the French detachments at Gafsa in southern Tunisia. Between 17th November and 25th December two main attempts were made to capture Tunis. The first succeeded in advancing, on 28th November, as far as Djedeida, on the road between Tunis and Bizerta and only twelve miles from the former. At this point the enemy counter-attacked strongly with tanks and dive-bombers; the latter were able to operate from good airfieldss only a short distance in rear and our own air forces were ungble to give cover, since the rain had put all their temporary landing grounds out of action. Our forces on the inland road were therefore obliged to withdraw to Medjez el Bab. This town, as its name   the Ford of the Pass   shows, is of great strategic importance. It lies"

Thus, on the moming of 15th November, our forces had been reinforced, whereas the enemy, though possibly reinforced late on the r4th, had been deprived of some of the reinforcements due to arrive on the morning of the 15th. We were, however, owing to the heavy bombing, and the physical condition of our troops, unable to score decisively against the enemy during the day."

Ships PENN and ECHO's forces had been shadowed continuously by aircraft during the night of 14th/15th November, and bombed from time to time, and it was evident that the enemy were making use of air reconnaissance to keep their forces clear of ours; on the night 15th/16th, therefore, H.M.S. PENN and her force were ordered to remain at immediate readiness and to act on enemy reports, hoping thereby that enemy forces would be committed to a landing and that we would be able to intercept them. Owing to breakdown of W/T in Leros, reports of enemy landing craft, relayed through Alexandria, arrived in H.M.S. PENN too late for action to be taken on them, and the dawn sweep ordered by Commander-in-Chief, Levant produced no enemy sighting. In point of fact, had the Commanding Officer of H.M.S. PENN acted as soon as he received the report, it is possible that he might have interfered with the landing craft off the beaches in Alinda Bay."
