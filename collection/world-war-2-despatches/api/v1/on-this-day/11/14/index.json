            "description": "1g. During the first two weeks in November, London had continued to be the enemy's main target, and was visited by at least Too German bombers nearly every night. Then, in the middle of the month, came a change. On the night -of 14th November, by the light of the full moon, nearly 500 German aircraft delivered an attack on Coventry which lasted from about eight o clock in the evening until half-past five the following morning. The attack began with the dropping of large numbers of incendiary bombs by a Unit called K.Gr.r00, which was known to speciahze in this form of target marking. More incendiaries, hundreds of high explosive bombs and a number of parachutemines followed. The raid wrought great havoc in the centre of the city, severely damaged 21 important factories, wrecked gas and watermains and cables, blocked the railways, and put four or five hundred retail shops out of action. Three hundred and eighty people were killed and 800 seriously injured. The Civil Defence Services did excellent work, and, though shaken, the citizens of Coventry remained undaunted."

On 14th November it was reported that the Druze Emir Majed Arslan, Minister of Defence in the Lebanese- Government, had collected a small force of armed men in the hills to the south of Beirut; and tribes in South Lebanon were also reported to be gathered in armed bands."

There was an even more pressing reason for capturing the coastal group of landing grounds. No convoys had sailed to Malta since the previous April owing to the impossibility of providing air protection and the garrison and people of the island were now on the verge of starvation. The situation would be beyond control unless a convoy putting out from Alexandria on 16th November arrived safely and of that there was little hope without strong fighter protection from the coast of Cyrenaica. It might very well have proved impossible to supply any further advance, seeing that 10 Corps had advanced two hundred and twenty miles in six days and that heavy demolitions had been carried out both on the road and the railway. But the administrative arrangements stood the strain, stores were landed at Sollum and the harbours of Matruh and Bardia were opened within two days of their capture so  fat enough supphes were available to allow y Light Armoured Brigade to continue. While the main body hastened down the road and secured Tmimi on 14th November another column moved across the desert via Bir"

Only four westbound ships were sailed, of which three arrived safely at Akureyri: the fourth was recalled when it became apparent that there was considerable enemy activity in the Barents Sea, but failed to get the signal and was sunk. A fifth westbound Russian ship was sailed on 14th November,: just ahead of Q.P.15, and atrived safely. The Russians thereafter continued to sail ships independently in the intervals between convoys: four more were sailed late in November and fifteen in December: all arrived without loss."
