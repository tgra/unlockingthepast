SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 28 APRIL, 1950

of the port party landed at the same time.
The boom and gate were intact, though in
poor condition in spite of the existence of
spare gear on the spot. The town was almost
deserted. There was no damage to port in-
stallations apart from that caused by our own
aircraft on the night of the beach assaults.
About 2130, Naval Commander Force “A”
advised that all personnel ships of the con-
voys due on D+3 day should proceed ito
Syracuse to discharge.

Pozzallo occupied.—Following the bombard-
ment by H.M.S. BRISSENDEN mentioned
above, the white flag was hoisted and H.M.S.
BRISSENDEN closed the town of Pozzallo.
The Bombardment Liaison Officer and an
armed party landed and accepted the surrender
at 1315, returning on board with 98 prisoners.
The port was found to be useless for unloading
either vessels or craft.

A.A, cruisers transferred—To strengthen
the defence of the Acmp anchorages which had
so far borne the greater part of the enemy’s
air attacks, H.M.S. DELHI, hitherto at BARK
WEST, was transferred to the orders of Naval
Commander Force “A” from noon.

H.M.S. COLOMBO from Force “V” was
transferred to the Western Task Force to re-
inforce the protection of Gela anchorage where
enemy aircraft were also troublesome.

D+2 Day.
Monday, 12th July.

Weather—Weather continued fine, and on
the whole less inconvenience was experienced
from swell at the anchorages and beaches,
though it still retarded the rate of discharge
at the western end of the area. *

Situation at beaches.
A. Bark WEST.

“G” Naval Commando moved from
SuGaR sector to BaRK SouTH and “ N” Com-
mando took over SUGAR sector in addition to
ROGER.

M.T. continued to come in on SucaR RED
I beach and a number of L.C.T. beached at
SuGar Rep II. The exits from these beaches
were only moderate, and the roads behind
bad, while approximately one vehicle in three
was “drowned” getting ashore. Accordingly
it was decided that S.N.O.L. (S) should trans-
fer to BarK SOUTH (QUEEN sector) and receive
the follow-up convoy, while $.N.O.L. (R) re-
mained to complete the discharge of the assault
convoy over RoGER sector. Stores began to
come in at about midday, and an urgent call
for petrol in the evening was met by unload-
ing from L.C.T. throughout the night.

B. Bark SoutH and East.

At 0600 the first follow-up convoy of L.S.T.
arrived at BaRK SourH and commenced to
beach and unload during the forenoon. All
the original L.S.T. and L.C.T. completed un-
loading by the afternoon. The rocky ledge
at the eastern end of AMBER beach had been
levelled and improved by this time to an extent
which enabled five L.S.T. to be discharged at
a time.

Two M.T. ships from Bark West arrived at
Bark SourH and commenced to discharge by
means of D.U.K.W.

Naval Commander Force “B” decided that
as soon as the M.T. ships of the assault convoy

2091

were cleared BarRK East beaches should be
kept open mainly for 51 Division stores in
L.C.T. which were becoming congested at BARK
SouTH and that S.S. DIOMED, the only
follow-up ship destined for Bark East, should
be diverted to BarK SOUTH.

Late in the evening the two Category “A”
ships of the assault convoy completed unload-
ing (the third had been sunk en route).

C. @ Aci Soutu.

Discharge was completed of the four Class
“ A” M.T. ships of the assault convoy and the
stevedores thus released were transferred to the
Class “B” ships.

(ii) Actp NorTH.

At 1900 an additional beach, called BLuz,
was opened at the northern end of the sector
and proved satisfactory for both L.C.T. and
L.C.M. though inadequate approaches and
shortage of labour precluded its use for land-
ing stores.

Gun Support.
Supporting fire was provided by ships as and
when required and opportunity offered.
H.M.S. MAURITIUS had a busy day and
carried out shoots as follows :—

(a) from 0830 to 0900, in response to an’
urgent call for support, Mellili was effectively
engaged.

(S) at 0930, a coast battery was engaged
and gave no further trouble.

(c) at 1115, in response to an immediate
call, a battery north of Priolo which was
holding up the army’s advance was effectively
engaged. After a short bombardment the
Forward Observation Officer reported the
target destroyed.

@) at 1205, fire, reported effective from
Cae observation, was again opened on

fe

(e) at 1251, a strong point near Augusta
was bombarded at the request of the army.

(f) at 1340, Mellili was again bombarded,
direct observation indicating that the fire
was effective.

(g) at 1403, the target was another de-
fended post and the Forward Observation
Officer reported the shoot as particularly
satisfactory.

(A) at “1500, an accurate and successful
shoot on a defended area near Augusta.

(@) from 1532 to 1541, direct fire in the
Augusta area.

(@) from 1834 to 1843, a successful shoot
at a coast defence battery.

(k) at 2006, an effective shoot on Augusta
defences in support of a commando landing
from H.M.S. ULSTER MONARCH

H.M.S. TETCOTT, in support of the com-
mando landing from H.MS. ULSTER
MONARCH,

(a) at 1930, engaged and silenced a light
high velocity gun on the ridge overlooking
Augusta.

(6) at about the same time, effectively
bombarded at a range of three cables with
4-inch pom-pom and O6cerlikon a cement
works near the shore from which machine-
gun fire was observed.
