SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 OCTOBER, 1948

52. Thus, on the moming of 15th Novem-
ber, our forces had been reinforced, whereas
the enemy, though possibly reinforced late on
the r4th, had been deprived of some of the re-
inforcements due to arrive on the morning of
the 15th. We were, however, owing to the
heavy bombing, and the physical condition of
our troops, unable to score decisively against
the enemy during the day.

53. H.M. Ships PENN and ECHO’s forces
had been shadowed continuously by aircraft
during the night of 14th/15th November, and
bombed from time to time, and it was evident
that the enemy were making use of air recon-
naissance to keep their forces clear of ours;
on the night 15th/16th, therefore, H.M.S.
PENN and her force were ordered to remain
at immediate readiness and to act on enemy
reports, hoping thereby that enemy forces
would be committed to a landing and that we
would be able to intercept them. Owing to
breakdown of W/T in Leros, reports of enemy
landing craft, relayed through Alexandria,
arrived in H.M.S. PENN too late for action
to be taken on them, and the dawn sweep
ordered by Commander-in-Chief, Levant pro-
duced no enemy sighting. In point of fact, had
the Commanding Officer of H.M.S. PENN
acted as soon as he received the report, it is
possible that he might have interfered with the
landing craft off the beaches in Alinda Bay.

54. Motor torpedo boats, minesweepers and
motor launches landed the troops ex H.M.S.
BELVOIR at Portolago during the night. H.M.
Ships ECHO and BELVOIR left the Aegean
short of fuel, and H.M. Ships FURY, EX-
MOOR (Commander J. Jefferies, R.N.) and
ore. KRAKOWIAK arrived to take their
place. ;

55. On the 16th November the situation
ashore in Leros became critical as reinforce-
ments received during the night allowed the
enemy to overrun our headquarters and posi-
tions in the Merviglia area, and though they
were driven out again by the reinforcements
we had received, the continued bombing and
the incessant fighting over nearly five days
had so reduced the fighting power of our forces
that they were unable to continue the battle
and the island surrendered at approximately
r7ooB.

56. During the night 16th/17th November
H.M.S._EXMOOR and O.R.P. KRA-
KOWIAK, who had been ordered to Samos
to transfer the Greek ‘‘ Sacred ’’ Squadron to
Leros, rejoined H.M.S. FURY. H.M. Ships
PENN and ALDENHAM’s bombardment of
the Alinda Bay area had to be cancelled and
they bombarded Kos harbour on their way
south to join H.M.S. BLENCATHRA, who
was towing H.M.S. ROCKWOOD from the
Gulf of Kos to Alexandria.

PHASE V.
WITHDRAWAL FROM AEGEAN.

57. Plans were made in mid-October to col-
lect a number of caiques to be available in
case it became necessary to withdraw our
troops from Samos and Leros. The number
of small craft under the orders of the Senior
British Naval Officer, Aegean was also in-
creased for general operational purposes and
to assist in a possible withdrawal,

5377

58. The course taken by the fighting in
Leros, however, prevented any action by these
caiques though in the final stages a number
of army and naval personnel managed to escape
in various craft.

59. After its fall on 16th November, evacua-
tion of such troops as could be got out of
Leros was conducted by Lientenant-Comman-
der L. F. Ramseyer, R.N.V.R., from a caique,
he himself having escaped from Leros by
caique 12 hours after its surrender. Naval
craft and a number of R.A.F. high speed
launches were used, S.B.S.* patrols being
landed to round up British troops stili at
liberty. An R.A.F. launch and Levant
Schooner No. 2 successfully evacuated the
L.R.D.G. patrols from Seriphos and Mykoni
respectively.

60. Following the fall of Leros it was decided
to withdraw Allied forces still remaining in
Samos. These consisted of 220 British troops
and 380 of the Greek Sacred Squadron, This
was successfully carried out by caiques on the
night of r9th/2oth November; in addition,
8,300 Italian troops, Greek guerillas and civi-
lians were evacuated. This movement was
covered by various naval and R.A.F. craft.
The majority of these troops together with a
number of Italians ftom the Samos garrison
and Greek refugees, were sent by train to
Syria, having turned over their arms.

61. The remainder of the British naval and
military personnel from Samos and the
escapees from Leros found their way south
in a variety of craft, including two Italian
F-lighters, “one towing an L.C.M., two
L.C.T.st, an Italian tug towing a M.M.S.,
various minesweepers and coastal craft, all of
whom arrived in Levant ports by 2nd Decem-
ber. One of these F-lighters which left Leros
on 15th November under the command of
Lieutenant Stowell, R.N.R., reached Haifa via
Samos with 177 German prisoners from Leros
still on board on 25th November.

62. The direction of these operations was
seriously hampered by the capture of B.Y.M.S.
972 at Kalymnos on the night of r1th/12th
November, which resulted in all the codes
carried by these small craft being compromised.

63. Following our withdrawal from the
Aegean it was decided to reduce the status
of Casteloriso to that of an outpost which
could be evacuated if a heavy attack developed
against it; accordingly on the night of
27th /28th November surplus men, guns and
equipment were withdrawn to the Levant by
destroyer and L.C.T. without incident.

64. A satisfactory sequel to these disappoint-
ing opetations was the successful withdrawal
of the damaged H.H.M.S. ADRIAS through
Kos Channel and north of Rhodes. She left
on ist December, and reached Alexandria
under her own steam on 6th December. For-
tune favoured this hazardous passage in that
unforeseen circumstances prevented her move-
ments being known to the enemy until she was
east of Casteloriso. In the first place a German
hospital ship on opposite course passed her
