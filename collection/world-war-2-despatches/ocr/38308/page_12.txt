CAP was flown off at 0555 in position 23° 33°
N 125° o2’ E. The plan for the day followed
‘generally the pattern of previous strikes, namel
to crater the runways on-all Myako and Ishi-
gaki airfields and ‘to maintain a CAP over
them to prevent repair” work, destroying any
enemy airborne, and ‘to strafe any grounded
planes. .In addition, 2 strikes by rocket-firing
Fireflies were:ordered to attack coastal shipping

* and ground installations.

Four bomber strikes were sent in, ‘and found
that’ most craters‘ had been filled in on run-
ways at both islands. By the end of the day
all airfield runways on both islands were leit
unserviceable, with the exception of ‘those. at
Hirara (Myako) which were only partially
cratered.

There was no enemy dirborne opposition
over the islands and none .came near the ‘Fleet.
The several bogeys detected during the day
were all found to be friendly search planes
when intercepted.. A lugger and some junks
were rocketted and left’ burning, as were a
possible radar station and barracks. .

This was not avery fruitful day. One
Avenger reported ditching x0 miles south of
Ishigaki. | The position was searched all ‘the

This is an unremunerative return, but the
operation was one’which offered little oppor-
tunity of effecting ‘high losses on the enemy.

‘Airborne opposition in the target areas—there
was none, whilst airborne attack was confined
to small groups of Kamikase, who split up 30
or 40 miles from the Fleet and in their approach

fighter interception or for gunfire.
