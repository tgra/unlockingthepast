remain in close order and will be manoeuvred
as a unit until action 1s joined. ‘When the
signal ‘“‘ Act independently ’’ is made or at
discretion of Commanding Officer, REPULSE
will assume freedom of manoeuvre remaining
in tactical support but engaging from a wide
enough angle to facilitate fall of shot.

5. Intend to operate at 25 knots unless a chase
develops and subsequently to retire at maxi-
mum speed endurance will allow.

6. Capital ships should attempt to close be-
low 20,000 yards until fire is effective but
should avoid offering an end on target. Ships
must be prepared to change from delay to non-
delay fuzes according to target.

7. PRINCE OF WALES and REPULSE are
each to have one aircraft fuelled and ready to
fly off if required If flown off aircraft must
return to land base. Kota Bharu aerodrome
is understood to be out of action.

8. TENEDOS will be detached before dark
to return independently to Singapore.

g. ‘Remaining destroyers may be detached
during the night gth/1oth should enemy infor-
mation require a high speed of advance In
such case these destroyers are to retire towards
Anamba Island at ro knots until a rendezvous
is ordered by W/T.

TO: PRINCE OF WALES, REPULSE

. FROM: C.-in-C., E.F
Inform Ships’ Companies as follows: Begins—
“The enemy has made several landings on the
north coast of Malaya and has made local pro-
gress. Our Army is not large and is hard
pressed in places. Our Air Force has had to
destroy and abandon one or more aercdromes.
Meanwhile fast transports lie off the coast.

This is our opportunity before the enemy can
establish himself. We have made a wide cir-
cuit to avoid air reconnaissance and hope to
surprise the enemy shortly after sunrise to-
morrow Wednesday. We may have, the luck
to try our metal against the old Japanese battle-
cruiser .KONGO or against some Japanese
cruisers ahd destroyers which are reported in
the Gulf of Siam.~ We are sure to get some
useful practice with the H.A. armament,
~ Whatever we meet I want to finish quickly
and so get well clear to the eastward” before
the Japanes¢ can mass too formidable a scale
of an attack against us. So shoot to sink.’’—

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1048

(iii) Fighter protection on Wednesday, roth
will not, repeat not, be possible.

(iv) Japanese have large bomber forces based
Southern Indo-China and possibly also in Thai-
land. C.-in-C., Far East, has requested General
MacArthur to carry out attack with his long-
range bombers on Indo-China aerodromes as
soon as possible.

(v) Kota Bharu aerodrome has been
evacuated and we seem to be losing grip on
other northern aerodromes due to enemy action,

(vi) Military position near Kota Bharu does
not seem good, but details are not available.

Staff, Eastern Fleet.

MOST IMMEDIATE.

One battleship, ‘‘M’’ class cruiser, 1 des-
troyers and a number of transports reported
close to coast between Kota Bharu and Perhen-
tian Island by air reconnaissance this afternoon.

FROM. Chief of

Correct my 1125/9. Force was sighted at
ogcoZ/g (1630GH /9).

T.0.0. 1155Z/9.

TO: C.-in-C., Eastern Fleet.
Staff, Eastern Fleet.

IMMEDIATE.

Only significant enemy report 1s contained
in my 1125Z/gth. Enemy apparently continu-
ing landing in Kota Bharu area which should
be frurtful as well as Singgora.

2. On the other hand enemy bombers on South
Indo-China aerodromes are in force and undis-
turbed They could attack you five hours after
sighting and much depends on whether you
have been seen today.

Two carriers may be in Saigon area.

3. Military situation at Kota Bharu appears
difficult. Aerodrome is in enemy hands.

4. All our northern aerodromes are: becoming
untenable due to enemy air action. C.-in-C.,
Far East, hints he 1s considering concentrating
all air efforts on defence of Singapore area.

5. Extremely difficult to give you clearer pic-
ture because air reconnaissance communications
are so slow due partly to damage to aerodromes.
