            "description": "The oth Australian Division began to arrive behind El Alamein on the 4th July, and pursuing my policy of wresting the initiative from the enemy and of seizing important tactical points so as to prepare the ground for a decisive attack later, I launched this division on the roth July against the Tel el Eisa mounds west of El Alamein. The attack was supported by tanks and a strong artillery and was carried out with skill and determination. The mounds were secured and remained in our possession, as a valuable bastion constituting a permanent threat tothe enemy positions to the south of it."

            "description": "On: the 4th July, the oth Australian Division began to concentrate on the coast in rear of the El Alamein fortress, but I had to ask its commander, Lieutenant-General Morshead, to detach one of his brigades temporarily to provide some infantry to hold the vital Ruweisat Ridge, which was the key to our whole position. This division was incorporated in the 30th Corps, in command of which Major-General Ramsden succeeded Lieutenant-Genera] Norrie on the 7th July. The enemy now began to move tanks and other troops-round the left flank of the 13th Corps which had been stretched as far west as Deir el Harra. Our front was now much extended and loosely knit. In order, therefore, to close the gap existing about Deir el Hima between the left of the 30th and the tight of the 13th Corps, the New Zealand Division was ordered to take ground to the eastward, their place on the outer flank being taken by the 7th Motor Brigade. The enemy took advantage of this to extend his positions to the south and east and, on the gth July, he occupied our defensive locality near Deir el Qattara, which had been evacuated in accordance with my policy of avoiding the isolation of troops in detached posts. The enemy continued to exert pressure on this flank and eventually pushed as far east as Qaret el] Himeimat, but"

During the action Major-General Lumsden, commanding ist Armoured Division, was wounded and replaced by Major-General A..H. Gatehouse, commander of the roth Armoured Division which was still training and equipping in the Delta. About a.week later, during the attack of the 2and July, General. Gatehouse himself was wounded and was succeeded in the command of the Ist Armoured Division by Brigadier A. F. Fisher. Although the enemy counter-attacked with tanks on the evening of the 15th and regained some of the lost ground, our tactical position in this very important part of the front was improved by the operation. Moreover, we took some 2,000 prisoners, mostly Italians. ;"

The passage of the convoys was covered most effectively by the operations of the North-West African Coastal Air Force, of No. 201 (Naval Co-operation) Group, of squadrons operating under Air Headquarters Air Defence, Eastern Mediteranean, and, on D-1 day, ofthe North-West African Tactical Air Force Squadrons based on Malta. Their problem was one of a complexity equal to our own. It was solved with conspicuous success, since no bomb was dropped on any convoy the majority were not sighted by enemy aircraft and all reports showed that the fighter cover was excellent."

Later on that day, course was altered to the northward, to cross the convoy track and reach a position north-west of Bear Island, within air striking range of the convoy on the morning of 4th July: this time was calculated from the information available to be the earliest at which surface attack was likely to materialise.

The first, by nine torpedo aircraft, took place late on 2nd July: it was unsuccessful and one aircraft was shot down. A solitary aircraft scored a torpedo hit on the morning of 4th July, the merchant ship later being sunk by our own forces ; and there was an unsuccessful attack by six bombers in the evening.

Our main forces had now reached the line on which the enemy had decided to stand but on the Adriatic they were not yet up with that line which in this sector was the River Chienti. On 16th June I had instructed the Poles to press on with all possible speed to secure the capture of Ancona. The Polish advance was indeed rapid and by the 2oth they had crossed the River Aso and captured Fermo and Pedaso. On the 2ist they even managed to secure a small bridgehead over the Chienti but next day this was destroyed by a heavy enemy counter-attack. It was clear that to force the Chienti would require a full Corps attack. General Anders} decided that in view of the time needed for concentration and for bringing up the necessary supplies and ammunition the probable date would be 4th July. I agreed to this plan and proposed to stage the attack in such a way as to be able to press directly on from the Chienti to Ancona, some twenty-two miles beyond the river."
