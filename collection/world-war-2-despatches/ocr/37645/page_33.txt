SUPPLEMENT to Tse LONDON GAZETTE, 10 JULY, 1946

should preferably be an armoured brigade. 1
very reluctantly decided that the operation
would not’be possible until after the rains were
over in May. The morale of the Italian
troops was obviously good; many of them had
fought in British Somaliland, and in the small
local brushes we had with them they were
fighting very well. On the other hand many of
my own troops were untrained in field-work
and movement by M.T.; some battalions had

not even completed their musketry. Further-_

more, there was not sufficient M.T. in_ the
country to motorise fully the six brigades I felt
were necessary, to carry supplies over the long
L. of C., nor to provide the water echelon re-
quired to transport the water over the stretch
of country between Tana and the Giuba, which
my information at that time gave as being com-
pletely waterless. Also the shortage of support-
ing arms caused me some concern. It was not
then apparent that the enemy would fail to put
up a determined resistance, and his positions
were strongly wired, entrenched, mined, and
provided with tank traps. In February when
the main advance took place the total support-
ing arms in E.A. Force for all fronts, outside
the infantry units, was as given below. Further-
more my battalions had no Bren carriers: —
Artillery— :
36 field guns, 18 pdrs. and 4.5 hows.
(Equal to 14 modern regiments.)
24 3-7 hows.
4 60 pdrs.
4 6in. hows.
Tanks—
x2 Light Mk. 1.

8. I decided therefore to occupy the period
before the rains broke in reducing the distances
everywhere between my own forces and the
Italians preparatory to a major offensive after
the rains, to make every effort to find and
develop water in the waterless belts, to con-
struct routes forward through the bush suitable
for two lines of M.T., and to establish large
forward dumps. I may say here that the 280
miles of bush between the Tana and the Giuba
was traversed only by narrow, winding bush
tracks originally made by game and widened
later merely by occasional human use.

Further, it was my intention to make use of
this period to obtain moral ascendancy over the
Italians by every means possible, such as by
vigorous offensive patrolling, and by cutting out
isolated posts. Initially 1 ordered the forward
move in the south to the boundary of Italian
‘Somaliland, and in the north as far as Hobok,
these advances to commence on 15th January.
Nevertheless I later instructed my Divisional
‘Commanders that the extent to which they did
in fact move forward was only to be limited
‘by administrative possibilities,

g. It will be readily appreciated that the
administration and maintenance of the forces
in the type of terrain over which the operations
were to be carried out presented problems of
considerable difficulty. For instance, before any
advance was undertaken all forward troops
were already being maintained by road hun-
dreds of miles in front of railhead. The troops
‘on the Tana were 230 miles in front of rail-
head, at Wajir 300 miles, at Dukana 390 miles,
at Lokitaung 317 miles. The greater portion
of the roads were liable to be impassable in w

weather. The resultant commitment in trans-
port, particularly as these distances were in-
creased by our forward moves, was extremely
heavy, but by the establishment of large dumps
as far forward as I could get them I was able
to reduce the transport requirements for the
first phase of the campaign. In spite of the
large amount of transport I was able to obtain
through the good offices of the Union of South
Africa, at no time had I too much, and during
subsequent operations my plans had invariably
to be based on the availability of transport as
one of the main factors in deciding my moves.

to. Even before operations began the 1,300
miles of road which had to be maintained under
military arrangements was a heavy enough
commitment; ‘but our subsequent advance
throughout the whole campaign increased this
out of all proportion.

1x. Another important aspect of the opera-
tions from the point of view of administration
was the provision of water. This problem had
received special previous study in conjunction
with the Quartermaster General of the Union
Defence Forces, Brigadier General J. Mitchell
Baker, C.B., D.S.0., AJD.C.

MT. convoys for the carriage of water were
organised, and special vehicles and equipment
provided by the Union Government A very
valuable supplement to the water convoys was
furnished by the work of the 36 Water Supply
Company, §.A.E.C. which, aided by geo-
physical experts, developed boreholes, and a
limited supply of water in the vast track of
hitherto waterless bush between the Tana and
Giuba rivers. The existence of this waterless
area had been regarded as one of the most for-
midable obstacles to an advance on the Giuba
position. The fact that at no time were the
troops without the daily allowance of one
gallon per man and half a gallon per radiator
does credit to those who organised the supply.

12. The first of the cutting-out operations,
directed against El Wak, some rxo miles from
our forward positions at Wajir, took place be-
tween 16th and 18th December 1940. This
raid was most successfully carried out by 12th
(A) Division. In order to gain maximum ex-
perience of moving large M.T. columns over
long distances at night, both the rst S.A. and
the 24th Gold Coast Brigades were used,
although the forces in El Wak were known to
consist of only one battalion and 16 guns and
some Banda. A large proportion of the enemy
battalion escaped into the bush, but all the
guns, a quantity of stores, and a number of
prisoners were captured at a very small loss
to our troops, and considerable loss in killed
and wounded to the enemy.

I cannot speak too highly of the way in
which Major General A. R. Godwin Austen,
C.B., O.B.E., M.C., planned the operation, nor
of the dashing manner in which it was carried
out by both brigades This action marked the
start of the ascendancy of the morale of E.A.
Force over that of the Italians.

13. Shortly after this raid the whole military
aspect in Africa was altered by the successes in
the Western Desert, and the enemy withdrawal
in Eritrea. About the 1st February 1941 J
came to the conclusion that an operation on a
reduced scale against Chisimaio would have a
teasonable chance of success owing to the
lowered morale of the Italians. I calculated I
had sufficient transport for a force of four brig-
