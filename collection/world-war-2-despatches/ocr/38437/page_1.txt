AIR OPERATIONS BY AIR DEFENCE OF GREAT BRITAIN AND
FIGHTER COMMAND IN CONNECTION WITH THE GERMAN
FLYING BOMB AND ROCKET OFFENSIVES, 1944—1945.

The following report was submitted to the
Secretary of State for Air on 17th April, 1948,
by Air Chief Marshal SiR Roperic Hitt,
K.C.B., M.C., A.F.C., Air Marshal Com-
manding, Air Defence of Great Britain, Royal
Air Force, from 15th November, 1943, to
15th October, 1944, and Air Officer Com-
manding-in-Chief, Fighter Command, Royal
Airy Force, from 15th October, 1944, until
the end of the war in Europe.

Part I: PRELIMINARY

(a) Command and Higher Organisation of
A.D.G.B. and Fighter Command.

x. Towards the close of 1943 the Allied
fighter, tactical reconnaissance, and tactical
bomber forces in the United Kingdom began
to assemble under the command of Air Chief
Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory, K.C.B.,
D.S.O., in readiness for the landing in north-
west Europe which was to take place in the
spring. The name of the Allied Expeditionary
Air Force was given to this combination, part
of which was set aside, under my command,
for the defence of the British Isles.

2. The Force that I commanded was func-
tionally a successor to Fighter Command. For
the time being, however, that name was aban-
doned, and the old name of Air’ Defence of
Great Britain was revived.

3. 1 commanded Air Defence of Great
Britain from its inception on 15th November,
1943, until 15th October, 1944, when the Allied
Expedinoniny Air Force was disbanded. My
Command then became an independent one
and the name Fighter Command was restored.

Thereafter, I held the post of Air Officer Com-
manding-in-Chief, Fighter Command, until the
end of the war with Germany.

4. Throughout the life of Air Defence of
Great Britain, and especially after the landings
in Europe had begun, the control over my
handling of operations which was exercised by
Air Chief Marshal Leigh-Mallory in his capacity
as Air Commander-in-Chief was little more than
nominal. His energies were engrossed by offen-
sive tasks. As the Armies in France pushed
on, these tasks made it necessary for him to
spend more and more of his time on the
Continent. I was obliged, therefore, with the
Air Commander-in-Chief’s knowledge and con-
sent, to deal directly with the Air Ministry, the
British Chiefs of Staff, and governmental
bodies on many points of operational policy.
On the other hand, Air Chief Marshal Leigh-
Mallory continued to exercise, through his staff,
a close supervision over certain aspects of
administration, eSpecially those affecting
personnel.

5. On 17th November, 1943, I received from
Air Chief Marshal Leigh-Mallory a directive
which defined the functions of my headquarters
“under the general direction of the Air Com-
mander-in-Chief ”’ as follows:—

(2) To be responsible for the air defence of

Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

(b) To command Nos, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,

60 and 70 Groups and exercise operational

control of fighters in Northern Ireland.

(c) To control operationally the activities
of A.A. Command, the Royal Observer

Corps, Balloon Command, ‘‘ and other static
