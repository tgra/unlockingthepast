            "description": "35. The long range penetration brigade which was making its way across the Chindwin overland towards Katha received its first airborne suppiies on 10th February, and its maintenance thereafter became a continuous commitment. The remaining two brigades were landed on two strips improvised in the jungle during the nights of S5th/6th and 10th/11th March, and a fourth and fifth brigade were flown into another landing ground during the nights of 24th/25th March and 5th/6th April. The successful accomplishment of the air side of this operation was shared directly by the First Air Commando Unit and by the British and American Transport squadrons which â€˜participated, although the whole operation was only made possible by the high degree of air superiority gained by the tactical air forces in the preceding months.",
