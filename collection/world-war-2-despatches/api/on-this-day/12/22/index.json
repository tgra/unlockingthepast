            "description": "When the Guards Brigade reached Antelat on the 22nd December, they found a hostile force including thirty tanks lying around Beda Fomm, covering the Axis withdrawal down the coastal road. One of its battalions, which occupied Antelat, was driven out again on the 23rd by a strong detachment of this force. Bythat time the Support Group had reached this neighbourhood and had been sent north-westwards to interfere with whatever the enemy had in hand at Carcura, off which seven ships were lying. When the news reached him that the Guards Brigade had been attacked at Antelat, General Gott ordered the Support Group to turn about and move at once to their assistance. At the sight of both brigades assembled to attack him the enemy withdrew from Antelat towards Agedabia. The pursuit of this force would have been an excellent task for ihe armoured regiment which had arrived during the morning, but after a brief engagement with enemy tanks it had no fuel left with which to give chase."

With the object of maintaining the morale of the civil population of Malaya I held a meeting on the 22nd December, attended by members of the Legislative Council, leading men of the different communities and the Press, the total number being about 120. The main points I stressed were that the available strength had proved inadequate; we had to remember that the aircraft, A.A. guns and tanks that might have come to Malaya were not being wasted, but were being used with great effect in Libya.and Russia; that there was every reason for confidence that, now the requirements of the Far East had become press-"

Part of our force was now cut off in Stanley, while various remnants were still holding out in isolated positions. The Japanese were now virtually surrounding Victoria, where a great deal of damage had been inflicted by bombing and shelling. Oil installations were destroyed, but it was found impossible to do so at Lai Chi Kok, since a large hospital would have been endangered. A telegram was received from the Admiralty giving the full text of Mr. Churchill's message, but also leaving to the Governor the discretion of surrender when resistance could no longer be usefully continued."

As soon as it was seen that by these tactics the enemy was escaping 4 Light Armoured Bngade was sent on to harass the fugitives. But almost every one of the bridges and culverts over the numerous wadis had been blown up, afd the wadis sown with mines; in addition the country on either side of the road was exceedingly rough, so that the armoured cars were unable to close with the enemy. In spite of these difficulties the advance guard covered the forty miles to Nofilia by the evening of 16th December. For the next two days the Light Armoured Brigade engaged round Nofiha in skirmishes with the enemy rearguard, which began to retire on the roth by stages to Sirte. By 22nd December go Light and 21 Panzer Divisions had joined the main body, which was hastily preparing a fresh defensive position at Buerat, leaving 15 Panzer Division to cover Sirte."

The Japanese strategy consisted in a continuous land and air offensive pressed with the utmost vigour with the object of advancing into South Malaya and capturing Singapore before our reinforcements could arrive. This offensive was supported by their Navy on the east coast of Malaya. Their Navy also cooperated with coast-wise operations on the west coast as soon as landing craft could be made available. These special craft were originally landed at Singora and transported across the peninsula by road to the west coast in the State of Kedah where they were launched on the 22nd December. These sea-borne operations had good and continued air cover. Had there been available at Singapore some fiotillas of fast armoured and properly equipped coastal craft it is certain that the enemy would not have been able to exercise the constant threat to our communications with sea-borne forces which they did in fact succeed in doing."

They proposed instead to wait until 22nd December and then to sail a convoy of thirtyone ships, with an escort of summer dimensions. The experience of Q.P.15 confirmed _ my opinion that a convoy of this size could not be handled: the Admiralty proposal, moreover, would waste the first half of the dark period,"
