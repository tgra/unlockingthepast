SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, -1948

26. The tactical appreciation asked for was
prepared by the Commander-in-Chief, China,
GeneralwOfficer Commanding, Malaya, and Air
Officer Commanding, Far East. It was re-
viewed and endorsed by the Singapore Defence
Conference held in October, 1940, attended by
representatives of Australia, New Zealand,
India and Burma, and by one American
observer. It was estimated that 566 1st Line
aircraft would now be required and that, when
this target was reached, the strength of the
land forces should be 26 battalions with sup-
porting arms, ancillary services, etc. The
Army estimate was accepted by the Chiefs of
Staff who, however, declined to increase the
previously approved air scale. The general
situation and war plans were further discussed
at staff conversations with officers from the
Dutch East Indies on 25-29th November, 1940,
at a conference with Dutch and Australian
representatives and United States observers in
February, 1941 (‘‘ A.D.A. Conference ”’), and
at a full conference with American and Dutch
(as well as Dominion) representatives in April,
t94x (‘‘ A.D.B. Conference ’’).

arrive in Malaya. In August, 1940, two British
battalions arrived from Shanghai on the evacua-
tion of the latter place and in October and
November, 1940, the 6 and 8 Indian Infantry
Brigades, both of the 3z Indian Division
(Major-General Murray Lyon) reached Malaya.
In February, 1941, the first contingent of the
Australian Imperial Force arrived. It con-
sisted of the Headquarters and Services of the
