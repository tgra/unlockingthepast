SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 10 JULY, 1947

afforded by the Royal Navy at all times to the
troops under my command. Without that help
it would have been impossible to make any
progress. The Royal Navy carried and escorted
the Allied troops and, pending the arrival of
anti-aircraft guns, took over the duties of anti-
aircraft protection under the most difficult
circumstances. The naval staff, particularly
Captain Maund, R.N., and Commander
Hubback, R.N., worked in intimate and un-
flagging co-operation with my own staff: I
owe these officers a deep debt of gratitude for
their ever close and cordial assistance.

15. Relations with the French were most
happy throughout. The loyalty and efficiency
displayed by General Bethouart were of the
highest order. It was a very great pleasure to
be so closely associated with so fine an officer.

16. Major-General Fleischer and the troops
of the 6th Norwegian Division under his com-
mand co-operated at all times willingly and
effectively with the Allied forces. Without that
co-operation the British and French troops en-
gaged on the mainland would have been faced
with a number of additional difficulties.

17. The period of planning and of consulta-

tions with the Royal Navy and with the Allied-

Forces threw a great strain and weight of
tesponsibility upon my General Staff. The
establishment of a ‘base and the supply and
movement of troops with limited and difficult
means of transportation made equally heavy
demands upon my Administrative Staff and
Services. All these demands were met in a
most praiseworthy manner. All concerned dis-
played powers of improvisation of the highest
ler.

18. I would draw special attention to the fine
work of my General Staff Officer (First Grade),
Colonel A. B. Dowler and of, my A.A. and
Q.M.G., Colonel J. F. W. Allen, M.C. These
officers were faced with unusual problems and
responsibilities They dealt with them all in a
truly admirable manner.

I9. That I once commanded an Allied Force
containing such fine troops, British, French and
Polish alike, will for ever remain a source of
great pride to me.

I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant,
P. J. Mackesy,
Major-General.

APPENDIX ““B”’,
REPORT ON OPERATIONS IN NORTHERN
NORWAY.

13th May to 8th June, 1940.

The foRowing report was submitted to the
Secretary of State for War on ioth June,
1940, by Lieutenant-General C. J. E.
Auchinleck, C.B., C.S.I., D.S.0., O.B.E.

Receipt of Instructions.

1. On the evening of 28th April I was sum-
moned by the Chief of the Imperial General
Staff (General Sir E. Ironside) to the War Office
and informed by him that J, with part of the
4th Corps Staff, would be required to go to
Narvik in the immediate future. I returned to

3181

my headquarters at Alresford and arranged
for an advanced headquarters to be established
in the War Office. ‘

2. For the next week, my staff were fully
employed collecting and collating information
concerning Northern Norway and the existing
situation in that theatre.

In this task they received every possible
assistance from the staff of the different depart-
ments and branches of the War Office.

3. On the 6th May, I received my instruc-
tions from the Secretary of State for War.
These instructions were to the effect: —

(a) That the object of His Majesty’s
Government was to secure and maintain a
base in Northern Norway from which it
would be possible :—

i, To deny iron ore supplies to Germany
via Narvik.

ii. To interfere with ore supplies to Ger-
many from Lulea jn Sweden.

iii. To preserve a part of Norway as a
seat of Government for the Norwegian
King and Government.

(6) That the forces assembled for this pur-
pose were under the command of Admiral
of the Fleet Lord Cork and Orrery; the
Military Commander Major-General Mackesy
being subordinate to him, and that this
system of unified command was to remain
in being until such time as His Majesty’s
Government decided to terminate it and
revert to the usual system of having inde-
pendent commanders of the sea and land
forces.

(ec) That I was appointed G.O.C.-in-C.
designate of the Anglo-French land forces
and of the British Air Component in the
theatre of Operations.

(4) That I was to proceed to the area with
an officer detailed by the Chief of the Air
Staff and in conjunction with the Earl of
Cork and Orrery, report for the information
of the Chiefs of Staff, the forces required ‘o
attain the objects outlined in sub-paragraph
(a), and the area which should be occupied.

(e) That I was to consider the possibility
of shipping any iron ore now at Narvik to
the United Kingdom, and of resuming a
supply of iron ore from Swedish mines at
Gallivare, and to report on the feasibility
and desirability of repairing the railway from
Narvik to the Swedish frontier.

4. I received also an instruction from General
Sir John Dill, Vice-Chief of the Imperial
General Staff, to the effect that it was the
intention of the C.I.G.S. that I should take
over command of the Anglo-French forces when
His Majesty’s Government decided to end the
system of unified command, but that, if on
arrival in the Narvik area, local conditions
appeared to me to necessitate the step, I was
to assume command of the Anglo-French
troops, placing myself under Admiral of the
Fleet Lord Cork and Orrery.

5. Before leaving London I appreciated the
situation in Northern Norway in the light of
such information as was available on the spot,
and informed the C.I.G.S. that in my view,
the implications of the objects given to me
‘were: —

(a) The establishment of aerodromes neces-

for the effective operation of an air
component. These would include one at
