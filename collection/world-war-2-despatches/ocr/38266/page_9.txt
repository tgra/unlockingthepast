SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE,. 22 APRIL, 1948

strength might have been considerably re-
duced, and that while I agreed that an assault
up the Rangoon river would be extremely
hazardous if the Japanese had installed a
heavy scale of defence, there was at present
Bs sign that they had done so or intended to
0 So.

I never received from the Chiefs of Staff or
War Cabinet either approval or condemnation
of the plan; but the resources required to im-
plement it were obviously not forthcoming. I
had stated our requirements at 182,000 tons
per month beginning in March if the plan was
to be prepared and executed in the winter
1943-44. The shipping programmes for March
and April provided less than half of this.

45. Meanwhile in the middle of February I
had ordered my planning staff to prepare plans
. for operations against Sumatra and Java, so as
to have available alternative plans, if the
Combined Chiefs of Staff decided against the
scheme for the reconquest of Burma. Plans for
the capture of the Andaman Islands and for
the invasion-of Northern Sumatra were also
examined.

46. I had intended to visit Australia in May
to see the progress of the war against the
Japanese in South-West Pacific, to learn what
I could from their tactical methods and train-
ing, and to discuss the co-ordination of opera-
tions from India with those m South-West
Pacific.
London in June to settle plans for the winter.
When, however, I put this programme to the
C.I.G.S. early in April, Iwas instructed to pro-
ceed forthwith to U.K. without visiting
Australia, to discuss future plans for the war
against Japan. I left India on April 18th and
arrived in London on April 22nd.

47. The War Cabinet did not favour the
plan I had proposed and which the Americans
had accepted. It was decided to discuss opera-
tions from India against Japan at a conference
in Washington to which I accompanied the
Prime Minister and Chiefs of Staff, with the
A.O.C.-in-C., India, and the Commander in

_ Chief, Eastern Fleet. _

The discussions in Washington did not result
in any new proposals for action from India
in 1943-44. It was decided that—

(a) First priority should be given to de-
veloping the air route to China to a
capacity of 10,000 tons a month;

(6) There should be land and air opera-
tions into Upper Burma from Ledo and
Imphal, ‘combined with a Chinese ad-
vance from Yunnan.

(c) Akyab and Ramree Islands should be
captured by amphibious operations.

In fact, the only difference from my plan for
1942-43 (see paragraph 2) was the addition of
Ramree Island to the objectives.

48. On the instructions of the Prime Minis-
ter I returned to London from Washington for
further discussions. In June, His Majesty the
King was graciously pleased to appoint me to
be Viceroy of India, and on June 2oth I was
succeeded as Commander-in-Chief in India by
General Sir Claude Auchinleck.

49. This despatch marks the end of my
-active military career. During the present war,
in just under four years, from September, 1939,

I proposed then to suggest a visit to -

2519.

to June, 1943, I have directed some fourteen
campaigns; in the Western Desert of North
Africa, m British Somaliland, in Eritrea,
in Italian Somahland, in Abyssinia, in Greece,
in Crete, in Iraq, in Syria, in Iran, in Malaya,
in the Dutch East Indies, in Burma, in Arakan.
Some have been successful, others have failed.

I should like to express my admiration for
the general strategy of the War Cabinet and
for the bold and imaginative use made of our
limited resources during these first four years.
of war. I have always been placed during
these years at the far end of the Supply line,
and have always been short of troops and
equipment and air forces for the tasks I have
had to undertake; but I have always been con-
scious that everything possible was being done
to support me, that my lack of resources was
due to a general shortage, that my difficulties
were sympathetically understood and that I
was being given all possible help and
encouragement. For this I am most grateful.

50. I regret to have one exception to make.
During the operations recorded in this despatch
I received neither encouragement nor help nor
understanding of the difficulties, only criticism
for the failure of a bold attempt to engage the
enemy with inadequate resources, in hazardous
circumstances.

That my plans were not unsound is, I think,
shown by the fact that the plans adopted by
the South-East Asia Command for the winter
1943-44 have been practically the same as
those I laid down for the previous winter; and
that the Long Range Penetration Groups which
were initiated by Major-General Wingate under
my direction have been adopted and extended
as a result of the experience I originated. That
I had considerable difficulties to encounter is.
shown by the fact that in spite of greatly in-
creased resources and another year’s training
and experience, progress in Burma in the cam-
paigning season of 1943-44 has been little, if
any, greater than in the corresponding period
of 1942-43.

A glance at a map will give some idea of the
distances involved in operations from India,
and therefore of the magnitude of the adminis-
trative problem.

THE SOLDIER.

51. In this my last despatch I should like
to pay a tribute to the British soldier. He has.

-shown himself in this war, as in all others, the

finest all-round fighting man in the world. He
has won so many victories that he never doubts
of victory; he has suffered so many disasters
and defeats on his way to victory that defeat
seldom depresses him. He has adapted himself
to desert and to jungle, to open plains and to
mountains, to new foes, new conditions, new
weapons with the same courage and humorous
endurance of difficulties and dangers which he
has always shown. His staying power is a
sure guarantee of final success.

Whatever the qualities of the soldier, the
value of an army depends in the end on the
leadership of the regimental officer; and in the
British Army this still remains worthy of the
men they lead. Whatever method may be
adopted in the future to officer the British

_Army, it must ensure the same standard of

leadership and the same close relations with th
soldier. : :
