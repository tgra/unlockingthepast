From here, I intended that they should cover the evacuation of the British Army, but the German air attack became so concentrated, that after a number of Hurricanes had been destroyed on the ground on 23rd April, the remainder were ordered to leave for Crete. In Crete, Blenheim fighter patrols were organised to cover the ships evacuating the troops from the beaches, These escorts were maintained throughout the evacuation without respite, and I consider it was due largely to their efforts that such a large proportion of the total British forces in Greece were evacuated.",

On the 23rd April we received a long and detailed appreciation of the situation. In discussing possible Japanese plans, an attempt to invade Ceylon was not Tuled out, although it seemed more likely that the Japanese would try to exploit their success in Malaya and Burma by advancing into India from the north-east. For the time being we were in no position to offer effective resistance by sea, land, or air to any offensive. Should the Japanese press boldly westward without pause for consolidation, the Indian Empire would  be in grave danger. In that event the security of the Middle East and its essential supply line would be threatened. The Middle East and India were therefore interdependent.",

It confirmed my general appreciation of the danger to India, +.e., that an invasion of N.E. India by sea, land and air was the most probable threat, while an attack on Ceylon was possible; it recognised the powerlessness of the Eastern Fleet to offer effective opposition; accepted that the land forces in India were inadequate by at least one Armoured Division, one Army Tank Brigade and four infantry divisions, which deficiencies could not be met till late in 1942; and gave the air squadrons required as 66 (there were in India at this time 15 operational squadrons, rising to a total of 25 by the end of June).",

The enemy defences were strong and long-established and the terrain, as I have said, was particularly difficult; these advantages outweighed in the early stages their numerical inferiority and the lack of reserves for the defence, but as position after position was wrested away there were increasingly less troops to man the positions in rear. 9 and 1 Infantry Divisions attacked on, the morning of 23rd April on the Sedjenane-Mateur and B ja-Mateur axes respectively. On the first day 9 Division gained its objective west of El] Aouana 1 Division made slightly slower progress but by the 25th had reached the high ground a mile to the south-east of Sidi Nsir station. This advance had exposed the left flank of the division and 34 Infantry Division was now brought in between the other two to clear up the area astride the Sidi NsirMateur road. The mdge of hills west of Sidi Nsir was cleared by 28th April after three days of concentrated artillery fire and on the same day the high ground east of the village was captured after close and heavy fighting.",

XIX Corps was to attack three mountain positions commanding Pont du Fahs from the south; no date was set for this attack and it was not to be launched until First Army considered that the enemy in these strong positions had ibeen sufficiently weakened by the attacks on either flank. First Army was to attack on 22nd April. 9 Corps would begin in the early morning with 46 Infantry and x and 6 Armoured Divisions. The infantry were to destroy the enemy positions west of the salt marshes of Sebkret el Kourzia and the armour was then to follow through as quickly as possible directed on Gebel Mengoub, an eight hundred foot feature fifteen miles from the north end of the marshes and the same distance from Tunis, 5 Corps would attack in the evening of 22nd April with 1 and 4 Divisions south of the river, directed on Massicault, and 78 Division in the mountains north of the river with Gebel Ahmera ( Longstop ) as their first objective. TH Corps  attack was timed for the next day, 23rd April, with 1 Division attacking on the Sidi Nsir road with its final objective the pass above Chouigui, and 9 Drvision on the axis Sedjenane-Mateur.

In a series of attacks on one day alone, the enemy destroyed 10 Blenheims on the ground at Niamata and damaged several other aircraft which had to be subsequently destroyed and abandoned. Several such attacks were made, during which many aircraft were destroyed or rendered unserviceable, but owing to the loss in several instances of unit records during the ultimate evacuation, full details of enemy raids are not available. Towards the end the repeated enemy attacks on our aerodromes in the Athens Area caused further heavy losses, and as a final blow a force of Hurricanes retained at Argos to cover the evacuation was almost wiped out when 13 of them were destroyed on the ground during intensive enemy air attacks on 23rd April.",

These requests I passed on to the Admiralty for H.M. Government but the Norwegians, who seemed to imagine that immense reserves of guns and ammunition, etc., were readily available in England, could not understand why their requests were not immediately complied with. To ease matters I authorised the issue to them of all the war material, not required by the Anny, taken in the captured German Transport ALSTER which was sent to Tromso on the 23rd April to discharge accordingly; to meet Article 39 of the Naval Discipline Act, the British Consul at Tromso was asked to watch the discharging and make an affidavit of goods handed over; a copy of this affidavit was sent to the Secretary of the Admiralty later.",

            "description": "On 23rd April the remaining Hurricanes, about twelve in number, on which reliance had been placed to protect the convoys during the first part of their journey from Greece, were, owing to unavoidable lack of A.A. defences, all destroyed on the ground at Argos by enemy action. The embarkation programme was accordingly revised to enable a greater number of troops to be embarked in the Peloponnesus whence the journey to Crete would be shorter and less exposed to air attack. Fortunately, however, the plan remained elastic, and when the Corinth Canal was cut by enemy parachutists in the early morning of 26th April, it was possible again to change the plans and to embark the 4th New Zealand Brigade from a beach east of Athens, Porto Ratti, instead of from the Peloponnesus.",
