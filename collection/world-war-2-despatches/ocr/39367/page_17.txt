SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 OCTOBER, 195]

188. Of the remaining four routes, which
were the ones to which the main weight of
the interdiction programme was applied, ‘the
most important was the Brenner line running
south from Innsbruck via Trento to Verona.
The remaining three routes ran across Italy’s
north-eastern frontier. They were:—

(a) the Tarvisio route running from Tar-
visio to Udine and on to Treviso;

(b) the Piedicolle route via Jugoslavia,
‘alice joined the Tarvisio route at Udine;
an :

(c) the Postumia route, also via Jugo-
slavia.

189. Though the four routes mentioned above
were the most important from the point of view
of the interdiction policy, attention was also
given to the moderately dense network of rail-
ways serving Northern Italy,

190. The interdiction was carried out in a
series of zones: The Brenner toute was
attacked along its whole length from Inns-
bruck to Verona, while the three north-eastern
frontier lines were attacked in the frontier
zone, and also along the Tagliamento, Livenza,
Piave, Brenta and Adige River zones, to the
south-west across the Venetian Plain. Lastly
the routes in the Po Valley were attacked at
the crossings of the Po River and its tributaries.
The whole system provided a series of good
targets in the way of bridges, viaducts, mar-
shalling yards and sidings.

Air Effort in January and February.

191. The interdiction programme began in
earnest on roth January, 1945, and from then
until the ground offensive began on gth April,
M.A.T.A.F. devoted some 75 per cent. of its
total effort to this task Previously,
M.A.T.A.F. had operated primarily in the Po
Valley, but during January and February air
operations against the frontier railway zones
were given top priority, and action against
the more southerly communications leading to
the battle area became a secondary considera-
tion.

192. The 57th Wing concentrated mainly on
the Brenner Pass route, assisted by the
XXIInd Tactical Air Command, while the
Desert Air Force attacked the north-eastern
frontier routes. In the less important Po
Valley, XXIInd T.A.C.. operated against com-
munications west of Vicenza, while D.A.F.
concentrated on the Imola-Budrio-Medicina-
Molinello area east of Bologna. The Strategic
Air Force heavy bombers gave assistance with
some 5,000 tons of bombs, most of which were
dropped on marshalling yards, and of which
some 3,000 tons were on the Brenner route.

193. This heavy effort showed immediate
results. In January, the Brenner route was
definitely blocked to through traffic for fifteen
days, and probably for another five; in
February, at no time was the route open to
continuous through traffic. On the north-
eastern frontier routes, through rail traffic was
denied the Germans for the whole of January,
and although it was possible on a few days
during the early part of February, the state of
interdiction during the latter half of the month
was the most complete achieved up to that
time. ‘ 2 t

194. This success quickly had the effect of
obliging the enemy to lean more and more

5573

upon the roads for his communications. Thus
in January, heavy road movement at night was
reported along the Adige Valley and down both
sides of Lake Garda, and photographic recon-
naissance and ground reports showed that there
was litle rail activity south of Trento. The trams-
port of supplies and heavy equipment clearly
presented a great problem to the enemy, though
the movement of troops could still be accom-
plished, albeit with a great time lag. Petrol
was by then a very scarce commodity indeed,
and quite insufficient for large scale motor
transport movement, quite apart from the con-
tinual hazards of Allied air attacks.

Air Effort in March.
The Brenner route.

195. March witnessed a still greater air effort
against this vital line, in particular by the
medium bombers of the 57th Wing, who
dropped some 3,000 tons of bombs on it in the
course of 1,600 sorties—some 60 per cent. of
their total effort for the month, Bridges and
‘diversions along almost the entire route re-
mained the main objectives, with targets at
Ora and San Michele, in the central Brenner
zone, receiving the chief attention. Other
targets heavily attacked were at Ala, San
Ambrogio and San Margherita, on the lower
Brenner line, and Campo di Trens on the upper
Brenner line.

196. Simultaneously, XXIInd T.A.C. main-
tained heavy pressure on the central and lower
portions of the route by day, while night in-
truder aircraft did the same by night. In these
attacks, not only were the blocks created by
the medium bombers further enlarged, but
additional bridges were destroyed, tracks cut,
and traffic both bombed and straffed.

197. The M.A.S.A.F. bombers again co-
operated by dropping some 1,300 tons of
bombs on Verona marshalling yards. In
addition their disruption of the Austrian rail-
way system was having its effect on communi-
cations further south.

198. In spite of the enemy’s desperate repair
efforts, and of a spell of bad weather from
26th to 2zgth March, through traffic on the
Brenner route was again impossible for the
whole of the month. The interdiction, in fact,
reached the highest level yet attained. Ten or
twelve blocks on the route at one time was a
common occurrence and on one occasion there
were at least fifteen blocks on the stretch
between Bolzano and Verona.

The north-eastern routes.

199. The main burden of the attacks on these
lines again fell on the Desert Air Force, which
concentrated chiefly on the Tarvisio-Udine line.
In addition, the 57th Wing flew 364 sorties
against bridges and diversions in the five river
zones in the Venetian Plain, while XXIInd
T.A.C. fighter-bombers, and the night
intruders, attacked targets primarily in the
Casarsa area. M.A.S.A.F. aircraft co-operated
by dropping 7oo tons of bombs, with the
Treviso and Padua marshalling yards as the
main targets.

200. These attacks caused the three north-
eastern frontier routes to be blocked for the
whole of the month, and, moreover, little traffic
was able to pass over the more southerly
stretches of the lines across the Venetian Plain.
