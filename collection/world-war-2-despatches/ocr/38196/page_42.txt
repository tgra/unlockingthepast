The Enfidaville line thus marked the culmi-
nation of Eighth Army’s great advance
across Africa. This holding and diversionary
role was not indeed its sole contribution to the
final victory, for three and a half divisions were
transferred to First Army to give weight to the
main attack on Tunis. It is right, however, to
take note at this point of the extent of Eighth
Army’s achievements. In six months they had
advanced eighteen hundred miles and fought
numerous battles i which they were always
successful. This would be an astonishing rate
of progress even in a civilized country with all
the modern facilities of transport—the equiva-
lent of an advance from London to two hundred
miles east of Moscow—but in a desert it was
even more remarkable. It reflects in particular
the greatest credit on the administrative ser-
vices. Their problems might have seemed quite
insoluble but thanks to the admirable prepara-
tions made and the sound basis of experience
gained in earlier campaigns administration had
kept pace with operations and never failed in
its support of the fighting troops.

Before First Army opened its offensive the
enemy gave a last demonstration of tactics that
had become almost traditional in Tunisia, the
spoiling attack. On the night of 2oth-2zst April
he attacked with sudden violence ‘between
Medjez and Goubellat, using a force of five
battalions and about seventy tanks. The
infantry came mainly from the Hermann
Goering Division and advanced to the attack
with great vigour and determination We had
had little warning of what was imminent and
in the early stages of the battle parties of enemy
succeeded in infiltrating into our forward posi-
tions where the troops were assembling for the
offensive, into the gun lines and as far as 4
Division Headquarters. In spite of the dark-

ness and the confusion the attack, given the,

codename LILACBLOSSOM by the Germans,
was a failure; we took over four hundred and
fifty prisoners and claimed over thirty tanks
destroyed. Nor were our plans for the offensive
upset or delayed, except to a munor degree on
9 Corps front, where 46 Division attack had to
be postponed four hours.

g Corps’ offensive started on the morning ot
gand Apnil when 46 Division advanced to the
attack in the area of the Kourzia salt marshes.

“On the mght, south-west of the marshes, the
division was unsuccessful in face of strong
defended localities and dense minefields which
inflicted casualties on the supporting tanks.
The attack on the left, to the north of the
marshes, made better progress. Ground was
gained steadily and by the late afternoon the
Corps commander put in 6 Armoured Division
to attack through the infantry. This met
opposition from to Panzer Division and a tank
battle developed. It continued next day*when
the enemy was reinforced by the tanks of 21
Panzer Division and on the 24th when 15
Panzer Division also arrived. General von
Arnim was clearly worried about the danger
in this area, and concentrated all his armour
here; by the 26th all three armoured divisions
were opposing us between Medjez and Bou
Arada and the Headquarters of the German
Africa Corps had been brought round to take
command With these reinforcements he
succeeded in.stabilizing his front in the broken
ground north-east of the marshes and although
1 Armoured Division was committed on 24th

April we were unable to score any significant
gains. We had, however, caused the enemy to
concentrate almost all his mobile reserves
zgainst this sector, and had iflicted heavy
losses on him. It was a good preparation for
the final blow. On 25th April the enemy with-
drew from the salient now protruding south of
the Bou Arada—Pont du Fahs road, followed
up by XIX Corps. The latter were now within
striking distance of the Pont du Fahs defile,
having cleared Gebel Fkirine on 26th April.
Tank battles continued on g Corps front all
day of the 26th but that evening 6 Armoured
Division was withdrawn into Army reserve.

While the main enemy attention was concen-
trated on the battle in the Goubellat plain 5
and II Corps had been able to make important
advances on the whole front from the Medjerda
to the sea. Resistance, indeed, was as strong
as ever and all our gains were most stubbornly
contested. 78 Divisiom began on 22nd April
with an attack on Gebel Ahmera, the left hand
bastion of the Medjez gate which had defied
us since the previous December. In very heavy
fighting they had cleared all but the north-
eastern end by midday of the 23rd and mopped
up the remaimng enemy pockets on Gebel
Tanngouche. On the same day r and 4 Divi-
sions attacked to the south of the Medjerda;
the former captured Grich el Oued and the
latter Goubellat. On 25th April 78 Division
captured Heidous and next day Gebel Ahmera
was finally cleared. We were now firmly based
on the left bank of the river and continued
to extend our ground on the right bank. On
the 26th 1 Division pushed the enemy’s posi-
tions back as far as Gebel Bou Aoukaz, a
dominating feature four miles down stream
from Gebel Ahmera on the opposite bank and
4 Division advanced down the main Tunis
road to a distance of seven mules beyond
Medjez. At this point the enemy began to
launch a series of furious ‘counter-attacks., On
the 27th he drove back the left flank of 4
Division at Ksar Tyr and for the next three
days he continued these attacks with a mixed
battle group from 15 Panzer Division. He
regained a little ground at the point of junc-
ture of r and 4 Divisions; his losses were heavy
but his troops continued to show an excellent
spirit. .

On the northernmost sector progress by II
Corps was steady and continuous throughout
this period. The enemy defences were strong
and long-established and the terrain, as I have
said, was particularly difficult; these advan-
tages outweighed in the early stages their
numerical inferiority and the lack of reserves
for the defence, but as position after position
was wrested away there were increasingly less
troops to man the positions in rear. 9 and 1
Infantry Divisions attacked on, the morning
of 23rd April on the Sedjenane-Mateur and
Béja-Mateur axes respectively. On the first
day 9 Division gained its objective west of
El] Aouana 1 Division made slightly slower
progress but by the 25th had reached the
high ground a mile to the south-east of Sidi
Nsir station. This advance had exposed the
left flank of the division and 34 Infantry Divi-
sion was now brought in between the other two
to clear up the area astride the Sidi Nsir-
Mateur road. The mdge of hills west of Sidi
Nsir was cleared by 28th April after three days
of concentrated artillery fire and on the same
day the high ground east of the village was
captured after close and heavy fighting.
