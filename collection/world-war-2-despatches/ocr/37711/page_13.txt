SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 4 SEPTEMBER, 1946

to make rapid headway in the sector which
the enemy obviously regarded as the most
vital.

Tue DRIVE across THE Pas DE CALAIS TO
. ANTWERP AND THE RHINE.

On 26th August, I issued detailed orders ‘for
the conduct of the advance North of the Seine.
Twelfth Army Group was to operate on the
tight flank of 2x Army Group, and directed
First United States Army along the
axis Paris—Brussels, with the object of getting
established in the general area Brussels—
Maastricht—Liége—Namur—Charleroi.

On 1st September the Supreme Commander
assumed command and direction of the Army
Groups himself, and I was no longer, there-
fore, his overall land force commander. From
now on my despatch will be primarily con-
cemed with 21 Army Group proper, that is,
with. the British and Canadian forces, to-
gether with the various Allied contingents
which served with them.

In considering the development of the
strategic plan after crossing the Seine the
ptimary object, of course, was the destruction
of the German Army.

As a result of discussions between the
Supreme Commander and myself, from now on
the eventual mission of 21 Army Group became
the isolation of the Ruhr.

The urgent problem was to prevent the
enemy’s recovery from the disaster sustained
in Normandy. A major consideration was the
administrative situation created by our ever-
lengthening Lines of Communication. My ad-
ministrative staff had, however, been building
- up reserves during August in order to support
the pursuit. Imports were out by 60 per cent.
in order to release a considerable quantity of
transport from beach and port clearance for
forward maintenance purposes.

The immediate tasks of 21 Army Group were
the destruction of the enemy in ‘North-East
France, the clearance of the Pas de Calais with
its V-bomb sites, the capture of airfields in
Belgium, and the capture of Antwerp.

Between 25th and 30th August, Second
British Army and First Canadian Army
crossed the Seine, and the four Allied armies
now started advances which were eventually
fo bring them to the Rhine on a very broad

it.

On the right, Third United States Army,
having concentrated East of Paris (which was
liberated on 25th August), was striking East-
wards during the first week of September to
Nancy and Verdun. Shortly afterwards another

. column was directed South-East towards the
Belfort area, to join up with the Seventh
United States Army approaching from Mar-
seilles.

The First United States Army advanced
over the Aisne with its right flank directed on
the Duchy of Luxembourg and its left flank on
the genera] axis Mons—Litge.

Second British Army advanced North-East
on Central Belgium, while First Canadian
Army was about to sweep up the Channel

st.

coast.

On the left, 2 Canadian Division drove
straight through Tétes on Dieppe; the divi-
sion entered the port towards the evening of
Ist September. "2 Canadian Corps continued
to advance rapidly North of the Somme which
‘was crossed on 3rd September. 3 Canadian

4443

Division closed in on the defences of Boulogne
and Calais on 5th September; reconnaissance
revealed that the enemy was intending to fight
in defence of both these ports.

Meanwhile, 1 Corps advanced North of the
Seine on 1st September. While the 49 Division
swung left into the Havre peninsula, the 51
Division went straight for St. Valery and libe-
tated the town on 2nd September. Probing on
the 3rd September showed that the elaborate
defences of Havre were fully manned. 51 Divi-

- sion was ordered to take over the Northern

sector of-the perimeter and preparations for
the assault were put in hand. On the 12th
September the garrison commander sur-
tendered.

30 Corps was the spearhead of the British
drive to the North. Amiens was reached on
31st August, Brussels was entered on 3rd Sep-
tember, and the city of Antwerp on the follow-
ing day. This advance imposed a considerable
strain on administration. Our spearheads were
being maintained some 400 miles from the tem-
porary base in Normandy. The greatest strain
was thrown on road transport, because only
short stretches of railway were available owing
to the widespread demolitions. But all diffi-
culties were overcome, and the pace of the
pursuit was maintained.

The Advance to the Meuse and Rhine.

The Supreme Commander directed that our
immediate aim should be the establishment of
bridges over the Rhine throughout its entire
length, and that we should not go beyond this
until Antwerp or Rotterdam could be opened.
In view of the time factor it was agreed that
zi Army Group should launch its thrust to the
Rhine before completing the clearance of the
Scheldt estuary.

My intention now was to establish bridge-
heads over the Meuse and Rhine in readiness
for the time when it would be possible to
advance eastwards to occupy the Ruhr. I
ordered the resumption of the Second Army
advance from the Antwerp—Brussels area for
6th September, and by 11th September a bridge-
head was established over the Meuse—Escaut
Canal. It was already noticeable that the
enemy was beginning to recover his balance, so
that the urgency of launching the thrust to the
Rhine was underlined.

On Sunday 17th September the battle of
Arnhem began, The purpose was to cross the
Meuse and the Rhine, and to place Second Army
in a suitable position for the subsequent develop-
ment of operations towards the northern face of
the Ruhr and the North German plains. The
thrust to Arnhem outflanked the northern ex-
tension of the West Wall, and camé very near
to complete success.

The essential feature of the plan was the lay-
ing of a carpet of airborne troops across the
waterways from the Meuse—Escaut Canal to the
Neder Rijn, on the general axis of the road
through Eindhoven to Uden, Grave, Nijmegen
and Armmhem. The airborne carpet and bridge-
head forces were provided by 82 and ror United
States Airborne Division and 1 British Airborne
Division, and a Polish parachute brigade. Along
the corridor, or airborne carpet, 30 British Corps
was to advance and establish itself North of the
Neder Rijn with bridgeheads over the Ijssel
facing East. From the start, however, adverse
weather conditions prevailed, and indeed, during
the eight vital days of the battle, there were only
