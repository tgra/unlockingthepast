THE ATTACK ON ST. NAZAIRE, 1942.

The following Despatch was submitted to the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on the
13th April, 1942, by Admiral of the Fleet

Sir CHARLES WM. FORBES,. G.C.B.,

D.S.0., Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth.

Plymouth Command,
13th April, 1942.

I regard the attack on St. Nazaire on the
28th March, 1942, the report of which is here-
with forwarded for the information of Their
Lordships, as more difficult than that on Zee-
brugge, as a large weakly-armed force had to
make an undetected passage of over 400 miles
to the scene of action at an average speed of
II% knots, through an area. usually covered
by the enemy’s air reconnaissances. | The
success of the attack reflects great credit on

. all who took part, but chiefly on Commander
R. E. D. Ryder, Royal Navy, who displayed,
not only during the operation, but in the
preparations beforehand, outstanding qualities
of leadership, ingehuity and determination.

2. The manner in which he bluffed his way
past the defences of the Loire to within a mile
of the objective was admirable and was care-
+, fully worked out beforehand.

‘, 3. Results uf the Operation.

, (@ The principal object of the attack was
‘achieved, as the large lock capable of taking
the TIRPITZ should be out of action for a
considerable time. The .outer caisson was
destroyed by the blowing up of H.M.S.
CAMPBELTOWN, and the demolition parties
destroyed the pumping station and the

operating mechanism of the outer and inner -

caissons. «Commander Ryder speaks very

highly of the speed with which these military
demolitions were carried out,

(b)The. demolition of other port facilities
including the possible destruction of the
“caisson at the Old Entrance, -
Subsidiary results. were :— :

(c) The killing ef a considerable number
of Germans, partly by their own fire.

(@) The certain ge, and probable sink-
ing of, a U-boat by H.M.S. TYNEDALE.

(e) The destruction of a number of enemy
aircrait by H.M.S. BROCKLESBY, M.L.s
and aircraft of No. 19 Group, R.A.F.

(f) The probable diversion of troops and
armament to Biscay ports.

(g) The moral effect on the enemy of an
attack on one of his principal bases.

4. Losses. Our naval losses amounted to
34 officers and 157 ratings killed or missing out
of a total of 62 officers and 291 ratings who
sailed from England. A considerable number
of these are likely to be prisoners of war. Of
the 18 coastal craft employed, ten were sunk
by enemy action, one was destroyed by our own
forces as it was unable to make the return
journey, three were destroyed by our own forces
by order of the Commanding Officer of H.M.S. °
CLEVELAND, as he considered they were un-
able to make the return journey (a decision
with which I do not agree), and four returned
safely but damaged. ‘Taking into consideration
the extreme vulnerability of the coastal craft,
neither the losses in men or materia] can be
considered as excessive for the results achieved.

The losses in Commando troops, 34 officers
and 178 other ranks out of 44 officers and 224
other ranks, were high, but again it is hoped
that a number have survived as prisoners of
war. :
