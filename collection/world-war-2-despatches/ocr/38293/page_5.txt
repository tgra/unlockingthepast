This state of affairs was further aggravated
by the fact that during the moonlight nights
ships proceeded to sea and kept under way
until daylight, with the object of avoiding
bombing attacks inside the harbour or being

ined in. Although sound in theory owing
o the factors mentioned, this resulted in ships

equently disappearing during the course of
‘night, and all contact with them was lost

if the morning, some Captains refusing to
bfing their ships back for several days. As

e planning and success of the evacuation in

; be early stages largely depended on efficient

" edntrol of shipping in Greek waters and as
Greek ships might be required to assist, quite
apart from any shipping from Egypt, it was
quite clear this state of affairs would have to
be altered. As a first step a signal station was
‘established in Phaleron Bay manned by Royal-

‘ Naval ratings for reporting and keeping in
touch with ships. “Greek sailors supplied by
Greek naval authorities, with a knowledge of
English, were placed on telephone watch at
the most important telephones’ to. Piraeus and
Phaleron Bay, and interpreters provided. Also
an arrangement was come to whereby I gradu-
ally took over-control of Greek shipping in
local waters, and eventually the conduct of all
local ‘naval affairs, the Divisional Sea Trams-
port’ Officer and Naval Control Service Officer
moving to my office at G.H.Q. Rear Admiral
Turle ‘was Tet free to give his attention to his
diplomatic duties, which increased daily as the
situation grew more critical. The cypher staff
ofthe Naval Attaché were later on also trans-
ferred to my office. This arrangement was a
mutual one between Rear Admiral Turle and
myself, and I received every possible assistance
and co-operation from him.’ :

5. I could appreciate at once that the
bottle-neck of any evacuation would be the
small craft required for ferrying troops to H.M.
, Ships and transports from the beaches. It
“would have been a bad risk to use what quays
were left available at Piraeus, and Kalamai in
the S.W. Morea was the only other port with
quays. A ‘‘ Caique and Local Craft Commit-
tee ’’ was formed this day under the direction of
Commander K. Michell (of the Divisional Sea
Transport Officer’s staff) with military and
Greek representatives, its purpose being to

¢ charter and fit out as many caiques, motor
boats and local craft as possible. As it turned
“out hundreds of soldiers owe their escape to
\ caiques and small craft taken up in this manner.

6. The reconnaissance’ parties already
referred to left to reconnoitre beaches and’
roads, That this was nm ‘was shown by
the fact that one of the best beaches to which
roads were shown on some maps and charts
_ had, in fact, no approach roads or tracks
( whatever, and so was useless for the pur-

pose of evacuation. In order to put the
beach organisation on a solid footing, the
C.-in-C:, Mediterranean was requested to
send 32 officers for beaches and services
with local’ craft and 24 Petty Officers and
‘Leading Seamen, 72 Seamen and 6 Signal-
men for beaches. These parties were con-
sidered vital as a quick turn round of craft at
beaches would be essential, and’ numbers
requested were based on the fact that the like-
lihood of being able to transfer parties from
one locality to another under the prevailing
conditions, was remote.

7. From a‘ conference held at’ Air H.Q. this —
day at which General Wilson, Air Vice Marshal
d’Albiac and I were present, the following facts _
emerged :— . .

(a) There was a marked deterioration in
the military situation and in the morale of the
. Greek forces, as well. as a-weakening of the
. will to resist on the part of the Greek Gov-
ernment. General Papagos, the Greek

Commander-in-Chief, had informed General

Wilson that, if it was possible, he would like

the British forces to be withdrawn as-soon as

practicable. General Wilson had informed
the ‘Greek Commander-iti-Chief that the

British could hold on for another month, but

General Papagos doubted if the Greeks could

hold out as long as that.

(b) Two major considerations at this time
pointed to an early withdrawal :—
* (i) The enemy’s superiority in the air.
(ii) The fact that if our forces remained
in Greece we would undoubtedly be con-

- fronted, at an early date, with the problem -

of feeding two million people.
(cy The earliest date of D.x for Operation
‘* Demon ’’ was likely to be Monday, 28th
(d) It was possible: that the Thermopy]
line might not hold out as the covering
troops might not get back in time to hold it.
It was therefore agreed that an emergency
plan of evacuation should be made forthwith,
without awaiting the results’ of beach
reconnaissances. ny
8. Large numbers of the British colony were
evacuated this day in two ships which sailed
after dark. Subsequent to their sailing, I was
informed that there were still 1,500 British sub-
jects remaining to be. evacuated. Every day
saw this number diminishing, as they took
whatever Greek ships were available, whether
escorted or not. . a

g.. The Greek Prime Minister today com-
mitted suicide and a new Government had to
be formed.

Saturday, 19th April. :
ro. A conference was held at 1800 at which
General Sir Archibald Wavell was present. The
following points emerged and show the situation
as it was at this time: —
. (a) The new Greek Government had not
yet been formed, and a new Prime Minister
had not yet been elected. No decision had
yet been receivéd from the Head of the
Government whether they wished to hold out
or withdraw.

(b) A cable was received from the British’

" Prime Minister in’ which he stated that there
could be no question of a. withdrawal of
British troops for the present unléss
specially requested both by the Greek King

and Government., The’ cable pointed out’
that as the Greeks had asked for the assist-
ance of British troops in Greece, these troops

. could not be withdrawn on the grounds that
the country would be devastated if they
stayed. ; .

(c) General Wilson was of the opinion that

we could hold the Thermopylae’ line

_ indefinitely once our’troops were in position.
