The U.S.S.R. in 1943 expressed their appre-
ciation when M. Maisky, Soviet Ambassador
in London, paid this glowing tribute to the men
whose. courage had made possible the carriage
of these vital war supplies to Russia:

“The Russian convoys are a Northern
Saga of heroism, bravery, and endurance.
This Saga wil live for ever, not only in the
hearts of your people, but also in the hearts
of the Soviet people, who rightly see in it
one of the most striking expressions of
collaboration between the Allied Govern-
ments, withott which our common victory
would have been impossible.”

The following are extracts from Despatches

December, 1942, submitted to the Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty by Admiral
Sir John C. Tovey, K.C.B, DS.O.,
Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet.

Loss of s.s. WAZIRISTAN

1. The year started with the first loss from
these convoys; it was brought about by a
most unfortunate combination of circum-
stances. Convoy P.Q.7 was so delayed by
defects while assembling at Hvalfiord* that the
Admiral Commanding, Iceland, decided to
sail it in two parts. The first, which sailed late
in December, consisted of only two ships: the
cruiser and destroyers of the ocean escort were
therefore held back for the second, and larger,
part; and the two ships were given two mine-
Sweepers as ocean escort.

2. These were sailed as usual to join the
convoy near Jan Mayen Island but failed to
make contact before the local escort of
trawlers parted company, or in fact at all. The
merchant ships thus arrived south of Bear
Island without escort: U-boats, working in this
area for the first time, succeeded in sinking the
WAZIRISTAN. The COLD HARBOUR,
her companion, arrived off the White Sea a
week late.

3. That the first appearance of U-boats
should coincide with the first: unescorted
convoy was most unfortunate. In order that
escorting cruisers should not be exposed to

U-boat attack at convoy speeds, they were
ordered after this attack to part company with
their convoys between 14° East and 26° East
and pass through this area at high speed, re-
joining the convoys when the latter had come
through. It was considered unlikely that
enemy surface forces would operate in the same
area as U-boats. 3

Loss of H.M.S. MATABELE
4. Convoy P.Q.7B arrived safely, but P.Q.8
was attacked by U-boats north-eastward of the
Kola Inlet*. The ss. HARMATRID was
torpedoed on 17th January, but reached
harbour in tow: the MATABELE, one of the
two escorting destroyers, was torpedoed the
next day and lost with only two survivors,

5. The increased enemy effort against the
convoys, of which these unfortunate losses
were evidence, though expected, was disturb-
ing. The early spring was approaching, with
a period of two or three months during which
the ice would still compel the convoys to pass
through two narrow focal areas close to the
enemy coast, without the compensation of foul
weather and long darkness to restrict his air
activity. It seemed therefore that air attacks,
and surface or U-boat attacks made possible
by air reconnaissance, might reach a scale
ppd the escorting resources of the Home

eet.

6. I pointed this out to Their Lordships and
pressed for strong and continuous Russian
patrol activity off the Kola Inlet, to make that
area untenable by U-boats, and for short-range
and long-range fighter protection. The cruiser
could not remain in company with the convoy,
in U-boat infested waters, solely to provide the
A.A. defence which could come more effec-
tively from fighters. The Rear Admiral Com-
manding, 10th Cruiser Squadronf, in the
NIGERIA, ‘was stationed at Murmansk
throughout February to represent these require-
ments to the Russians, the NIGERIA provid-
ing escort for east and westbound convoys
between Bear Island and the Kola Inlet.

Surface Threat from Trondheim

7. The presence of the TIRPITZ at
Trondheim, where she artived on 17th January
and, still more, her, reinforcement on 23rd
February by the SCHEER and PRINZ
EUGEN, constituted another and more serious
threat to these convoys. It seemed probable
that the heavy ships, if they attacked, would
do so between Jan Mayen and Bear Islands,
leaving the eastern section of the route to their
U-boats and aircraft. It was therefore neces-
sary to provide heavy cover on this part of
the route, even though this could not be done
without uncovering to some extent the
Northern Passages. .

8. To economise the use of this heavy cover,
I asked the Admiralty on 26th February that
the convoys should be sailed simultaneously
from each end, so that their passage through
the danger area should be synchronised. This
I also asked for
four more destroyers, to enable the covering .
force to have a proper screen and the convoy
a close escort of two destroyers. °
