            "description": "i Special Service Force and 36 Division attacked the northern third of the mountain mass to gain Monte La nen and bale Maggiore. Air support on that day was heavy and tae the rat time was not reduced by weather. Both Corps  attacks were successful. On 6th December 10 Corps captured the summit of Monte Camino, which they had almost secured on the 3rd but failed to hold against counter-attacks, and on the oth Rocca d Evandro was captured. This brought 10 Corps to the Garigliano all along its front. II Corps captured La Difensa on 3rd December and held it against strong counter-attacks, and on the 8th captured and mopped up Monte La  Remetanea. 36 Division's attack on Monte Maggiore, the northernmost and lowest peak, had succeeded by the night of the 3rd; counter-attacks were repulsed and by the 7th the position could be considered secured.   Between then and the xrth ro Corps took over the whole of the feature from II Corps. Between 29th November and gth December VI Corps on Fifth Army's right made diversionary attacks along the axes of the Colli Atina and Filignano Sant  Elia roads. Very little ground was gained in tangled and difficult country, with peaks rising to over twelve hundred metres. 2 Moroccan Division began to relieve 34 Division on the Corps  right on 8th December. Phase I of the Army Commander's plan was now, however, completed with the capture of the Camino massif and Phase II was ordered to start on 7th December. In this phase ro Corps had a minor defensive r le; the principal objective was the clearing of Monte Sammucro and this was assigned to II Corps. VI Corps was to continue to drive westwards along the roads to Atina and Sant  Elia but on a larger scale facilitated by the accession to its strength of the fresh and mountain trained Moroccan Division. It was hoped that by attacking on so wide a front the enemy would be sufficiently stretched to prevent him massing for the defence of Cassino. The bitterest fighting took place for Monte Sammucro and the village of San Pietro in Fine below it. The attack began on 7th December; the first two high points on Sammucro were seized without exceptional difficulty but after that our troops were held until the 13th by severe German counter-attacks and heavy mortar and artillery fire. On the 8th the Italian Motorised Group failed in an attack on Monte Lungo, in the throat of the gap. The second battle for San Pietro opened on the a5th and succeeded, though at heavy cost in casualties, by the 17th; Monte Lungo was also occupied and, north of the village, we forced our way further along the knife-edge of Monte Sammucro. This was bitter mountain fighting, with great use of artillery and gains in territory small compared with the time consumed and the losses suffered. There was still another enemy position, almost equally as strong as San Pietro, just a short distance ahead, based on the western end of Monte Sammucro and the lower hills covering the village of San Vittore. But 36 Division was exhausted and on 29th December had to be relieved by the 34th before San Vittore was taken. The VI Corps attack on the right had also made little progress against difficulties of ground and stubborn enemy defence; by the end of the year it could only be said to have kept level with the advance of II Corps with"

It entailed the crossing of the Mayu River (two miles wide), the capture of Rathedaung, and finally of Kudaung Island, which was the objective. This island lies due north of Akyab, in the junction of the estuaries of the Mayu and  Kywede Rivers. One battalion, ferried from Kwazon to the west bank of the Mayu, drove -on to Pyinshe (seven miles south of Kwazon), sweeping prisoners into their net. On the 29th December, they crossed the river to Htizwe, forestalling the West Africans in the occupation of this objective. Two days later  they occupied Rathedaung unopposed, after it had been bombarded from tthe sea by the destroyer NEPAL. On the same day (31st December) another battalion occupied Kudaugg Island, thus fulfilling the Brigade s"
