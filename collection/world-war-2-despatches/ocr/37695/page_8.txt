such efficiency that in spite of continual raids
serious damage was rarely‘ inflicted by-enemy
aircraft, of which several were shot down and
many damaged.

28. On the 18th July I received from
Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey, com-
manding the Australian Imperial Forces, a
letter, written at the instance of the Australian
Government, urging me to consider the relief*
of the whole garrison as the health of all the
troops composing it showed signs of marked
deterioration. He sented to me that the
telief of the Australian portion of the Garrison
was particularly desirable in view of the grow-
ing feeling in Australia that the time had come
to fulfil the agreement made between their own
and the British Government that the Australian
troops should be concentrated under one com-
mand and serve as one force. He suggested
that the lull in operations presented an oppor-
tunity which should not be missed. This letter
was followed on the 23rd July by a telegram
from the War Office repeating a message to the
same effect from the Australian Government
and urging me to give full and sympathetic
consideration to the views of the Australian
Government.

I agreed in principle to the relief of the
garrison both for the sake of the troops and in
order to fulfil the undertaking given to the
Australian Government; but I was doubtful
whether it would be practicable to relieve the
whole garrison. The ‘Commander-in-Chief,
Mediterranean, however, believed that he would
be able to effect the relief and maintain the
fortress by sea at the samv time.

29. A complete plan was drawn up by which
the Polish Independent Brigade should replace
the 18th Australian Infantry Brigade and the
18th Cavalry (Indian Army) during the moon-
less period in August and the 7oth (6th) Divi-
sion relieve the gth Australian Division during
the two succeeding moonless periods. The first

“In order that the conditions which necessitated
this relief shall be clearly understood, comments of
(i) the Commonwealth Government and (ii)
General Blamey, are appended below:—

(i) (Commonwealth ernment)

‘ The relief of Australian troops in Tobruk was
supported by three successive Australian Govern-
ments. dt is in agreement with General Blamey’s
observations which mere confirmed by the
Inspector General of Medical Services of the
Australian Army (Major-General R. M. Downes)
whe on his return from a visit to the Middle
Eas .eported in rgqr:

«The first A.LIF. troops transferred from
Tobruk had suffered a considerable decline in
their physical powers. The men did not think
that they were tired but few of them would be
able to march eight miles . .’""

(ii) (General Blamey)

“*T conour with the statements except that I do
not think the first portion of paragraph 29
accurately represents the position. It will be noted
that on 18th July I had made representations on
the great decline in the physical condition of the
troops who had been holding Tobruk. This decline
continued and two months later when the Chiefs
of Staff directed the relief on 15th September the
condition of the troops was such that any strong
attack by the enemy might have endangered the
safety of the fortress. Moreover, an offensive was
contemplated and plans included operations by the
defenders at a later date, which I was certain
that they could not have maintained owing to their
Joss of strength and physical condition. I opposed
General Auchinleck most strongly in his proposals
to retain these troops any longer in Tobruk. It
took a considerable time for them to recover their
strength after their celief.”*

SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 21 AUGUST, 1046

welief was carried out with complete success
between the 19th and the 2gth August, releasing
the 18th Australian Infantry Brigade to rejoin
its Division in Syria and the 18th Cavalry to
join its formation, the 3rd Indian Motor Bri-
gade, in Egypt.

It was then necessary to consider whether
further relief of the garrison was desirable or
feasible. The Commander-in-Chief, Mediter-
ranean, the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief
and myself were unanimous in recommending
that it was undesirable to continue the pro-
gramme for the following reasons, The relief
effected in August had not only proved a great
strain on the Royal Navy and the Royal Air
Force, but had inevitably limited the latter’s
offensive aotion. To continue in the next two
moonless periods would again interfere with
other important operational tasks and impose
a further heavy strain on the two Services.
This would be increased by having to continue
to maintain the fortress by sea during moon-
light periods and thus expose our valuable
shipping to unjustifiable risks. It was impos-
sible to defer the last phase until the Novem-
ber moonless period, as this would have clashed
with the date provisionally set for the begin-
ning of our new offensive. Furthermore, no
alternative formation being available for the
purpose, the immediate employment of the 7oth
Division in Tobruk would prevent Indian units
from Iraq being introduced into it in accordance
with a policy which will be explained later in
this Despatch. Finally the decline in the
health of the garrison, which had been ad-
vanced as a pressing reason for effecting relief,
did not appear to be so great as to warrant its
continuation in the face of so many important
objections. I submitted these arguments in a
cable to London and stated that, subject to the
Prime Minister's approval, I would reinforce
the garrison at once with an infantry tank
battalion instead of continuing the relief.

On the 15th September, however, I received
a cable from the Chiefs of Staff informing me
that, after careful consideration of the opinion
of the Commanders in Chief, the Australian
Government felt compelled to request the with-
drawal of the gth Australian Division and the
reconcentration of the Australian Imperial
Foroe.

Accordingly the relief of most of the gth
Australian Division by the 7oth Division was
completed in the next two neoonless periods,
between the 18th and the 28th September and
the 12th and the 26th October. Only the 2/13th
Infantry Battalion now remains in Tobruk.

The 4th Battalion of the Royal Tank Regi-
ment was despatched at the same time.

The withdrawal of the Australian Division
necessitated a change in command. On the
gand October, 1941, Major General R. MacK.
Scobie, commanding the zoth Division, took
over command of the fortress.

30. I wish to acknowledge the services ren-
dered in the siege of Tobruk by the Royal
Navy, the Fleet Air Arm and the Royal Air
Force. Not only did they enable the relief to
be carried out with negligible loss to army
personnel, though at great strain and some
loss to themselves, but by continuing to’ main-
tain the fortress for eight months in spite of
heavy risks and great difficulties they made
it possible to renew the offensive which other-
wise would have been considerably delayed.
