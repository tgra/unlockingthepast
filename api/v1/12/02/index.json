            "description": "As the New Zealand Division had had extremely heavy casualties and was now in danger of becoming entirely cut off, General Norrie gave the order for them to withdraw. Having repulsed further attacks on Zafraan during the day, they withdrew during the night with the survivors of the st Army Tank Brigade, the partner of their successes, and reached the frontier in the early hours of the 2nd December, exhausted but in good heart. At the same time the rst South African Infantry Brigade was ordered to abandon the attempt to recapture Point 175. During the night they retired southwards to Taieb el Essem, leaving a rearguard to mask Point 175 until the New Zealanders had passed in safety."

Tiddim itself fell on 18th October, and the way was now open for a double thrust towards Kalemyo from the west and north. Japanese resistance in the Kennedy Peak area, albeit grim, proved no match for the experienced Allied troops and the accompanying air bombardment, and Kalemyo fell on 15th November. With the capture of Kalewa on 2nd December the chapter of mountain warfare was closed and the Fourteenth Army was ready to debouch upon \u2018the plains of Central Burma."

Indian Division had continued to advance on the left of the Corps\u2019 front until the Sangro was reached; it was then relieved by the New Zealanders and went into reserve behind 78 Division. The latter was to seize a bridgehead, the Indians were to break into the line, then 78 Division was to \u2014 come into the lead again and exploit on to Pescara and simultaneously the New Zealanders were to strike across the river directed on Chieti, from where they were to swing southwest down Route 5 to develop the desired threat against the Avezzano area. D-day was laid down as 20th November in orders published on the 16th, but both the timing and execution of the plan were strongly affected by the weather. It was essential to make full use of our command of the air and our superiority in armour, and both depended on reasonably fine weather. On the 20th the weather broke completely and we could only establish a small bridgehead; on 23rd November the river was in flood and rendered all bridges useless; the same happened on 25th November: when the attack had again been scheduled. The main attack eventually went in on the 27th with 8 Indian Division leading. Mozzagrogna, a key point in the defences, was captured on the 2oth and by the next day a bold use of our armour against ground considered impassable by the Germans gave us the whole ridge above the Sangro from there to the sea. In the meantime ihe New Zealanders had got across the river and on 2nd December captured Castelfrentano. The Division\u2019s next objective was Orsogna, which was attacked unsuccessfully on 7th December and again on the 14th equally without success. The enemy had"

On the night of 2nd December an air raid by about thirty aircraft on the port of Bari took the defences by surprise and caused very heavy damage. Seventeen ships of various sizes were sunk and thirty thousand tons of cargo lost, mainly by the explosion of two ammunition ships. The port was not permanently damaged but we lost five days\u2019 working. ."

            "description": "33. By the end of November, it will be remembered, the leading division of 33 Corps, 11 (East African) Division, was approa ing Kalewa. It entered that village on the 2nd December, after stiff close-quarter fighting in the Chaunggyin area, six miles to the west. A battalion then crossed the Chindwin on the night of the 4th-Sth December in the face of only slight opposition, but was held up two miles to the east. North of Kalewa, the brigade advancing southwards astride the river encountered stubborn resistance on the east bank, seven miles north-east of the village; but an outflanking movement caused the enemy to abandon his position and a link-up with the rest of the Division was effected. It is of interest to note that by the 10th December, Indian sappers had in 36 hours achieved the feat of erecting across the Chindwin a thousand foot Bailey pontoon bridge. The enemy unsuccessfully attempted to destroy it by air attack two days later. Two brigades of 11 (East African) Division crossed the river, but met determined opposition in their efforts to extend their bridgehead. By the 14th December, however, a semi-circular area, extending from a point six miles north-east of Kalewa to Shwegyin, five miles to the south-east, had been \u2018cleared. The withdrawal of the Division for rehabilitation then began, on relief by 2 British Division, and was completed by the end of the month."
