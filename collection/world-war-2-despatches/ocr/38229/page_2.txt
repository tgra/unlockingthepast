3. On the 12th December, 1941, I was
informed by the Air Ministry that I was to take
over Command of the Air Forces in Burma.
It was proposed to reinforce Burma with a force
of 4 Fighter Squadrons, 6 Bomber Squadro'’s
and 1 G.R. Squadron with the object of making
a front in Burma should: the Japanese carm-
paign against Malaya prove successful. On the
14th December I left England. I met the
Commander-in-Chief in India, General Sir
Archibald Wavell, and the Air Officer Com-
manding-in-Chief, Air Marshal Sir Patrick
Playfair, on the 28th December in Delhi, where
the land and air situations were explained io
me.

i
ParT I—AIR SITUATION ON MY ARRIVAL IN

BURMA AND CONSEQUENT REQUEST FOR

REINFORCEMENT.

4. On the rst January, 1942, I flew to
Rangoon to take over command from Group
Captain E. R. Manning. He met me at
Mingaladon aerodrome and I proceeded to
Group Headquarters. It was necessary to
make an appreciation of the air situation as a
first step.

5. During the first seven days of January L
visited the airfields nm Burma, the Station,
Squadron and Detachment Commanders and
met the Military and Civil Authorities. The
Governor of Burma was H.E. Sir Reginald
Dorman Smith, G.B.E, the Army in Burma
was under the command of Lieutenant-General
T. J. Hutton, C.B., M.C., while the Senior
Naval Officer at Rangoon was Commodore C.
Graham, RN.—Commodore Burma Coast—
who succeeded Capt. J. Hallett, R.N., up to
that time N.O.1.C. Rangoon.

6. I found that the air garnson of the country
comprised one Squadron of the American
Volunteer Group, armed with P.4o’s at a
strength of 21 I.E. based at Mingaladon, and
No. 67 R.A.F. Buffalo Squadron of a strength
of «bout 16 aircraft, also based at this Sector
Station. Apart from the personnel of 60
Squadron—whose aircraft had been retained
in Malaya—and the Communication Fhght
equipped with aircraft of the Moth type belong-
ing to the Burma Volunteer Air Force, there
was at that time no further aircraft in the
country. Reinforcing aircraft for the Far East
were, however, flying through Burma to
Malaya and the Dutch East Indies.

.7. The American Volunteer Group, whose
primary role was the defence of the Burma
Road, under the command of General (then
Colonel) C. L. Chennault, was based at Kun-
ming. A Squadron of the A.V.G. had been
detached by the Generalissimo Chiang Kai-
Shek for the defence of the Port of Rangoon,

the only port through which supphes for China
could be passed.

8. Control of the R.A.F. in Burma had been
somewhat chequered. Up to the 15th |
December, 1941, it was organised as Burgroup
—later 221 Group—under A.O.C. Far East.
On the 15th December 1941, this Group was
transferred to the command of the C.-in-C.
india. Almost immediately after my armval in

' Burma 221 Group became Norgroup under the

command of General Wavell, Supreme Com-
mander South-Western Pacific Command,
though remaining under the C.-in-C. India for
administration. After the fall of Java,
Norgroup reverted again to the Command of
C.-in-C. India.

g. Airfield lay-out and topography.—Geo-
graphically, Burma is a cul-de-sac with a long
tongue of jungle escarpment reaching South
from Moulmein to Victoria Point. The Port
of Rangoon therefore provided the only means
of maintaining an Air Force in Burma, since
on the West, Burma is cut off from India by
the dense jungle escarpments of the Arakan
Yomas, mm the North by the Naga Hills, in
the East by the Karenni Hulls, while the Pegu
Yomas, a mountain range, divides the waters.
of the Sittang and the Irrawaddy which flow
almost their entire distance through Burma to
Rangoon and the ‘Gulf of Martaban. Thus
there were two Valleys in which airfields could
be made.

Io. The main line of airfields ran from Vic-
toria Pomt to Moulmein, to Rangoon and
Mingaladon and then up the Valley of the
Sittang through Toungoo to the East, through
Heho and Namsang and up to Lashio in the
North, a total distance of some 800 miles.
This line of aerodromes faced the enemy air
force based in Thailand and because the terri-
tory to the East and South East of this line
of air bases was mountainous country covered.
by jungle, through which there were few if
any communications, it followed that situated
here adequate R.D.F. and telephone warning,
of the approach of enemy aircraft attempting.
to attack our bases was impossible. Had
Toungoo, Heho and Namsang been situated.
with their attendant satellites in the Irrawaddy
Valley, warming would have been possible and
satisfactory as long as the communications in
the Sittang Valley remained in our hands. This.
fact gravely influenced the air carnpaign.

rz. In general, the aerodrome development
and construction undertaken on behalf of the
Far East Command by the Government in
Burma showed an extremely good state of
affairs. Indeed, remarkable. All airfields
had one or two all-weather runways fit for
modern aircraft of the heaviest type. Accom-
modation for personnel, P.O.L. and bombs and
ammunition were available and all-weather
satellites were provided for most airfields.
Moreover, at this time of the year the paddy
fields were hard and, provided labour was
available, a runway suitable for fighter or
bomber aircraft could be prepared in a week.
Thus airfield accommodation for a considerable
air force was available in Burma. The weak-
ness of the lay-out, however, was, as already
stated, that the four main airfields between
Toungoo and Lashio (inclusive) had little or no
warning.
