            "description": "Iog. The hint was taken. The consequences were profound and striking. As a result of these meetings between Station and Battery Commanders, the first requisite of understand- ing between two parties whose interests must occasionally conflict\u2014the realisation that the other side also has a viewpoint\u2014was attained. The mists of suspicion whose gathering had troubled me so much were dispersed almost overnight. -On subsequent visits to the same stations I was again shown aircraft that had suffered minor damage from anti-aircraft fire. But this time, instead of having to listen to grievances against the ners, I was told of pilots who had flouted discipline and good sense by venturing too near the guns. In short, pilots and gunners were beginning to under- stand one another\u2019s problems and work to- gether. Unity was restored. The process reached its climax towards the close of the main attack. Flying towards the south coast on the 28th August, I could see over Romney Marsh a wall of black smoke marking the posi- tion of the \u2018\u2018 Diver \u2019\u2019 barrage. From time to time a fresh salvo would be added to repair the slow erosion of the wind. On the far side of the barrage fighters were shooting down flying bombs into the Channel; on the nearer side more fighters waited on its fringe to pounce on the occasional bomb that got so far. The whole was as fine a spectacle of co-operation as any commander could wish to see."

            "description": "At dawn on the 25th August Russian troops entered Iran from the north and, occupying Tabriz, advanced along the south-western shore of the Caspian, while our troops entered from Iraq in the Ahwaz-Abadan area and in two colurans from Khaniqin. The oth Armoured Brigade formed part of the northern column which rapidly overcame opposition in the Paitak Pass and reached Shahbad on the morning of the 27th August. The Persians offered little real opposition either to the British or the Russian advance, and on the 28th August the Shah ordered all resistance to cease."
