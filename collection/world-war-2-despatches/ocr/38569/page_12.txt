104, At 0630, STRATHNAVER arrived,
escorted by BRAMHAM and BLYSKAWICA,
and secured alongside in the outer harbour.

105. Between 1000 and 1100, a heavy attack
by about 30 Ju. 88s developed. The principal
targets of this attack were MARNIX and
DEWDALE, but individual vessels on patrol
were also attacked. Most of the planes were
Kept high by A.A. fire. The gunnery efficiency
of DEWDALE and MARNIX Tudoubtediy
Saved these ships. The only damage was a
near miss on BLYSKAWICA. Two Ju. 88s
‘were shot down by DEWDALE.

- 106. At 1100, MARNIX escorted _ by
BICESTER sailed for Algiers. Unloading had
not been fully completed.

107. Landing craft were delayed by all these
attacks but left for Djidjelli with petrol and
R.AF. stores between 1100 and 1200, arriving
late that night.

108. At 1240, the harbour was attacked by
six torpedo bombers. At least two of these
were shot down, one, the first, by a Spitfire
patrol from Algiers; the other is claimed by
DEWDALE. The attack was broken up and
turned away, ‘torpedoes being dropped at long
Tange.

109. Two high level bombing attacks were
carried out between 1330 and 1430. One attack
was by ten planes, the other by four planes.
One aircraft was shot down by A.A. - fire.
BLYSKAWICA sustained further casualties
and damage from a near miss and was sailed
for Algiers at 1600.

..110. At 1655, Ju. 88s carried out dive attacks

from scattered low clouds. When the light
was failing two waves of torpedo bombers
attacked. The attack was directed against
DEWDALE, who again came through un-
scathed. Two planes were shot down.
WILTON was hit by a bomb which fortunately
passed through the ship without exploding and
only caused superficial damage. WILTON
then sailed for Algiers, being practically out
of ammunition.

. 111. At 2115, STRATHNAVER sailed for
Algiers escorted by BRAMHAM.

112. Fighters had been providing cover
intermittently ‘throughout the day, but were
-only once present during an air attack. They
had to be flown to and from Maison Blanche
-aerodrome at Algiers, which only permitted 20
minutes of patrol over Bougie. R.A.F. fighters
at Algiers also had other commitments and the
cover provided at Bougie was consequently
thin and inadequate.

113. R.A-F, fighters were flown to Djidjelli
aerodrome in the early morning of the 12th,
but were not able to operate continuously until
the 13th, because the attempts to Jand petrol
and ammunition by, landing craft did not
succeed until midnight 12th/13th. By using
up all the petrol in the tanks of its aircraft,
the squadron was able to carry out one sortie
in defence of Bougie, destroying a number of
enemy bombers, before being grounded
through lack of petrol.

114. At 1210, a bombing attack was carried

out by fourtéen Ju. 88s, the attack being well

_ Pressed home. The MT. GLENFINLAS was

hit alongside whilst unloading and subsequently

sank. The French ship ALCINA was also hit

and set on fire. Fighters drove off the: raiders.
ROBERTS shot down two of the attackers.

115. It was decided as a result of this raid
that two French ships, unable to raise steam,
should be scuttled to prevent them catching
fire. Both ships rolled over and lay on their
beam ends.

116. During the night the M.T. ships
OCEAN VOLGA and STANHILL and the
oiler DEWDALE sailed for Algiers, together
with five French merchant ships.

117. The M.T: URLANA, the last ship of
the assault convoy to be unloaded, was sailed
during the night of the 17th.

118. On Sunday, 15th Novenilier, the A.A.
ship POZARICA arrived at Bougie. I had
sent her there on relief by DELHI from her
duty as A.A. guardship, Algiers. Enemy air
aetevity since then has been on a very reduced.

119. Before concluding my report, I would
like to refer to the very happy relations which
existed in H.M.S. BULO between the
Navy, the- Army, the Air Force and the
American Army. In my quarters I was
privileged to have Major-General C. W.
Ryder, U.S. Army, Major-General V. Evelegh,
O.B.E., 78th Division, and Air Commodore
G. M. Lawson, CBE, MC, RAF, and
throughout the whole period there was com-
plete understanding and co-operation between
us and our services.

120. The operation was in many ways far
more difficult than a straightforward Com-
bined Operation in that the political factors
were very strong and denied us the initiative
in offensive action. The quick success of the
operation was undoubtedly due mainly to
surprise, good weather, and the number of
places at which landings took place which
gave the impression of overwhelming force.
Had the operation taken place in bad weather
and with strong opposition it might well have
failed due to lack of training and rehearsal,
and this fact should not be overlooked when
planning further operations.

Task Force,

27th December, 1942.

I have the honour to forward herewith the
report of proceedings of the Centre Naval
Task Force in Operation “Torch”.

2. An operation of such magnitude and
scope must of necessity produce many lasting
the zeal and
enthusiasm of every man, British and
American, were the most outstanding.

3. With Major-General L. R. Fredendall,
the Commanding General, and his staff, co-
operation was easy, and from first to last we

‘worked as one.

4. The altogether admirable discipline of the
American troops evoked much favourable com-
ment. Once they understood what was ex-
pected of them, they were untiring until the
job was properly performed.

5. The value of preliminary practice in
combined operations needs no emphasis and
great value was’ gained from the exercise in

‘Loch Linnhe and elsewhere prior. to sailing.
