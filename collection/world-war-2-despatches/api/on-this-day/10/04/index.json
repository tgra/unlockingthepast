The only serious novelty in this Aide Memoire was the plan to cut Middle East Base and administrative services so that Italy could build up an organisation capable of administering the forces there. This plan caused remonstrance from Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Commander South-east Asia, when he attended a meeting of the Middle East Defence Committee on 4th October. The argument was advanced that the Middle East Base was a vast and complex organisation which could not be cut without loss of efficiency, and that the retention of the Middle East Base, in its existing form, was an integral necessity for the development of our strategy in South-east Asia.",

The conference agreed that it was essential to retain the initiative and approved my plan of campaign which I teported at the same time. Eighth Army's advance up the east coast was running into a cul-de-sac of rather unimportant country; but General Montgomery was of.the opinion that if he could establish himself on the high ground north of Pescara, after crossing the Trigno, Sangro and Pescara rivers, he could then strike south-westwards down Route 5, the Via Valeria, to Avezzano and threaten Rome from the east.

The brigade operating down the Chindwin Valley, after capturing strong enemy positions north-west of Mawku, was engaged in. the vicinity of the village itself. The situation at the end of October was that the Japanese had withdrawn from the Chindwin River, north of Paungbyin, and were occupying positions in the Atwin Yomas, north-west of Mawlaik. It appeared possible that, when driven from these, they might try to hold the escarpment which divides the Chindwin from the Mu River.",
