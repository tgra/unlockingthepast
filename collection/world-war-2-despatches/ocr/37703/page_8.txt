THREAT OF INVASION REMOVED.

. 27. The sustained series of victories in South
Russia and the successful operations in North
Africa both render a German threat to North
Persia in 1943 progressively more and more
unlikely. The initiative now lies with the Allied
Nations and it is our duty to retain that initia-
tive and bring the maximum force to bear on
the German war machine from as many direc-
tions as possible. It was to be expected, there-
fore, that the forces in my Command would be
reduced and that the status of the Command
would require revision.

In January I received orders to despatch the
5 British Division to the Middle East Com-
mand and finally on 23rd January I was sum-
moned to a conference with the Prime Minister
in Cairo, On roth February the 56 (London)
Division was also ordered to the Midile East
Command. I decided therefore to re-group
the remaining formations within the Command
and issued orders for their location in the
general area Mosul-Kirkuk.

On 17th February I left for Cairo to take up
my new duties.

28. In concluding my despatch I wish to
bring to notice the hard work and continual
effort of the staff and signals on my Headquar-
ters in building up the Command into a fighting
organization in so short a time.

The Commanders Tenth Army, 3 and 21
Corps and their subordinate Commanders have
given wholehearted co-operation in the training
and equipment of their formations and in over-
coming difficulties inherent in their re-organiza-
tion.

SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 28 AUGUST, 10946

The Commanders of the L of C Areas and
Sub-Areas in carrying out their tasks deserve
credit for what they have accomplished under
conditions of great distances, bad weather and
communications.

In General Anders, Commanding the Polish
Army in the East, I have found a most willing
collaborator who carries great prestige with his
troops and who has worked tirelessly to get his
troops into line with British methods.

General Connolly of the United States Per-
sian Gulf Service Command has shown willing
co-operation and understanding in the taking
over of the Persian L of C by the American
forces on their recent arrival.

I found in Air Vice Marshal H. de Crespigny,
Royal Air Force, a willing co-operator in the
preparation of the plans for the defence of
North Persia and am much indebted to him
for his sound advice on all matters affecting
our two services.

Commodore C. F. Hamill, Royal Navy,
Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf, rendered
most valuable service not only in the control
and allotment of shipping between the various
Persian Gulf ports but also by the ready manner
in which he met emergency demands for sea
transport. :

Tam also much indebted to Mr. J. A. de C.
Hamilton of the Minister of State’s Branch
Office in Baghdad for his help and advice on
many subjects for which civil and military
responsibilities overlap.

Throughout my period in the command the
willing co-operation of His Majesty’s Embassy
in Baghdad and the Legation in Teheran have
been of the greatest assistance.
