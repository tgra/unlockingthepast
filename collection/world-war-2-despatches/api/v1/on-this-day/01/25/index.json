            "date": "25th January",
            "description": "The enemy advanced again on the 25th January. Two columns, one moving north-east along the track from Antelat and the other to the east of the Abd el Hafid bog, converged on Msus. The enemy moved very fast, especially the eastern arm of the pincer, and his tanks outdistanced our guns and transport. The 2nd Armoured Brigade became heavily engaged with the enemy's western column, but successfully extricated itself, though the next day it could muster only thirty or forty tanks. Many parties of our troops were surrounded, and it was feared that the whole of the Guards Brigade might be cut off. They drew out, however, and rejoined the division at Charruba towards which the withdrawal was now directed, the original line of retirement having been found impracticable for movement. The 4th Indian Division was informed of the withdrawal shortly after midday and proposed to evacuate all administrative troops from Bengasi by dawn next day."

Up to the 25th January, when we still had possession of the important chain of aerodromes and landing grounds and the lateral road in Central Johore, there was still a hope, though by then only a slender one, that our strategy might be successful. The loss of the Batu Pahat force, however, forced upon us the necessity of withdrawing into the Singapore Fortress area and of concentrating upon its defence. We had then failed in our object of protecting the Naval Base. Our task thereafter was to hold the Singapore Fortress area."

Orders were issued cancelling the work already begun on the extension of the Sudan railway from Gedaref towards Gallabat. The railway from Kassala was to be extended as quickly as possible as far as Tessenei. This work was given priority over all other railway work in the Sudan. It was further decided that an all-weather road from Rashid to Gallabat was not now necessary, and that a well maintained dry-weather track would suffice."

This attack was halted by the Hermann Goering Division after gains of up to two miles. The advance was resumed on the 27th but was again halted well short of its objective; 3 Division was still three: miles from the town and it was evident that a more concentrated and better prepared attack would be necessary. I Division in the meanwhile was endeavouring to push up the main road from Anzio to Albano with Campoleone as its first objective. An attack on the so-called   Factory Buildings \" (actually the first buildings of Mussolini's new town of Aprilia) was successful on the 25th, though it met strong resistance from 3 Panzer Grenadier Division; but we could only advance a mile and a half beyond the  ' Factory   and it was clear that Campoleone, like Cisterna, could only be taken by a strong and consolidated attack. I had returned to the bridgehead on the 25th, after being there on D-day, and as a result of my observations ordered General Clark on the 27th to press the advance with the utmost energy. before the enemy reinforcements could arrive; they were then suffering considerable delay from our air attacks on communications. I told him I considered that, with the prospect of the balance of 45 Divisiom arriving in the bridgehead shortly, risks must be taken and I suggested that all efforts should now be concentrated on full-scale co-ordinated attacks to capture Cisterna and Campoleone, followed by a rapid advance on Velletri."

It is thought that plans were in hand to strengthen the defences, as General Sir John Laverack, Commanding 1st Australian Corps, visited Palembang about 25th January and indicated that an Australian division might be expected invthe near future.
