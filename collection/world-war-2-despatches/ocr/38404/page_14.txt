me that the co-operation of a bomber force
was necessary to make these operations effec-
tive. The Chief of the Air Staff upheld this
view; and it was decided that the ‘‘ Circus ”’
offensive should continue.

150. Up to this time 46 “‘ Circus ’’ opera-
tions had been carried out since 14th June.
In those six weeks escort and support had been
given to 374 bomber sorties and over 8,000
fighter sorties flown. We had lost 123 fighter
pilots but it was hoped that many more German
fighters than this had been destroyed. In
addition, over 1,000 fighter sorties had been
flown in support of 32 bomber operations
against shipping, including the operations
against the German capital ships on 24th July
and an attack on the docks at Le Havre on
roth June. Fighter sweeps without bombers
accounted for approximately another 800
sorties, and operation ‘‘ Rhubarb ’’—resumed
on 16th July after a month’s pause—for a fur-
ther 61. Altogether the six weeks’ intensive
effort had meant the expenditure of nearly
10,000 offensive sorties by my Command. This
was an impressive total, but to preserve per-
spective it must be remembered that the effort
devoted to defensive purposes was still greater,
approximately this number of sorties being ex-
pended during the same period on the protec-
tion of shipping alone. :

151. The ‘‘ Circus ’’ offensive was resumed
on 5th August and 26 operations were carried
out during the month. Blenheims of No. 2
Group provided the striking force for 24 cf
them and Hampdens of No. 5 Group for the
other two. As the enemy gained experience
in repelling these attacks his opposition grew
more effective, and the balance of advantage
showed a tendency to turn against us. Ths
being so, it was for, consideration whether the
scale of the offensive should be reduced, if
not at once, at any rate as soon as there was
any sign of a more stable situation on the
Eastern Front

152. Apparently the same considerations
occurred simultaneously to the Chiefs of Staff.
Consequently, the problem was studied at the
end of August and beginning of September
in the Air Ministry as well as at my Head-
quarters and at Headquarters No. rz Group.
The outcome was that, although it was now
clear that the offensive had not succeeded in
forcing the return of German Units, at any
rate in substantial numbers, from the Eastern
Front, and could not now be expected to clo
so, it was generally agreed that it ought to be
continued, although on the reduced scale which
the declining season was likely to impose nm
any case. A suggestion” made by the Air
Officer Commanding No, 11 Group, which I
endorsed, was that, instead of being largely
concentrated against the French departments of
the Nord and Pas-de-Calais, the attacks should
now be delivered over a wider area so as to
induce the Germans to spread their fighters
more thinly along the coasts of France and
the Low Countries. ;

153. Accordingly, twelve ‘‘ Circus ’’ opera-
tions were carried out in September and two
during the first week of October. The objec-
tives attacked by the bombers included two
targets at Rouen, one at Amiens, one at Le
Havre and one at Ostend. .

154. By this time it was clear that demands
from other theatres of war were likely to cause
a shortage of fighter aircraft at home for some
time to come. For this reason, and also be-
cause the weather was growing less favourable
and the situation on the Eastern Front had
reached a stage at which it was unlikely to be
materially affected by the ‘‘ Circus ’’ offen-
sive, on 12th October I instructed the three
Group Commanders concerned with offensive
operations that in future ‘‘ Circus ’’ operations
must only be undertaken in specially favour-
able circumstances, but that a rigorous offen-
sive should be continued against shipping and
“fringe targets "’. ‘

155. Early in October the Hurricane bomber,
which had been under development for some
time, became available for active operations,
and armed with, this weapon the Command
assumed responsibility for what was called the
“Channel Stop’’. The object of this opera-
tion, which hitherto had been performed mainly
by Blenheims of No. 2 Group with fighter
escort, was to close the area between the North
Foreland, Ostend, Dieppe and Beachy Head
to ali hostile shipping by day.

156. When the Air. Ministry decided to re-
duce the scale of the ‘‘ Circus ’’ offensive in
September, I made arrangements at their
instance to increase the scale of scope of opera-
tion ‘“‘ Rhubarb ’’. Hitherto pilots had seldom
been lucky enough to meet German aircraft,
so that their only alternative to inaction had
been to make rather aimless attacks on sur-
face objectives. I might have taken advantage
of this situation by imposing a rigid “ target
policy,’’ but up to the present I had judged
it advisable to lay down any mle which
might give the impression that attacks on sur-
face objectives were as important as_ the
destruction of enemy aircraft. Pilots were
therefore given a free hand in this matter so
long as they observed the general bombard-
ment instructions which reflected the attitude
of H M. Government to questions of humanity
and international law.

157- Although the relative importance of
enemy aircraft and surface objectives as
objects of attack had not changed, my staff
and I felt that the time had come to sub-
ordinate the ideal to the real by recognizing
that on nine occasions out of ten our pilots
were not likely to see any German aircraft
and must either attack surface objectives or
do nothing.

158. Accordingly, new instructions for opera-
tion ‘‘ Rhubarb ’’ were issued in October.
Pilots were now to proceed to a selected sur-
face objective, and if they met no German
aircraft on the way, that would be their target.
If they did meet German aircraft, then the
destruction of those aircraft would take
priority. .

159. Categories from which the surface ob-
jectives were to be selected were drawn up by
my staff in consultation with the Air Ministry;
they included canal barges, railway tank
wagons, electrical transformer stations and, for
a season, factories engaged in distilling alcohol
from beet. On 20th October, H.M. Govern-
ment withdrew a long-standing ban on the
attack of moving goods trains, so that we could
now attack tank wagons on the Hibve as well
as in sidings. . a:
