            "description": "122. The attacks on Japanese Headquarters and concentration areas can be illustrated by a strike on 29th March against the Japanese Burma Area Army Headquarters located in Rangoon. Reports indicate that four hundred Japanese, with a high proportion of officers, were killed. News of the attack spread to the Allied prisoners in Rangoon, and was the cause of considerable encouragement to them. The enemy\u2019s evacuation of the city a month later is much more understandable in the light of these attacks, which made Rangoon such a dangerous area even before ground forces were within striking distance. Mandalay had already suffered such attacks, notably one in January when it was reported by agents that six hundred Japanese were killed. The part played by such air blows in persuading the enemy to abandon his strategic positions earlier than anticipated must surely have been great."

The Captain (D), Four- teenth Destroyer Flotilla, with the striking force teported that he was joining HAVOCK, as did GREYHOUND and GRIFFIN, but at orzo HAVOCK altered the report to that of an 8-inoh cruiser. At 0036, the Captain (D), Tenth Destroyer Flotilla, had reported leaving three cruisers stopped and on fire and two other cruisers in the vicinity as well as two damaged destroyers. At 0314 HAVOCK reported being alongside POLA and asked whether \u2018\u2018 to board or blow her stern off with depth charges,\u2019\u2019 the Captain (D), Fourteenth Destroyer Flotilla then reported having sunk ZARA and being about to sink POLA. 29th March, 1941."

His forces on both banks of the river were pushed back and, by the end of March, 89 Brigade (7 Indian Divi- sion) had entered Lanywa on the west bank and were successfully probing south from Singu, and west towards Kyaukpadaung, east of the river. 7 Indian Division (less 33 Brigade) was placed under command of 33 Corps on the 29th March, when that Corps entered the area in which the Division was operating. 33 Brigade reverted to under the Soma of 7 Indian Division on the 31st March."

            "description": "117. In the Meiktila area, there was con- tinuous fighting. While mobile columns of infantry and tanks were successfully operating against the enemy who were attempting to close in on the town, inflicting heavy casualties and capturing many guns, the Japanese were con- centrating on capturing the airstrip, two miles north of Meiktila, on which our supplies de- pended. On the night 15th-16th March, their attacks reached the north-west corner of the airstrip where they dug in. They were success- fully counter-attacked but their guns still dominated the strip, and the air-transportable brigade of 5 Indian Division, which was then being flown in landed under artillery fire. Several aircraft were destroyed, but the American Air Commandos were undeterred and no sortie turned back. The enemy then attacked in strength and succeeded in capturing the airstrip. This resulted in an immediate severe curtailment of supplies, including ammunition, since we had to fall back on \u201c dropping \u201d as opposed to \u201clanding.\u201d There followed a week\u2019s fierce fighting to regain the strip. The enemy dug in in the broken country to the north, which was almost impassable for tanks, and strengthened the position with numerous anti-tank guns and minefields. This meant that the clearance of the strip was a job for the infantry, together with elements of the R.AF. Regiment and R.A.F. Servicing Com- mandos, and it was achieved against the most determined opposition with the magnificent support of R.A.F. fighter-bombers. The Japanese artillery, however, still covered the airfield at almost point-blank range and further bitter close-quarter fighting was necessary be- fore the enemy was routed. The whole area was cleared by the 29th March. The enemy\u2019s suici- dal resistance cost him nearly all his guns and we inflicted tremendous casualties."
