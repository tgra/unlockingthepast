King's Own Royal Regiment were brought up from Shaiba by air as reinforcements, the garrison was considerably: outnumbered. In the meantime, Iraqi troops had occupied Rutbah, and by 3rd May all the refineries and oil installations were in their hands. There were at the time insufficient forces at our disposal to drive them out. On 6th May Colonel O. L. Roberts assumed command of Habbaniya."

            "description": "8. During the 28th, plans for the evacuatioa were concerted with Admiralty representatives and orders were issued to both General Carton de Wiart and General Paget as to how the evacuation was to be carried out. The evacuation of the French was commenced on the night of the 28th/2g9th and arrangements were made for the evacuation of the remaining troops from Namsos to be completed on the nights of the 1st/and and 2nd/3rd May. Plans for the evacuation of Andalsnes were for the evacuation to be carried out on two nights, Ist/2nd, and 2nd/3rd May, but the plan was made sufficiently elastic so that if nec the process of evacuation from this latter port could be put forward 24 hours. It had been planned when the force was evacuated from Namsos that a rearguard should fall back by land to Mosjoen retiring in the face of the enemy, and that in the meantime a party should be sent by sea to ensure holding the latter port against enemy troops landed by parachute from the air, and orders to this effect were issued. General Carton de Wiart opposed this plan on the grounds that owing to lack of petrol and transport and more important still, the fact that the road during the thaw was practically impassable, the operation would be likely to end Subsequent telegrams did not induce him to alter his view and even the passage by the land route of a small party of French Chasseurs was by him deemed impossible. My final wire on this subject was to the effect that if in the opinion of General Audet the retirement of a small rearguard of French Chasseurs by the land route was impossible, this rafion was not to take place. It was evident that, if French Chasseurs could not retire along this route, the Germans could not advance along it. In the event no withdrawal by land did take place, though this was an error as the Germans have since made full use of this route, and have advanced so rapidly along it that our troops in Mosjoen have not had time to get properly established and it is more than likely that we shall not be able to hold the place."

After dark vigorous patrolling was carried out and one patrol succeeded in scaling the precipitous Bald Hill. This bluff was successful. The enemy believed he had repulsed a strong attack. Behind 3/18 Garhwal Rifles noise, activity and the display of lights, all carefully controlled, gave added realism to the deception. The enemy was deceived  by these manoeuvres, and placed his forces  to repel an attack astride the road and from the direction of Falaga Pass,"

Frontier Battalion reached the outskirts of Debra Tabor on 7th May and from then until arrival of 4 Company on 16th May, in spite of continual rain, inadequate clothing and cover, and much lameness caused by jigger sores, they maintained systematic nightly bombing attacks on the Debra Tabor garrison, which consisted of two Blackshirt and two Colonial battalions and a regular Banda group. 4 Company continued the work with mortar support until 2oth May, when the battalion was ordered to Dessie, much to the regret of the commander, who, after an exchange of correspondence with Colonel Angelini, commanding the Debra Tabor garrison, believed, that in spite of his instructions to hold out to the last man, Angelini would have surrendered with a little more pushing. Major Simonds was withdrawn at the same time. Debra Tabor did not fall until the beginning of July 1943, but it remained isolated throughout the intervening period as a result of the work of Beghemder Force and the Frontier Battalion."
