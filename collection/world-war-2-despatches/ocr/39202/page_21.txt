33 Corps. The Squadron Commander, it was
prota to 10 considered that the factor
imuting the monthly carrying capacity of a
squadron was the ability of the Data’ eaice
than that of aircraft, to withstand the strain
of intense activity. Few of the pilots in ques-
tion could have remained efficient if the
squadron had attempted to carry on for longer
than six weeks at the same level of activity.

Maximum Monthly Carrying Capacity of L5

Aircraft.

256. While the average daily number of cases
evacuated per aircraft was 5, some of the air-
craft actually exceeded this number, while
some failed to reach it. On the other hand,
had all aircraft been used to the same extent
as those which flew more than the average for
the whole squadron, the average daily number
evacuated would have been six, or 180 for the
squadron of 30 aircraft. This figure was
agreed upon by the Squadron Commander,
who estimated that the maximum daily carry-
ing capacity of a single squadron of light air-
craft was 180 and the maximum monthly capa-
city 6,000. This, of course, was based on the
maximum distance of 65 miles between the
Tear and forward strips.

257. The situation was somewhat altered in
the instance of 4 Corps’ advance down the
Meiktila-Rangoon road in April, 1945, when
an American light aircraft squadron was
evacuating cases from Toungoo to Meiktila
for a short period. The distance involved
was 330 miles for a whole sortie, and the flight
lasting approximately four and a half hours.
This meant that it was not possible to evacuate
more than two cases per plane per day for
more than a total of 60 casualties per day for
the whole squadron. It was interesting to
note in this connection, however, that 4 Corps’
Tate of advance in April was approximately
14 miles per day. While the distances flown
by light aircraft engaged on casualty evacua-
tion were correspondingly great, the squadron
was nevertheless well able to handle all cases,
because ground casualties were very light.

258. Altogether the data derived as a result
of the operational experience of these light air-
craft in Burma suggests that one squadron of
32 LS aircraft is sufficient to evacuate all the
Cases: requiring evacuation from the forward
areas of a Corps of three Divisions, provided
the average daily number of cases does not ex-
ceed 180 and the average distance flown is
not greater than 60 miles per trip (120 miles
per round sortie). One other important pro-
viso, of course, is that we have air superiority
and that there is no prolonged heavy fighting
with an exceedingly high sickness rate.

GENERAL RECONNAISSANCE.

A Period of Great Versatility for G.R. Aircraft.

259. When the period under review opened,
offensive general reconnaissance had become
effectively established as the primary opera-
tional function of air-sea power in this Theatre.
The opening weeks of 1945 had incontestably
indicated an entire absence of enemy U-boats
throughout the vast expanses of the Indian
Ocean, and pointed to the urgent need for
alternative employment. Thus evolved the
plan for an intensive anti-shipping campaign

2147

to disrupt the enemy’s sea transport in and
around the waters of the Andaman Sea. Four
months of vigorous anti-shipping strikes and
carefully planned air-sea mining operations
revealed that these tactics were greatly harass-
ing the enemy, and an intensification of offen-.
sive general reconnaissance was rightly con-
sidered a remunerative policy to pursue.

260. Although the primary operational réle
of 222 Group in May 1945 was that of sinking
and immobilising the enemy’s shipping, it
must be borne in mind that there were con-
tinued and increasing commitments in the
spheres of photographic reconnaissance,
meteorological flights and air-sea rescue. I
had, in fact, delegated the responsibility for the
organisation and control of air-sea rescue
operations and units to Air Marshal Com-
manding 222 Group as from Ist April, 1945,
for the whole of South East Asia Command.
Moreover, there was always the possibility that
the enemy might recommence his U-boat war-
fare with renewed vigour, and the G.R. forces
under my control had always to be prepared
for such a contingency.

Developing the Anti-Shipping Campaign.
261. With the re-occupation of Rangoon on
May 3rd, 1945, it became possible to estab-
lish a new and invaluable base from which
to develop the anti-shipping campaign in more
easterly waters. Sunderland aircraft of 230
Squadron (relieved in July by a detachment
of 209 Squadron, similarly equipped) operat-
ing from the depot ship S.S. “ Manela” under
the operational control of 346 Wing were able
to spread their tentacles over the areas of the
Tenasserim Coast, Kra Isthmus, Gulf of Siam
and South China Seas, adding confusion and
perplexity to the enemy with their constant
armed reconnaissance and timely attacks
wherever suitable targets presented themselves.

262. As a counterpart to this newly estab-
lished base of Rangoon in the north, the de-
velopment of Cocos Island in the south con-
stituted an equally important strategic base
for similar operations off the west coast of
Sumatra, the south coast of Java and the
Sunda Straits. No. 321 Squadron, equipped
with Liberators (Mark VD, commenced
operating a detachment of six aircraft from
Cocos Island on July 22nd, 1945.

263. No. 354 Liberator Squadron, which
had initiated the offensive anti-shipping strike
aspect of the campaign in early February,
disbanded on 15th May, 1945. No. 203
Liberator Squadron, however, which had com-
menced strike operations on 20th . March,
1945, continued its programme of incessant and
forceful attack over the Andaman Sea, Straits
of Malacca, Gulf of Siam, Java Sea, Bangka
Strait and off the west coast of Sumatra until
the cessation of hostilities. This squadron
was based at Kankesanturai (North Ceylon)
but frequently operated detachments from
Akyab, Ramree and Cocos Island under
adverse conditions.

264, The paramount problem of the ship-
ping strike operations was the lack of forward
bases. Liberator aircraft had been operating
from bases far removed from this scene of
operations, and the period of patrol in the
operational area was inevitably curtailed, thus
