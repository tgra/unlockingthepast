I immediately took steps to strengthen the A.A. defences of these areas, partly by moving guns from other parts of the country and partly by pledging a substantial part of the anticipated production in March and April. By the middle of March, the move of 81 ad- ditional heavy A.A. guns to the West Coast ports had been ordered, and shortly after- wards further increases amounting to another 104 heavy A.A. guns were arranged. Actual increases exceeded what had been planned: 58 guns were withdrawn from the Midlands in March, and 24 guns came from the factories: by 1st June a further 106 new guns had been deployed.,"

This operation was to\u2019 start on the night of the 1st June as a preliminary to a general counter-offensive. Meanwhile the Free French were ordered to capture Segnali, which they found unoccupied."

The general administrative arrangements, however, to sustain our own offensive or to meet an enemy attack were completed by the 15th May. The Belhamed trailhead was opened eleven days later, but was only used for delivering tanks. By the 15th May it was evident that the enemy would in all probability anticipate our offensive and arrange- ments to cope with a possible withdrawal to the frontier were put in hand as a precautionary measure.

            "description": "The Navy had sustained heavy losses in ships during the passage to and from Crete, and it had been decided that the evacuation must end on the night of 31st May-1st June. The embarka- tion during the last two nights was carried out under conditions of considerable difficulty, rations and water were limited and the troops, scattered in various hiding places during the day to shelter from enemy air attack, were difficult to collect for embarkation. I ordered General Freyberg to return to Egypt on the night of 30th-31st May, and he and his staff were taken off by flying boat. General Weston remained in command and was taken off on the following night. It is regretted that a con- siderable number of troops had to be left behind, including an Australian battalion and the bulk of Layforce, who had all fought most skilfully and gallantly to the end."

            "description": "12. It was impossible for many months to obtain financial approval for the expenditure of any further money on defences or roads; and essential equipment, which had been ordered by Colonel Chater many months pre- viously, was not supplied by the Colonial Office, which was still responsible for the administration of the troops. It was not till 1st June, 1940 that administrative control of Somaliland was taken over by Middle East. It seemed difficult to persuade the authorities to consider seriously the possibility of war with Ttaly; and even as late as April I was still being refused permission, as the result of the Government policy of avoiding the provoca- tion of Italy, to send any Intelligence agents over the frontier to obtain information of Italian dispositions, on the grounds that our relations with the Italians might thereby be impaired."

            "description": "It was during this period that the crisis of Fifth Army\u2019s attack in the Alban Hills was reached and on 31st May, in order to give them more freedom of action, I shifted the inter-Army boun north to leave Route 6 to Fifth Army. Eighth Army were thereby directed further northwards in conformity with the movements of the enemy whose withdrawal was now much more northerly, up the Arce- Avezzano and Frosinone-Arsoli roads. 10 Corps was pursuing up the former, with -the New Zealanders in the lead, and 13 Corps up the latter, with 8 Indian and 78 Divisions. The Canadian Corps was to move up Route 6 through Ferentino to the Army boundary and prepare to pass 6 South ican Armoured Division through in pursuit through Rome. Should the enemy succeed in stabilizing on the \u201cCaesar? line 13 Corps would join in a concentrated attack to the north of the Canadians. Ferentino fell on 1st June and the Canadians pushed on to Anagni, which was captured on the 3rd. By this time the fall of Rome was clearly imminent and Eighth Army turned its best efforts to get forward 6 South African and 6 British Armoured Divisions to lead the pursuit. It was not an easy task, for the South Africans had to pass through the, whole Canadian Corps and then found Route 6 blocked by the French Expeditionary Corps and II Corps. In spite of these irksome difii- culties it was inspiring to have these two fresh armoured divisions with which to press the pursuit of a fleeing enemy. As I signalled the night Rome fell \u2018\u2018 If only the country were more open we could make hay of the whole"

The raising of the new District to take over in rear of Fourteenth Army was comparatively simple and was brought about by the end of the month. The return of 202 Area to India, which was also part of my plan, was a much more complicated business, especially as it involved consideration of the question whether 404 Area should not also be handed over. It was not until May, 1945, after prolonged discussion with G.H.Q., India, at which the Supreme Allied Commander, the A.O.C.-in-C., South-East Asia, and the G.O.C.-in-C., Eastern Command, India, were represented, that it was decided that 202 Area would be transferred to control of India Command, while I retained 404 Area, but raised to District status. I may add here that the actual handover did not take place until the 1st June, 1945, on which date also H.Q. L. of C. Command was disbanded, and 404 Area came under my direct control. The overall administrative organization of Burma was considered at the same time and my proposal to form 606 District for South Burma out of the H.Q. L. of C. Command, which became redundant, was agreed. Thus after the fall of Rangoon, I should have three Districts, 404 controlling Chittagong and Arakan, 505 controlling Northern and Central Burma including Mandalay, and 606 control- ling Southern Burma, including eventually Tenasserim,"

This operation was, however, never actually cancelled. As far back as the Sth February, the Supreme Allied Commander had issued a Directive in which my tasks were defined as follows: \u201cTo secure the Ledo\u2014Burma road, capture Rangoon by 1st June, 1945, open the\u2019 port of Rangoon and destroy the main Japan- ese forces in Burma, excluding the Tenasserim coast.\u201d In this Directive the Commander-in- Chief, East Indies Fleet, was instructed \u201cTo furnish such Naval support and amphibious resources as may be\u2019 required for combined operations,\u201d and, mention was also made of the Indian Airborne Division, which was to be held under the Supreme Commander\u2019s opera- tional control. This amounted, in effect, to. \u201cOperation Dracula,\u201d though in a modified form, and I considered the time had now come to put it into effect, that is, to carry out a com- bined sea, land and air operation against Rangoon, though on a much smaller scale than was originally planned."
