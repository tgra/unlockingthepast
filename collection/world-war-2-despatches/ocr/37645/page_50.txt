and speedy initiative, to the troops for their
Telentless persistence in advancing under the
varied arduous conditions which they met; in
the Northern Frontier District, in heat and
dust, and long periods on only a gallon of water
per man; in the Abyssinian hills in wet and
cold, and undertaking operations calling for the
highest degree of physical fitness and resistance
to fatigue. Although food was always plenti-
ful the staple ‘‘ Bully Beef’’ was seldom re-
placed by fresh meat, and most of the white
personnel had no bread for the whole period
of two months. Owing to the speed of the
advance and the distances covered, it was im-
possible to maintain a regular service of mails,
a matter of considerable concern to many of the
men. All these discomforts were met by both
white and native troops with the imperturbable
cheerfulness which has Jong been the charac-
teristic of the British soldier.

sth February to 5th April were: —

It might appear from this figure that there
was in fact very little serious fighting. This
is by no means the case. Nearly always when
our troops met the enemy they were heavily
fired on, and the number of automatics and
heavy machine-guns captured testified to the
fire power the enemy could develop. I attri-
bute the reasons for the low number of
casualties firstly to the superior mobility of our
forces which enabled them quickly to find the
** soft spot,’? secondly to the cover provided by
the bush, and thirdly to lack of marksmanship
of the Italian Colonial Infantryman who when
pressed was inclined to shoot high.

138. I wish to express my grateful thanks
to Vice-Admiral R. Leatham, C.B., R.N.,
Commander-in-Chief East Indies, and all ranks
and ratings concerned, for the invaluable help
rendered by the Royal Navy throughout the
operations, commencing with the efficient sup-
port given by ‘‘ Force T ”’ in the bombardment
of the coast before the capture of Chisimaio,
and later during the forcing of the Giuba. The
successive opening of the ports of Chisimaio,
Merca, Mogadiscio and Berbera enabled my
operations to proceed without a pause. In
every case facilities for unloading were poor or
non-existent, ‘but the difficulties were sur-
mounted with the efficiency and drive we have
come to expect from our sister service.

139. I cannot speak too highly of the part
played by the Air Forces in this campaign.
The Air Officer Commanding remained with me
throughout the operation, thus facilitating the
requests for immediate air assistance. From the
commencement of the campaign our Air
Forces, under Air Commodore W. Sowrey,
D.F.C., A.F.C., ably assisted by Brigadier H.
Daniel, M.C., A.F.C., S.A.A.F., established
complete air superiority, with the result that
the advance of the troops was little interfered
with by enemy air activity, and after the cross-
ing of the Giuba we moved wholly by day.
Bombing and “‘ ground strafing ’’ by the enemy
was sporadic and normally ineffective. During
the later stages of the campaign a support

group consisting of bombers, fighters, and A.C.
machines was formed, and its Air Force Com-
mander with his own communications advanced
with the Commander of the leading troops. The
value of this arrangement from the army point
of view cannot be overstressed. Air support
for the forward troops of the nature called for
by the situation, was ‘‘on tap,’’ and engen-
dered the greatest confidence amongst both
commanders and men.

140. To the pilots of the $.A.A.F. fighters,
who destroyed such a number of enemy
machines on the ground, and to the S.A.A.F.
bombers which created such havoc amongst the
retreating enemy, must be ascribed their great
share of the credit for the successes gained. The
invaluable work of the S.A.A.F. Army Co-
operation Squadrons was carried out with dar-
ing and efficiency. ‘Without the continuous
employment of the Communication Flight,
R.A.F., control of the operations spread over
such a large area of country would have been
impossible. I would like to mention the ground
staff which, in spite of lack of spares and faci-
lities generally, by dint of unceasing toil kept
the maximum number of machines in the air.

The number of enemy aircraft destroyed
ana the period was 57 against our own losses
of 8.

141. Here I must express my great apprecia-
tion of the assistance given so freely in every
way possible to the Army by His Excellency
the Governor of Kenya, Their Excellencies the
Governors of Tanganyika, Nyasaland, North-
ern Rhodesia and Uganda through the East
African Governors’ Conference, the Govern-
ment of Southern Rhodesia, and various civil
authorities and institutions. All requests that
I have had to make from time to time met
with immediate response.

142. It is not too much to say that the willing
co-operation given to the Army at all times by
the Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours
Administration played a large part in further-
ing the operations, In particular, their
invaluable assistance in the construction and
repair of large quantities of military material
of various types must be mentioned. To Briga-
dier General the Hon. Sir Godfrey Rhodes,
C.B.E., D.S.O., and the officers and employees
of the Administration the Army owes its
gratitude.

Tn addition to this practical help the Kenya
and gana Railways and Harbours has as.
part of the common war effort assisted His
Majesty’s Government by large remissions of
financial charges that would normally be due
to them for military traffic.

143. A great deal of voluntary work for the
benefit of the Army has been undertaken. Sub-
scriptions have been made towards the welfare
of, and gifts for, the troops. Ambulances and
mobile canteens have been presented, and my
Welfare Officers have been greatly assisted by
provision of accommodation for officers and
other ranks for periods of leave.

144. The Force owes a great debt to Lady
Moore who, in addition to many other activi-
ties, organised and managed the voluntary
Kenya Women’s Emergency Organisation which
ran the badly-needed canteens in Nairobi, and
provided vegetables and other comforts for the
forward troops when possible.
