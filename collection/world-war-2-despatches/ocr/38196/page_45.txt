SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 5 FEBRUARY, 1948

sion entered Mateur. The enemy tried to hold
a line on the high ground east of the Mateur-
Tebourba road and especially the pass leading
to Chouigui, which was strongly defended by
the Barenthin Regiment. North of Mateur,
however, 1 Division to the south and g Divi-
Sion to the north of Garaet Achkel continued
to make progress. The Moroccan Goums
attached to g Division were particularly use-
ful in the mountains to the north of the lake
These were strong positions by nature but the
German defenders had been too much
weakened by their losses round Jefna. On the
morning of the 7th May resistance broke, on
the edge of the last hills, and the American
Corps started the final attack which was to
bring them into Bizerta.

At first light on 7th May 6 and 7 Armoured
Divisions moved forward once more from
Massicault. Despite his best efforts the enemy
had been pnable to organise a defence in the
area of the break through, though he was
hastily summoning back the forces cut off to
the south of our penetration. 6 Armoured Divi-
sion fought a stiff action south-east of St.
Cyprien while 7 Armoured Division, advancing
north of the road, captured the village by
‘0830 hours and pressed on for the suburb of
Le Bardo There was a sharp skirmish at the
junction of the Medjez and Bizerta roads, a
little sniping from isolated houses on the out-
skirts but at 1445 hours xz Hussars and 1
Derbyshire Yeomanry entered Tunis. The en-
thusiasm of the population was unrestrained;
it was the first of many experiences we were
to have of the hberation of a great city. An
hour and a half after the British entry into
Tunis 47 Regimental Combat Team of 9
United States Division entered Bizerta. It was
a happy coincidence that we should have
gained our two main objectives simultaneously
and that both the major Allies should have
won a notable victory on the same day; I had
of course planned this division of the spoils
but I had not expected so dramatic a climax.

The fall of Tunis and Bizerta clearly came
to the German Command, both in Africa and
Berlin, as a most severe shock. It was not
until the evening of 8th May that the High
‘Command issued a statement that Africa would
now be abandoned and “the thirty-one
thousand Germans and thirty thousand Italians
remaining ’’ would be withdrawn by sea. I
commented in a report to General Eisenhower
that night that the Navy and Air Forces
would interfere with this programme, which in
any event depended on the enemy holding a
firm bridgehead in Cape Bon, and reminded
him of Mr. Churchill’s words in August, 1940:
“* We are waiting, so are the fishes ’’. In fact
no effort of this sort was made, for the enemy’s
plans of defence had been completely disrupted.
The divided forces were not given a moment’s
pause to recover. As soon as the situation in
Tunis was under control 9 Corps split its forces
according to the pre-arranged plan and pro-
ceded to mop up, to left and right. On the
left 7 Armoured Division was direcfed north-
wards up the Bizerta road towards Protville
and the Medjerda; simultaneously 1 United
States Armoured Division was moving towards
the same area, north of the Protville marshes,
from Mateiir. The troops entrapped in this
pocket consisted of the Manteuffel Division,
15 Panzer and 334 Infantry Divisions. They

883

had little hope of resistance and none of evacua-
tion and at noon on gth May they accepted
unconditional surrender. Six Generals were
among the prisoners, including von Vaerst,
the Commander-in-Chief of 5 Panzer Army.

The forces cut off on the south of our wedge
of penetration, between 9 Corps and Eighth
Army, were larger than those to the north. In
order to deal with these the first essential was
to establish ourselves across the base of the
Cape Bon peninsula, for should they be able
to withdraw into it they might prolong resist-
ance unduly. Provided we followed up our
success vigorously, however, there could be no
chance for them of withdrawing m_ time.
Accordingly 6 Armoured Division, after passing
through Tunis, wheeled right down the road
which runs across the base of the peninsula.
It was followed by 4 Infantry Division, and
x Armoured Division came up on its right from
the Goubellat area. The first obstacle encoun-
tered was the Hammam Lif defile. At the
bottom of the Gulf of Tunis Gebel Bou
Kournine, the sacred ‘‘ twin-horned ’’ moun-
tain of the Carthaginians, rises steeply above
the road leaving a narrow gap of about three
hundred yards between it and the sea shore.
The pass was held by some of the remaining
troops of the Hermann Goering Division,
strongly supported by heavy anti-aircraft guns
withdrawn from airfield defence. For two
days this exceptionally strong position held 6
Armoured Division at bay but on the morning
of roth May they broke through by sending
a body of tanks through the very edge of the
surf.

With the forcing of the Hamman Lif defile
our advance was rapid and met no further
obstacles. 6 Armoured Division poured through
the pass down the main road to the south and
by nightfall on the roth had reached Hammamet
on the east coast. Next day 4 Division swept
tapidly round the peninsula, encountering no
opposition and demonstrating that no important
forces had withdrawn there. On 12th May 6
Armoured Division attacked southwards from
Bou Ficha, 56 Division co-operated with shell-
ing from the south and after a brief resistance
the enemy raised the white flag. Our encircling
ring had joined up and the only enemy still
resisting were in isolated pockets to the north-
west of Enfidaville.

Up to this time the enemy facing Eighth
Army had held their ground and continued to
show resistance; indeed the front had been
livelier than ever, for the Germans had greatly
increased their artillery fire in order to get rid
of as much ammunition as possible.* On the
rath, however, mass surrenders occurred.
General Graf von Sponeck, commanding go
Light Division, surrendered to  Lieut.-
General Sir Bernard Freyberg of the
New Zealand Division, old opponents on
many hard-fought fields. General von Arnim,
the Army Group Commander, surrendered to
the Commanding Officer of 2 Gurkhas. He was
brought to my Headquarters at Le Kef, where
he still seemed surprised by the suddenness
of the disaster, The Italians in the more in-
accessible hill-country north of Saouaf held out
the longest, and General Messe delayed his
surrender until the morning of the 13th; shortly

provided with supplies of all natures e
