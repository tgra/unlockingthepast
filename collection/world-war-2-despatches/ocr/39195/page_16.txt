question now arose as to the priority of our
further crossings. If the next crossing were
again to be effected by 33 Corps, it would
further indicate that our main objective was
Mandalay. On the other hand, it was essen-
tial that 4 Corps should secure their bridge-
head early, in order to allow sufficient time for
the mechanised force designed for the thrust on
Meiktila to pass through it—an operation
which, once he realised its significance, the
enemy would strain every nerve to delay.
General Slim, therefore, decided that one divi-
sion from each Corps should cross simul-
taneously: 20 Indian Division from 33 Corps
and 7 Indian Division from 4 Corps. He con-
sidered that even if the enemy regarded 4
Corps’ crossing as the greater menace, he
would not be able to react in time to upset our
plans in this sector, in view of the existing
threat to Mandalay and the pressure exerted
by 33 Corps elsewhere.

79. The Japanese were completely deceived
by 19 Indian Division’s crossing. They
believed, as we had intended they should, that
this Division was the advanced guard of
4 Corps and they decided to exterminate it
before its two bridgeheads could be consoli-
dated. I had hoped, when I had originally
directed 19 Indian Division on to Indaw in
the “ railway corridor,” that Northern Combat
Area Command would be able to exert suffi-
cient pressure from the north that the Japanese
would be unable to concentrate in strength
against the left flank of Fourteenth Army.
Unfortunately, as I have already indicated, the
sudden transfer of the two Chinese divisions
to China had disrupted General Sultan’s plans,
and temporarily halted Northern Combat Area
Command’s advance. This enabled the enemy
to concentrate the bulk of his 15 and 53
Divisions against the Kyaukmyaung bridge-
head, thereby pinning 19 Indian Division to
this restricted area for a much longer period
than would otherwise have been the case.
Moreover, the Commander, 15 Japanese Army,
was able to support these two Divisions, not
only with the bulk of his Army artillery, but
also with batteries drawn from 31 and 33
Divisions, and with tanks. Covered by what
General Slim described as “the heaviest
artillery concentration our troops had yet
endured,” the Japanese infantry hurled them-
selves against our defence night after night,
keeping up their attacks for nearly a month.
Not only did 19 Indian Division hold its
ground, but, despite heavy casualties, it
actually expanded its bridgehead. Gradually,
as their losses mounted, the enemy attacks lost
their sting until it became apparent, even to
the Japanese, that we could not be dislodged.

I wish to pay tribute to the gallantry and
determination displayed by 19 Indian Division
in this their first major encounter with the
enemy. Although, like all troops new to battle,
when opposed by veteran formations, they had
to buy their experience, their firm stand at this
stage against serious odds contributed
materially to the success of our operations
elsewhere. It is perhaps worthy of note that
this Division, except for a few small units,
was composed entirely of pre-war regular
troops.

80. It may serve to clarify the picture of
this vital phase of operations if, before

describing what occurred at each crossing-
place, I summarize the crossings which were
made. Four crossings of the Irrawaddy were
undertaken. Briefly they were as follows :—

(a) 19 Indian Division crossed north of
Mandalay at Thabeikkyin (9th January) and
Kyaukmyaung (16th January), as already
described. They then, as will be shown later,
advanced south on Mandalay, shifting their
bridgehead south to Singu.

(6) 20 Indian Division crossed neat
Allagappa, west of Mandalay, in the Myinmu
area, on the 12th February, with the object
of advancing east along the south bank’ of
the river towards Mandalay.

(© Twelve days later (24th February),
2 British Division crossed at Ngazun, a
village between Mandalay and 20 Indian
Division’s bridgehead.

(d) Meanwhile 4 Corps (7 and 17 Indian
Divisions with 255 Indian Tank Brigade),
with Meiktila as its ultimate objective, had
advanced down the Gangaw Valley
crossed the Irrawaddy at Nyaungu, to the
west of Pakokku, between the 13th and
19th February.

It will be noted that the Army Commander’s
decision that simultaneous crossings should be
made on both 33 and 4 Corps’ fronts was
successfully implemented ; 20 and 7 Indian
Divisions crossed within 24 hours of each other.

The crossings will ‘be described in the order
in which they took place.

81. First I will deal with 20 Indian Division’s
advance to, and crossing of, the river. After
the capture of Budalin, 20 Indian Division con-
tinued its advance with all three brigades up.
On the right, 32 Brigade, directed on Monywa,
there met with fanatical resistance. This
important river port was captured on the 22nd
January after three days fierce fighting. In
the centre, 80 Brigade occupied Wadan, on
the Ayadaw-Monywa road, and pushed south-
ward. On the left, 100 Brigade, advancing
from Ayadaw, made a lightning thrust at
Myinmu, on the Irrawaddy, which fell on the
22nd January after bitter hand-to-hand fight-
ing. An incident occurred here which illustrates
the Japanese mentality: a detachment pinned
against the river, formed up and marched
straight into it, deliberately committing mass
suicide by drowning. For the capture of both
Monywa and Myinmu we received magnificent
air support. The next three weeks were spent
by 20 Indian Division in closing up to the north
bank of the Irrawaddy between the Mu and
Chindwin Rivers. The Japanese rear parties
remaining on the north bank put up a stubborn
resistance. While this area was being cleared,
we pushed patrols out across the river. These
operated with the greatest daring, not only
reporting on possible crossing places, but in
the words of the Army Commander, maintain-
ing “a reign of terror among the Japanese
posts on the southem bank.” The enemy
responded by sending a small detachment
round the left flank of 20 Indian Division ; this
detachment crossed the Mu River from the east
bank, under an artillery concentration, and re-
captured Nyaungyin, a village two miles east
of Myinmu. They then split up into small
harassing parties, which had to be hunted down
and eliminated. ;
