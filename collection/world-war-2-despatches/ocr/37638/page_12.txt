New Zealand troops which had been landed in
Crete by the infantry of the 6th Division, so as
to enable the 6th Australian Division and the
New Zealand Division to be reorganized, in
Palestine and Egypt respectively, as soon as
possible. During the early part of May, how-
ever, the Royal Navy was fully engaged in the
operations necessary for the passage of the
convoy mentioned in para. 51 above through
the Mediterranean, and was unable to provide
the necessary escorts for any large shipping
movements between Crete and Egypt. Later,
it became obvious that there would be no time
to effect reliefs before the German attack
developed and that it would be necessary to
meet that attack with the troops already in
Crete and to defer any question of relief until
the German attack had been repulsed. Further,
the German attacks on shipping to Crete were
so intensive as to make it difficult and dan-
gerous for shipping to approach the island. I
visited Crete on 30th April and placed Major-
General Freyberg in command. I instructed
him to organize the defence of the island with
the troops available and with such additional
resources as I was able to send him from Egypt.

53. British forces had been first sent to Crete
on 1st November, 1940. The force sent was
only the Headquarters of an infantry brigade,
two battalions, 2nd Battalion The Black Watch
and 1st York and Lancaster Regiment, and
certain other details. There was then a Greek
division in the island; there seemed no immedi-
ate threat to Crete, and the only requirement
was to secure Suda Bay as a refuelling base for
the navy. The defensive arrangements were all
made with this end in view. There was at the
time no prospect of the island becoming an air
base, and the coast defences, anti-aircraft
defences and infantry defences, were designed
wey to protect the naval anchorage at Suda

ay.

Fowards the end of November the whole of
the Greek troops in the island were removed.
One additional British battalion (xst Welch
Regiment) was sent to Crete in February, and
orders were issued to prepare a base for one
division. Meanwhile an aerodrome was under
construction at Maleme, west of Canea, and the
landing ground at Heraklion in the east of the
island was being improved, With the constant
shortage of aircraft in the Middle East, however,
it was never possible to station any aircraft
permanently in the island. At the end of
November a Commando was sent to the island,
its object being to carry out raids on the
adjacent Italian islands. Otherwise the garri-
son remained at three battalions until after the
evacuation from Greece. During the operations
in Greece, however, Suda Bay became of
greater importance to the Navy and it was
therefore decided to send the Mobile Naval Base
Defence Organisation (M.N.B.D.O.), which had
lately arrived in the Middle East, to improve the
defence of Suda Bay.

54. In the light of after events, if we had
been able to develop the defences of Crete more
highly during the early period of occupation,
we could have made the enemy’s task in seizing
it even more costly than it was. The value of
the island was fully appreciated, but the con-
stant shortage of troops and material in the
Middle East was an effective obstacle to any
large-scale defence measures, and any work
would have been at the expense of other com-
mitments in the Middle East, which at the time

appeared more important. Engineer units and
equipment were always short, and were more
urgently required in Greece, in the Western
Desert and elsewhere. It was already necessary
severely to ration steel for reinforced concrete
works in the Western Desert and on the
northern frontier of Palestine; and shipping to
Crete was always scarce. It has been sug-

- gested that local labour could have been em-

ployed, but practically all able-bodied men in
the island were serving in the Greek forces in
Albania, while to collect the inhabitants from
the long and poorly developed island a con-
siderable quantity of transport would have been
required, and this, as already stated, was the
chief difficulty in all theatres in the Middle
East.

55. The total troops in Crete when the
German attack took place was approximately
28,600. Of these the great majority were in
need of rest and reorganisation after the opera-
tions in Greece, There was a shortage of equip-
ment of all kinds, and a proportion of the
personnel was unarmed. Improvised units were
formed from these men and were equipped with
such arms as were available. It was intended
to evacuate from the island before the German
attack all such personne] as could not usefully
be employed in the defence; but owing to the
shortage of shipping and escorts mentioned
above it was only possible to remove a small
proportion before the German attack. As an
additional embarrassment, there were 16,000
Italian prisoners of war, captured by the
Greeks, under guard on the island.

Every effort was made to send stores and
material to increase the means of defence; nine
infantry tanks, a number of captured Italian
guns, a certain amount of transport, and other
arms and equipment were shipped. A con-
siderable proportion, however, was sunk on
the voyage, as the enemy scale of attack on
shipping rapidly increased in intensity. The
materials sunk included about half the field

s and more than half the engineer stores
required for constructing defences.

56. The island of Crete is about 160 miles
long and about 40 miles wide. ‘It is very
mountainous and there is only one main road
which runs the whole length of the north coast,
on which are all available harbours. The roads
from north to south are few and poor. It is
possible to find landing places in the south of
the island, but there are usually no easy exits
from them and no communications with the
test of the island. It had always been intended
to develop landing places on the south of the
island and roads from them to the north, in
order to avoid the exposed passage round the
north of the island; but there had never been,
for the reasons given above, sufficient means
to carry this out.
