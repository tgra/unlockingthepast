            "description": "The defence of Syria, Iraq and Persia from the north had always been regarded as one problem, with Cyprus as an essential outpost on the western flank. In September, 1941, I had arranged with General Wavell for India and the Middle East to collaborate in planning. On the 5th January, 1942, Iraq and Persia passed under my command, and LieutenantGeneral E. P. .Quinan’s forces became the Tenth Army corresponding to General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson’s Ninth Army in",

            "title": "General Montgomery Adjusts Battle Plans as Storms Disrupt Key Supplies Ahead of January Assault",
            "description": "General Montgomery’s plan was to attack up the main road with 50 and 51 Divisions and make a wide outflanking movement through the desert to the left with 7 Armoured and 2 New Zealand Divisions, all under 30 Corps. He was very anxious, however, not to scare the enemy off his present ne prematurely, for a withdrawal would multiply our problems. Accordingly the main bodies of this force were left right back and the enemy observed only with an armoured car screen from 4 Light Armoured Brigade. 7 Armoured Division was forty-five nules further east, the New Zealand Division a hundred miles and 51 Division, except for 154 Brigade on the Wadi Bey el Kebir, two hundred miles behind the front. This, of course, had the additional advantage of easing the problem of maintenance. Advance parties were brought forward to reconnoitre the proposed routes of attack and some artillery registration was carried out. The intention was to attack on 15th January if the enemy showed signs of withdrawing and on the 9th if he was prepared io stand. It was soon clear that the former was the more likely; the infantry began moving off, Pistoia and Spezia on the 3rd and 4th and the Young Fascists shortly afterwards. At this point, however, an unexpected difficulty arose. On 4th and 5th January very heavy gales at Benghazi caused severe damage; the outer mole was breached, four ships, one containing over two thousand tons of ammunition, were sunk and the capacity of the port was reduced by two-thirds. The intake of stores had to be supplemented by road from Tobruk. In order to make up for this while still sticking to the proposed date General Montgomery decided to drop 50 Division from the attack and leave it and the rest of 10 Corps, which he had intended to bring forward to the Agheila area, back in Cyrenaica",

In_ the meantime the Commander Kuantan Force had been ordered to hold the aerodrome till the 5th January (see Section XXXI) and this had been later extended to the roth January. On the 2nd January, however, events on the west coast and the serious threat to our communications there forced the Commander 3 Indian Corps to expedite the programme and early on the morning of the 31d January the Commander Kuantan Force received orders to withdraw his force to Jerantut forthwith. During the day the enemy closed in on the aerodrome and at about 1745 hours, as the withdrawal was taking place, a strong attack developed and very heavy fighting took place. It was during this action that Lt.-Col. Cummings, commanding the 2/12 Frontier Force Regt., won the Victoria Cross. During the withdrawal the rearguard was twice ambushed on the main road by a Japanese force, which had passed by bush tracks west of the aerodrome, and suffered heavy casualties.",

            "title": "Urgent Call for Landing Craft: Eisenhower Outlines Strategic Needs for Air Force and Assault Operations in Italy",
            "description": "A further review of the situation produced more definite proposals. On 31st October, General Eisenhower again approached the Combined Chiefs of Staff with a full review of the need for landing craft and the resources necessary to meet those needs. The tasks for which the craft were required were threefold. The first was the build-up of auxiliary units to complete formations already in Ltaly. Secondly it was essential to be able to mount an assault behind the enemy lines in the strength of about a division, probably on the west coast. Thirdly it was necessary to meet the demands of the Strategic Air Force, which included not only the move of the operational formations themselves but also large numbers of airfield construction and servicing units. The Foggia airfields, though the principal base in South Italy for the Italian Air Force, were not all-weather and very large quantities of steel plank had to be transported. The requirements of the Strategic Air Force had also been largely increased by the decision, communicated on 23rd October, to set up the XV United States Air Force in Italy. With our present resources, that is adhering to the existing programme of returning craft to the United Kingdom, the first of these tasks would not be completed before 15th December and there would remain only sufficient lift for one brigade or regimental combat team, which would be quite inadequate. If, however, we could keep until 15th December all the British Landing Ships, Tank (between forty-eight and fifty-six) and twelve United States, it would be possible both to complete the build-up of present formations and to mount a divisional amphibious assault. Even then only about a third of the task of establishing the Strategic Air Force in Italy would have been carried out; but if the craft could be retained for a further three weeks, until 5th January, the whole programme could be completed.",

            "description": "I was still a little anxious about the time limit for the return of landing craft because of the needs of maintenance and my Chief Administrative Officer, General eRobertson,* gave me his opinion on 5th January that the plan was not sound administratively. I managed eventually a slight readjustment of the progtamme, as a result of a conference on 8th January, which gave us a reasonable guarantee that we should be able to supply the force landed. I also planned to land in the first follow-up convoy a mobile, hard-hitting force from 1 United States Armoured Division and 45 Infantry Division. Later the remainder of these divisions was to follow. This meant that in two months SHINGLE had grown from a first tentative figure of twenty-three thousand men to an expected eventual strength of one hundred and ten thousand. It was hoped that the Germans would not be able, with the resources available to them in Italy, both to block off this force and to hold the ‘‘ Gustav ”’",

These parachutists were undoubtedly the best German troops in Italy— in the German army, some said—and Ortona gave magnificent opportunities for street fighting. For over a week, from 20th to 28th December, the Canadians were engaged in the most violent hand-to-hand struggle. Street fighting, especially in a town of masonry houses, calls for the greatest skill and courage as Stalingrad had shown and the Canadians came triumphantly out of a test as severe as any in the war. On the 28th the parachutists were finally driven from the town. All our attacks on Orsogna in the meanwhile had failed ‘and the enemy remained in {possession for another five months. For the rest of the period no advance was made east of the Apennines; the Germans took the opportunity of the pause in operations to complete the relief of 65 Division by the newly arrived 334 Division. ~ On the Fifth Army front advances by II Corpg and the French Expeditionary Corps between 3rd and 15th January drove the Ger-",
