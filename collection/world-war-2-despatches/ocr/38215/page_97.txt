HEADQUARTERS MALAYA CoMMAND ORDER
No. 28.
The broad policy is to continue opposition
to the enemy on the mainland to cover the
arrival of our reinforcements.

5. 3 Indian Corps.—Will fight the enemy
wherever met and will NOT give ground till
forced to subject to the condition that the Corps
tnust remain in being as a fighting formation.

It is of importance to cover Kuala Lumpur
as long as possible owing to the large amount
‘of material stored in that area.

The lateral road Jerantut—Raub—Kuala
Kubu provides the main communication be-
tween East and West Malaya. This important
factor should be given full consideration in the
‘conduct of the battle.

6. It is the mtention to withdraw the
Kuantan garrison at a time to be decided later,
‘dependent upon the development of operations
elsewhere and upon climatic conditions. Pre-
liminary arrangements will be put in hand
forthwith. :
¢ 7:,On completion of the withdrawal of the
garrisons from Kelantan and Kuantan, the role
of the 9 Indian Division will be: —

(a) to protect the Line of Communication

Gemas—Kuala Lipis.

2 (b) to prevent the enemy repairing and

using the Line of Communication Kuala

+ Lipis—Kuala Krai.

(c) to form a reserve in the area Raub—

Bentong.

8. The 11 Indian Division should therefore,
if forced to fall back from its present position,
fight the enemy in South Perak under instruc-
tions to be issued by the Commander, 3 Indian
Corps, who will ensure that the operations of
the two divisions are co-ordinated.

9. The Commander, 3 Indian Corps, will
also be prepared for landings on the west coast
of Malaya. For this purpose a small naval
flotilla is being formed and will be based on
Port Swettenham.

to. A.I.F.—While retaining his main forces
for the defence of the east coast, the Com-
mander, A.I.F., will at the same time make
Preliminary arrangements to deal with (a) an
enemy advance down the main Kuala Lumpur
—Singapore road (b) landings by small enemy
forces on the west coast of Malaya.

11. C.A.A.D.—The C.A.A.D, will be pre-
pared to provide the maximum possible A.A.
protection for ships arriving with reinforce-
ments while they are unloading.

_12. Singapore Fortress—The Commander,
Singapore Fortress, will arrange for recon-
naissance of the north shore of Singapore
Island to select positions for the defence of
possible landing places.

14. There must be NO unnecessary with-
drawals. ;

15. Arrangements are being made by Head-
quarters Malaya Command to harass the
enemy’s communications.

Similar arrangements should be made by
subordinate formations whenever the oppor-
tunity offers. :

1. The operations on land in Malaya have
developed in a way which probably few of us
anticipated to the full before the war started.
There have been some norma] attacks by
formed bodies of the enemy, in which our
adversaries have not shown up to any special
advantage except that they have shown at
times fanatical courage. But the operations
have tended to develop more and more on
guerrilla lines. The enemy is trying to dis-
lodge us from our positions by flanking and
encircling movements and by attacks on our
communications. He has the advantage that
he is far less dependent on his communica-
tions than we are, and also that, being rice-
eaters, his soldiers are able to live on the
country for longer periods than are ours. As
I have said before, his Army is an Army of
gangsters, relying for success more on weaken-
ing the morale of the troops than on any par-
ticular skill with his weapons. All reports go
to show that, whereas his mortar fire is actually
accurate but not very destructive, his small
arms fire is generally wild and comparatively
ineffective.

2. I believe that our young and inexperienced
troops are now getting their second wind. I
am confident that, if well led, they will prove
their superiority over the enemy. We must
play the enemy at his own game. It is develop-
ing into a guerrilla war, so let us also adopt
guerrilla tactics. Formations should reduce
their transport as far as possible by sending
all vehicles which are not immediately wanted
well to the rear. Every platoon and section
should be taught to become both tank hunters
and Japanese hunters. The object must be to
destroy as many Japanese as possible and also
to destroy the morale by constantly attacking
him.
To do this we must have a good local intelli-
gence organization, Every unit at least should
have attached to it a Malay speaking and if
possible Chinese speaking local European who
should be able to build up a local intelligence
organization. Some of these have already been
made available: endeavours will be made to
supply others on application.

3. While our policy for the present is to keep
our forces in being as fighting formations this
does not mean that casualties must always be
avoided. Provided greater losses are inflicted
on the enemy, casualties can and should be
accepted within reasonable limits. The doctrine
to be inculcated into every officer and man is
that they must always be looking for a way
of getting at the enemy. If they are cut off,
they are well placed for attacking the enemy
from behind, and should make every effort
to do this before seeking to rejoin their own
unit.

Tf on the other hand the enemy succeeds in
getting behind us we must turn round and
fight him. It is a guerrilla war and must be
fought with guerrilla tactics,
