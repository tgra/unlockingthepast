The enemy was completely taken aback by this thrust into his rear areas, and although his line of communication troops fought hard, they were unable to do more than delay slightly our advance. By the afternoon of 3rd March, the garrison of Meiktila had been annihilated and 4 Corps had thus placed a brigade, which our air transport speedily built up into a division, squarely athwart the main enemy line of communication from his base at Rangoon to the fighting zone."

So far as they went, these results of our new policy of concentrating on one area were encouraging; but events soon showed that no lasting effect on the Germans had been achieved. When firing was resumed (apparently from Duindigt) on the 26th, no appreciable decline in its quality or quantity was apparent. Nor did the first of No. 2 Group's long-awaited bombing attacks, which was delivered on the 3rd March, have any better effect. The attack was delivered by 56 Mitchells, and the target chosen not without some misgivings since the continued presence of the Germans and their gear was doubtful  was the Haagsche Bosch.  Unfortunately the bombing was not sufficiently accurate, in consequence of which casualties occurred among Dutch civilians and their property was damaged. After this unhappy experience, Air Marshal Coningham decided to make no more attacks on targets at the Hague."

            "description": "222, Meanwhile we had been continuing our fighter-bomber offensive against the rocketfiring organisation and its communications. After the 3rd March we made no further attacks on the Haagsche Bosch, but turned our attention to the adjoining racecourse area at Duindigt, along with other storage and firing areas and a group of buildings belonging to the Bataafsche Petroleum Company, which apparently the Germans were using as billets and offices.  As before, we selected railway targets for attack when conditions were unsuitable for attacking our primary objectives. During the second week of March alone we dropped some 70 tons of bombs at Duindigt. By the middle of the month we had evidence that the Germans had abandoned the area, which was by that time so pitted with craters that, in the words of a contemporary report,  it looked as if Bomber Command, not Fighter Command, had been attacking it  . This success was accompanied by another temporary decrease in the scale of rocket attack on London; and what was, perhaps, more significant was that about this time the Germans took to doing more and more of their firing in the early hours before dawn. We concluded that our efforts had spoilt their arrangements for storing rockets in the forward area and that they were being forced to bring the missiles up at night and fire them off as soon as possible. Accordingly, during the second half of March we paid little attention to storage areas and devoted most of our fighterbomber effort to communications. Altogether we made more fighter-bomber sorties in March than in the previous four months put together, and dropped more than three times the weight of bombs dropped in February."

Progress was slow owing to minefields and road-blocks. Four miles east of Neghelli opposition was met and overcome, and Neghelli itself was occupied at 0830 hours on 21st March. No administrative arrangements could be made at that time to maintain troops in Neghelli, so the column returned to Dolo on 26th March. On 23rd March the Commander rath (A) Division had been ordered by me to do what he could to keep the enemy forces north of Neghelli engaged. By making a show of force in this area it was hoped to delay the withdrawal of enemy forces on the route Neghelli-Addis Abeba and thus to contribute to the success of operations being undertaken by rrth (A) Division in the Harrar-Auasc River area. ' Unfortunately this message was delayed and before receipt the Neghelli columns, which had never  been intended to stay, had been withdrawn. Accordingly, re-occupation was decided upon provided the necessary administrative arrangements could be overcome. A column of 3rd G.C. Regiment less two companies, one troop of E.A.A.C.

No enemy were reported near Neghelli but local riots were taking place-between Boran-and:Somaii tribesmen and punitive patrols had to be sent out to round up offenders.

By the end of February, it had pushed the enemy back over the Me Chaung and this obstacle was crossed on the 3rd March. 53 Brigade was carrying out extensive patrolling east and south of Ru-Ywa and several small clashes occurred. 2 (West African) Brigade continued its advance on An from the south-west, meeting only slight opposition, but experiencing great topographical difficulties. 74 Brigade after crossing the Me Chaung, pushed ahead towards Tamandu against considerable opposition. On the 4th March, with the aid of tanks, they overTan several enemy positions, the enemy's antitank artillery making no impression on our Shermans. After a sharp  but successful engagement in the vicinity of the road junction south of Tamandu they exploited northwards to the village, which they found derelict and deserted and which was proudly handed over to them by a naval party which had landed a few hours earlier. Severe fighting, however, continued east and north of Tamandu for some days until the enemy's fierce resistance -was broken by the combined efforts of 74 Brigade and the West Africans advancing from the north. On the 7th March 1 Brigade crossed the Dalet Chaung and occupied Dalet Village. Simultaneously, 4 (West African) Brigade crossed the Chaung further south and established itself in the hills five miles north-northeast of Tamandu. 2 (West African) Brigade had reached the Tamandu An road and established a block at the Me Chaung crossing."
