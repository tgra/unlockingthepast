Burma, I also ordered that the convoys con-
taining reinforcements which had been turned
back from Rangoon should again be diverted
towards that port.

I arrived at Magwe in Upper Burma on the
morning ,of ist March and held a conference
with the Governor, General Hutton and Air-
Vice Marshal Stevenson. There seemed io me
mo reason why Rangoon should not continue to
be held at least long enough to enable the re-
inforcements on the way, 63 Indian Infantry
Brigade and a field regiment, to be landed.
There was no evidence of any great enemy
strength west of the Sittang, the 7 Armoured
Brigade was still intact, and Chinese troops
were moving down towards Toungoo. I there-
fore gave instructions that any orders that
might have been issued with a view to the
evacuation of Rangoon should be cancelled and
directed that all ships with troops or stores for
Burma should proceed.

I flew during the afternoon with General
Hutton to Rangoon. On arrival there we
found a telegram from: the G.O.C. 17 Divi-
sion recommending the immediate evacuation
of Pegu. I motored with General Hutton to
Divisional Headquarters at Hlegu and found
that the report on which the Divisional Com-
mander’s recommendation was based had
proved a false one. The Divisional Com-
mander was obviously a sick man, and I
replaced him by Brigadier Cowan, who com-
manded the 17 Division with success for the
remainder of the campaign.

On 2nd March I visited the troops of the
17 Division and 7 Armoured Bngade on
the Pegu front and then flew to Lashio, since
IT had heard that Marshal Chiang-Kai-Shek
would be there. I had two satisfactory inter-
views with him that evening and next day
returned to India. At Calcutta I met General
Alexander, who was on his way to take over
command of the Burma Army, and instructed
him to hold on to Rangoon for as long as
possible.

While my intervention on this occasion post-
poned the evacuation of Rangoon for a week
and enabled reinforcements .of an Infantry
Brigade and a field regiment to be landed, it
eventually placed General Alexander in a diffi-
cult position and led to his forces being nearly
cut off, as described in his report. On balance
I am satisfied that we gained by the delay.

OpEraTions AFTER FALL OF RANGOON.

22. Once Rangoon had fallen, there was
comparatively little that G-H.Q. in India could
do to mfluence the operations in Burma.
Until the road from Assam was completed, re-
inforcements of personnel and stores could only
be sent in by air, and the number of transport
aircraft was extremely limited.

The chief requirement of the forces in Burma
at this time, British and Chinese, was air
support, which India was unable to provide in
the necessary strength. At first it was hoped
to maintain the ascendancy which our air forces
in Burma had so far held over the Japanese
in spite of great numerical inferiority. The
loss of the port of Rangoon, however, stopped
the flow of R.A.F. personnel and equipment
planned by the Air Ministry, and the loss of
the airfield organisation in Southern Burma
greatly affected air operations. Once Rangoon
had gone, the maximum force that could be

maintained in Upper Burma from the re-
sources available was one Bomber Squadron,
one Fighter Squadron and one Army Co-
operation Flight, in addition to one A.V.G.
Fighter Squadron. It was decided to form
also a mixed Wing of one Fighter, one Bomber
and one G.R. Squadron at Akyab. Shortage
of aircraft, however, prevented this Wing being
fully formed and with the exception of a few
obsolescent fighters, all the serviceable opera-
tional aircraft—fighters and bombers—were
absorbed by the formation of the Wing in
Upper Burma. This Wing was based at
Magwe, the only airfield left in Burma with
any degree of warning. On the 21st and 22nd
March, over a period of some 24 hours, it was
attacked by the enemy in force. The avail-
able Hurricanes and Blenheims had been en-
gaged in the early morning of the 21st against
an enemy concentration of aircraft at Minga-
ladon on which they had inflicted severe
losses. When the enemy retaliated only 12 of
our fighters were serviceable and able to take
off to engage the first raid. Although four of
the enemy were shot down and two were
damaged, the weight of attack got home. In
his attacks the enemy made Magwe tem-
porarily untenable for first-hne aircraft and
destroyed or rendered unserviceable 17 bombers
and fighters on the ground. The cause of this
reverse was our weakness in fighters, the failure
of the warning system and an almost complete
absence of aircraft pens and dispersal arrange-
ments. The loss of these aircraft, which con-
stituted practically the only air force available
at the time, and the withdrawal of the R.A.F.
to Lashio on the northern frontier of Burma
and Loiwing in China, several hundred miles
further north, made the support of the Burma
Army an extremely difficult problem.  Air-
craft were only reaching India in small
numbers, and it was essential to organise the
defence of Calcutta and of Ceylon. I had
reluctantly to decide that I must use the air
forces reaching India to build up a defence in
that country, and that I could not afford the
heavy losses that Japanese numerical
superiority, the lack of training of our air
squadrons, the,absence of a warning system
and the difficult flying conditions in Upper
Burma were bound to cause in an attempt to
give air support to the forces in Burma. The
Japanese air arm had ‘therefore almost a free
hand in the later stages of the Burma cam-
paign, and it was fortunate for us that they
failed to take full advantage of their oppor-
tunity.

23. I had little confidence in being able to
prevent the Japanese from reaching the Burma
oilfields at Yenangyaung or from occupying
Mandalay if they made a determined attack on
these objectives. We could not relieve or re-
inforce our troops of whom the majority had
been fighting continuously for some months in
difficult conditions, while the enemy had prac-
tically unlimited powers of reinforcing his land
and air effort. During March and April he
increased his forces in Burma by three divisions
and gradually drove .back the Chinese and
ourselves,

I hoped that we might still manage to retain
a hold on Upper Burma north of Mandalay and
a common front with the Chinese. I discussed
with General Alexander during a visit which I
