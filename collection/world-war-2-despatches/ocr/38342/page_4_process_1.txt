35. From 1000 hours onwards, the situation became confused in South Vaagso, where Group 2 were encountering strong opposition in the northern end of the town. The destruction of communications with the forward troops rend red control by the Flagship difficult.

that resistance was nearly overcome and that

demolitions were in progress.

41. As the majority of the industrial targets vad Been destroyed and as landing craft were becoming dispersed in ferrying wounded and Norw gian volunteers out to the ships and Yhight take some time to reorganise for withdrawal purposes, the Military Commander, in agreernent with the Naval Commander, ordered re-embarkation at 1250 hours.

42. The withdrawal of all proups was catried out without opposition. | The Firda factory, which was the last of the industrial targets, aid the Seternes Lighthouse were Jstholished before  the troops re-embarked.

- left the shore, and returned himself in the last

landing craft.

46. In considering the course of the operati n particular attention is drawn to the followitig factots which both had important bearings  on the course-of the fighting: in the first place,

1



the hampering, effect of the desire to comply strictly with the orders which had been issued to avoid all possible damage to Norwegian property; and in the second place; the conflicting claims of the comparatively short time limit imposed by the whole nature of the opera-_ tion, and of the restrictions on speed which are inherent in all street fighting but particularly when it is conducted against determined opposition. .

47. It here requires mention that the opposition was overcome, and all the demolition tasks completed, often under heavy enemy fire, well within the time limits laid down and that such results could not possibly have been obtained had it not been for the personal leadership of Lieutenant-Colonel J. F. Durnford-

 Slater, and for the sense of discipline, the

initiative and courage that was shown time and again iby junior leaders, both officers and N.C.0.s. .
