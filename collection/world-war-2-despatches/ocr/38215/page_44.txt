chance of re-establishing any measure of air
superiority.

255. As regards the relative strength of the
Land Forces, we knew from air reconnaissance
that Japanese ships had been steadily discharg-
ing at Singora and other ports, but the general
situation as regards the strength of the forces on
both sides remamed as stated in Section XXIII.

We had, however, now been informed that
we might .expect substantial reinforcements
during the month of January, the principal of
which were as under : —

(a) During the first few days of January.
—One Indian Infantry Brigade with attached
troops.

(b) About 13th-15th January —One
Brigade Group of the 18 British Division with
certain artillery units. These troops were
coming in large American liners, the safe
arrival and despatch of which were of the
utmost importance,

(c) Later in January.—The 18 British
Division (less one Brigade Group), one Indian
Infantry Brigade, some Australian and Indian
Reinforcements and certain other units.

256. The Hurricane Fighters were coming in
the same convoy as (b) above. This was there-
fore a most valuable convoy, the chief danger
to which lay in air attack from bases either in
West Borneo, in Malaya or in South Thailand,
or from aircraft carriers.. The scale of air attack
which the enemy could deliver would be much
increased if he could, before the arrival of the
convoy, establish his aircraft on the Kuantan
and Kuala Lumpur aerodromes.

257. In the west coast area the situation
appeared to be slightly improved. The new
6/15 Indian Infantry Brigade had had 10 days
in which to reorganize and to occupy the
Kampar position. The 28 Indian Infantry
Brigade, though on continuous front line duty,
had had no heavy fighting for the last 10 days
and was now also in position, The 12 Brigade
Group had, it is true, been continuously in
action since its arrival in the North and was
tired. A defensive position, to which to fall
back, was being prepared north of Tanjong
Malim The chief danger lay in the threat to
the left flank and rearward communications
from enemy forces which might either cross the
lower reaches of the River Perak or be landed,
from coastal craft, It seemed, however, that
the strength of such forces must be limited.

258. On the east coast the Kelantan Force
was resting in the area Kuala Lipis—Jerantut—
Raub covered on the North by Macforce which
was still operating on the railway north of
Kuala Lipis and on the South by detachments
watching the approaches through Pahang. In
the Kuantan area patrols had made contact
towards the end of December with enemy troops
moving South by the coast road in Trengganu
and the Kuantan Force had, in accordance with
instructions received from Higher Authority,
been re-disposed with the bulk of the force,
material and transport west of the River
Kuantan and with light mobile forces only
operating east of the river.

259. It was clear that the enemy intended to
continue his advance down the west coast as
rapidly as he could. He might also be expected
to attempt landings of small forces on the west

coast from the sea. On the east coast a com--
bined sea and land ‘attack against Kuantan
seemed possible, while the enemy might also-
deliver a seaborne attack against East Johore
or against Singapore Island direct. In this
connection a special landing-craft carrying ship
had been seen lying off Singora by our recon-
naissance aircraft. There remained also the
possibility of an airborne attack directed against.
our aerodromes.

260. As regards our own course of action, the
governing consideration was the safe arrival of
land and air reinforcements and time to de-
ploy them. An early withdrawal would enable
the enemy to establish his aircraft on the aero-
dromes at Kuantan and Kuala Lumpur before
the arrival of the mid-January convoys. In
consequence, it would make the task of bring-
ing in these convoys much more difficult.

To achieve our object of protecting the Naval
Base it Was necessary to fight the main battle
om the mainiand and it was hoped to be able
to deploy all the reinforcements due to arnve
in January for that purpose. Therefore the
longer we could delay the enemy in Central
Malaya the better. :

Further, there was a great deal of machinery
and large quantities of stores, both military and
civil, m the Kuala ‘Lumpur area. Time for the
evacuation of these was required.

I hoped to be able to hold the Kuantan aero-
drome for another ro days or so, which would
make it impossible for the enemy to repair
and organize the aerodrome before the middle
of January. Allowmg time for the Kuantan
garrison to withdraw and cross the Jerantut
ferry, this would mean that the west coast
force would have to hold the enemy north of
the Kuala Kubu Road Junction until about the
middle of January. That would mean that it
would have a depth of about 70 miles in which
to manoeuvre for 15 days.

With the above considerations in mind I
went north on the 30th December to discuss
with the Commander 3 Indian Corps and his
Divisional Commanders the details of the
strategy to be pursued.

261 Accompanied by the Commander
3 Indian Corps J visited the Headquarters
11 Indian Division at Tapah on the 31st Decem-
ber. The Divisional Commander reported that
the position at Kampar was satisfactory. As
regards future strategy, he expressed confidence
in his ability to hold the enemy north of the
Kuala Kubu Road Junction until at least the
14th January. He was therefore instructed that he
was not without permission to withdraw his
force beyond that road junction before the r4th
January, and that he was to continue to 1m-
pose the maximum delay on the enemy’s ad-
vance. I impressed upon all commanders the
importance of taking adequate measures to
prevent penetration by enemy tanks down the
main road—a danger which I considered a very
‘real one in-view of our complete lack of tanks
with which to counter it.

262. On the Ist January we visited the Head=
quarters 9 Indian Division at Raub. The
Divisional Commander reported that he had in-
structed the Commander Kuantan Force that
he should hold the Kuantan aerodrome for a$
long as possible, provided he did not thereby
jeopardise his force. He had indicated that the
aerodrome should be held for 5 more days if
