            "description": "The battle of 2nd November was the decisive action and it must have been that night that the enemy decided to withdraw. Indications of a withdrawal came early on 3rd November and increased as the day wore on. One armoured car regiment, the Royal Dragoons, had managed to pass round the enemy’s gun line in the dawn mist on the 2nd and was already raiding his communications and firing his dumps in rear; but the main body of our armour was still penned in to the east of the Rahman track. 7 Motor Brigade had made a night attack on the night of the 2nd in an attempt to cut through the gun screen across the track, due west beyond Tell el Aqqaqir, but the country was completely flat and the positions gained would have been untenable by day. At dawn, therefore, 8 Armoured Brigade tried another tack and moved south-west; here too it struck ground sown with mines and raked with anti-tank fire so that after slow progress it was again held up on reaching the Rahman track. 4/6 South African Armoured Car Regiment, however, managed to slip past and raced to join the Royals at El Daba. Meanwhile the full weight of our air attack was switched to the main road, where slow-moving, closepacked transport already in retreat presented excellent targets from Ghazal to Fuka.",

            "description": "' 15. The convoy should have rendezvoused with the destroyers ‘ESCAPADE, ISAAC SWEERS and MARNE in position 45° 50’ N., 26° 08’ W. at 0800 G.M.T. on 31st October. These destroyers had sailed from Ponta Delgada on 29th October and were joining as additional escort. Owing to the ‘incorrect receipt of a cypher message, the rendezvous was, however, missed, and ROTHER was detached a.m. 31st to look for them but was unsuccessful. ‘At 1815 on 1st Novembet, H.M. Ships CLEVELAND, ALBRIGHTON and ESKDALE were sighted northbound to join K.M.S. 2 and they reported having seen ESCAPADE earlier in the day steering south-east. ISAAC SWEERS and ESCAPADE eventually joined the screen at 1200 on 2nd November, and MARNE at 0800 on 3rd November.",
