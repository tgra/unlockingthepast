47. The distribution of Army Units was,
as a matter of fact, in a condition of perpetual
change to meet new situations as they arose,
and I must pay a very sincere tribute to the
flexibility of the Army organisation, and to the
tact, patience and loyalty of the Commander-
in-Chief of the Ant-Aircraft Command,
Lt®Gen. Sir Frederick A. Pile, Bart., K.C.B.,
D.S.O., M.C., which enabled these constant
changes to be made without disorganisation.

48. In theory the Commander-in-Chief,-
Fighter Command, was the authority respon-
sible for settling the dispositions of all guns
allotted to the Air Defence of Great Britain;
but this was little more than a convenient fic-
tion. The number of guns available was so
inadequate for the defence of all the vulnerable
targets in the country, and the interests con-
cerned were so diverse and powerful, that it
was not to be supposed that an individual
member of any one Service would be left to
exercise such a prerogative uninterruptedly.
A disproportionate amount of my time was
taken up in discussions on gun distribution,
and each decision was at once greeted with a
fresh agitation, until finally I had to ask that
all proposals should be discussed by a small
Committee on which all interests were repre-
sented, and I normally accepted the recommen-
dations of this Committee during quiet periods.
During active operations I consulted General
Pile, and we acted according to our judgment.

One rather important lesson emerged from
our experience, viz., that the general fire-con-
trol of all guns in the Air Defence System
should be vested in the Air Defence authori-
ties. I do not, of course, mean that, if an in-
vasion had taken place, the guns co-operat-
ing with the troops in the Field should have
been subordinated to any A.A. Defence Com-
mander, but the existence of ‘' free-lance ’’
guns*), the positions and even the existence
of which were unknown to me, was an appreci-
able han jicap, especially at night. It was im-
possible to acquaint them with the approach e
of enemy raiders, or of the fact that our own
aircraft were working in the vicinity.

49. When the night attacks on London began
to be really serious, General Pile, in consulta-
tion with myself, decided to send heavy rein-
forcements. Within 24 hours the defences to
the South and South-East of London were
approximately doubled, and the great increase
in the volume of fire was immediately noticed
and had a very good effect on public morale.
The physical effect in the shape of raiders
destroyed was by no means negligible, but the
main effect was never generally known. The
track of every raid was, of course, shown on
various operations tables, and on some nights
as many as 60 per cent. of the raiders
approaching London from the South turned
back after dropping their bombs in the open
country or on the fringe of the Barrage.

50. The A.A. Guns at Dover enjoyed
unusual opportunities for practice, with the
result that their crews became acknowledged
experts in the art of Anti-Aircraft Gunnery.
Their skill, however, was attained through the
circumstance that they and the Dover Balloon

* These guns belonged to Field Force Units. As
such units were, of necessity, highly mobile, their
exact location was not always known to Fighter
Command. Nor, after a recent move, were they
always included in the telephone system.

Barrage were continuously the objectives of
German attack; they manned their guns con-
tinuously night and day, and I must pay a
high tribute to their morale, enthusiasm and<
efficiency.

A report from the 6th A.A. Division, which
was busily and typically employed, is included
at Appendices C, C.A, C.B. and C.C.

51. A short Appendix (C.D) is added show-
ing the number of rounds fired per aircraft
destroyed, for the whole Anti-Aircraft Com-
mand.

52. On the map which constitutes Appen?
dix A.A. are shown the boundaries of Groups
and Sectors, and also the positions of the Bal-
loon Barrages, together with an indication of
the front covered by Radio Location Stations
and the area covered by the Observer Corps.

53. The Balloon Barrages had, at this stage,
had little opporturiity of justifying their exist-
ence, except perhaps at Rosyth and Scapa
Flow, since bombing attacks against land
objectives in Britain had not yet begun. It
was thought, however, (and later experience
confirmed this opinion), that the heavy cost
of their installation and maintenance, and their
drain on man-power, were on the whole justi-
fied. It is true that their material results, in
terms of enemy aircraft destroyed, were not
impressive, they suffered staggering casualties
in electric storms, and had brought down a
number of our own aircraft; on the other hand,
they exercise a very salutary moral effect upon
the Germans and to a great extent protected
the vital objectives, which they surrounded,
against low-altitude attacks and dive-bombing.

54. This is not the place to give an account
of the romantic discovery and development of
Radio Location. It may be explained, how-
ever, that the backbone of the system consisted
of a series of large ‘‘ chain ’’ stations at inter-
vals averaging about 30 miles. These gave
warning, by means of reflected electrical
echoes, of the presence of aircraft within the
radius of their effective action, which attained
to nearly 200 miles in the most favourable cir-
cumstances. The average effective radius was
about 80 miles, but they had the serious limita-
tion that they failed altogether ts give indica-
tions of aircraft flying below 1,000 feet.

55. To overcome this disability, which was
particularly hampering to operations against
low-flying minelayers, smaller units called
“C.H.L. Stations’? were included in the
protective line.

56. These had a restricted range (about 30
miles), and were incapable of giving heights
with any degree of accuracy; they were, how-
ever, extremely accurate in azimuth, and con-
stituted an essential feature of the Defensive
and Warning Systems.

57. The Radio Location system was growing
so fast and had to meet so many calls from
overseas that the training of the technical per-
sonnel and the maintenance of the elaborate
scientific apparatus presented great difficulties.
(n spite of these handicaps, however, the
system operated effectively, and it is not too
much to say that the warnings which it gave
could have been obtained by no other means
and constituted a vital factor in the Air
Defence of Great Britain.
