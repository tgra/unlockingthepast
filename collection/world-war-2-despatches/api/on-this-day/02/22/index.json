            "description": "39. Towards the middle of February it had become clear that the German infiltration into Roumania was likely to develop into a  drive  through Bulgaria, with Salonika as the preliminary objective. The Greek Government recognised this as a very real threat, but they were anxious to avoid any action originating from their territory which might precipitate events. Though they were continually calling for more air support, they did not accept the offer of British Troops until 22nd February when at a Conference held at Tatoi, attended by the King of Greece, Prime Minister Korysis (who had succeeded the late General Metaxas),"

            "description": "218. The full effect of the expansion of the   Big Ben   fighter-bomber force was seen in the second half of February, when Fighter Command made 548 sorties: and dropped 108 tons of bombs precisely the same weight in two weeks as in the previous six. At the suggestion of my Chief Intelligence Officer, who recommended that we should try the effect of concentrating our efforts on a single target for at least a week, nearly three-quarters of this bomb tonnage was aimed at the Haagsche Bosch; where severe damage was done, particularly on the 22nd February, when a film studio which the Germans used for storage was gutted. An almost complete cessation of rocket fire over a period of more than sixty hours followed this attack; and  on the 24th February photographic reconnaissance failed to reveal a single rocket anywhere in the square mile or so of wooded parkland that the Haagsche Bosch comprised. Other evidence strengthened the inference that the Germans had been driven from the Haagsche Bosch, at least for the time being, and suggested that they had been forced to improvise facilities in the racecourse area at Duindigt, further to the north."

The 22nd Brigade Group was ordered to proceed from Mabungo along a track which was marked on the map, but of the condition of which nothing was known, to,cut the toad to Mogadiscio some 18 miles east of Gelib. Meanwhile the Gold Coast Brigade Group was to advance south from Mabungo, and the Ist S.A. Brigade Group north from Ionte. This operation was carried out with complete success on 22nd February. All three brigades completed their tasks in an exemplary manner, but I must particularly mention the march, practically across country, of the 2and Brigade Group, which called for the greatest endurance and skill, and also the rapid manner'in which ist S.A. Brigade was able to fight its way north in the face of opposition, and be the first to enter Gelib at 1000 hours on the 22ndi February."

Combat Command  'B  and   Nickforce  both were placed under orders of U.S. 2 Corps. During 21st/22nd February   Nickforce   only just managed to hold on, but the German attack was halted finally by 1400 hours 23rd February. It had been a close shave. I then ordered 1 Guards Brigade across from Sbiba to Thala, but by the time it arrived the enemy had begun to withdraw."

The solution eventually adopted was first given expression in an appreciation of 22nd February and the plan there proposed was agreed on at an Army Commanders  conference at Caserta on 28th February. In essence it involved making Fifth Army responsible for the sea flank, including Anzio and the Aurunci Mountains south of the Liri, and bringing the weight of Eighth Army into an attack up the Liri valley. It would mean a great effort of regrouping and would take a considerable time. This would in any case be inevitable, for all troops in both Fifth and Eighth Anmies were exhausted and time was necessary, not only for them to be rested, but also for the arrival of reinforcements."
