Many of the German defenders were killed and many captured, and the salient was extended by about two thousand yards to include the whole of the Tell el Eisa ridge. 1 Armoured Division had been ordered to operate in a due westerly direction on the Australians’ left but they were unable to gain any ground. The enemy had succeeded in establishing a good defensive",
