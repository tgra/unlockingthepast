SUPPLEMENT To tHe LONDON, GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

One battalhon (2 Cambridgeshire) was sent to
Batu Pahat and one (5 R. Norfolk) was held
in Teserve at Ayer Hitam.

352. At about 0200 hrs. 16th January the’

leading Japanese troops crossed the River Muar
at a point a few miles upstream from the
town and by ogoo hrs. had reached the road
and established a block 2 miles east of Muar.
Dunng the morning some sharp fighting took
place in this area. At 1300 hrs. a further col-
lection of barges or landing craft appeared off
Muar, some of which were sunk by our artillery
fire. Continuous fighting went on throughout
the afternoon in the outskirts of the town. By
the evening of the 16th all troops of the 45
Brigade south of the river, except for the right
forward battalion, were concentrated in the
Bakri area and the Brigade Commander was
planning a counter-attack to recapture Muar.

Early on the 17th January the Commander
Westforce withdrew the 2/29 Bn. AI.F. from
the Segamat front and despatched it to Bakri
to meet the threat which was now developing.
It arrived in the afternoon,

353- The enemy’s attack from Muar, though
it had not yet been possible to assess the full
strength of it, obviously constituted a very real
threat to Westforce’s communications in the
Yong Peng area, for if the enemy could reach
the road there the whole of the Segamat force
would be cut off. I discussed the situation with
the Commander Westforce and the Commander
11 Indian Division at Rear Headquarters West-
force at 1200 hrs. 17th January. We were
loth to order an immediate withdrawal from
Segamat which we thought would be damaging
to morale and decided to strengthen the Yong
Peng-Muar front by every means at our dis-
posal. I arranged to make available 1mmedi-
ately the 2/z9 Australian Battalion from
Jemaluang, relieving it temporarily by the
reserve battalion of the 53 Brigade.

354. Early on the morning 18th January the
45 Indian Infantry Brigade, with the 2/29
Australian Battalion attached, was strongly
attacked by the enemy in its perimeter position
west of Bakri. Nine enemy tanks were
destroyed by the Australian anti-tank guns and
tank hunting platoons. The enemy cut the
road between this force and Brigade Head-
quarters situated a short distance to the east
but with the arrival of the 2/19 Australian
Battalion the situaton was restored. In the
evening the Japanese again attacked heavily
but were repulsed. .

On the afternoon of the 18th the enemy
landed a strong force on the coast a few miles
north of Batu Pahat.

355. Our Intelligence Service on this day
reported that the Japanese were advancing with
two divisions in front line, a Division of the
Imperial Guards being in the Muar area and the
5 Division on the main road. The latter was a
crack division which was known to have been
specially trained in. landing operations, The full
extent of the threat from Muar now became
clear. I félt that our chances of holding up
this thrust for any length of time were not great
and that a withdrawal from Segamat would
sooner or later ‘be forced upon us. I therefore
approved a proposal by the Commander West-
force on the eveningr18th January for an imme-
diate withdrawal behind the River Segamat as

1299

a preparatory step to a further withdrawal
should such become necessary.

356. At the same time, by agreement with
the Commander Westforce, I placed the whole
of the Muar front temporarily under the Com-
mander 3 Indian Corps. My reasons for this
were: — .

(a) I thought it difficult for the Commander
Westforce with his small staff to give the
close attention to the Muar front which the
dangerous situation there demanded as well
as controlling the operations on the Segamat
front some 70 mules distant. ‘

(b) It would obviously be necessary’ to
build up a supporting front west of Yong
Peng in order to keep open communications
both with the Muar and Segamat forces. This
could only be done by troops at that time
under command of 3 Indian Corps.

357. On the morning of the roth January
very heavy fighting again developed in the
Bakn area. The enemy again struck at our
communications destroying some transport
which was parked in rear of the defensive posi-
tion and blocked the road. About midday the
right forward battalion of. the 45 Brigade (4/9
Jats) which had remained detached was am-
‘bushed when rejoming the main force and
suffered heavily. Brigade Headquarters w
practically wxped out by a bomb. .

The Commander 53 British Brigade was now
made responsible for the Bukit Payong—Yong
Peng area, under 11 Indian Division, having
been relieved of his responsibility for Batu
Pahat. The 3/16 Punjab Regt of 11 Indian
Division was placed under his orders.

358. At z420 hrs, rgth January I held a
conference at Yong Peng at which the Com-
manders 3 Indian Corps, Westforce, 11 Indian
Division and 53 British Infantry Brigade were
present. The following orders were issued:— _

(a) The 53 Brigade Group to hold a posi-
tion from the bridge at Parit Sulong to the
high ground S.E. of the junction of the Yong
Peng—Muar and Yong Peng—Batu Pahat
roads.

(b) The 45 Brigade Group to be ordered
to withdraw at once through the 53 Brigade
Grotp to a position west of Yong Peng. _

(c) The Segamat Force to continue its with-
withdrawal. . ;

(d) The 22 Indian Infantry Brigade, on its
arrival at Yong Peng on the night 2oth-2rst
January from the Segamat front, to be at the
disposal of 11 Indian Division.

359. Events, however, anticipated the imple-
mentation of this plan, for on the afternoon of
the 19th January an enemy force attacked and
captured the defile east of Bukit Payong and
later occupied the bridge at Parit Sulong. An
attempt the following morning to recapture the
defile by counter-attack was only partially
successful, and eventually our troops took up
a defensive position at the west end of a cause-
way which crossed a marshy area a little further
east.

360. In accordance with the orders to with-
draw, sent by W/T from Westforce which was
the only means of communication then open,
the Muar Force started to concentrate on the
evening of 19th January but was attacked from
all sides and suffered heavily. Early onthe
zoth the withdrawal started, ‘the force -being
