SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON

would attempt to beach ship to form a lee to
try to improve conditions.

Simultaneously with this bad news the Vice-
Admiral received a signal from $.N.O. Dunkirk
to the effect that Dunkirk was being continu-
ously and heavily bombarded and that the
enemy artillery were gradually finding the range
of the loading berth. He stated he wished only
to enter ships which were necessary for the flow
of troops.

This latter signal fortified the Vice-Admiral in
his decision to suspend the sailing of personnel
vessels to Dunkirk until the accumulation of
those en route had been evened out.

55. One group of minesweepers who, up to this
time had been working continuous round trips
between Sheerness and La Panne, were diverted
to round trips /between Dunkirk beach and
Margate to compensate for the gradual drift of
troops westward along the Coast, and to com-

ensate for the reduced flow of troops off

unkirk Pier consequent on the artiHery bom-
bardment. At the same time, by using
Margate the duration of the round trip was
reduced. The Rear-Admiral, Dover, from off
the coast was instructed to run a paddle mine-
sweeper bows ashore on rising tide to be used as
a bridge, deeper draught ships coming to her
stern, if conditions were suitable. It was not
thought, however, that this would be an effec-
tive measure of bridging the gap between water-
line and off shore ships, as the length of a
paddle minesweeper was so small compared
with the length of the shallow water to be
traversed.

56. During the forenoon beaches at La
Panne were subjected to heavy artillery fire.
Action was taken with the R.A.F. Commands to
locate batteries shelling the beaches and Dun-
kirk pier and include air bombardment of these
positions in the R.A.F. protective measures
undertaken during the operation.

57. During the afternoon additional beach
Parties were sent out, and barges with provi-
sions, ammunition and water arrived at the
beaches during the day, and were grounded.
Two further drifters were despatched with
petrol, diesel oil and lubricants to the beach
area to refuel the inshore craft.

58. Arrangements were made to be ready to
embark Lord Gort and Staff from La Panne
1800 or later, by M.T.B. After 1700 weather
conditions off the beaches improved, particu-
larly as the tide rose and it appeared once more
possible to take effective quantities direct from
the beaches, and to use the special tows, ships
lifeboats, power lifeboats and tugs, which were
on passage from Ramsgate and which had been
earmarked for lifting the final covering force.

In the afternoon, however, it was learned that
the Military plan had been changed, and that it
was no longer possible for the original covering
position, as planned, to be held by 4,000 troops
who were then to withdraw to the beaches for
embarkation by boat. Instead, it was learned
that the Eastern-most Division was to be with-
drawn Westward from the La Panne area, and
that the special flight of boats was to be used
to lift this force from the beaches. At the same
time, the troops in the Bray and Malo sectors
were being thinned out by movements West-
ward towards Dunkirk itself. This change of
plan involved concentrating the special tows
and the minesweepers—to which they were
to transfer the troops—into the stretch opposite

the beach between Bray and one mile East of
La Panne and also advancing the commence-
ment of the operation by one hour. The risk
of this change of plan was obvious as the boat
tows were not in communication with the Vice
Admiral, and reliance had to be placed on the
Minesweepers to inform and see that the escort-
ing M.A.S.B.s would shepherd the tows to the
new positions. The minesweepers had anchored
so as to serve as guiding marks, as had been
explained to the Naval Officers in each tow.
Apart from the special tow, a very large
number of small power boats despatched, in
most cases direct, from the South East ports,
Newhaven to Sheerness, were arriving off the
beaches, and compensated in a large measure
for the heavy losses that had occurred amongst
the original towing boats, whalers, cutters, life-
boats and ships’ boats, which had occured on
the beaches during the preceding three days.
On the La Panne beaches after 1600 very
good progress was made. The piers of pontoons
built by the Military the previous day were
extremely useful, and were largely responsible
for the rapid evacuation of troops. All the
troops that could be found were embarked by
midnight and ferried off to the ships. The
local Beachmaster (Captain R. Pim, R.N.V.R.)
searched the adjacent beaches for stragglers at
midnight, and was informed by a Staff Officer
that no more troops would embark from the La
Panne beaches, but would march to Dunkirk,
as it was anticipated that these beaches would
be shelled and probably be in German hands
the following day. This, as it turned out, was
a correct forecast. The Beachmaster estimates
that 5,000-men were lifted from the La Panne
beaches during the evening and up to midnight.

59. At 1920 all ships in the fleets were in-
formed by the Vice Admiral that the final
evacuation of the B.E.F. was expected on the
night 1st/2nd June, and that the evacuation of
the French from Dunkirk and Malo beach
would continue from 1st June by both British
and French ships.

60. General Lloyd informed the D.M.O. of
the new plan, stating that General Alexander
had been placed in command of the final phase
of the evacuation. Composition of force not
known. Further, that it was impossible now
to say how long the French evacuation would
take but that the Alexander force would remain
till the last. No firm information could be
obtained from the French as regards : —

(i) The number of French troops to be
evacuated.

(ii) The nature and extent of French sea-
borne transport.

(iii) The French military plan for the
defence of the perimeter and the final with-
drawal of French troops.

61. General Remarks: The main features of
the day were:—

. (a) The increased enemy artillery activity
on Dunkirk and La Panne beach, and on the
approach channels.

(b) The set-back to evacuation from the
beaches that occurred during the choppy
weather of the forenoon, followed by an
excellent recovery in the afternoon and even-
ing when large numbers were lifted from the
beaches.

(c) The change in the military plan as re-
gards the locality and time of lifting the final
contingents of the B.E.F.
