The Director also acted as a member of the
Air Staff dealing with combined operations
questions, while the Miltary Member was an
oeS. part of the Staff Duties Directorate at

The responsibility for all traming for com-
bined operations passed to the Headquarters
Indian Expeditionary Force (I.E.F.) on its
formation in April 1943, but it soon became
apparent that this was not satisfactory. Force
commanders were only charged with training of
forces allotted to them for a specific operation,
whilst at G.H.Q. it was necessary that the future
policy governing combined operations should be
tormulated and preparations made to carry it
out. Moreover advice was constantly being
sought by my planning staff on combined
operations questions in connection with the
many plans under consideration.

An immediate re-organisation of the Combined
Operations Directorate was therefore essential
so’ that it could resume its proper® functions.
I took the first opportumty of discussing this
with the Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Fleet,
and early in August the Cifiefs of Staff approved
of a Rear Admural.as Director, and a Captain
R.N., a Brigadier, and an Air Commodore as
Deputy Directors of a reconstituted Directorate
of Combined Operations at G.H.Q. of the India
Command.

‘The responsibilities of the Directorate were
laid down, as follows: —

(a) In all matters of combined operations
to advise the Supreme Commander, South-
East Asia Command and Commander-in-
Chief, India, and to give direct counsel to
such other authorities as might be authorised
from time to time.

(0) To maintain close-liaison with the Chief
of Combined Operations and other D.C.O.’s
and. to disseminate doctrine regarding com-
bined operations.

(c) To guide all preliminary training in
combined operations. To control basic train-
ing for the assault, for all three services at
combined training centres and landing craft
wings of the R.I.N., including the training
headquarters and staffs in planning and pre-
paration of operations.

(d) To advise on the organisation and
equipment of all forces detailed for the assault
in a combined operation. This included
direct contact with the Semor Officer Assault
Ships and Craft.

(e) To advise on any special training re-
quired by troops to be landed over beaches.

(f) To arrange for the trial and develop-
ment of landing crafts and specialised equip-
ment for combined operations; to make recom-
mendations for their provision; and to develop
special technique in combined assault. These
matters were to be treated with particular
reference to the waters and terrain likely to be
encountered in operations in South-East Asia.

(g) To advise the Joint Intelligence Com-
mittee of ‘any special type of information re-
quired, or action to be taken in connection
with combined operations.

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 APRIL, 1948

18. Tramng for Combined Operations,

The provision of landing craft and stores for
combined operations, and the maintenance
of equipment were made the responsibility of
the Supreme Aled Commander, South-East
Asia Command.

The question as to whether the Director of
Combinéd Operations (India) should remain
under the Commander-in-Chief India or should
transfer to the South-East Asia Command was
also discussed at length, and it was agreed that
it was better that he should remain under the
Commander-in-Chief India, at any rate for the
time being. 7

Rear Admiral E. H. Maund was, appointed
by the Admuralty as Director on the 25th
August, and arrived in India on the 16th
October.

In the meantime future traiming policy had
not stood still.

The question of giving basic and refresher
training to amphibious divisions with their
naval and air components was investigated in
detail. There were two main problems. The,basic
and refresher training for those divisions in

_India, and the refresher training for those divi-

sions who must come to India from other places
before operations could be mounted. Two over-
riding factors affected these problems, the mon-
soon and the difficulty of moving large bodies
of’ troops over great distances on the already
overstrained railways of India.

We already had one combined training centre
on the West coast near Bombay. As training
had to be complete by early December of 1944,
a second centre was clearly necessary, and
Cocanada on the East coast, though by no
means ideal, was selected as the only practical
site available.

The Cocanada Training Centre was developed
to provide wet-shod training for an assault
brigade group and a beach group, together with
their quota of divisional, corps and army troops,
and their R.N. and R.A.F. components,

These two centres represented the limit of
India’s capacity in the matter of combined
operational training facilities. Even for the
second centre it was not possible to find in
India the requisite officers for the instructional
staff.* :

19. Manpower and Craft for
Operations.

As regards actual hands for the special for-
mations required, large numbers of Royal Navy
personnel entered the country during the period
of this Despatch. In addition the Royal Indian
Navy continued to train crews for landing-craft.

Originally the R.I.N. were to train sufficient
personnel for three assault brigade groups, but
it was found that landing craft crews for two
brigade groups was the most that could effi-
ciently be produced from India at the present
time.

Two -afloat exercises took place during
October and November whilst large “‘ wetshod ””
exercises ‘were prepared for December.

In the past our training had suffered from
lack of sufficient landing craft, but during the
period of this Despatch they came into the coun-
try in good number. There was still however

regarding collective training of amphibious formations
in both combined operations and jungle warfare.
