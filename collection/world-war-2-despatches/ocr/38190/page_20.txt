attack failed with twenty-one casualties (out
of a strength of twenty-five), .

At ogoo hours 21st December Major H.
Marsh reported from his machine gun ccm-
pany H.Q. at Little Hong Kong that the enemy
could be seen moving from Wong Nei Chong
Gap along the crest of the hill westwards. That
matters in that area had not progressed
favourably was evident when at 1025 hours I
jJearnt that out troops were being pushed back
North of Blacks Link* and Mount Cameron.
The Winnipeg Grenadiers now in positions on
Mount Cameron were ordered to hold on at all
costs.

93 A second air raid on the Peak District
developed at 0950 hours and a bomb of 500 lbs.
was dropped, amongst others, just below Jar-
dines Corner, entirely blocking the road and
cutting off communications with Volunteer
HQ except by telephone, by which means the
Observation Post Commander reported that
forty steam launches in line, with steam up,
were assembled two hundred yards off shore by
Kai Tak aerodrome. Unfortunately, at this
time Royal Artillery communications to observa-
tion posts were destroyed except the one to
High West, and from this observation post the
target was invisible.

94. At 1000 hours 21st December 2/14,

Punjab Regt. in the Garden Road-Kennedy
Road area were ordered to re-orientate them-
selves to face South East to cover a possible

break through from the Wanchai Gap direction. -

A section of machine guns was sent at once to
connect up by fire with the Wanchai Gap dis-
positions, at which place were located the HQ
of both West Infantry Brigade and the Winni-
peg Grenadiers. At the same time all garrisons
of 2/14 Punjab pillboxes on the North shore
were to be withdrawn to Battalion HQ—I
had now to take considerable risks on other
portions of the island defences in view of the
direct menace from the Mount Cameron area.

95. By 1100 hours the enemy had brought a
heavy mortar into action just off King’s Road
near the Power Station, with which they bom-
barded the R.N. Yard. They also bombed
Repulse Bay area and carried out a ground
attack on the Little Hong Kong area from the
direction of Aberdeen, thus threatening en-
circlement, at any rate temporarily, of that
important area in which was located the new
R.A.O.C. Magazine and the main bulk of the
remaining ammunition stock. The enemy hac
landed some troops near Causeway Bay, and
the housetops in that area were reported

“crowded with them.’’ At noon they were
pressing down King’s Road and had mounted
a gun at No. 163. At this time all the guns.
at the R.N. Yard were out of aceon following
a heavy bombardment.

96. (a) At midday 2zst December our
“line ’’ ran from Little Hong Kong area to
the Southern slopes of Mount Cameron. In the
former area were located two parties under
Major H. Marsh, 1 Middlesex Regt., and Major
A. J. Dewar, R.A.S.C., respectively. Major
Marsh had one officer (plus a R.A M.C. officer),
eighteen other ranks 1 Middlesex Regt., five men
of the Winnipeg Grenadiers and fourteen
Chinese of the Medium Detachment of the

* Blacks Link—the track leading from Wong Nei
Chong Gap to Wanchai Gap.

HKVDC, and was located in the ‘‘ Combined
Company HQ ”’ of the defence sub sector—one
company of the Winnipeg Grenadiers having
been withdrawn for the Wong Nei Chong Gap
counter attacks. Major A. J. Dewar, with
twenty naval ratings, placed himself under the
command of Major Marsh and was posted on
the high ground (Shouson Hill private houses)
covering the East flank. This “‘Island’’ of
defence resisted all attacks from 20th December
to the afternoon of 25th December and fought
very gallantly, as did also a simular isolated
detachment, viz , the administrative details on
“The Ridge’? under Lt.-Colonel R. A. P.
Macpherson.

(b) During the course of the morning I had
issued instructions to withdraw the Middlesex
machine guns from the pillboxes between Sandy
Bay and Aberdeen, and to put them on a
mobile basis as far as possible: a platoon at a
tame could be “‘ ferried,’’ even though the
transport situation was acute. The South West
sector of the island defence was therefore com-
pletely denuded—another undesirable but neces-
sary risk. A section of machine guns was now
sent to supplement the defences in the Aberdeen-
Bennets Hill area, under Commander H. C.
Millet, R.N. (retd.). A platoon was also sent
to the Officer Commanding 1 Middlesex Regt.,
for the Leighton Hull defences.

97. (a) Mortaring of North shore defences
continued at 1300 hours 21st December, and pill
boxes were subjected to accurate high velocity
shell fire from both Kowloon and positions on
their flank on the island. Pill box 59, for
instance received thirty direct hits, but the
Middlesex sergeant in command personally
upheld the defence, though withdrawing the
crew temporarily.

(b) Enemy craft were still ferrying back-
wards and forwards between Kowloon and the
Sugar Factory-North Point area.

(c) In the morning a motor torpedo boat had
evacuated from Stanley the Commanding
Officer of 5/7 Rayput Regt. and the remnants of
his battle HQ, and he now took over command
of the troops of 5/7 Rajput Regt. who were
fighting alongside 1 Middlesex Regt.

98. HKVDC (a) A report was received that
No. rt Company had had heavy casualties in
the Stanley Mound area and had lost all their
officers. The remains of the company had
rallied at Stanley. +

(6) The A.A. Lewis gun post of No. 6 Com-
pany (Portuguese) at ‘‘ Watson’s,’’ Causeway
Bay, reported that they had been captured by
Japanese, disarmed, and told to make off
towards our lines. They did so and rejoined
for duty.

99. 1330 hours. A Japanese destroyer,
escorting two merchant vessels, was sighted
South of Cheung Chau Island, heading for
Hong Kong.

I00. 1430 hours. (a) Two companies of
enemy occupied the whole length of Mount
Nicholson, and brought up a small gun.

(b) A. report was received from ‘‘ A ’’ Com-
pany Royal Rifles of Canada that the whole
company had moved. One platoon had
reached the ‘‘ Ridge ’’ and another platoon was
on Middle Spur though the enemy were still
firing from it. The situation at Repulse Bay
being so unsatisfactory, I ordered a senior
