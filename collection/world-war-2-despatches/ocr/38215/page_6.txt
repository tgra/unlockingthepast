In November, 1937, having, as G.S.O.I.
Malaya, made a careiul study of the problem
of the defence of Singapore, I prepared on the
instructions of the General Officer Commanding
(Major-General, now Lieut.-General Sir W. G.S.
Dobbie) an appreciation and plan for an
attack on that place from the point of view of
the Japanese. In this appreciation it was
pointed out (a) that, as a result of the political
situation in Europe, it was unhkely that the
British Fleet would be able to reach Singapore
in 70 days, (b) that in consequence, a more
deliberate form of attack could be undertaken.
The pian recommended consisted of pre-
liminary operations to seize the aerodromes in
South Thailand and in Kelantan, the Island of
Penang and the naval and air facilities in
Borneo, followed by the main operation to
capture Singapore itself. From this appreciation
deductions were made as to the main points in
the defence plan which required attention. These
deductions stressed the probability of the
Japanese making use of territory in South
Thailand, the increased importance of the
defence of North Malaya and of Johore, the
urgent need for the strengthening ‘of our Air
Forces and Local Naval Craft, and for more
infantry, and the unsatisfactory situation as
regards food stocks. A copy of the deductions
made is attached as Appendix’ A to this
Despatch. The Appreciation and deductions
were forwarded by the G.O.C. to the War
Office.

In May, 1938, General Dobbie in another
appreciation of the defence problem wrote:

“Tt is an attack from the northward that

I regard as the greatest potential danger to

the fortress. Such attack could be carried

out during the period of the north-east
monsoon. The jungle is not in most places
impassable for infantry.’’

He further stated that defensive positions
were being reconnoitred on the general line
Johore River—Kota Tinggi—Kulai—Pulai
River. Subsequently defences were constructed
on the west bank of the river north and south
of Kota Tinggi.

22. Development of the Defence Plan.—Up
to the summer of 1939 the defence policy con-
tinued to be based on the assumption that the
British Fleet would sail from Home waters
immediately on the outbreak of war with Japan
whatever the situation in Europe might be. It
was then, however, officially recognized that this
might not be possible. The ‘‘ Period before
Relief ’’ wag increased from 70 to 180 days
and authority given for reserves to be built
up on that scale. In August, 1939, the rath
Indian Infantry Brigade Group, which had
been held in readiness for this purpose, was,
in view of the threatening political situation,
despatched from India to Malaya.

23. In April, 1940, the G.O.C. (Lt.-Gen. Sir
Lionel Bond) submitted a new appreciation in
the light of the new situation and especially
of the increase of the period before relief from 70
to 180 days. In it he pointed out that the
Japanese could now afford to establish their
base at a much greater distance from Singapore
and possibly in South Thailand. He con-
sidered therefore that the northern frontier
might have to be held against a considerable
force for several months. He estimated that the
forces now required for the defence of Malaya

were of the order of 40 battalions (say 4
divisions) with 3 machine gun battalions and
2 tank regiments. He realised that it would be
impossible at that time to provide this force,
and suggested, as an alternative, that the Royal
Air Force ‘‘ could and should be made abso-
lutely responsible, if not for the detection and
destruction of a Japanese expedition before it
landed, at least for ensuring that no base can
be maintained and no line of communication
can be operated within striking distance of our
aerodromes.”’ If this could be done, he esti-
mated that the land forces then required would
be in the nature of 25 battalions with support-
ing arms, which should include 3 anti-tank
batteries and one company of armoured cars or
tanks.

It was at this time that the problem, which
had hitherto remained one of the defence of
Singapore Island and of a portion of Johore,
developed, as had appeared inevitable as early
as 1937, into one of the defence. of the whole
of Malaya. The G.O.C. asked for official con-
firmation of this. The problem was further com-
plicated by the collapse of France in June, 1940,
the immediate result of which was that Malaya
was exposed to a greatly increased scale of
attack,

24. In August, 1940, the Chiefs of Staff, in
their Far East Appreciation, officially
recognised that both the fundamental assump-
tions of the C.I.D. 1937 Appreciation had
broken down because it was now impossible to
send the Fleet to the Far East, and the
Japanese advance southward, the development
of communications and of aerodromes in
Thailand, and the increased range of aircraft,
had all contributed to the development of the
overland threat to Malaya. The necessity for
holding the whole cf Malaya, with reliance
primarily on Air Power, was now recognised.
It was laid down that the réle of the land forces
was to be (a) The close defence of the naval
and air bases, (b) Internal security, (c) To deal
with any enemy land forces which might
succeed in gaining a footing despite the action
of the Air Force. Until the necessary air forces

could be provided, their absence must be made *

up for as far as possible by the provision of addi-
tional land forces. It was estimated that a
minimum of 336 ist Line aircraft would be
required for the defence of Malaya and British
Borneo, and for trade protection in the north
east half of the Indian Ocean. It was laid down
that the aim should be to complete this pro-
gramme by the end of 1942. It was considered
that, when this target was reached, the total
land garrison required would be the equivalent
of 6 brigades with ancillary troops. Meanwhile
approximately three divisions would be neces-
sary. It is to be noted that this appreciation
was made before the entry of the Japanese into
Indo-China. The Commanders in Singapore
were instructed to make a tactical appreciation
based on the Chiefs of Staff strategical appre-
ciation.

25. In September, 1940, the Japanese occu-
pied the northern portion of Indo-China,
thereby greatly increasing the threat to
Singapore. In fact, the whole conception of
the defence problem had again been changed
because a Japanese invading force, instead of
having to be transported all the way from
Japan, could now be concentrated and pre-
pared within close striking distance of Malaya.
