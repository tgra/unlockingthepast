SUPPLEMENT To THz LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

Disposition of Opposing Forces*

When the attack opened the forces under
Kesselring’s command totalled twenty-six Ger-
man divisions and two Italian; they were
fairly well up to strength, for drafts in June,
July and August amounted to some sixty
thousand. There had been certain changes in
the order of battle, At the end of July the
Hermann Goering Panzer Division, which had
been active in the Mediterranean theatre ever
since it was formed, and first saw service in
Tunisia, had been withdrawn to the East Prus-
sian front. To replace it Kesselring received,
in August, 98 Infantry Division which had been
re-forming in the Zagreb area after its severe
losses in the Crimea. In August two more
mobile divisions, 3 and 15 Panzer Grenadier,
were withdrawn for the western front; the two
infantry divisions to replace them did not arrive
until September. The Allied invasion of
Southern France added two more German divi-
sions to the order of battle in Italy, 148 In-
fantry and the 157 Mountaint Divisions. These
were originally in Nineteenth Army but the
rapid advance up the Rhone cut them off from
their parent formation and they fell: back on
the Maritime Alps, coming under Kesselring’s
command, This invasion had, in its early
stages, had the effect of weakening the forces
opposing us. On getting wind of the prepara-
tions for the assault, which it was impossible to
conceal, Kesselring decided that the blow was
about to fall on the Ligurian coast. He there-
fore hastily moved go Panzer Grenadier
Division to Genoa. It arrived there on 13th
August, but when the real invasion came, two
days later, it was re-directed to the Franco-
Italian frontier.

In the two armies opposing us on the main
battle front there were nineteen divisions.
Tenth Army held the eastern half of the line,
from the Adriatic to the inter-army boundary
just west of Pontassieve, with LXXVI Panzer
Corps left and LI Mountain Corps right; these
Corps Headquarters had recently exchanged
sectors. LXXVI Corps, from the sea to the
area of Sansepolcro, had three divisions for-
ward and two in reserve, all infantry and one,
the -71st, at only half strength. 278 Infantry
Division, on ‘the seaward flank, after fighting
a continuous withdrawal all the way up the
Adriatic coast since June, had been badly
shaken by the Poles in the heavy fighting from
Ancona to the Metauro. Of, the two divisions in
reserve 162 (Turkoman) Infantry Division was
not of high quality but ‘the other was the
famous 1 Parachute Division. This was resting
in the rear of 278 ‘Division on the coust and it
was intended that the latter should withdraw
through it for a badly needed rest in a quieter
sector of the line. The mountainous sector of
LI Corps, from Sansepolcro to Pontassieve,
was held by five infantry divisions, mainly
those which had suffered most in the retreat
from Rome, such as the 44th, 114th and 334th.
There was one infantry division, the recently
arrived 98th, in Army reserve near Bologna.
Fourteenth Army, from Pontassieve to the
coast, had eight divisions, also divided between
two Corps, I Parachute left and XIV Panzer
right with the inter-Corps boundary at Em-
poli. The former had 4 Parachute and two
infantry divisions, the latter 26 Panzer, 16 S.S.

Panzer Grenadier and one infantry division.
Armmy reserve consisted of 29 Panzer Grena-
diers, north of Florence, and 20 Luftwaffe Field
Division, which had now finally absorbed the
remains of 19 Division, on the coast between
the western end of the ‘‘ Gothic’’ line and
Viareggio.

It is more difficult to adduce these disposi-
tions as a definite proof of the success of our
cover plan than in the case of the spring
offensive but they do show a tendency to
concentrate on the defence of the central sector
rather than the east coast. Particularly signi-
ficant is the fact that, of the three divisions
in Army reserve, one was near Bologna and
a second, the only mobile reserve, was between
Florence and Bologna.* The enemy’s order
of battle on the east coast was not impressive
except for the parachutists and the event soon
showed that it would need heavy reinforce-
ments if this sector of the front was to be
held. It also showed, unfortunately, the in-
evitable limitations of any cover plan: the two
sectors which alone it was logical to threaten
were, on the German side though not on our
own, so closely connected by good lateral com-
munications that reserves intended for the one
could very rapidly be diverted to the other.

In northern Italy the Italians were now com-
ing a little more into the picture. Marshal
Graziani, Commander-in-Chief of the Fascist
Republican Forces, was given command of a
mixed Italo-Germany ‘‘ Army of Liguria” of
two Italian and twoand a halfGerman divisions.
With these he was responsible for the coast
from the French frontier to Spezia; the more
important sectors, on the French border and
covering Genoa and Spezia, were held by
German troops. After the Allied invasion of
France this command was increased by the
addition of the two divisions from Nineteenth
Army and 90 Panzer Grenadier Division, rais-
ing the Army of Liguria to a total of seven
divisions. It played, however, a purely defen-
sive réle throughout. In the north-east, under
Army Group command, the Germans had a
reserve mountain division and one infantry
division, the 94th, which was re-forming after
its serious losses.

Against these forces we had twenty divisions
and eight brigades. Eighth Army accounted for
eleven divisions, all but two of which were in
the three attacking Corps. On the right was
the Polish Corps with 3 and 5 Divisions and
an armoured brigade along the Metauro from
the Adriatic on a front of about seven miles.
Next, on a narrow front of just over two miles,
covered by a screen of Polish units, was the
Canadian Corps with x Infantry and 5
Armoured Divisions, supported by a British
tank brigade. To the west, covering about
twenty miles of front, was 5 Corps, the
strongest of the -attacking Corps, with two
infantry divisions, 46 and 4 Indian, in the
line and 1 Armoured and 4 and 56 Infantry
Divisions, plus two armoured brigades, in re-
serve. 10 Corps covered lightly, with zo
Indian Division and a mixed brigade group, the
area stretching from the upper Tiber valley to
the Army boundary on the Pratomagno. In
Army reserve was 2 New Zealand Division, to

*20 Luftwaffe Field Division was not a very
important reserve and its location is irrelevant to the
problem. 90 Panzer Grénadier -Division, before its
move to the north-west, had been resting west of
Bologna. ; ;
