- 7. The breakdown ‘of, H.M.S. IMPERIAL’s
steering ‘gear was a bitter misfortune which car-
ried ..disaster in its train. The handling” of
H-M:S.' HOTSPUR ‘in ‘embarking ‘and carry-
ing’ a total ‘of goo ‘men must’ have’ | been
admirable. *

8. As a. direct. “result. of f this delay, Force
B and the Royal Air Force fighters failed
to make contact at daylight.” The force was
consequently exposed, starting only a few
miles from the enemy’s air. base in Scarpanto,
to the full weight of enemy air attack without
any air support, ‘until the first of our fighters
eventually gained contact at 1200.

The “consequence of ‘this unhampered_on-
slaught of aircraft .was the loss of H.M.S.
HEREWARD and the damage. to H.MS.
ORION and H.M.S. DIDO (paragraphs Io to
15). The -difficult decision to leave H.M.S
HEREWARD to her fate was “undoubtedly
‘ correct, and it is at least some consolation that
a large proportion of those on board survived.

9. This disastrous voyage left the Com:
mander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, in a most un-
- pleasant quandary. Of the 4,000 troops em-
barked in Force B no ‘Jess than: 800 had
been Killed, wounded or captured, after leaving
Crete. If this was to be the scale of casualties; it
appeared that, quite apart from our own pros-
pective losses of ships and men, who could ill be
spared, our efforts to rescue the Army from
capture: might only lead to the destruction of
a.Jarge proportion of the troops.. It was only
after long and anxious consideration that the
= to continue the evacuation .could be

: taken.

10. The decision to tontine; once taken, was
amply justified, for the remainder of the evacua-
tion proceeded almost without casualty’ to per-
sonnel. Fighter protection became steadily
more effective and the enemy less enterprising :
his failure to interfere with the hightly embarka-
tion at. Sphakia was most surptising,, “and
reminiscent of the Greek evacuation.

covering’ her survivors and did’ well to save,
so Many.

147 The deehition’ “to attempt ‘no *furth ef
evacuation on the" night rst/2nd ‘June (par
graph 51) was made ‘with the greatest ae:
ance, but with dwindling forces and men ahi
machinery at the point of exhaustion, a facthee
attempt’ when ‘the forces had‘ already been
ordered to’ surrender could not.be justified. It -
was particularly galling that a large propor-
tion of the men ‘left, to surrender consisted of.
the Royal Marines, who had a Souighe so Gallant
a “rearguard action. .

15. Wheie so much fine service ‘was per-
formed it is difficult, as ever, to pick out indivi-
dual acts of merit. Reference must be made
however to, the: fearless judgment’ and gallant
beariig of Rear Admiral’ H. B. Rawlings,
O.B.E.,’ the Rear Admiral Commanding,
Seventh Cruiser Squadron in extricating his
shattered squadron on the 29th May and in
bringing it safely to harbour.

The co-operation and understandin; A Major
General J. F. Evetts, C.B., C.B.E .» who
was attached to me ‘for the evacuation poe
were a source of ‘great strength at this time..
Group Captain C. B. R. Pelly’s untiring zéal
was of the utmost value.. -

16. ‘The beating and discipline of dificera and,
men of all services in this ordeal was a source:
of inspiration. In particular the behaviour of
men in the crowded ships of Force B on
the 29th May was most notable in the face, of
the -hammering they endured.

17. I had occasion-to remark at the con-
clusion of my despatch on the first phases of,

the Battle of Crete, that I never felt prouder -

of the Mediterranéan Fleet except during those
trials ‘which it was about to undergo... The-trials:
in question are described i in this narrative ‘of the

final ‘phase.

It is not easy to convey how heavy was the
strain that men and ships sustained. Apart,
from’ the cumulative effect of prolonged sea-

going over, extended periods: it has ‘to be '

remembered that in this jast instance ships’ com-
panies had none of the inspiration of battle with

‘the enemy to’bear them up. Instead they had the

unceasing anxiety of the task of trying to bring
away in safety, thousands of their own country-
men, many of whom were in an exhausted and
dispirited condition, in ships necessarily so over-
crowded that even. when there was opportunity
to relax conditions made this impossible. They
had started the- evacuation already over tired
and they had to carry it through under condi-.
tions of savage air attack such as had only re-
cently caused grievous losses in the fleet.

There is rightly little credit or glory to be -

expected. in these operations’ of rétreat but I
feel that the spirit of tenacity shown -by those
who. took part should not go‘ unrecorded.

-More than once T felt that the stage had been
reached when no more could: be asked of officers
