BATTLE OF MATAPAN.

The following Despatch was submitted to the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on the
11th November, 1941, by Admiral Sir
Andrew B. Cunningham, G.C.B., D.S.O.,
Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Station.

Mediterranean,
11th November, 1941.

Be pleased to lay before Their Lordships the
attached reports of the Battle of Matapan, 27th-
30th March, 1941. Five ships of the enemy
fleet were sunk, burned or destroyed as per
margin.* Except for the loss of one aircraft
in action, our fleet suffered no damage or
casualties.

2. The events and information prior to the
action, on which my appreciation was based,
are already known to Their Lordships. Long
and: anxious consideration had been given to
the disposition of available forces, important
factors being the necessity to maintain the flow
of ‘‘ Lustre ’’{ convoys to Greece, and the
difficulty of findi:
fleet operation when demands for convoy
escorts were so heavy.

The disablement of H.M.S. YORK at Suda
Bay at the outset of these deliberations was a
serious blow.

3. The disposition described in paragraph 7
of the Commander-in-Chief’s narrative was
adopted with the intention of countering a
possible cruiser raid into the Aegean. It was
designed to give flexibility and allowed for a
quick change of plan if more intelligence came
to hand to clarify the situation.

I was concerned to avoid any movement
which might alarm the enemy and cause him
to defer any operation he might have in mind.
To allow a state of suspense to continue, with
Operation ‘‘ Lustre ”’ in full swing, would have
imposed an increased strain on the light forces
of the fleet.

4. The disposition originally ordered left the
cruisers without support. The battlefleet could
if necessary have put to sea, but very
inadequately screened. Further consideration
led to the retention of sufficient destroyers to
screen the battlefleet. The moment was a
lucky one when more destroyers than usual
were at Alexandria having just returned from
or just awaiting escort duty.

5. It had already been decided to take the
battlefleet 1o sea under cover of night on the
evening of the 27th, when air reconnaissance
from Malta reported enemy cruisers steaming
eastward p.m. /27th. The battlefleet accordingly
proceeded with all possible secrecy. It was
well that it did so, for the forenoon of the 28th
found the enemy south of Gavdo and the Vice-
Admiral, Light Forces (Vice-Admiral H. D.
Pridham-Wippell), ‘with Force ‘“‘B’’* in an
awkward situation which might have been
serious had the support of the battlefleet been
lacking.

6. The situation at o812 (Diagram No. 1),
when surface contact was first made did not
appear unsatisfactory although in fact at this
time Force ‘‘B’’ was very uncomfortably
placed with a second and powerful enemy
cruiser squadron out of sight to the north-east
and well placed to cut Force “B”’ off from
the battlefleet. This squadron had actually
been sighted and reported by H.M.S. GLOU-
CESTER'’S spotting aircraft (see paragraph Io
and Report of V.A.L.F., paragraph 11) but
fortunately for everybody’s peace of mind this
report did not get beyond H.MS.
GLOUCESTER’S T.S.} (see diagrams 1 and 2).

7. Aircraft from H.M.S. FORMIDABLE had
sighted and reported a further force to the
northward of the cruisers and in one case had
reported battleships, but the situation was not
very clear. The aircraft were not at this time
using duty letters which made for confusion:
previous experience had taught us how often
cruisers of the Italian Navy are reported as
