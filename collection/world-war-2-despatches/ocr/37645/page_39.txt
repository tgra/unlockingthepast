SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON

covering Gelib. In addition enemy communica-
tions in Gelib itself were kept under fire by
60 pdrs, This ruse was entirely successful.
Many casualties were inflicted by this bombard-
ment and the enemy had to change his L. of C.
in this area.

By the morning of the zoth pontoon bridges
of improvised bridging material had been estab-
lished both at Ionte and at Mabungo and I was
in a position to bring up the xrzth (A) Division,
and place them close up behind the bridgehead
at Mabungo preparatory to advancing on
Mogadiscio should the attack across the river
be successful. Before this advance could take
place it was essential that Gelib should be taken,
and I instructed the Commander of the z2th
(A) Division to carry out an operation with this
in view. Meanwhile the rst S.A, Brigade had
crossed the river at Ionte and were directed to
cut off Giumbo. This operation was carried out
with considerable skill, and entailed-an arduous
march across the peninsula‘to the sea. Practi-
cally the whole of the garrison at Giumbo
capitulated, those fhat did not proceeded on
foot along the sea coast towards Modun, and
were taken prisoner later.

55. The plan of the Commander of the 12th
(A) Division for the capture-of Gelib was
as follows. The 22nd Brigade Group was
ordered to proceed from Mabungo along a track
which was marked on the map, but of the con-
dition of which nothing was known, to,cut the
toad to Mogadiscio some 18 miles east of Gelib.
Meanwhile the Gold Coast Brigade Group was
to advance south from Mabungo, and the Ist
S.A. Brigade Group north from Ionte. This
operation was carried out with complete success
on 22nd February. All three brigades com-
pleted their tasks in an exemplary manner, but
I must particularly mention the march, practi-
cally across country, of the 2and Brigade
Group, which called for the greatest endurance
and skill, and also the rapid manner'in which
ist S.A. Brigade was able to fight its way north
in the face of opposition, and be the first to
enter Gelib at 1000 hours on the 22ndi February.

56. I wish to commend Major-General
Godwin Austen for the skilful plan which he
made for the crossing of the river, and the care-
ful instructions he gave for its implementation.
The battle of the Giuba undoubtedly dealt the
enemy a blow from which he never recovered,
and laid the foundation for subsequent
successes.

57. During this day enemy forces from
Bardera counter-attacked the bridgehead at
Mabungo which was held by the 2nd Nigeria
Regiment of 11th (A) Division. The counter-
attack was not pressed home, was easily beaten
off, and did not interfere with my plans of
passing the rth (A) Division across the bridge.

58. At this time I became aware that the
enemy had committed practically the whole of
the forces facing me to the defence of the river,
and very little was left between the river and
Mogadiscio. Some thousands of prisoners had
been taken; it was known that whole units were
dispersing into the bush, and the orders and
counter-orders given by the enemy were indica-~
tive of extreme confusion. I felt sure, therefore,
that in view of the disorganised state of the
enemy, I would have little difficulty opcratin:
northwards to Harrar after Mogadiscio ha
been captured.
road from Mogadiscio to Harrar was 804 miles,

Although the distance by |

I found that by denuding the troops left on the
Kenya front of transport, I would just be able
to use a force of three brigades against Harrar.
I therefore cabled on 2and February to the
Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, pointing out
that as the rains in this area arrived later than
in Kenya, I would be able to continue opera-
tions, and that I thought I could capture Harrar
by the end of the first wéek in April. Permission
to continue was duly received.

59. At 0600 hours on the 23rd February the
z1th (A) Division with the 23rd Nigerian
Brig.’e and the 2and E.A. Brigade under
command, began their advance from Mabungo
to Mogadiscio, and that evening after a sharp
fight, elements of the 22nd Brigade occupied
Modun, and the next morning Brava. The rst
S.A. Brigade was placed in Force reserve and
directed to Brava, and it was my intention that
the rath (A) Division should move northwards
via Bardera and Iscia Baidoa. Unfortunately
owing to administrative difficulties connected
with the amount of supplies which could be
Janded at Chisimaio, I was not able to advance
in this direction till a few days afterwards, The
revised Order of Battle is shown in Appendix
“Dp”,

60. On 24th February the Nigerian Brigade
Group which was destined to lead 11th (A)
Division passed through 22nd E.A. Brigade
at Modun and Brava. Merca was captured on
asth February after encountering some opposi-
tion. That same evening some light forces of
the rzth (A) Division entered Mogadiscio,
having been unopposed for the final 20 miles.

The distance covered by the Nigerian Bri-
gade Group between o600 hours 23rd February
and 1700 hours 25th was 275 miles.

61. H.M.S. Shropshire carried out a most
effective ‘bombardment of enemy camps and
dispositions near Modun cross roads on the
day previous to its capture. Observation for
the ‘bombardment was undertaken by an
S.A.A.F. Glen Martin aircraft, the observer of
which had fortunately been previously in-
structed in spotting for naval gun fire. That
a large number of casualties were caused
during this bombardment was confirmed subse-
quently on the capture of Modun.

62. About this time all indications showed
that the enemy had left Bardera and that rorst
Division was withdrawing northwards. I was
still not able to operate strong forces from 12th
(A) Division, but ordered the Commander to
move light forces to Bardera, Dolo and Lugh
Ferrandi. These operations were undertaken
quickly. Bardera was occupied on 26th
February, Iscia Baidoa on 28th February,
Lugh Ferrandi on 3rd March, Dolo on 5th
March. A further number of prisoners were
taken including the commander and staff of
2oth Colonial Brigade. It transpired that the
whole of the African personnel of this brigade,
some 3,000 men, had dispersed into the bush.

63. The policy of breaking the crust and
then motoring straight on, regardless of what
was happening in rear, was fully justified in
the result, though in face of a more deter-
mined enemy, counter-attacks against our
Tear and communications: would doubtless have
been troublesome. ,

Shortage of water and difficulties of supply
in the hot bush country over which our ad-
vance took place worked their effect on the
Italian units which had been left behind, the
