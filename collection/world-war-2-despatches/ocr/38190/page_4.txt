often short of water and hot meals. Whether
Royal Navy, Royal Air Force, Royal Artillery,
Royal Engineers, Royal Signals, Infantry or
members of the ancillary services, one and all
played their part fully in the true traditions
-of the services.

The casualties suffered and those inflicted on
the enemy speak for themselves.

In closing my despatch I wish to pay a
‘special tribute to the Hong Kong Volunteer
Defence Corps. They proved themselves to be
a valuable portion of the garrison. In peace
they had surrendered: a great deal of their leisure
to training, their mobilization was completed
smoothly and quickly, and in action they proved
themselves stubborn and gallant soldiers.
To quote examples seems almost invidious but
I should like to “place on record the superb
gallantry of No. 3 (Eurasian) Company at
‘Wong Nei Chong Gap and of No. 1 Battery who
undertook infantry defence in the Stanley area,
while the efficiency and gallantry of their Signal
section and despatch riders were outstanding.

My thanks and deep appreciation are also
due to H.E. The Governor who was a tower
of strength to me in our trying ordeal; and
similarly I must place on record my admira-
tion for all the members of his civil defence
services who displayed magnificent fortitude
and energy in their multitudinous activities.

APPENDIX A.

WAR NARRATIVE,

This War Narrative of the defence of Hong
Kong is built up on the detailed record of Battle
(Fortress) HQ kept at the time, minute by
minute.

In some cases, where subsequent knowledge
of facts has made it possible to insert items
to make a clearer picture, this has been done
in the text, but care has been taken not to in-
clude anything which would have a bearing on
possible decisions which might have been taken.
Frequently subsequent knowledge has been in-
cluded in footnote form only. This despatch
was compiled in a Prisoner of War Camp under
constant fear of observation or search and with
no clerical facilities. All maps, plans, schemes,
orders, etc., were destroyed on capitulation and
the officers and men marched to Shamshuipo, a
distance of 5 miles, and were permitted to take
only what they could carry on the person, The
Fortress HQ War Diary was concealed and
brought away. Cross checking has taken place
where possible with survivors, but the Canadian
troops were moved early to another camp and
no visiting was allowed to hospitals, hospital
camps or Indian camps. The timings are based
on Hong Kong winter time then in force.

Part I,

Own Forces—Before the outbreak of war with
Japan.

1. On the outbreak of war with Germany the
garrison consisted of three infantry battalions
and one machine gun battalion which permitted
the employment of only one infantry battalion

on the mainland; its role was to cover a compre-
hensive scheme of demolitions and to act as a
delaying force.

‘With the arrival on 16th November, 1941, of
two Canadian battalions a new defence plan
was brought in which had been originally out-
lined in 1937. It had never been fully practised,
as troops had never been available in sufficient
numbers. It employed three infantry battalions
on the mainland on a front of 10} miles—the
so called ‘‘ Gindrinkers Line ’’ sited on very
commanding country but with certain inherent
weaknesses. It had necessarily little depth,
which in two localities was particularly dan-
gerous, viz., Customs Pass and the Pass between
Golden Hill and Laichikok Peninsula.

2. Owing to the extensive front, each bat-
talion’s layout consisted of a line of platoon
localities, the gaps between which were covered
by fire by day and by patrolling at night. One
company only of each battalion could be kept
in reserve and this was normally located in a
prepared position covering the most dangerous
line of enemy approach, The reserve company
of the centre battalion (2/14 Punjab Regt.) was
employed initially as ‘‘ Forward Troops ’’ on
the Taipo Road to cover the demolitions and
to delay the enemy’s initial advance.

3. Directly the news arrived of reinforcement
by two Canadian battalions, reconnaissance was
carried out by commanding officers only, in
order to maintain secrecy. The existing garrison
carried out detailed reconnaissances down to
platoons later, and worked out the exact
defence plan for holding the Gindrinkers Line.
A considerable amount of work was found to be
necessary, for (except for the centre sector) the
line was in its partially completed form of three
years previously, when the. general policy of
defence was altered and the Gindrinkers Line
abandoned.

4. A few days before the Canadian battalions
arrived large working parties were found by the
mainland battalions and a little later the three
battalions occupied their sectors permanently
to push on the work faster.* It was in these
battle positions that the 5/7 ‘Rajput Regt.
(Right battalion), the 2/14 Punjab Regt.
(Centre battalion) and the 2 Royal Scots (Left
battalion) were located when war against Japan
‘broke out.

The time was too short, however, for either of
the (new) flank battalions to be practised pro-
perly in their defence roles by a series of four-
day exercises which had been the custom in the
past. These battalions, therefore, were not
familiar with the successive rear defence posi-
tions. It was indeed unfortunate that the
timing of events occurred in such a way that
the Japanese attack developed when of the
six battalions in the garrison, only two knew
their roles in exact and practised detail. (The
x Middlesex Regt. throughout had retained its
role of beach defence and: the 2/14 Punjab
Regt. had been ‘‘ Mainland battalion ’’ centred
on the Taipo Road.)

* The urgent necessity for speed called for this to be
done in spite of 1t being a malarial time of the year.
The 2 Royal Scots were in an area which was highly
malarial and they had many cases. This weakened
them considerably and, the hospital being full, many
were sent back without the normal ten days con-
valescence The battalion was 771 strong but only
600 effectives
