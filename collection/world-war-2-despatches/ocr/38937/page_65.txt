SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

originally conceived this was a part, but an
* especially important part, of the general plan
then in force for disrupting the enemy’s lines of
communication; as I have already explained,
it had been found by experience that the
destruction of bridges catised very much more
embarrassment to the enemy than the previous
policy of attacking marshalling yards, This
was, however, just that period in the first week
of June when it seemed likely that we should
be able to force our way rapidly through the
Apennines and still have sufficient force to ex-
ploit into northern Italy on a large scale, and
for this we wanted to have the chance of seiz-
ing a bridge over the Po, I was in fact plan-
ning an airborne operation for this very purpose
using 2 Parachute Brigade which was shortly
afterwards, unfortunately, withdrawn from me
for use in the South of France. I therefore
decided to cancel MALLORY MAJOR; but the
decision to mount ANVIL put a very different
complexion on the situation. The Po would
now probably be the limit of our possible ex-
ploitation after we had brokem through the
mountains. The Air Force plan offered an
opportunity of making a virtue of this neces-
sity; I decided to pin my hopes on being able

to bring the Germans to a decisive battle be-

tween the Apennines and the Po and drive
them against the obstacle of a bridgeless river.
In the meantime the enemy’s maintenance

would suffer from the interposition of this _

dramatic line of interdiction.

Orders for the operation went out on rrth
July; its scope was extended and all bridges,
both road and rail, were to be destroyed.
During the first four days of the operation,
rath to r5th July, medium bombers concen-
trated on the nineteen bridges from Piacenza
to the sea. Favourable weather contributed to
the success of the attacks. In the first two days
eleven bridges were rendered impassable and
by the r5th the line of interdiction was com-
plete. In some cases, however, the damage
was not considered extensive enough and re-
peated attacks were made until, by the 27th
all bridges over the Po east of and inclusive
of the one at Torreberetti, north of Alessandria,
were cut.

Change of Plan.

On 4th August I recast the plan for the
attack on the ‘‘ Gothic” line. The principal
difference was in the réle of Eighth Army;
instead of exerting its main strength on its
left and driving at the centre of the line side
by side with Fifth Army it would now carry
out a swift but secret transfer of strength to
its right and strike at the extreme eastern end of
the line in order to. roll up the enemy’s left at
the point where he was least protected by the
terrain. When this attack was well under
way, and depending on tht extent to which the
enemy had weakened his centre to meet it,
Fifth Army would launch a subsidiary. attack
up the axis Florence-Bologna. In order to
strengthen this blow and make Fifth Army
more nearly equivalent in strength to Eighth
Army, and to what it had been before the
recent withdrawals, I proposed to place under
General Clark the British 13 Corps, of one
armoured and two infantry divisions.* Thus

* 6 South African Armoured, 1 British and 8 Indian
Infantry Divisions. The South Africans were later
put under command of IV Corps and replaced by 6
British Armoured Division. 78 Division was added in
October. e

Fifth Army once more regained its character
of an Allied Army, which had distinguished it
from the start.

The new plan, which was given the code-
name OLIVE was decided on at a short and
informal conference on Orvieto airfield. There
were only three of us present, General Leese,
General Harding, my Chief of Staff, and myself
and we sheltered from the sun under the wing
of a Dakota while General Leese explained the
reasons which led him to urge a reconsideration
of our previous intentions. The proposal for
a redirection of our attack was largely his idea
and arose from his judgment of his Army’s
capabilities and the manner in which it could
be best employed. I was already concerned
at the prospect of extensive operations in moun-
tains without my best mountain troops, the
French. General Leese shared this concern
and represented frankly that, although he was
prepared to exert his utmost endeavours to
carry out whatever strategy should seem best,
he had not that confidence he would like to
have in his ability to break through the centre
of the Apennine position, With very small
exceptions Eighth Army had no troops trained
in mountain warfare and, of course, no
organized mountain divisions; provision of pack
transport trains and other vital necessities for
this kind of operation was only improvised at
present and the Army as a whole had had com-
paratively little experience of large-scale opera-
tions in mountains. On this line of attack,
moreover, it would be unable to develop to
the full extent its superiority in armour and
artillery, the use of which in combination had
been the mainstay of its successful African
operations and which had recently given proof
of its effectiveness in the Liri valley. The east
coast route, on the other hand, appeared to
provide much more the kind of battlefield to
which Eighth Army was accustomed. It
would have fewer mountains to contend with
and the chance of employing its artillery in
controlled and concentrated “‘ set-piece ”’
attacks, and the hope of flat country ahead
beckoned to its desert-trained armour,

Eighth Army’s preference for the east coast
toute of attack was based, it will be seen, on
reasons both strictly military and also psycho-
logical. The latter reasons; as a well-known
dictum of Napoleon’s lays down, are as much
military factors as the former and in a case
where the courses available were fairly equally
balanced it was obviously preferable to choose
that course which inspired the greater confi-
dence in those who were to carry it out. It
was anything but certain that our heavy blow in
the mountains of the centre would take us
through to our objective and if the first attack
there fell short of expectations the advantage
would be all with the defenders. He had by
far the easier lateral communications so that,
once it was clear that all our strength
was concentrated at one point, he could
very rapidly build up a counter
concentration. On the new plan we should
be able to employ what I call the strategy
of the “two-handed punch’ or, more
orthodoxly expressed, the strategy of attacking
two points equally vital to the enemy (i.e.,
Ravenna and Bologna) either simultaneously
or alternately in order to split the reserves
available for the defence.

Plans to implement this decision were made
