Enemy Air Activity.

Once again the northern end of the area ex-
perienced thé heaviest attacks during a day
when activity was on much the same scale as
the previous day. Details :-—

A. Bark West.

There was slight activity at dawn, and one
aircraft was shot down by a night fighter con-
trolled by the radar set in L.C.T. 305.

B. Bark SOUTH.

A raid warning in the early hours left BARK
SouTH untouched. On this occasion M.L.s*
put up a very effective smoke screen. After
nightfall, further warnings, with aircraft pass-
ing overhead, still produced no bombs.

C. Bark East.

The hospital ship DORSETSHIRE had
arrived the previous afternoon and before night-
fall had been sent to sea by S.N.O.L.(N) so as
to be well clear of the assault area and illumi-
nated during the night. Nevertheless, at 0500/
12th July, she was attacked and sustained some
structural damage and casualties from near
misses. Though the attacks on the anchorage
were of some weight no other damage was
caused,

SUPPLEMENT To THs LONDON GAZETTE, 28 APRIL, 1950

Following the experience of TALAMBA and
DORSETSHIRE the latter and AMRA were
for the night of 12th/13th July darkened and
anchored close to the convoy so as to have the
benefit of the anti-aircraft and smoke protec-
tion of the anchorage.

D. Acmp Sout and Norrtu.

At 0500, H.M.S. ESKIMO, when about three
miles to the southward of Cape Murro di Porco
on her way with Naval Commander Force
“A” to investigate the situation at Augusta,
was attacked by several aircraft and hit in
Nos. 5 and 6 oil fuel tanks. The ship stopped
and was ordered to Malta in tow of H.MS.
TARTAR; they arrived at 1700 without
further incident. .

At dawn an attack developed off Jic sector
and a near miss at the fore end of S.S. OCEAN
PEACE caused a fire in the cased petrol in
No. 1 hold. The fire could not be controlled
and the ship had to be sunk to prevent further
disaster. The usual raids after dark on
anchorage and beaches were again ineffective,
causing only a few casualties ashore. A good
smoke screen was put up before the raids
began.

Augusta entered.—Late the previous. night
there had been a report that Augusta was
being evacuated by the enemy and in execu-
tion of orders from Naval Commander Eastern
Task Force, sweepers proceeded to sweep the
channel at first light. They were not molested
by coast defence batteries, which were under
occasional fire from H.M.S. EREBUS to keep
them quiet, but a field gun opened fire on the
B.Y.M.S. (L.L.) when on their last leg out.

At 1045, H.MS. EXMOOR, flying the flag
of Naval Commander Force “A”—he had
transferred from H.M.S. ESKIMO after she
had been bombed—proceeded into the harbour.
The gate was open and the boom vessel
abandoned, and there was no sign of life until
a field gun, or possibly a tank, concealed
behind trees, began shelling the ship at short
range. The fire was accurate, and as no target
could be distinguished EXMOOR was ordered
out. No counter shoot could be conducted
owing to the proximity of our own troops.

N.C.ET.F. enters Augusta—H.MS. EX-
MOOR with the Greek Hunt class destroyer
KANARIS in company re-entered the port at
1600 followed later by H.M.S. BROCKLESBY
flying the flag of Naval Commander Eastern
Task Force. Again the ships had to withdraw
because of fire from high velocity guns of 3 to
4-inch calibre to which no adequate reply
could be made owing to uncertainty in regard
to the exact whereabouts of our own troops.
Much transport was seen in motion ashore, but
could not be engaged as it was not known
whether they were friend or foe—they were in
fact enemy,

Late in the evening one of the brigades of
5 Division penetrated into the town, and the
naval port party arrived from Malta. The
army’s hold was, however, precarious, and later
the S.B. Squadron, S.A.S. Regiment* was
successfully landed by H.MS. ULSTER
MONARCH as a reinforcement. In conse-

uence of this uncertainty and a statement by

e Brigadier that he might have to retire from
