This despatch bears witness to the part\nplayed by the Air Forces in the final stages of\nthe Mediterranean campaign. Their contribu-\ntion was one of the deciding factors in the final\nvictory in that Theatre. The despatch covers\nthe period of my appointment as Commander-\nin-Chief, Royal Air Force, Mediterranean and\nMiddle East, and as Deputy Air Commander-\nin-Chief, Mediterranean Allied Air Forces, from\n16th March, 1945, when J assumed command\nfrom Air Marshal Sir John Slessor, until\nhostilities ceased in the Theatre—on 2nd May,\n1945, for the Italian Sector, and 8th May,\n1945, for the Balkan Sector.\n\n2. The purpose of a despatch is to give a\nshort and lucid account of the main events\nduring the period of a Commander-in-Chief’s\nappointment. This task may not present any\nmajor difficulty in the case of a Command such\nas Bomber Command, which is purely func-\ntional, with singleness of aim and resources.\nBut in the case of a geographical Command\nsuch as MEDME, the task is more complicated.\nNot only did my Command contain within it\nthe three main types of functional command—\nStrategic, Tactical and Coastal—so that I was\nresponsible for a complete range of opera-\ntional air activity, but it also presented a large\n\nnumber of problems not directly operational in\ncharacter, some of them purely air matters,\nsuch as questions of Transport Command bases,\nsome of them of a political nature, such as my\ndealings with the Greek and Jugoslav govern-\nments.\n\n3. Then again, MEDME command had an\nunusual structure, arising out of the develop-\nment of the war in the Mediterranean, in that\nit contained as a sub-command the R.A.F.\nMiddle East, whose chief problems in 1945\nconcerned internal security and training\nmatters. It was desirable therefore that the\nA.O.C.-in-C. R.A.F. Middle East, though\nunder my command, -should exercise a large\nmeasure of autonomy.\n\n4. Finally, the operations of the Royal Air\nForce in MEDME were inextricably bound up\nwith those of the United States Army Air Force. .\nAn integration of Command had been achieved\nwhich was more complete than that to be found\njim any other Theatre. So it would be quite\nimpossible to write a despatch dealing only with\nR.A.F. activities—it would be like trying to\nbuild a house with only two walls.\n\n5. Under these circumstances, I have not\nattempted to deal with every subject which\narose during my period of command, but only\nwith outstanding events, I have given only\nas much detail as was necessary to present a\nbalanced picture of these events. In particular,\nI have not attempted to cover the problems\nwhich arose in the Middle East, nor have I\ngiven a complete history of each of the R.A.F.\nformations under my command—their activi-\nties are covered only- in so far as they\nparticipated in the main events described.\n",

Active air operations in support of the\nFourth Army commenced on the rgth March\nand continued with unabated vigour until the\nend of hostilities on the 8th May 1945. At the\nsame time a considerable effort was maintained\ninst the enemy in the Sarajevo area, and\nagainst his communications throughout Jugo-\nslavia to prevent reinforcement of his forces in\nfront of the Fourth Army,\n\n111. The detailed description of air operations\nin support of the Jugoslav Fourth Army offen-\nsive follows in the next section of this part.- It\nis never a simple task to give a compact and\nlucid account of air operations in support of a\nland battle, because of the constant necessity to\nrelate those operations to events on the ground\nand to the overall picture of the battle. In this\nparticular case, the task is far more difficult\nthan’ usual, simply because a clear picture of\nexactly what was happening on the ground was,\nmore often than not, not available to the air\nforces. Some of the difficulties of co-operating\nwith the Partisans have been indicated in earlier\nparagraphs,* and though these were reduced for\nthis particular offensive, the degree of liaison\nand close co-operation achieved never\napproached that which existed between the\nArmies and Air Forces in Italy. Because of\nthis, there could be onlya minimum of advance\nplanning, and air operations were therefore,\nof necessity, much more of an ad hoc nature.\nThis fact is reflected in the account of the\nair operations which follows. Moreover,\npolitical developments following the cessation of\nhostilities made impossible an accurate assess-\nment of the value of the operations by Balkan\nAir Force, since the Allies were not allowed\nto examine targets, to have discussions with the\nJugoslavs themselves, or to interrogate their\nprisoners.\n\nOperations during the Offensive.\nThe first phase—capture of Bihac\n\n11z. On the rgth March, Marauders and\nBaltimores heralded the opening of the Jugo-\nslay Fourth Army’s attack on Bihac with in-\ntensive bombing of strongpoints south-west of\nthe town, From then until the 25th, when\nBihac was entered, uninterrupted aid was given\nto the land forces by tactical support and attack\non communications in the enemy’s rear.\n\n113. Simultaneously, attacks were mounted\nagainst Gospic, Senj and Ogulin and through-\nout the same period practically the whole of\nthe road and rail system of North Jugoslavia\nwas subjected to straffing and bombing. Air-\ncraft of M.A.S.A.F. and M.A.T.A.F. added\nweight to this concentrated and widespread\neffort. Mustangs of D.A.F. gave special assist-\nance by highly successful attacks on road and\nrail bridges.\n\n114. The Fourth Army successfully com-\npleted the first phase of its offensive with the\ncapture of Bihac on the 28th March. They\nclaimed to have killed 4,000 enemy and taken\n2,000 prisoners.\n\nSecond Phase—clearing of Islands and advance\n. to Fiume\n\n115. Determined to hold the Northern\nAdriatic coast at all costs, the enemy continued\n\n* 79-32 and 94.\n\n5567\n\nhis policy of strengthening the coast and in-\nland defences, but the toll taken by B.A.F.\nand the Royal Navy of his shipping, apart\nfrom the threat of invasion, was causing him\nmuch embarrassment and he finally evacuated\nthem.\n\n116. No summary of the operations during\nMarch would be complete without mention of\nthe outstanding work of the Long Range Desert\nGroup patrols established in Istria, and on the\nIsland of Rab. These patrols were set up,\nin enemy-held territory and were frequently\nlocated by them. Nevertheless, they continued\nto send out most valuable information for the\n\n117. April was the climax of B.A.F.’s effort\nin support of the Jugoslav Fourth Army, and\nindeed, to the whole of its operations over\nJugoslavia during the past year. Flying well\nover 3,000 sorties, fighters, fighter-bombers and\nmedium bombers destroyed or damaged during\nthis month approximately 800 M.T., 60 loco-\nmotives, and 40 naval craft.\n\n118. On the 4th of April, a co-ordinated\nattack was put in against the island of Pag,\nthe coastal garrison of Karlobag and the town\nof Gospic, and by the 6th all three objectives\nhad been cleared of the enemy. In quick\nsuccession followed the fall of Rab, Krk,\nLussin and Cherso.\n\n119. The task of the ground and naval forces\nwas lightened immeasurably by the air support\ngiven by B.A.F., so much so that little or no\ninterference was experienced from the formi-\ndable defences during the actual assaults. Along\nthe coastal road, under cover of our fighters,\nFourth Amy forces also moved up without air\nor ground opposition, and ] e 15th the coast-\nline had been cleared up to and including\nKraljevica.\n\n120. In the hinterland, however, the enemy\nappeared momentarily to have stabilised the\nsituation, but B.A.F. kept up the attacks on\ncommunications. In anti-shipping strikes over\nthe Northern Islands R.P. Hurricanes and Spit-\nfires reaped a good harvest, disabling and sink-\ning several vessels.\n\nrar. Between the zoth and 27th April, a\nlarge number of close support attacks was put\nin against gun positions when the Fourth\nArmy were held at the outskirts of Fiume, and\nattacks were maintained on shipping. :\n\nThird phase—tink-up with 15th Army Group\nand clearing of Northern Jugoslavia\n\n122. During the final week of April the Jugo-\nslav Fourth Army made a break-through in\nNorth Istria to the River Izonzo and near\nMonfalcone met the advanced spearheads of the\nBritish Eighth Army. This left the Germans\nwith a number of isolated and _ill-garrisoned\nstrongpoints running from Novo Mesto (on the\nroad from Karlovac to Ljubljana) to Gorizia.\n\n123. The final assault on Fiume was made on\nApril 30th; the drive to Trieste met with com-\nparatively little opposition.\n\n124. Evidence that the enemy realised the\nhopelessness of his position in the Istrian Penin-\nsula and elsewhere was shown on Ist May—a\nweek before hostilities ceased—when approxi-\nmately 25 vessels of all types surrendered to\n",

Active air operations in support of the\nFourth Army commenced on the rgth March\nand continued with unabated vigour until the\nend of hostilities on the 8th May 1945. At the\nsame time a considerable effort was maintained\ninst the enemy in the Sarajevo area, and\nagainst his communications throughout Jugo-\nslavia to prevent reinforcement of his forces in\nfront of the Fourth Army,\n\n111. The detailed description of air operations\nin support of the Jugoslav Fourth Army offen-\nsive follows in the next section of this part.- It\nis never a simple task to give a compact and\nlucid account of air operations in support of a\nland battle, because of the constant necessity to\nrelate those operations to events on the ground\nand to the overall picture of the battle. In this\nparticular case, the task is far more difficult\nthan’ usual, simply because a clear picture of\nexactly what was happening on the ground was,\nmore often than not, not available to the air\nforces. Some of the difficulties of co-operating\nwith the Partisans have been indicated in earlier\nparagraphs,* and though these were reduced for\nthis particular offensive, the degree of liaison\nand close co-operation achieved never\napproached that which existed between the\nArmies and Air Forces in Italy. Because of\nthis, there could be onlya minimum of advance\nplanning, and air operations were therefore,\nof necessity, much more of an ad hoc nature.\nThis fact is reflected in the account of the\nair operations which follows.

Hurricanes in the Gulf of ‘Trieste.\nMustangs and Spitfires remained at readiness\nthroughout the week for support of the 4th\nJugoslav Army, but few requests were made.\n\n125. By the 6th May the enemy’s withdrawal\nin Slavonia was rapidly reaching its end. Kop-\ntivnica (S.E. of Varazdin) and Bjelovar (E. of\nZagreb) fell to the 3rd Jugoslav Army, and\nwith the capture of Kocevje (S. of Ljubljana)\nby VII Corps the German position was further\nimperilled in the Novo Mesto area. Generalski\nStol was taken and Karlovac threatened. The\nend of the day saw the enemy pocket north-\nwest of Fiume surrender, and the following day\nB.A.F. flew its last six sorties.\n\n126, Among the enemy formations caught in\nJugoslavia were 15 Mountain Corps, 21 Moun-\ntain Corps (including 118, 22 Divisions, and 11\nG.A.F, Division) and gx Corps (including 104\nJaeger, 7 S.S. and 41 Divisions). Elements\nof 7 S.S. Division succeeded in reaching Central\nAustria.\n\n127. Outside the borders of Jugoslavia, 188\nMountain Corps, 237 Infantry and remnants of\n398 Germano-Croat Divisions, cut off northwest\n\nFiume, surrendered to Jugoslav forces, but\nwere subsequently allowed to make their way\nnorth into Austrian territory.\n\nSummary.\n\n128. Altogether, more than 7,000 sorties\nwere flown by Balkan Air Force during the\nFourth Army offensive, between March roth and\n3rd May. More than 100 static targets were\nattacked, including gun positions, strongpoints,\nheadquarters, barracks, troop concentrations,\nrailway stations, dumps and bridges.\n\n129. So concluded air operations in the\nBalkans. The task of Balkan Air Force was\ncompleted and on 8th May instructions were\nissued by the Supreme Allied Commander that\nthe A.O.C. should cease to exercise co-ordinating\nfunctions in respect of trans-Adriatic operations.\nUntil its final disbandment on 15th July, 1945,\nHeadquarters, Balkan Air Force, therefore con-\ntinued as an ordinary R.A.F, Headquarters\nwith responsibility only for the control of its\nvarious Wings and units.\n\nSPECIAL OPERATIONS.\n\n130. Apart from the normal air operations,\nconsiderable effort was expended on Special\nOperations. Large quantities of ammunition,\nfood and clothing were landed and dropped\nthroughout the country for the Jugoslav Army,\nutilising a highly developed system of landing\ngrounds and dropping points. Very large num-\nbers of wounded Partisans, together with\nwomen and children, were evacuated to Italy\nfrom the most seriously threatened areas, their\nPresence in Jugoslavia being a serious embarrass-\nment to the Jugoslav Army. By the end of the\nwar in Europe 36 landing strips had been pre-\npared in Jugoslavia.\n\n131. During the period I was in Command,\na Special Operation was carried out involving\nthe evacuation of approximately 2,000 refugees\nfrom Slovenia. Marshal Tito had requested this\nespecially as they were in danger of being killed\nby the Germans withdrawing through the area,\n\n132. The extent of these Special Operati\ncan be seen from the fact that from the forma~\ntion of B.A.F. until May, 1945, 11,632 sorties\nwere flown to Jugoslavia and 16,469 gross tons\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 OCTOBER, 1951\n\nof stores were dropped or delivered to the coun-\n. By means of Pickups (landing operations)\n\napproximately 2,500 personnel were sent in and\n\napproximately 19,000 brought out.\n\nCoNncLUSIONS.\n\n133. I have divided this section into two\nparts, the first part dealing with conclusions from\nthe operational point of view, and the second\npart dealing with conclusions concerning the\nBalkan Air Force as a whole. :\n\nConclusions (Operational).\n\n134. A scientifically accurate assessment of\nthe value of the operations by Balkan Air Force\nin the Balkans has been impossible, as political\ndevelopments have almost entirely prevented\nexamination on the spot, discussion with the\nJugoslavs themselves, and interrogation of\nprisoners. Even so, from the meagre evidence\navailable from Liaison Officers, congratulatory\nmessages from Partisan Commanders, and from\nthe fact that they were always keen to call for\nair support, it is certain that our aircraft gave\ndecisive material, and even more moral, assist-\nance to the Partisans.\n\n135. For the reasons given above, the effec-\ntiveness of attacks on communications cannot\nbe assessed with precision. The fighter-bombers\ndid not cameras, but there is ample\nevidence that claims for damage to M.T. were\non the conservative side and there can be no\ndoubt that these attacks very seriously hindered\nthe enemy’s power of movement. Possibly the\nclaims against railway engines were over-\noptimistic and many more were damaged than\ndestroyed. There is evidence that in attacks\non marshalling yards and railway tracks serious\ndamage was inflicted in one third of the attacks.\nWhat effect this had cannot be assessed, but\nfrom photographic evidence it is fair to say that\nthe damage inflicted slowed up enemy move-\nments effectively, and caused considerable con-\ngestion.\n\n136. At sea there is no doubt that the attacks\non shipping, which virtually stopped all traffic\nby day, seriously hindered the enemy and\nprobably convinced him of the impossibility\nof holding the Northern Adriatic Islands since\nthe adjacent coastline on the mainland had\nbeen liberated by the Partisans. The effect\nof air attack on the enemy’s midget craft bases\nhas already been mentioned.\n\n137. There is evidence from photographs,\nconfirmed in some cases from examination on\nthe spot, that the numerous attacks on the\nenemy’s coast defence guns on the Northern\nAdriatic Islands, particularly on Rab and Krk,\nneutralised these defences and prevented their\neffective use against the Partisan forces which\ntook the islands, It would be too much to\nclaim, however, that these attacks did more\nthan cut down losses, as the Partisans were\nusually careful not to stage an attack until they\nhad reliable information that the enemy had\ndecided to abandon an island.\n\n138. Finally, the air was kept clear for\nSpecial Operations aircraft who were able to\ntake in supplies and evacuate personnel by day\nwithout interference. This very greatly in-\ncreased the material aid given to the Partisans.\nThis was achieved even though the enemy knew\nwhat was going on, were often within easy\nreach of the landing strips, and -at times\nbombed them. Our fighters, however, pre-\nvented any effective interference at any time.\n",

Hurricanes in the Gulf of ‘Trieste.\nMustangs and Spitfires remained at readiness\nthroughout the week for support of the 4th\nJugoslav Army, but few requests were made.\n\n125. By the 6th May the enemy’s withdrawal\nin Slavonia was rapidly reaching its end. Kop-\ntivnica (S.E. of Varazdin) and Bjelovar (E. of\nZagreb) fell to the 3rd Jugoslav Army, and\nwith the capture of Kocevje (S. of Ljubljana)\nby VII Corps the German position was further\nimperilled in the Novo Mesto area. Generalski\nStol was taken and Karlovac threatened. The\nend of the day saw the enemy pocket north-\nwest of Fiume surrender, and the following day\nB.A.F. flew its last six sorties.\n\n126, Among the enemy formations caught in\nJugoslavia were 15 Mountain Corps, 21 Moun-\ntain Corps (including 118, 22 Divisions, and 11\nG.A.F, Division) and gx Corps (including 104\nJaeger, 7 S.S. and 41 Divisions). Elements\nof 7 S.S. Division succeeded in reaching Central\nAustria.\n\n127. Outside the borders of Jugoslavia, 188\nMountain Corps, 237 Infantry and remnants of\n398 Germano-Croat Divisions, cut off northwest\n\nFiume, surrendered to Jugoslav forces, but\nwere subsequently allowed to make their way\nnorth into Austrian territory.\n\nSummary.\n\n128. Altogether, more than 7,000 sorties\nwere flown by Balkan Air Force during the\nFourth Army offensive, between March roth and\n3rd May. More than 100 static targets were\nattacked, including gun positions, strongpoints,\nheadquarters, barracks, troop concentrations,\nrailway stations, dumps and bridges.\n\n129. So concluded air operations in the\nBalkans. The task of Balkan Air Force was\ncompleted and on 8th May instructions were\nissued by the Supreme Allied Commander that\nthe A.O.C. should cease to exercise co-ordinating\nfunctions in respect of trans-Adriatic operations.\nUntil its final disbandment on 15th July, 1945,\nHeadquarters, Balkan Air Force, therefore con-\ntinued as an ordinary R.A.F, Headquarters\nwith responsibility only for the control of its\nvarious Wings and units.\n\nSPECIAL OPERATIONS.\n\n130. Apart from the normal air operations,\nconsiderable effort was expended on Special\nOperations. Large quantities of ammunition,\nfood and clothing were landed and dropped\nthroughout the country for the Jugoslav Army,\nutilising a highly developed system of landing\ngrounds and dropping points. Very large num-\nbers of wounded Partisans, together with\nwomen and children, were evacuated to Italy\nfrom the most seriously threatened areas, their\nPresence in Jugoslavia being a serious embarrass-\nment to the Jugoslav Army. By the end of the\nwar in Europe 36 landing strips had been pre-\npared in Jugoslavia.\n\n131. During the period I was in Command,\na Special Operation was carried out involving\nthe evacuation of approximately 2,000 refugees\nfrom Slovenia. Marshal Tito had requested this\nespecially as they were in danger of being killed\nby the Germans withdrawing through the area,\n\n132. The extent of these Special Operati\ncan be seen from the fact that from the forma~\ntion of B.A.F. until May, 1945, 11,632 sorties\nwere flown to Jugoslavia and 16,469 gross tons\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 OCTOBER, 1951\n\nof stores were dropped or delivered to the coun-\n. By means of Pickups (landing operations)\n\napproximately 2,500 personnel were sent in and\n\napproximately 19,000 brought out.\n\nCoNncLUSIONS.\n\n133. I have divided this section into two\nparts, the first part dealing with conclusions from\nthe operational point of view, and the second\npart dealing with conclusions concerning the\nBalkan Air Force as a whole. :\n\nConclusions (Operational).\n\n134. A scientifically accurate assessment of\nthe value of the operations by Balkan Air Force\nin the Balkans has been impossible, as political\ndevelopments have almost entirely prevented\nexamination on the spot, discussion with the\nJugoslavs themselves, and interrogation of\nprisoners. Even so, from the meagre evidence\navailable from Liaison Officers, congratulatory\nmessages from Partisan Commanders, and from\nthe fact that they were always keen to call for\nair support, it is certain that our aircraft gave\ndecisive material, and even more moral, assist-\nance to the Partisans.\n\n135. For the reasons given above, the effec-\ntiveness of attacks on communications cannot\nbe assessed with precision. The fighter-bombers\ndid not cameras, but there is ample\nevidence that claims for damage to M.T. were\non the conservative side and there can be no\ndoubt that these attacks very seriously hindered\nthe enemy’s power of movement. Possibly the\nclaims against railway engines were over-\noptimistic and many more were damaged than\ndestroyed. There is evidence that in attacks\non marshalling yards and railway tracks serious\ndamage was inflicted in one third of the attacks.\nWhat effect this had cannot be assessed, but\nfrom photographic evidence it is fair to say that\nthe damage inflicted slowed up enemy move-\nments effectively, and caused considerable con-\ngestion.\n\n136. At sea there is no doubt that the attacks\non shipping, which virtually stopped all traffic\nby day, seriously hindered the enemy and\nprobably convinced him of the impossibility\nof holding the Northern Adriatic Islands since\nthe adjacent coastline on the mainland had\nbeen liberated by the Partisans. The effect\nof air attack on the enemy’s midget craft bases\nhas already been mentioned.\n\n137. There is evidence from photographs,\nconfirmed in some cases from examination on\nthe spot, that the numerous attacks on the\nenemy’s coast defence guns on the Northern\nAdriatic Islands, particularly on Rab and Krk,\nneutralised these defences and prevented their\neffective use against the Partisan forces which\ntook the islands, It would be too much to\nclaim, however, that these attacks did more\nthan cut down losses, as the Partisans were\nusually careful not to stage an attack until they\nhad reliable information that the enemy had\ndecided to abandon an island.\n\n138. Finally, the air was kept clear for\nSpecial Operations aircraft who were able to\ntake in supplies and evacuate personnel by day\nwithout interference. This very greatly in-\ncreased the material aid given to the Partisans.\nThis was achieved even though the enemy knew\nwhat was going on, were often within easy\nreach of the landing strips, and -at times\nbombed them. Our fighters, however, pre-\nvented any effective interference at any time.\n",

In addition, the extremely rapid Ger-\nman withdrawal northwards was, to a large\nextent due to his realising that a properly or-\nganised and equipped Jugoslav Army, supported\nby tanks and aircraft, was facing him. He\nfirst felt the weight of this on the Karlobag\nGospic-Bihac line, where combined Air/ Ground\nattacks quickly broke up his forward positions.\nThis fact, together with the overall effect of\nour aircraft in “‘ keeping the enemy’s head\ndown ”’ was a decisive contribution to the rapid\nJugoslav advance and the over-running of\nmany of his supply dumps and isolated gar-\ntisons.\n\nConclusions (General).\n\n140. Balkan affairs have always been of a\ncomplicated nature and this was especially so\nduring the second World War. At the begin-\nning of 1943 there were a variety of Navy,\nArmy and Air formations engaged in various\nactivities connected with Balkan affairs with\ninfluence and controls stretching from London\nto Caserta, Bari and Cairo.\n\n141. It became increasingly clear that with\nthe growing strength of the Resistance move-\nments in the Balkans, together with the over-\nall effect on the war in Italy, it was most im-\nportant to co-ordinate these activities in one\nplace and on a proper inter-service integrated\nbasis. The fact that the only feasible way of\ncarrying on the war in the Balkans was by air\nindicated that an Air Officer should be ap-\nPointed as the Co-ordinator.\n\n142. The Commanders, Navy, Army and\nAir, their efforts co-ordinated ‘by the Air Com-\nmander, had at their disposal staff sections\ncomposed of officers who were specialists in\ntheir particular task.\n\n143. Thus, any problems which arose could\nbe dealt with quickly and efficiently by the\nintegrated section, on an inter-service basis,\nwhether it was a question of operations, in-\ntelligence, signals, or plans; and a co-ordinated\nsolution could be presented to the Commander.\nA most important advantage, too, was the way\nin which each service learned to appreciate\nthe others’ points of view. The spirit of co-\noperation and understanding brought about by\nthe physical proximity of the various services\nand sections facilitated the solution of the most\ndifficult problems. The actual operational air\nunits of the Balkan Air Force were small in\nnumber and of various types, but the results\nachieved were most satisfactory.\n\n144. As a venture in ‘‘ Combined Opera-\ntions ” it was an experiment which subsequent\nevents proved to have been an outstanding\nsuccess and an example which could well be\nfollowed in future similar circumstances. For\nthese happy results great credit is due to Air\nVice-Marshal W. Elliot who commanded_the\nBalkan Air Force from its formation in June\ni944 until February 1945, and to Air Vice-\nMarshal G. Mills who succeeded him in\ncommand. until the Force was dissolved in July\n1945.\n\nPart IV.\nAIR ACTIVITIES PRIOR TO THE FINAL\nOFFENSIVE IN ITALY.\nINTRODUCTION. ©\n\n‘145. When I assumed command of the Royal\nAir Force..in. MEDME in mid-March, 1945,\n\n5569\n\nit was obvious that the German War was draw-\ning rapidly to a close. On the Western Front,\nthe enemy had been pushed back to the east\nbank of the Rhine, and a bridgehead of great\nstrategic importance had been gained at\nRemagen. By the end of the month, the last\ngreat offensive, across the Rhine and into the\nheart of Germany, had begun, which was to\nend in the final capitulation on the 8th May\nof all enemy forces opposed to the Allied Armies\nin the west.\n\n146. On the Eastern Front, the Russians were\nengaged in the capture of the East Prussian\nports of Danzig, Gdynia and Koenigsberg on\ntheir northern flank; they had reached the Oder\nat Kuestrin, which gave them a good jump-off\npoint for their coming offensive for the capture\nof Berlin; to the south, they had reached the\narea of Breslau; and further south still, they\nwere fighting to the west and north-west of\nBudapest, and were very soon to push on to\ncapture the Bratislava Gap and Vienna.\n\n147. In the Italian theatre, the front was\nquiet, while the Allied Armies made their\npreparations for the final offensive which was to\nstart in April and to lead to complete victory.\nIn Jugoslavia, the offensive by Marshal Tito’s\nFourth Army was just about to start, and was\nnot to stop until it had reached Trieste.\n\n148. This then was the background against\nwhich M.A.A.F. was to continue its air war-\nfare in the seven weeks which remained until\nthe war in Europe had ended.\n\nOPERATIONAL DIRECTIVE FOR THE PERIOD I6TH\n\nMarcu-8TH APRIL.\n\nMediterranean Allied Strategic Air Force.\n\n149. During March the overall mission of the\nMediterranean Allied Strategic Air Force\nremained to carry out its portion of the aim of\nthe Allied Strategic Air Forces in Europe, i.e.\n*“ the progressive destruction and dislocation of\nthe German military, industrial and economic\nsystems, and the direct support of land and\nnaval forces.’’\n\nThe strategic objectives in order of priority\nwere :—\n\n(a) The reduction of the enemy’s sources\nof fuel, particularly petrol, his most critical\nmilitary supply.\n\n(6) Destruction of lines of communication\nin Germany, and of facilities for the produc-\ntion, assembly and repair of armoured fight-\ning vehicles.\n\n* (c) Attacks in support of land operations.\n\nTo meet the needs of an urgent tactical situa-\n\ntion, temporary diversions of the effort of the\n\nM.A.S.A.F. from its primary function could\n\nbe ordered by the Supreme Allied Com-\n\nmander. Moreover whenever weather or other\nconditions prohibited operations under (a) or\n\n(b) above, elements of M.A.S.A.F. could be\n\nmade available to augment the Tactical Air\n\nForce effort in Italy or Jugoslavia, or to sup-\n\nport Russian operations.\n\nd) Attacks on important industrial areas,\nwhen weather or tactical conditions were un-\nsuitable for operations against any of the\nobjectives given above.\n\n(e) Counter air force attacks.

In addition, the extremely rapid Ger-\nman withdrawal northwards was, to a large\nextent due to his realising that a properly or-\nganised and equipped Jugoslav Army, supported\nby tanks and aircraft, was facing him. He\nfirst felt the weight of this on the Karlobag\nGospic-Bihac line, where combined Air/ Ground\nattacks quickly broke up his forward positions.\nThis fact, together with the overall effect of\nour aircraft in “‘ keeping the enemy’s head\ndown ”’ was a decisive contribution to the rapid\nJugoslav advance and the over-running of\nmany of his supply dumps and isolated gar-\ntisons.\n\nConclusions (General).\n\n140. Balkan affairs have always been of a\ncomplicated nature and this was especially so\nduring the second World War. At the begin-\nning of 1943 there were a variety of Navy,\nArmy and Air formations engaged in various\nactivities connected with Balkan affairs with\ninfluence and controls stretching from London\nto Caserta, Bari and Cairo.\n\n141. It became increasingly clear that with\nthe growing strength of the Resistance move-\nments in the Balkans, together with the over-\nall effect on the war in Italy, it was most im-\nportant to co-ordinate these activities in one\nplace and on a proper inter-service integrated\nbasis. The fact that the only feasible way of\ncarrying on the war in the Balkans was by air\nindicated that an Air Officer should be ap-\nPointed as the Co-ordinator.\n\n142. The Commanders, Navy, Army and\nAir, their efforts co-ordinated ‘by the Air Com-\nmander, had at their disposal staff sections\ncomposed of officers who were specialists in\ntheir particular task.\n\n143. Thus, any problems which arose could\nbe dealt with quickly and efficiently by the\nintegrated section, on an inter-service basis,\nwhether it was a question of operations, in-\ntelligence, signals, or plans; and a co-ordinated\nsolution could be presented to the Commander.\nA most important advantage, too, was the way\nin which each service learned to appreciate\nthe others’ points of view. The spirit of co-\noperation and understanding brought about by\nthe physical proximity of the various services\nand sections facilitated the solution of the most\ndifficult problems. The actual operational air\nunits of the Balkan Air Force were small in\nnumber and of various types, but the results\nachieved were most satisfactory.\n\n144. As a venture in ‘‘ Combined Opera-\ntions ” it was an experiment which subsequent\nevents proved to have been an outstanding\nsuccess and an example which could well be\nfollowed in future similar circumstances. For\nthese happy results great credit is due to Air\nVice-Marshal W. Elliot who commanded_the\nBalkan Air Force from its formation in June\ni944 until February 1945, and to Air Vice-\nMarshal G. Mills who succeeded him in\ncommand. until the Force was dissolved in July\n1945.\n\nPart IV.\nAIR ACTIVITIES PRIOR TO THE FINAL\nOFFENSIVE IN ITALY.\nINTRODUCTION. ©\n\n‘145. When I assumed command of the Royal\nAir Force..in. MEDME in mid-March, 1945,\n\n5569\n\nit was obvious that the German War was draw-\ning rapidly to a close. On the Western Front,\nthe enemy had been pushed back to the east\nbank of the Rhine, and a bridgehead of great\nstrategic importance had been gained at\nRemagen. By the end of the month, the last\ngreat offensive, across the Rhine and into the\nheart of Germany, had begun, which was to\nend in the final capitulation on the 8th May\nof all enemy forces opposed to the Allied Armies\nin the west.\n\n146. On the Eastern Front, the Russians were\nengaged in the capture of the East Prussian\nports of Danzig, Gdynia and Koenigsberg on\ntheir northern flank; they had reached the Oder\nat Kuestrin, which gave them a good jump-off\npoint for their coming offensive for the capture\nof Berlin; to the south, they had reached the\narea of Breslau; and further south still, they\nwere fighting to the west and north-west of\nBudapest, and were very soon to push on to\ncapture the Bratislava Gap and Vienna.\n\n147. In the Italian theatre, the front was\nquiet, while the Allied Armies made their\npreparations for the final offensive which was to\nstart in April and to lead to complete victory.\nIn Jugoslavia, the offensive by Marshal Tito’s\nFourth Army was just about to start, and was\nnot to stop until it had reached Trieste.\n\n148. This then was the background against\nwhich M.A.A.F. was to continue its air war-\nfare in the seven weeks which remained until\nthe war in Europe had ended.\n\nOPERATIONAL DIRECTIVE FOR THE PERIOD I6TH\n\nMarcu-8TH APRIL.\n\nMediterranean Allied Strategic Air Force.\n\n149. During March the overall mission of the\nMediterranean Allied Strategic Air Force\nremained to carry out its portion of the aim of\nthe Allied Strategic Air Forces in Europe, i.e.\n*“ the progressive destruction and dislocation of\nthe German military, industrial and economic\nsystems, and the direct support of land and\nnaval forces.’’\n\nThe strategic objectives in order of priority\nwere :—\n\n(a) The reduction of the enemy’s sources\nof fuel, particularly petrol, his most critical\nmilitary supply.\n\n(6) Destruction of lines of communication\nin Germany, and of facilities for the produc-\ntion, assembly and repair of armoured fight-\ning vehicles.\n\n* (c) Attacks in support of land operations.\n\nTo meet the needs of an urgent tactical situa-\n\ntion, temporary diversions of the effort of the\n\nM.A.S.A.F. from its primary function could\n\nbe ordered by the Supreme Allied Com-\n\nmander. Moreover whenever weather or other\nconditions prohibited operations under (a) or\n\n(b) above, elements of M.A.S.A.F. could be\n\nmade available to augment the Tactical Air\n\nForce effort in Italy or Jugoslavia, or to sup-\n\nport Russian operations.\n\nd) Attacks on important industrial areas,\nwhen weather or tactical conditions were un-\nsuitable for operations against any of the\nobjectives given above.\n\n(e) Counter air force attacks. These were\nadjusted so as to maintain the air superiority\n\n. which had already been gained. No fixed\n",

The Commanding General, M.A.T.A.F.,\nwas responsible for the selection of targets for\noffensive air operations in Italy, and no targets\nin Italy were to be attacked by other forma-\ntions except upon his request or approval. He\nmaintained at H.Q., M.A.S.A.F., and H.Q.,\nM.A.C.A.F., a list of targets from which in-\ndividual objectives could be selected by them\nwhen an opportunity for attack occurred. If\nM.A.T.A.F. required priority assistance from\nM.A.S.A.F., a request was made to Head-\nquarters M.A.A.F. for approval.\n\n152. Owing to the negligible effort of the\nGerman Air Force, the counter air force opera-\ntions and air protection for our forward areas\nwere only minor activities.

In addition, B.A.F. was\nresponsible for the selection of targets for air\noperations in Jugoslavia, and the communica-\ntion of this list to M.A.S.A.F., M.A.T.AF.,\nand M.A.C.A.F. When the other air forces\nfound an opportunity to operate against pre-\nviously accepted targets in Jugoslavia con-\nsistent with their other priorities; they confirmed\nwith B.A.F, that the targets selected were still\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 OCTOBER, 1951\n\ncleared for attack.

The primary task of the Mediterranean\nAllied Coastal Air Force continued to be the\nprotection of our own shipping, the attacking\nof enemy shipping of all types and the provi-\nsion of air sea rescue facilities.

An analysis of the bombing effort of the °\nCommand during March and early April shows\nthat there were four broad objectives.\n\n(a) The completion of the destruction of\nthe enemy’s oil resources.\n\n(6) Attacks on communications in South-\nEast Europe in order to aid the Russian drive\ninto Austria and Northern Jugoslavia. -\n\n(c) Interdiction of the enemy’s communi-\ncations, leading into, and inside Italy, and\nthe destruction of his supply dumps and\ninstallations, in preparation for the army’s\nfinal offensive,\n\n(@ Support for the offensive of the Fourth\nJugoslav Army.\n\nThe first three tasks are dealt with in detail\nbelow, while the fourth has been dealt with\nin Part III.\n\nOil Targets.\n\n156. By the middle of March, 1945, the air\ncampaign against enemy oil targets had\nachieved almost complete success. Begun\nnearly a year before, as a co-ordinated\noffensive with Bomber Command and _ the\nVIIIth Air Force operating from the United\nKingdom, it had, assisted by the advances of\nthe Russian armies, so nearly completed its\ntask, that there were by March, 1945, only six\nknown active plants within range of M.A.S.A.F.\nOf these the most important was that at Rub-\nland, seventy miles south of Berlin and over\n700 miles from M.A.S.A.F, bases. In the third\nweek in March, it was attacked three times by\nM.A.S.A.F. Fortresses with over one thousand\ntons of bombs, and successfully neutralised.\nIn March also, attacks were made on the already\ndamaged refineries in the Vienna area, and on\ntwo small refineries in the Western Hungarian\noil region.\n\n157. These raids brought the offensive to a\nsuccessful conclusion, for on March 26th, the\npetrol output of refineries still in enemy hands\nand within range of M.A.S.A.F. was estimated\nto be, for all practical purposes, nil; and during\nApril, it was judged to be a waste of effort to\nmake any further raids on oil targets from\nItalian bases.\n\n158. The overall result of the Anglo-American\ntwo-way bombing and of Allied ground ad-\nvances by the end of March, even allowing\nfor some small production from new under-\nground plants, was to reduce the enemy’s pro-\nduction of liquid fuels and lubricants to less\n",

These raids brought the offensive to a\nsuccessful conclusion, for on March 26th, the\npetrol output of refineries still in enemy hands\nand within range of M.A.S.A.F. was estimated\nto be, for all practical purposes, nil; and during\nApril, it was judged to be a waste of effort to\nmake any further raids on oil targets from\nItalian bases.\n\n158. The overall result of the Anglo-American\ntwo-way bombing and of Allied ground ad-\nvances by the end of March, even allowing\nfor some small production from new under-\nground plants, was to reduce the enemy’s pro-\nduction of liquid fuels and lubricants to less\n",

It can be truly\nsaid that the attacks on the enemy’s fuel pro-\nduction constituted one of the most successful\nair offensives ever waged.\n\nAssistance to the Russians.\n\n159. In November, 1944, it became evident\nthat the advance of the Soviet forces through\nHungary was destined to be one of the decisive\nthrusts of the war. It was equally clear that\nan excellent opportunity was presented to\nM.AS.A.F. of using its striking power to aid\nour Russian Ally, by limiting the supply and\nreinforcement of the defending Axis troops\nsouth of the Tatra mountains. To achieve this\naim, the air offensive had to dislocate the\nenemy’s railway systems in Austria, Western\nHungary, and Northern Jugoslavia. Although\nconsiderable damage had already been inflicted\non vulnerable points of these systems, a far\nmore comprehensive programme of air attacks\nwas now necessary, but before this could be\nimplemented, an exact picture had to be drawn\nup of the whole flow of enemy traffic to the\nsouth-eastern front. Before the end of 19044,\nby means of constant photographic reconnais-\nsance and reports from ground agents and\nprisoners of war, the necessary information had\nbeen obtained and collated.\n\n160. The first requirement of the Russian\nHigh Command was the dislocation of the rail-\nways from Linz and Vienna to Zagreb and the\nconnecting lines to North-East Italy. . This\nphase lasted approximately from the beginning\nof 1945 to 23rd February, 1945. Thereafter\nan additional commitment was the destruction\nof Western Hungarian marshalling yards and\nrailway targets in Northern Jugoslavia, in order\nto disiocate the enemy troop movement north-\nwards across the Drava river.\n\nThe Main Targets.\n\n16x. Before considering the implementation\nof the plan to aid the Russian armies, it is\nnecessary to give a brief survey of the principal\ncommunication targets involved.\n\n162. The key target of the whole railway net-\nwork was the complex of marshalling yards\nimmediately to the south-east of Vienna. Before\nthe air offensive began in earnest, most of the\nmilitary supplies and material from the Reich\nand Czechoslovakia were handled in these\nyards, which had ample facilities for the pur-\npose. Of slightly lower priority, but equally\nlarge and complex, was the railway centre at\nLinz, further to the west. And between the two\nwere the spacious yards at Amstettin, capable\nof dealing with all military traffic and un-\nhampered by industrial commitments.\n\n163. Southwards on the line from Vienna to\nZagreb were four important railway centres at\nWiener Neustadt, Bruck, Graz and Maribor,\nwhich had large classification yards with full\nfacilities and repair depots.\n\n164. East of the Vienna-Zagreb route the\nlines from the Austrian capital to Budapest were\nserviced by the Bratislava and Ersekujvar\ncentres, north of the Danube, and those at\nHegyeshalom and Komarom to the south of\nthe river.\n\n165. Further south, a number of minor lines\nbranched east from Wiener Neustadt and Graz,\npassing through the centres at Sopron and\nSzombathely.\n\n5571\n\n166. Complementary to the major targets\nwere minor yards and sidings along the various\nlines, while rail traffic offered tempting targets\nto M.A.S.A.F. fighters.\n\nThe Air Effort in March.\n\n167. In January and February well over\n£3,000 tons of bombs were dropped in meeting\nthis commitment, and March saw a further\nstepping up of the effort. In that month, some\n18,000 tons were dropped on Austrian,\nBavarian, Hungarian and Jugoslav railway\ncommunications in order to aid the Red Army\ndrive into Austria and Jugoslavia.\n\n168. On about one third of the day missions,\nvisual bombing was possible and the accuracy\nachieved was exceptional. Night bomber raids\nby No. 205 Group added to the disrupticn\ncaused by the Fifteenth Air Force attacks.\n\n169. In addition to the continued policing of\nthe Vienna-Graz-Zagreb route, in answer to\nRussian requests, M.A.S.A.F. now intensified its\nattacks on the western Hungarian marshalling\nyards and northern Jugoslav railway targets\nso as to dislocate the enemy’s northward move-\nment across the Drava.\n\n170. In neutralising the Germans’ forward\nmarshalling yards in western Hungary nearly\n2,500 tons of bombs were dropped at\nHegyeshalom, Komarom, Sopron, Szombathely\nand Ersekujvar (Nove Zamky). A further\n132 tons were dropped on the Bratislava yards,\njust inside Czechoslovakia.\n\n17i. Meanwhile, in completing the disrup-\ntion of the railway communications in Austria,\nsouthern Germany and northern Jugoslavia,\nMAS.AE. dropped some 15,000 tons of\nbombs.\n\n172. Of the fifteen bombing attacks de-\nlivered against the Vienna-Graz-Zagreb line the\nmost important were five directed against\nWiener Neustadt which, except for Bruck, was\nthe only remaining railway centre on the line\nwith a large and relatively intact marshalling\ncapacity. The 1,743 tons of bombs dropped on\nthis target left the yards severely damaged and\ncompletely blocked. Three heavy attacks were\nalso made on the crowded yards at Amstettin,\nwhich had become the main centre for the\nsorting of traffic after the previous month’s\ncrippling attacks on Linz and Vienna, and these\nlikewise resulted in the destruction of installa-\ntions and the blocking of the yards with the\nwreckage of rolling stock.\n\n173. Meanwhile, the air offensive was con-\ntinued against railway targets at Vienna, Linz\nand Graz at high intensity. Among the many\nother railway targets attacked the strongest\nefforts were directed against those at Wels,\nVillach, Bruck, Steyr, Gmund, St. Veit,\nKlagenfurt and St. Polten in Austria; at Muldort\nand Landshut in Bavaria; and Maribor, Zagreb\nand Dobova in northern Jugoslavia.\n\n174. No. 205 Group again supplemented the\nhavoc wrought by the United States day\n\nbombers by effective night attacks.\n\nDuring the first seventeen days of March,\nalso, M.A.S.A.F. fighters flew 333 effective\nsorties on straffing missions, which met with\nexcellent results, particularly in the destruction\nof locomotives.\n",

Of the remaining four routes, which\nwere the ones to which the main weight of\nthe interdiction programme was applied, ‘the\nmost important was the Brenner line running\nsouth from Innsbruck via Trento to Verona.\nThe remaining three routes ran across Italy’s\nnorth-eastern frontier. They were:—\n\n(a) the Tarvisio route running from Tar-\nvisio to Udine and on to Treviso;\n\n(b) the Piedicolle route via Jugoslavia,\nwhich joined the Tarvisio route at Udine;\nan :\n\n(c) the Postumia route, also via Jugo-\nslavia.\n\n189. Though the four routes mentioned above\nwere the most important from the point of view\nof the interdiction policy, attention was also\ngiven to the moderately dense network of rail-\nways serving Northern Italy,\n\n190. The interdiction was carried out in a\nseries of zones: The Brenner toute was\nattacked along its whole length from Inns-\nbruck to Verona, while the three north-eastern\nfrontier lines were attacked in the frontier\nzone, and also along the Tagliamento, Livenza,\nPiave, Brenta and Adige River zones, to the\nsouth-west across the Venetian Plain. Lastly\nthe routes in the Po Valley were attacked at\nthe crossings of the Po River and its tributaries.\nThe whole system provided a series of good\ntargets in the way of bridges, viaducts, mar-\nshalling yards and sidings.\n\nAir Effort in January and February.\n\n191. The interdiction programme began in\nearnest on roth January, 1945, and from then\nuntil the ground offensive began on gth April,\nM.A.T.A.F. devoted some 75 per cent. of its\ntotal effort to this task Previously,\nM.A.T.A.F. had operated primarily in the Po\nValley, but during January and February air\noperations against the frontier railway zones\nwere given top priority, and action against\nthe more southerly communications leading to\nthe battle area became a secondary considera-\ntion.\n\n192. The 57th Wing concentrated mainly on\nthe Brenner Pass route, assisted by the\nXXIInd Tactical Air Command, while the\nDesert Air Force attacked the north-eastern\nfrontier routes. In the less important Po\nValley, XXIInd T.A.C.. operated against com-\nmunications west of Vicenza, while D.A.F.\nconcentrated on the Imola-Budrio-Medicina-\nMolinello area east of Bologna. The Strategic\nAir Force heavy bombers gave assistance with\nsome 5,000 tons of bombs, most of which were\ndropped on marshalling yards, and of which\nsome 3,000 tons were on the Brenner route.\n\n193. This heavy effort showed immediate\nresults. In January, the Brenner route was\ndefinitely blocked to through traffic for fifteen\ndays, and probably for another five; in\nFebruary, at no time was the route open to\ncontinuous through traffic. On the north-\neastern frontier routes, through rail traffic was\ndenied the Germans for the whole of January,\nand although it was possible on a few days\nduring the early part of February, the state of\ninterdiction during the latter half of the month\nwas the most complete achieved up to that\ntime. . - :\n\n194. This success quickly had the effect of\nobliging the enemy to lean more and more\n\n5573\n\nupon the roads for his communications, Thus\nin January, heavy road movement at night was\nreported along the Adige Valley and down both\nsides of Lake Garda, and photographic recon-\nnaissance and ground reports showed that there\nwas little rail activity south of Trento. The trams-\nport of supplies and heavy equipment clearly\npresented a great problem to the enemy, though\nthe movement of troops could still be accom-\nplished, albeit with a great time lag. Petrol\nwas by then a very scarce commodity indeed,\nand quite insufficient for large scale motor\ntransport movement, quite apart from the con-\ntinual hazards of Allied air attacks.\n\nAir Effort in March.\nThe Brenner route.\n\n195. March witnessed a still greater air effort\nagainst this vital line, in particular by the\nmedium bombers of the 57th Wing, who\ndropped some 3,000 tons of bombs on it in the\ncourse of 1,600 sorties—some 60 per cent. of\ntheir total effort for the month. Bridges and\n‘diversions along almost the entire route re-\nmained the main objectives, with targets at\nOra and San Michele, in the central Brenner\nzone, receiving the chief attention. Other\ntargets heavily attacked were at Ala, San\nAmbrogio and San Margherita, on the lower\nBrenner line, and Campo di Trens on the upper\nBrenner line.\n\n196. Simultaneously, XXIInd T.A.C. main-\ntained heavy pressure on the central and lower\nportions of the route by day, while night in-\ntruder aircraft did the same by night. In these\nattacks, not only were the blocks created by\nthe medium bombers further enlarged, but\nadditional bridges were destroyed, tracks cut,\nand traffic both bombed and straffed.\n\n197. The M.A.S.A.F. bombers again co-\noperated by dropping some 1,300 tons of\nbombs on Verona marshalling yards. In\naddition their disruption of the Austrian rail-\nway system was having its effect on communi-\ncations further south.\n\n198. In spite of the enemy’s desperate repair\nefforts, and of a spell of bad weather from\n26th to 29th March, through traffic on the\nBrenner route was again impossible for the\nwhole of the month. The interdiction, in fact,\nreached the highest level yet attained. Ten or\ntwelve blocks on the route at one time was a\ncommon occurrence and on one occasion there\nwere at least fifteen blocks on the stretch\nbetween Bolzano and Verona.\n\nThe north-eastern routes.\n\n199. The main burden of the attacks on these\nlines again fell on the Desert Air Force, which\nconcentrated chiefly on the Tarvisio-Udine line.\nIn addition, the 57th Wing flew 364 sorties\nagainst bridges and diversions in the five river\nzones in the Venetian Plain, while XXIInd\nT.A.C. fighter-bombers, and the night\nintruders, attacked targets primarily in the\nCasarsa area. M.A.S.A.F. aircraft co-operated\nby dropping 7oo tons of bombs, with the\nTreviso and Padua marshalling yards as the\nmain targets.\n\n200. These attacks caused the three north-\neastern frontier routes to be blocked for the\nwhole of the month, and, moreover, little traffic\nwas able to pass over the more southerly\nstretches of the lines across the Venetian Plain.\n",

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT To tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 29 OCTOBER, 1951\n\n188. Of the remaining four routes, which\nwere the ones to which the main weight of\nthe interdiction programme was applied, ‘the\nmost important was the Brenner line running\nsouth from Innsbruck via Trento to Verona.\nThe remaining three routes ran across Italy’s\nnorth-eastern frontier. They were:—\n\n(a) the Tarvisio route running from Tar-\nvisio to Udine and on to Treviso;\n\n(b) the Piedicolle route via Jugoslavia,\nwhich joined the Tarvisio route at Udine;\nan :\n\n(c) the Postumia route, also via Jugo-\nslavia.\n\n189. Though the four routes mentioned above\nwere the most important from the point of view\nof the interdiction policy, attention was also\ngiven to the moderately dense network of rail-\nways serving Northern Italy,\n\n190. The interdiction was carried out in a\nseries of zones: The Brenner toute was\nattacked along its whole length from Inns-\nbruck to Verona, while the three north-eastern\nfrontier lines were attacked in the frontier\nzone, and also along the Tagliamento, Livenza,\nPiave, Brenta and Adige River zones, to the\nsouth-west across the Venetian Plain. Lastly\nthe routes in the Po Valley were attacked at\nthe crossings of the Po River and its tributaries.\nThe whole system provided a series of good\ntargets in the way of bridges, viaducts, mar-\nshalling yards and sidings.\n\nAir Effort in January and February.\n\n191. The interdiction programme began in\nearnest on roth January, 1945, and from then\nuntil the ground offensive began on gth April,\nM.A.T.A.F. devoted some 75 per cent. of its\ntotal effort to this task Previously,\nM.A.T.A.F. had operated primarily in the Po\nValley, but during January and February air\noperations against the frontier railway zones\nwere given top priority, and action against\nthe more southerly communications leading to\nthe battle area became a secondary considera-\ntion.\n\n192. The 57th Wing concentrated mainly on\nthe Brenner Pass route, assisted by the\nXXIInd Tactical Air Command, while the\nDesert Air Force attacked the north-eastern\nfrontier routes. In the less important Po\nValley, XXIInd T.A.C.. operated against com-\nmunications west of Vicenza, while D.A.F.\nconcentrated on the Imola-Budrio-Medicina-\nMolinello area east of Bologna. The Strategic\nAir Force heavy bombers gave assistance with\nsome 5,000 tons of bombs, most of which were\ndropped on marshalling yards, and of which\nsome 3,000 tons were on the Brenner route.\n\n193. This heavy effort showed immediate\nresults. In January, the Brenner route was\ndefinitely blocked to through traffic for fifteen\ndays, and probably for another five; in\nFebruary, at no time was the route open to\ncontinuous through traffic. On the north-\neastern frontier routes, through rail traffic was\ndenied the Germans for the whole of January,\nand although it was possible on a few days\nduring the early part of February, the state of\ninterdiction during the latter half of the month\nwas the most complete achieved up to that\ntime. . - :\n\n194. This success quickly had the effect of\nobliging the enemy to lean more and more\n\n5573\n\nupon the roads for his communications, Thus\nin January, heavy road movement at night was\nreported along the Adige Valley and down both\nsides of Lake Garda, and photographic recon-\nnaissance and ground reports showed that there\nwas little rail activity south of Trento. The trams-\nport of supplies and heavy equipment clearly\npresented a great problem to the enemy, though\nthe movement of troops could still be accom-\nplished, albeit with a great time lag. Petrol\nwas by then a very scarce commodity indeed,\nand quite insufficient for large scale motor\ntransport movement, quite apart from the con-\ntinual hazards of Allied air attacks.\n\nAir Effort in March.\nThe Brenner route.\n\n195. March witnessed a still greater air effort\nagainst this vital line, in particular by the\nmedium bombers of the 57th Wing, who\ndropped some 3,000 tons of bombs on it in the\ncourse of 1,600 sorties—some 60 per cent. of\ntheir total effort for the month. Bridges and\n‘diversions along almost the entire route re-\nmained the main objectives, with targets at\nOra and San Michele, in the central Brenner\nzone, receiving the chief attention. Other\ntargets heavily attacked were at Ala, San\nAmbrogio and San Margherita, on the lower\nBrenner line, and Campo di Trens on the upper\nBrenner line.\n\n196. Simultaneously, XXIInd T.A.C. main-\ntained heavy pressure on the central and lower\nportions of the route by day, while night in-\ntruder aircraft did the same by night. In these\nattacks, not only were the blocks created by\nthe medium bombers further enlarged, but\nadditional bridges were destroyed, tracks cut,\nand traffic both bombed and straffed.\n\n197. The M.A.S.A.F. bombers again co-\noperated by dropping some 1,300 tons of\nbombs on Verona marshalling yards. In\naddition their disruption of the Austrian rail-\nway system was having its effect on communi-\ncations further south.\n\n198. In spite of the enemy’s desperate repair\nefforts, and of a spell of bad weather from\n26th to 29th March, through traffic on the\nBrenner route was again impossible for the\nwhole of the month.

The switching of the main air effort\nnorthwards against the’ frontier routes implied\nthat more freedom of movement than formerly\nwas permitted the enemy in the Po Valley.\nDuring the period of static ground operations,\nhowever, this was considered of minor import-\nance. Nevertheless, a considerable M.A.T.A.F.\neffort was continued against the principal lines\nof communication immediately behind the battle\narea, especially when bad weather prevented\noperations further afield. During the period,\nsorties were flown against the Po River zone\nand in the Mincio, Oglia and Adda river zones,\nbranching northwards from the Po River. Par-\nticular attention was paid to the disruption of\nlines leading to Milan, Turin, and Genoa in\norder to hinder the transportation of looted\nindustrial and agricultural products bound for\nthe Reich. Also in March, the night intruder\neffort was increased considerably, particularly\nin the form of a greater number of attacks on\ndamaged bridges and diversions to demoralise\nthe enemy’s repair gangs. Generally, both the\nday and night attacking aircraft in the Po\nvalley were increasingly concerned with de-\nstroying rail and road traffic and rolling stock\nin marshalling yards rather than the wrecking\nof the railway system itself.\n\nAir Effort in April.\n\n202. In April M.A.T.A.F. maintained the in-\nterdiction of communications between Italy and\nthe Reich until the gth, when its main effort\nwas switched to the close support of the 15th\nArmy Group’s offensive. During the first eight\ndays of the month, the various elements of\nM.A.T.A.F. continued to attack the same tar-\ngets as during March. In particular, the medium\nbombers flew nearly 400 sorties against the\nBrenner Line, their main targets being the\nbridges. By the gth of April the route was\nblocked in eleven places. Desert Air Force\nmeanwhile continued to attack the lower reaches\nof the north-east frontier routes and the lines\nacross the Venetian plain. On the eve of the\nAllied offensive, the north-east frontier zone re-\nmained well disrupted, and no through traffic\nwas possible across the Venetian plain. The\nstate of interdiction in the Po Valley itself was\nalso very satisfactory. The XXII T.A.C.\nfighter-bombers paid a considerable amount of\nattention to the east-west lines north of the Po\nand their connecting lines, while the medium\nbombers made’ fairly constant attacks on\nbridges.\n\n203. M.A.S.A.F.’s April effort against the\nenemy’s railway communications in northern\nItaly was further increased. During the four\ndays prior to the opening of the Army’s offen-\nsive on the gth April the heavy bombers dropped\n2,000 tons of bombs on bridges and marshalling\nyards on the Brenner Pass route and also\nattacked bridges, marshalling yards and loco-\nmotive depots on lines to the west of the route\nand a marshalling yard.on the Piedicolle route.\nEver after the offensive started, M.A.S.A.F.\ncontinued to bomb the Italian railway system,\nin addition to providing close support to our\nadvancing troops.\n\nEnemy Repair Organisation.\n\n204. The enemy’s chief means of combating\nthe interdiction programme was a large and\nvery efficient repair organisation.\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 OCTOBER, 1951\n\n205. He showed extraordinary energy in\neffecting repairs and much resourcefulness in\nreducing the vulnerability of targets. Troops\nwhich were held up by the breaks were pressed\ninto the repair gangs; bridges were sometimes\nreplaced in 48 hours and craters were filled in\nin far less time. -In spite of frantic efforts\nat repair work and brilliant organisation, the\nenemy was never able to counter our air attacks\nsufficiently to make an appreciable difference\nto his desperate situation. e whole area was\nsterilized and the German Army was becoming\nmore and more impotent because of the im-\npossibility of movement—even by night.\n\n206. During the latter part of 1944 the enemy\nresorted to deception to supplement his repairs\nand it certainly became a very clever and much\nused means to increase the flow of traffic. At\nCalcinato, a span of the bridge was constantly\nseen to be out during air reconnaissance, but\naccumulated evidence proved that traffic was\npassing over at night. In fact, when a night\nreconnaissance was flown, the missing span was\nrevealed in place. This particular bridge at\nCalcinato became known as the first ‘‘ night\noperational ’’ bridge.\n\n207. As our attacks increased in number, so\nthe number of ‘‘ night operational ’’ bridges\nincreased also, During April eleven of these\nbridges were noted; ten of them were attacked\nand put out of service for varying lengths of\ntime,\n\n208. Another method of deception used by\nthe enemy was to maintain the unserviceability\nof selected bridges when there was no imme-\ndiate need for their use. Certain damaged\nbridges were repaired up to a certain point—\nleft so that they looked quite impassable—yet\ncould be made passable in a few hours.\n\n209. Full maintenance of the interdiction de-\npended on the weather. Good weather made\nit possible to achieve complete success, but in\nperiods of bad weather prohibiting flying,\nrepairs were rapidly carried out by the enemy\nand supplies adequate, for some days hurriedly\npassed through. In spite of these weather diffi-\nculties, the railways (as has been shown) were\nblocked almost continuously.\n\nInterdiction of road communications.\n\n210. Road movement was also dealt with in\na systematic way. The whole area of enemy\noccupied Italy was divided up into a number\nof areas and regularly patrolled by aircraft of\nTactical Air Force both by day and by night.\nTn this way, it was possible to keep an accurate\ncheck on all enemy road movements and to\nattack road transport wherever it was found.\nHowever, German road movements were\nstrictly limited because of the shortage of oil\nfuel. Oxen were used to tow lorries, and so\nvaluable had even small quantities of petrol\nbecome that members of the German 98th Divi-\nsion were offered a reward of a thousand\ncigarettes if they returned from a patrol with\na tin of captured: petrol.\n\nInterdiction of water communications.\n\n21x. As a result of the attacks on his other\nforms of communication the enemy made an\nincreasing use of waterborne traffic. Shipping\ntravelling by night carried supplies from Trieste\nand the Istrian ports, ‘while barges’ were used\nin the waterways of North-East Italy to support\n",

The switching of the main air effort\nnorthwards against the’ frontier routes implied\nthat more freedom of movement than formerly\nwas permitted the enemy in the Po Valley.\nDuring the period of static ground operations,\nhowever, this was considered of minor import-\nance. Nevertheless, a considerable M.A.T.A.F.\neffort was continued against the principal lines\nof communication immediately behind the battle\narea, especially when bad weather prevented\noperations further afield. During the period,\nsorties were flown against the Po River zone\nand in the Mincio, Oglia and Adda river zones,\nbranching northwards from the Po River. Par-\nticular attention was paid to the disruption of\nlines leading to Milan, Turin, and Genoa in\norder to hinder the transportation of looted\nindustrial and agricultural products bound for\nthe Reich. Also in March, the night intruder\neffort was increased considerably, particularly\nin the form of a greater number of attacks on\ndamaged bridges and diversions to demoralise\nthe enemy’s repair gangs. Generally, both the\nday and night attacking aircraft in the Po\nvalley were increasingly concerned with de-\nstroying rail and road traffic and rolling stock\nin marshalling yards rather than the wrecking\nof the railway system itself.\n\nAir Effort in April.\n\n202. In April M.A.T.A.F. maintained the in-\nterdiction of communications between Italy and\nthe Reich until the gth, when its main effort\nwas switched to the close support of the 15th\nArmy Group’s offensive. During the first eight\ndays of the month, the various elements of\nM.A.T.A.F. continued to attack the same tar-\ngets as during March. In particular, the medium\nbombers flew nearly 400 sorties against the\nBrenner Line, their main targets being the\nbridges. By the gth of April the route was\nblocked in eleven places. Desert Air Force\nmeanwhile continued to attack the lower reaches\nof the north-east frontier routes and the lines\nacross the Venetian plain. On the eve of the\nAllied offensive, the north-east frontier zone re-\nmained well disrupted, and no through traffic\nwas possible across the Venetian plain. The\nstate of interdiction in the Po Valley itself was\nalso very satisfactory. The XXII T.A.C.\nfighter-bombers paid a considerable amount of\nattention to the east-west lines north of the Po\nand their connecting lines, while the medium\nbombers made’ fairly constant attacks on\nbridges.\n\n203. M.A.S.A.F.’s April effort against the\nenemy’s railway communications in northern\nItaly was further increased. During the four\ndays prior to the opening of the Army’s offen-\nsive on the gth April the heavy bombers dropped\n2,000 tons of bombs on bridges and marshalling\nyards on the Brenner Pass route and also\nattacked bridges, marshalling yards and loco-\nmotive depots on lines to the west of the route\nand a marshalling yard.on the Piedicolle route.\nEver after the offensive started, M.A.S.A.F.\ncontinued to bomb the Italian railway system,\nin addition to providing close support to our\nadvancing troops.\n\nEnemy Repair Organisation.\n\n204. The enemy’s chief means of combating\nthe interdiction programme was a large and\nvery efficient repair organisation.\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 OCTOBER, 1951\n\n205. He showed extraordinary energy in\neffecting repairs and much resourcefulness in\nreducing the vulnerability of targets. Troops\nwhich were held up by the breaks were pressed\ninto the repair gangs; bridges were sometimes\nreplaced in 48 hours and craters were filled in\nin far less time. -In spite of frantic efforts\nat repair work and brilliant organisation, the\nenemy was never able to counter our air attacks\nsufficiently to make an appreciable difference\nto his desperate situation. e whole area was\nsterilized and the German Army was becoming\nmore and more impotent because of the im-\npossibility of movement—even by night.\n\n206. During the latter part of 1944 the enemy\nresorted to deception to supplement his repairs\nand it certainly became a very clever and much\nused means to increase the flow of traffic. At\nCalcinato, a span of the bridge was constantly\nseen to be out during air reconnaissance, but\naccumulated evidence proved that traffic was\npassing over at night. In fact, when a night\nreconnaissance was flown, the missing span was\nrevealed in place. This particular bridge at\nCalcinato became known as the first ‘‘ night\noperational ’’ bridge.\n\n207. As our attacks increased in number, so\nthe number of ‘‘ night operational ’’ bridges\nincreased also, During April eleven of these\nbridges were noted; ten of them were attacked\nand put out of service for varying lengths of\ntime,\n\n208. Another method of deception used by\nthe enemy was to maintain the unserviceability\nof selected bridges when there was no imme-\ndiate need for their use. Certain damaged\nbridges were repaired up to a certain point—\nleft so that they looked quite impassable—yet\ncould be made passable in a few hours.\n\n209. Full maintenance of the interdiction de-\npended on the weather. Good weather made\nit possible to achieve complete success, but in\nperiods of bad weather prohibiting flying,\nrepairs were rapidly carried out by the enemy\nand supplies adequate, for some days hurriedly\npassed through. In spite of these weather diffi-\nculties, the railways (as has been shown) were\nblocked almost continuously.\n\nInterdiction of road communications.\n\n210. Road movement was also dealt with in\na systematic way. The whole area of enemy\noccupied Italy was divided up into a number\nof areas and regularly patrolled by aircraft of\nTactical Air Force both by day and by night.\nTn this way, it was possible to keep an accurate\ncheck on all enemy road movements and to\nattack road transport wherever it was found.\nHowever, German road movements were\nstrictly limited because of the shortage of oil\nfuel. Oxen were used to tow lorries, and so\nvaluable had even small quantities of petrol\nbecome that members of the German 98th Divi-\nsion were offered a reward of a thousand\ncigarettes if they returned from a patrol with\na tin of captured: petrol.\n\nInterdiction of water communications.\n\n21x. As a result of the attacks on his other\nforms of communication the enemy made an\nincreasing use of waterborne traffic. Shipping\ntravelling by night carried supplies from Trieste\nand the Istrian ports, ‘while barges’ were used\nin the waterways of North-East Italy to support\n",

For instance,\nGeneral von Senger, Corps Commander of the\nGerman XIV Panzer Corps, stated:—‘‘ The\neffect of Allied air attacks on the frontier\nroutes of Italy made the fuel and am-\ntmunition situation very critical.” Again,\nGeneral von Vietinghoff, German Supreme\nCommander, Italian Theatre, stated:—‘‘ Rail\ntraffic was struck in the most protracted\nfashion by the destruction of bridges.\nRestoration of bridges required much time; the\nlarger bridge sites were detoured, or the supplies\nwere reloaded. With the increasing intensity\nof the air attacks, especially on the stretch of the\nBrenner, the damaged sections were so\ngreat and so numerous that this stretch,\ndespite the best of repair organisation and the\nemployment of the most powerful rebuilding\neffort, became ever worse and was only locally\nand temporarily usable.”\n\nc\n\n5575\n\n217. The interdiction policy was also largely\nsuccessful in its other objective—that of pre-\nventing any large scale withdrawal from the\nItalian front. In an attempt to provide\nreinforcements for the Western front, the enemy\ndid in fact withdraw three divisions by the end\nof March, but it must have been a heartbreak-\ning affair for him. The distance they had to\ntravel from the front to Austria was about 150\nmiles and given uninterrupted facilities, this\nshould have taken them about five days. The\nfirst, the 356th, Division, took three weeks; the\nsecond, the 16th S.S. Division, took a month;\nwhile the third, the 715th Division, also took a\nmonth. Perhaps the most significant fact was\nthat these divisions left much of their heavy\nequipment behind them.\n\n218. It can be stated with complete confid-\nence that the success of the interdiction policy\nwas a major factor contributing to the defeat of\nthe enemy in the Italian theatre.

This Part of my despatch covers the\nperiod from April gth to May 2nd—the twenty-\nfour days in which German power in the Italian\ntheatre was completely destroyed. It falls into\nthree main parts; a section on the planning for\nthe offensive, a section on the use of air power\nduring the battle, and a section on the battle\nitself.\n\n220. In my description of the battle, I have\nattempted to relate the air activities to the\nparticular activities on the ground to which they\npertained. In some cases, it has been possible\nto do this by a day to day narrative, taking\nair and ground activities together. In other\ncases, a day to day narrative, to be clear,\nwould require to be more detailed than is de-\nsirable for the purposes of this despatch, and\nin such instances, I have taken a complete\nphase of the ground activities over a period\nof days and then followed it by a description\nof the air effort connected with it.\n\n2a1, Using this treatment, the description of\nthe battle falls into five parts:\n\n(a) The Eighth Army battle from gth to\n14th April, which breached the Senio and\nSanterno River lines. This is described day\nby day. -\n\n(b) The Fifth Army battle from rqth to\nzoth April, in which the Fifth Army fought\nits way to the Po Valley. The initial part\nof this is treated day by day, and the latter\npart as a complete phase.\n\n(c) The Eighth Army battle from 15th to\nzoth April, in which a route was forced\nthrough the Argenta Gap. This is treated\nas a complete phase. .\n\n(d) The combined Eighth and Fifth\nArmies’ offensives from 21st to 24th April,\nin which the enemy tried to escape across\nthe Po. This is treated as a complete phase.\n\n(e) The final stages of the battle, from 25th\nApril to and May, treated as a complete\n",

With the increasing intensity\nof the air attacks, especially on the stretch of the\nBrenner, the damaged sections were so\ngreat and so numerous that this stretch,\ndespite the best of repair organisation and the\nemployment of the most powerful rebuilding\neffort, became ever worse and was only locally\nand temporarily usable.”\n\nc\n\n5575\n\n217. The interdiction policy was also largely\nsuccessful in its other objective—that of pre-\nventing any large scale withdrawal from the\nItalian front. In an attempt to provide\nreinforcements for the Western front, the enemy\ndid in fact withdraw three divisions by the end\nof March, but it must have been a heartbreak-\ning affair for him. The distance they had to\ntravel from the front to Austria was about 150\nmiles and given uninterrupted facilities, this\nshould have taken them about five days. The\nfirst, the 356th, Division, took three weeks; the\nsecond, the 16th S.S. Division, took a month;\nwhile the third, the 715th Division, also took a\nmonth. Perhaps the most significant fact was\nthat these divisions left much of their heavy\nequipment behind them.\n\n218. It can be stated with complete confid-\nence that the success of the interdiction policy\nwas a major factor contributing to the defeat of\nthe enemy in the Italian theatre. Air power had\nsuccessfully accomplished the task of preparing\nthe way for the Army’s offensive.\n\nPart V.\n\nTHE FINAL OFFENSIVE IN THE\nITALIAN THEATRE.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\naig. This Part of my despatch covers the\nperiod from April gth to May 2nd—the twenty-\nfour days in which German power in the Italian\ntheatre was completely destroyed. It falls into\nthree main parts; a section on the planning for\nthe offensive, a section on the use of air power\nduring the battle, and a section on the battle\nitself.\n\n220. In my description of the battle, I have\nattempted to relate the air activities to the\nparticular activities on the ground to which they\npertained. In some cases, it has been possible\nto do this by a day to day narrative, taking\nair and ground activities together. In other\ncases, a day to day narrative, to be clear,\nwould require to be more detailed than is de-\nsirable for the purposes of this despatch, and\nin such instances, I have taken a complete\nphase of the ground activities over a period\nof days and then followed it by a description\nof the air effort connected with it.\n\n2a1, Using this treatment, the description of\nthe battle falls into five parts:\n\n(a) The Eighth Army battle from gth to\n14th April, which breached the Senio and\nSanterno River lines. This is described day\nby day. -\n\n(b) The Fifth Army battle from rqth to\nzoth April, in which the Fifth Army fought\nits way to the Po Valley. The initial part\nof this is treated day by day, and the latter\npart as a complete phase.\n\n(c) The Eighth Army battle from 15th to\nzoth April, in which a route was forced\nthrough the Argenta Gap. This is treated\nas a complete phase. .\n\n(d) The combined Eighth and Fifth\nArmies’ offensives from 21st to 24th April,\nin which the enemy tried to escape across\nthe Po. This is treated as a complete phase.\n\n(e) The final stages of the battle, from 25th\nApril to and May, treated as a complete\n",

It should, perhaps, be mentioned that\nplans were made, and all preparatory action\ntaken for an airborne assault at brigade strength\nin the initial phases of the battle. Since this\nassault was not carried out, for reasons of an\nArmy nature, J have made no further reference\nto it.\n\nPLANNING FOR THE BATTLE.\nThe Army Plan.\n\n223. The task before the 15th Army Group\nwas to destroy some 25 divisions of the enemy\nbefore they could retire north-east into the\nAlps towards Austria, and prolong the struggle\nfrom there.\n\n224. The task was a formidable one. On\nthis west flank, the enemy was firmly planted\nin the rugged mountains. On his east flank\nhe was solidly entrenched behind the Senio,\nSanterno, Sillaro and Idice rivers, all compara-\ntively wide and steeply banked; an attacker\nthere faced a maze of ditches, dikes and flooded\nfields.\n\n225. Beyond these rivers there were still\nothers which made good defence lines for the\nenemy—the Po and the Adige, both of which\nwere already fortified. Beyond these again,\nwere more river lines, and mountains, across\nthe road to Austria.\n\n226. Against these advantages the enemy was\nshort of transport, his communications were\nunder constant air attack, his air power was\nnegligible, he had very little petrol, and he\nwas woefully inferior in tanks and guns. The\nrelentless air attacks to which he had been\nsubjected in recent months had destroyed his\nmobility and had decisively undermined his\nwhole powers of resistance.\n\n227. It was certain that he would fight des-\nperately to retain the Po Valley. If, therefore,\nthe 15th Army Group could achieve a quick\nbreak-through and a rapid exploitation, huge\nenemy forces might well be destroyed or cap-\ntured before they could retire across the Po.\n\n228. The possible lines of attack were\nseverely restricted. The 15th Army Group’s\nfront now ran from the Comacchio lagoon on\nthe Adriatic to just below Massa on the\nLigurian Sea skirting south of Bologna. The\nFifth Army held the mountainous zig-zag Jine\nfrom Massa to Monte Grande, ten miles south-\neast of Bologna; the Eighth Army line ran\nsouth-east from Monte Grande, across the\nSillaro and Santerno Rivers, and then north-\neast along the Senio’s south bank to the\nsouthern shore of Lake Comacchio and the\nAdriatic.\n\n229. It was decided that the main effort of\n15th Army Group should be launched in the\nBologna area by the Fifth Army, since once\nthe latter reached the Po valley, the terrain\nin their front favoured a quick break-through\nand a rapid advance,\n\n230. This main thrust by the Fifth Army was\nto be preceded by an Eighth Army attack, with\nthe object of drawing enemy reserves away\nfrom the Fifth Army front.\n\n231. The plan therefore fell into three main\nparts, which were to follow each other without\nany pause. In the first stage, each Army would\nbreak through the heavily defended enemy\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 OCTOBER, 195i\n\nlines opposing it—the Eighth Army first,\nbreaching Senio and the Santerno lines and at-\ntacking towards Bastia and Budrio; the Fifth\nArmy second, breaking out of the mountains\nand into the Po Valley, with the secondary\nmission of capturing or isolating Bologna.\n\n232. The second stage provided for a break-\nthrough by either or both Armies to encircle\nthe enemy forces south of the Po, The Eighth\nArmy was to go through the Argenta Gap to\nseize the Po crossings at Ferrara and Bondeno,\nand there make contact with Fifth Army\ncolumns exploiting north-east from Route 9\ndown the corridor north of the Reno. A secon-\n\nFifth Army effort was to be made north-\nward on Ostiglia.\n\n233. In the third stage, operations were to\nbe directed toward crossing the Po and ex-\nploiting northward, especially with the object\nof capturing Verona. If the situation permitted,\nfurther exploitation toward and across the Adige\nRiver was to follow.\n\n234. As a prelude to this main attack, two\n‘important subsidiary operations were to be\ncarried out. The first of these was an attack\nagainst Massa, on the extreme left of the battle\nfront, in order to keep the Germans in that area\noccupied. The second was an amphibious\noperation to capture the isthmus projecting be-\ntween Lake Comacchio and the Adriatic, which\nwould give the Eighth Army free access to the\nLake, and prepare the way for further am-\nphibious operations which were to aid in\nopening the road through the Argenta Gap to\nFerrara.\n\nThe Naval Plan.\n\n235. The Navy plan for the final offensive\nwas drawn up to give the Army as much sup-\nport as possible. On the Eighth Army front\nthe capture of the Argenta gap would require\nan assault in tank landing vessels, across the\nflooded country surrounding the Valle di\nComacchio. A Naval party was to be formed\nto assist the Army in training L.V.T. (landing\nvessel, tank) squadrons, and to act as navi-\ngational leaders in the assault.\n\n236. The coast northwards of Ravenna was\ngenerally unsuitable for amphibious landings.\nThe enemy was, however, sensitive in this area,\nand a concentration of tank landing craft in\nthe Ravenna-Porto Corsini Canal, combined\nwith a dummy assault and shore bombardment\nby landing craft at Porto Garibaldi, was to be\nundertaken in order to delay the movement\ntowards the battle area of the coastal defence\ndivision stationed there.\n\n237. On the west coast, gun support to the\nadvance of the Fifth Army along the coast was\nto be given by cruisers and destroyers. The\nclearing of a gunfire support area between\nViareggio and Spezia would entail further\nminesweeping.\n\n238. A flotilla of assault landing craft\nmanned by Royal Marines was to be carried\noverland from Ancona on tank transporters,\nand launched into the Po River to assist in\nthe crossing. .\n\n239.

The Air Force plan was to give maxi-\nmum assistance to the Armies by close support\noperations; to prevent the withdrawal of the\nenemy north of the River Po; and, when the\nenemy was in sufficient concentration, to en-\nsure his destruction.\n\n241. To achieve these aims, the whole\nstriking power of M.A.T.A.F. and M.A.S.A.F.\nwas to be used, support of the land forces\nbecoming the over-riding priority for both Air\nForces as soon as the offensive began.\n\n242. In general the Desert Air Force was to\nsupport the Eighth Army and XXII Tactical\nAir Command the Fifth Army, although one\nwould lend assistance to the other as the ground\nsituation required, and as determined by H.Q.\nTactical Air Force. The prior objective of these\ntwo forces was to give close support in the\nimmediate battle areas, The 57th Bombard-\nment Wing of medium bombers was to be used\non either Army front for close support opera-\ntions as the situation required.\n\n243. The Strategic Air Force was to be used\nin close support operations at the beginning\nof the offensives by each Army. Thereafter,\nit was to be available to attack communica-\ntions targets in Italy, nominated by the Com-\nmanding General M.A.T.A.F., in order to\nmaintain the interdiction already accomplished\nwhile M.A.T.A.F, forces were employed upon\nimmediate battlefield objectives.\n\n244. The opening of the offensive by the\nEighth Army was conditional on a preceding\nair assault by both M.A.S.A.F. and M.A.T.A.F.\nEntry into the battle of the Fifth Army was to\nbe dependent upon the gains made by the\nEighth Army, and was therefore to be made\nwhether or not it was possible to precede it\nwith an air bombardment.\n\n245. Preceding the 8th Army offensive some\n800 Fortresses and Liberators were to bomb\ntroop concentrations and gun installation areas\n3,000 yards behind the enemy front line on\nD-day. Roughly 170 medium bombers were\nalso to attack gun areas, after which 700 fighter-\nbombers were to follow with attacks on head-\nquarters buildings, strong points and targets of\nmoment. Approximately 100 Boston, Balti-\nmore and Mosquito aircraft and the whole of\nNo. 205 Group were to maintain the attacks\nduring the night hours.\n\n246. In addition to the close support opera-\ntions full tactical and artillery reconnaissances\nwere to be flown and four ‘‘ Rover ’’* stations\nmade available.\n\n247, This air programme was planned for\nfour days and thereafter as required. © Its\nexecution, together with that for the 5th Army\noffensive, is described fully in the narrative of\nthe final offensive.\n\nTue Battie.\n\nPreliminary Phase.\n\n248. At 0300 hours on 2nd April the pre-\nliminary phase of the battle began. Com-\nmandos in powered storm boats attacked at its\nwestern shore the Spit that divides Lake\n\n“ The ‘Rover’’ system was used for bringing air-\ncraft on to targets visible to a controller who was\nusually in a specially adapted armoured car or jeep—\nso that close support aircraft could be up to the minute\nwith a rapidly advancing ground force\n\n5577\n\nComacchio from the Adriatic, After two days\nfighting, the Spit had been taken, together with\nnearly 1,000 prisoners, thus eliminating enemy\nobservation of the Eighth Army's right flank.\nThis attack was helped, especially on the 2nd\nApril, by fighter bombers and medium\nbombers, who bombed gun positions, troops,\nand other battlefield targets. ,\n\n249. A further attack was made on the night\nof the 6th April across the Reno River on the\nLake’s southern shore and by the 8th, a bridge-\nhead had been secured across the River. These\ntwo operations had secured the Eighth Army’s\nright flank for their main attack.\n\n250. On the 5th April, on the extreme left\nof the battle-front, an operation was under-\ntaken to capture Massa. This was a diversion\nto keep the Germans busy in the west. Air\nsupport for this operation was provided by\nfighter bombers and medium bombers. The\nlatter also flew missions against coastal guns\nnear La Spezia which threatened to menace\nthe Army advance up the western coast.\n\nTue EicHTH ARMY OFFENSIVE.\n\n251. The first phase was to break the series\nof river lines—Senio, Santerno, Reno and\nSillaro—in which the enemy was very strongly\nentrenched. The Air Forces’ task was to make\nthese defence lines one by one untenable. -\n\n252.°The first main assault began on oth\nApril when M.A.S.A.F. was used to pound the\nenemy’s front line positions. Some 800\nFortresses and Liberators of 15th Air Force\nattacked troop concentrations between the\nRivers Senio and Santerno. Medium bombers\nsupplemented the attack and concentrated on\ngun positions. These in turn were followed by\nthe full weight of Tactical Air Force’ fighter-\nbombers, who bombed, straffed and fired\nrockets at enemy positions to the West of the\nSenio River and along the floodbanks of the\nriver itself.\n\n253. At I920 hours the Eighth Army’s V\nCorps on the right and the II Polish Corps on\nthe left opened the assault on the Senio posi-\ntions near Lugo. By nightfall a bridgehead\nhad been gained and bridges thrown across the\ntiver.\n\n254. The effect of the preliminary air bom-\nbardment can be judged from the fact that, in\nspite of extremely difficult terrain and formid-\nable defences, the army gained its objectives\nwith remarkably light losses. The New Zealand\nDivision, for instance, crossed the Senio with-\nout a single casualty, killed or wounded.\n\nNight oth-roth April—Eighth Army Front.\n255. Following up the heavy raids of the\nafternoon, 72 Liberators of No. 205 Group\ndropped a further 200 tons of bombs on forti-\nfied positions along the Santerno River, to\nwhich the enemy had retreated after the heavy\nair attack in the afternoon and to which he had\nalso brought forward two reserve divisions.\nThis raid was in preparation for the Army\nattack on the Santerno positions which was to\ntake place the following day. The employ-\nment of heavy bombers by night so close to\nour own positions was a new development, and\nundoubtedly surprised and dismayed the\nenemy. The attack was carried out within a\nperiod of four minutes and not a single bomb\n",

The Air Force plan was to give maxi-\nmum assistance to the Armies by close support\noperations; to prevent the withdrawal of the\nenemy north of the River Po; and, when the\nenemy was in sufficient concentration, to en-\nsure his destruction.\n\n241. To achieve these aims, the whole\nstriking power of M.A.T.A.F. and M.A.S.A.F.\nwas to be used, support of the land forces\nbecoming the over-riding priority for both Air\nForces as soon as the offensive began.\n\n242. In general the Desert Air Force was to\nsupport the Eighth Army and XXII Tactical\nAir Command the Fifth Army, although one\nwould lend assistance to the other as the ground\nsituation required, and as determined by H.Q.\nTactical Air Force. The prior objective of these\ntwo forces was to give close support in the\nimmediate battle areas, The 57th Bombard-\nment Wing of medium bombers was to be used\non either Army front for close support opera-\ntions as the situation required.\n\n243. The Strategic Air Force was to be used\nin close support operations at the beginning\nof the offensives by each Army.

The following morning, again preceded\nby a heavy air assault by fighter-bombers, the\ninfantry pushed forward to the line of the Lugo\nCanal, and by mid-day had reached it in\nstrength. New Zealand troops attacked across\nthe Lugo Canal soon after mid-day and by the\nevening had reached the Santerno River; at\nthe same time Lugo town itself was captured.\nFurther South the Polish Corps also reached the\nLugo Canal.\n\n258. In the afternoon the XVth Air Force\nmade an even greater effort in support of the\nground forces, despatching 1,261 bombers and\nfighters to continue the attack on the Santerno\ndefences begun by No. 205 Group the previous\nnight. The object was again to disorganise the\nenemy and attack troop concentrations, gun\npositions and defence installations in the area\nimmediately ahead of the Eighth Army.\n\n259. Desert Air Force flew 662 sorties during\nthe day of which 608 were in close support of\nV Corps and Polcorps. Four squadrons of\nMarauders of the S.A.A.F. bombed gun areas\nat Menate, near the South shore of Lake\nComacchio.\n\n260. On the Polcorps sector, attacks were\nmade at Solarolo, Gaiano, Bagnara and against\ngun areas on both sides of the Santerno. The\nMordano bridge over the Santerno was bombed\nby Thunderbolts, scoring four direct hits on\nthe bridge as well as others on the approaches.\n\nNight toth-11th April—Eighth Army Front.\n\n261.

During the early hours of the morning\nan attack by the army was launched on the\nextreme right flank from the bridgehead across\nthe Reno gained in the operations preliminary\nto the main assault and reached a point some\nfive miles south-east of Argenta, to the north of\nRoute 16.

In fact\nhis powers of movement had been practically\ndestroyed by our previous heavy air attacks in\npreparation for this battle. Artillery recon-\nnaissance aircraft secured the engagement of\nhostile batteries throughout the day, and photo\nreconnaissance aircraft covered the battle area,\nFerrara, Rovigo marshalling yards and any port\nactivity in the North. The day’s activity was\ntypical of the work carried out by the Air Force\nduring the offensive.\n\nNight 11th/12th April_8th Army Front.\n\n264. Further bombing was carried out by\nNo. 205 Group when 225 tons of bombs were\ndropped on enemy concentrations, defences and\ndumps in the Bastia area, some two to three\nthousand yards in front of our own troops.\nThe success of these attacks especially on the\nenemy’s communications caused him to aban-\ndon Highway 16 where it crosses the Reno and\ndivert his withdrawal to a point ten miles\nnorth-west of Bastia.\n\n265.

Further south, Polish forces attacked\nup Route g, capturing Castel Bolognese and\nin the late afternoon, Mordano on the west\nbank of the Santerno,\n\n268. On this day the majority of the 729\nsorties flown by D.A.F. helped the New\nZealand and Polish Forces to consolidate and\nenlarge their bridgeheads across the Santerno\nRiver. One hundred and six sorties were\ndirected against targets in the immediate battle\narea.

During the night No. 205 Group\nattacked the key communications centre of\nArgenta on Route 16, which was now being\nthreatened by the Eighth Army’s thrust north\nand south of the road. The destruction was\nvery great; roads were cratered and blocked\nwith rubble thus impeding the enemy’s use of\nthis line of communication.\n\n270.

The following morning, again preceded\nby a heavy air assault by fighter-bombers, the\ninfantry pushed forward to the line of the Lugo\nCanal, and by mid-day had reached it in\nstrength. New Zealand troops attacked across\nthe Lugo Canal soon after mid-day and by the\nevening had reached the Santerno River; at\nthe same time Lugo town itself was captured.\nFurther South the Polish Corps also reached the\nLugo Canal.\n\n258. In the afternoon the XVth Air Force\nmade an even greater effort in support of the\nground forces, despatching 1,261 bombers and\nfighters to continue the attack on the Santerno\ndefences begun by No. 205 Group the previous\nnight. The object was again to disorganise the\nenemy and attack troop concentrations, gun\npositions and defence installations in the area\nimmediately ahead of the Eighth Army.\n\n259. Desert Air Force flew 662 sorties during\nthe day of which 608 were in close support of\nV Corps and Polcorps. Four squadrons of\nMarauders of the S.A.A.F. bombed gun areas\nat Menate, near the South shore of Lake\nComacchio.\n\n260. On the Polcorps sector, attacks were\nmade at Solarolo, Gaiano, Bagnara and against\ngun areas on both sides of the Santerno. The\nMordano bridge over the Santerno was bombed\nby Thunderbolts, scoring four direct hits on\nthe bridge as well as others on the approaches.\n\nNight toth-11th April—Eighth Army Front.\n\n261.

During the early hours of the morning\nan attack by the army was launched on the\nextreme right flank from the bridgehead across\nthe Reno gained in the operations preliminary\nto the main assault and reached a point some\nfive miles south-east of Argenta, to the north of\nRoute 16.

During the day and through thé follow-\ning night the Eighth Army fought for the\nSanterno crossings and by the morning of the\nath April had considerable forces across the\nriver.

Spitfires and\nMustangs were constantly straffing enemy posi-\ntions. Search by tactical reconnaissance air-\ncraft for enemy movement in and behind the\nbattle area again revealed very little. In fact\nhis powers of movement had been practically\ndestroyed by our previous heavy air attacks in\npreparation for this battle. Artillery recon-\nnaissance aircraft secured the engagement of\nhostile batteries throughout the day, and photo\nreconnaissance aircraft covered the battle area,\nFerrara, Rovigo marshalling yards and any port\nactivity in the North. The day’s activity was\ntypical of the work carried out by the Air Force\nduring the offensive.\n\nNight 11th/12th April_8th Army Front.\n\n264. Further bombing was carried out by\nNo. 205 Group when 225 tons of bombs were\ndropped on enemy concentrations, defences and\ndumps in the Bastia area, some two to three\nthousand yards in front of our own troops.\nThe success of these attacks especially on the\nenemy’s communications caused him to aban-\ndon Highway 16 where it crosses the Reno and\ndivert his withdrawal to a point ten miles\nnorth-west of Bastia.\n\n265. Desert Air Force night intruders con-\ntinued their attacks im the battle area and\ncommunications behind it.\n\nDay 12th April_8ih Army Front.\n\n266. During the day the bridgeheads already\ngained across the Santerno were consolidated\ninto one, and a reserve division moved up\nthrough its northern part with the object of\nproducing a local pincer movement against\nBastia in conjunction with the force attacking\nnorth of Route 16.\n\n267. Further south, Polish forces attacked\nup Route g, capturing Castel Bolognese and\nin the late afternoon, Mordano on the west\nbank of the Santerno,\n\n268. On this day the majority of the 729\nsorties flown by D.A.F. helped the New\nZealand and Polish Forces to consolidate and\nenlarge their bridgeheads across the Santerno\nRiver. One hundred and six sorties were\ndirected against targets in the immediate battle\narea. The usual round of attacks on gun posi-\ntions and on tanks took place with considerable\nsuccess.\n\nNight 12th/13th April—8th Army Front.\n\n269. During the night No. 205 Group\nattacked the key communications centre of\nArgenta on Route 16, which was now being\nthreatened by the Eighth Army’s thrust north\nand south of the road. The destruction was\nvery great; roads were cratered and blocked\nwith rubble thus impeding the enemy’s use of\nthis line of communication.\n\n270. Bostons, Baltimores and Mosquitoes\ncontinued their vigil throughout the night,\npatrolling the battle area, the Po River cross-\nings and intruding further ‘North.\n\nDay 13th April_8th Army Front.\n\n271. At dawn on the 13th April yet another .\namphibious assault was launched behind the\nenemy’s left flank on the north-western shore\nof Lake Comacchio.

The bulk of the 766 sorties in the tac-\ntical area on the 13th were devoted to direct\nsupport of the amphibious landing on the right\nflank. One notable incident during the day\nwas when Spitbombers saw a Tiger tank dis-\nappear into a house. They bombed the house\nand produced a large explosion.\n\n273.

At dawn the 2nd New Zealand Division\nattacked over the Sillaro River due east of\nMassa Lombarda and towards Medicina, and\nby mid-day had established a firm bridgehead.\nTo the north, Conselice was finally occupied,\nwhile to the south, the Polish Corps captured\nImola on Route 9, and swept on towards Castel\nSan Pietro.\n\nSummary of the First Phase.\n\n276. Thus by the r4th April the first three\nof the river lines on which the enemy depended\nhad been breached, and the Eighth Army’s\nadvance was gathering momentum. On the\nright flank the threat to the Argenta gap was\ngrowing, and the ground forces would soon\nbe able to break out along Route 16 to the Po\nRiver. On the Eighth Army’s left flank good\nprogress was being made along Route g to-\nwards Bologna,\n\n277. The time had therefore come to launch\nthe Fifth Army into the Po Valley to be the\nleft thrust of the pincer movement aimed at\nencircling the enemy south of the Po. On\nthe morning of the 14th April the Fifth Army\njoined in the general offensive.\n\nTue Firte ARMy OFFENSIVE.\nDay 14th April—Fifth Army Front.\n\n278. The attack was opened by the IV Corps\nat 09.45 hours some 20 miles south-west of\nBologna in the mountainous country just west\nof Highway 64, which follows the upper valley\nof the Reno River. It was aimed at Mt, Pero,\nVergato and Montese. The attack was pre-\nceded by a forty-minute ‘‘ set piece ’’ air attack\nby fighter-bombers, and during the day XXII\nT.A.C. flew a total of 514 sorties, of which all\nbut 55 were on army support.\n\nDay 15th April_Fifth Army Front.\n\n279. A tremendous effort was made by the\nheavy bombers of 15th Air Force in the after-\nnoon, Every available aircraft that could\n\nD\n\n5579\n\npossibly be used—even some which had pre-\nviously been considered unfit for operations—\nwas pressed into service. A total of 1,790\nbombers and fighters were airborne. This force\nwas given two tasks. The first was to attack\naz targets nominated by the Fifth Army, such\nas command posts, dumps and enemy-occupied\nareas, in the area south of Bologna; the second\nwas to attack communications and stores tar-\ngets further north. Some 1,600 tons of bombs\nwere dropped by the first force, and some 800\ntons by the second. The effort by the heavy\nbombers was augmented by that of 258 medium\nbombers of Tactical Air Force, which attacked\nenemy reserve areas at Praduro on Route 64,\nand at Medicina, though the latter was more\nintimately concerned with Eighth Army opera-\ntions. Meanwhile, XXII T.A.C., in missions\nagainst targets along the front, including ground\npositions, command posts, occupied buildings\nand dumps, flew just under 500 sorties,\n\n280. By the evening of the r5th, Vergato\nand Montese had been captured, and during\nthe night, the Fifth Army II Corps, on the\nright of the 4th Corps, joined in the attack.\n\nGround and air effort, 16th to 19th April, Fifth\nArmy front. :\n281. During these four days, all the Fifth\nArmy forces were engaged in heavy fighting\namong the mountains which the enemy held so\nstrongly, but gradual progress was made to-\nwards Bologna. Immense assistance was given\nin this task by both Strategic and Tactical Air\nForce aircraft, and the heights guarding the\napproaches to Bologna became universally\nscarred and pitted with bomb craters,\n\n282. The planned assistance of the Strategic\nAir Force was largely foiled on the 16th by\ncloud over the Bologna area which prevented\npositive identification of targets, and only some\n200 tons of bombs were dropped. In the\nmeantime, XXII T.A.C, again directed almost\nits entire effort of some 500 sorties against\nbattlefield targets to the south and south-west\nof Bologna. On the 17th and 18th weather\nconditions were more favourable for accurate\nbombing, and in the course of the two days,\nXVth Air Force aircraft dropped a total of\n2,700 tons of bombs on tactical targets ahead\nof the advancing Fifth Army troops. The\nobjective, as in the preceding attacks, was the\nmaximum disorganisation of enemy forces, and\nthe destruction of equipment and installations,\nprior to an attack by Allied ground forces.\nAs in the case of previous attacks, virtually\nevery building in the areas attacked was\ndestroyed or heavily damaged. This effort\nwas supplemented by that of the medium\nbombers, while XXII T.A.C. continued to\ndevote almost all its attention to close support\nwork,\n\n283. The night of 16th/17th April provided\nNo. 205 Group with another communications\ntarget of importance. Casalecchio, which is\nlocated three miles south-west of Bologna,\noffered an excellent opportunity for the inter-\ndiction of the flow of German reserves from\nBologna which was attempting to stem the\nFifth Army advance. The raid was successful,\nthe road bridge in the town being destroyed,\nand much other damage being caused.\n",

The bulk of the 766 sorties in the tac-\ntical area on the 13th were devoted to direct\nsupport of the amphibious landing on the right\nflank. One notable incident during the day\nwas when Spitbombers saw a Tiger tank dis-\nappear into a house. They bombed the house\nand produced a large explosion.\n\n273. A Brigade Commander, commenting on\nan attack on a strong point by fighter-bombers,\nsaid, “‘ The resistance was completely broken.\nMy own troops were able to advance 1,000\nyards without resistance and roo prisoners were\ntaken after the bombing attack **\n\nNight 13th/14th April_8th Army Front.\n\n274. Heavy bombers of No. 205 Group were\nagain airborne to attack the town of. Porto\nMaggiore which was another key point on the\nroute through the Argenta Gap to the Po\nRiver, which the retreating Germans would\nhave to use. Desert Air Force’s contribution\nto the night’s effort was aimed at harassing\nenemy movement in and behind the battle area.\nMotor transport, barges, the Po River cross-\nings, and the road junction at Consandola were\nthe targets. During the night a Mosquito\nnight-fighter destroyed one F.W.190 and\ndamaged another.\n\nDay 14th April_8th Army Front.\n\n275. At dawn the 2nd New Zealand Division\nattacked over the Sillaro River due east of\nMassa Lombarda and towards Medicina, and\nby mid-day had established a firm bridgehead.\nTo the north, Conselice was finally occupied,\nwhile to the south, the Polish Corps captured\nImola on Route 9, and swept on towards Castel\nSan Pietro.\n\nSummary of the First Phase.\n\n276. Thus by the r4th April the first three\nof the river lines on which the enemy depended\nhad been breached, and the Eighth Army’s\nadvance was gathering momentum. On the\nright flank the threat to the Argenta gap was\ngrowing, and the ground forces would soon\nbe able to break out along Route 16 to the Po\nRiver. On the Eighth Army’s left flank good\nprogress was being made along Route g to-\nwards Bologna,\n\n277. The time had therefore come to launch\nthe Fifth Army into the Po Valley to be the\nleft thrust of the pincer movement aimed at\nencircling the enemy south of the Po. On\nthe morning of the 14th April the Fifth Army\njoined in the general offensive.\n\nTue Firte ARMy OFFENSIVE.\nDay 14th April—Fifth Army Front.\n\n278. The attack was opened by the IV Corps\nat 09.45 hours some 20 miles south-west of\nBologna in the mountainous country just west\nof Highway 64, which follows the upper valley\nof the Reno River. It was aimed at Mt, Pero,\nVergato and Montese. The attack was pre-\nceded by a forty-minute ‘‘ set piece ’’ air attack\nby fighter-bombers, and during the day XXII\nT.A.C. flew a total of 514 sorties, of which all\nbut 55 were on army support.\n\nDay 15th April_Fifth Army Front.\n\n279. A tremendous effort was made by the\nheavy bombers of 15th Air Force in the after-\nnoon, Every available aircraft that could\n\nD\n\n5579\n\npossibly be used—even some which had pre-\nviously been considered unfit for operations—\nwas pressed into service. A total of 1,790\nbombers and fighters were airborne. This force\nwas given two tasks. The first was to attack\naz targets nominated by the Fifth Army, such\nas command posts, dumps and enemy-occupied\nareas, in the area south of Bologna; the second\nwas to attack communications and stores tar-\ngets further north. Some 1,600 tons of bombs\nwere dropped by the first force, and some 800\ntons by the second. The effort by the heavy\nbombers was augmented by that of 258 medium\nbombers of Tactical Air Force, which attacked\nenemy reserve areas at Praduro on Route 64,\nand at Medicina, though the latter was more\nintimately concerned with Eighth Army opera-\ntions. Meanwhile, XXII T.A.C., in missions\nagainst targets along the front, including ground\npositions, command posts, occupied buildings\nand dumps, flew just under 500 sorties,\n\n280. By the evening of the r5th, Vergato\nand Montese had been captured, and during\nthe night, the Fifth Army II Corps, on the\nright of the 4th Corps, joined in the attack.\n\nGround and air effort, 16th to 19th April, Fifth\nArmy front. :\n281. During these four days, all the Fifth\nArmy forces were engaged in heavy fighting\namong the mountains which the enemy held so\nstrongly, but gradual progress was made to-\nwards Bologna. Immense assistance was given\nin this task by both Strategic and Tactical Air\nForce aircraft, and the heights guarding the\napproaches to Bologna became universally\nscarred and pitted with bomb craters,\n\n282. The planned assistance of the Strategic\nAir Force was largely foiled on the 16th by\ncloud over the Bologna area which prevented\npositive identification of targets, and only some\n200 tons of bombs were dropped. In the\nmeantime, XXII T.A.C, again directed almost\nits entire effort of some 500 sorties against\nbattlefield targets to the south and south-west\nof Bologna. On the 17th and 18th weather\nconditions were more favourable for accurate\nbombing, and in the course of the two days,\nXVth Air Force aircraft dropped a total of\n2,700 tons of bombs on tactical targets ahead\nof the advancing Fifth Army troops. The\nobjective, as in the preceding attacks, was the\nmaximum disorganisation of enemy forces, and\nthe destruction of equipment and installations,\nprior to an attack by Allied ground forces.\nAs in the case of previous attacks, virtually\nevery building in the areas attacked was\ndestroyed or heavily damaged. This effort\nwas supplemented by that of the medium\nbombers, while XXII T.A.C. continued to\ndevote almost all its attention to close support\nwork,\n\n283. The night of 16th/17th April provided\nNo. 205 Group with another communications\ntarget of importance. Casalecchio, which is\nlocated three miles south-west of Bologna,\noffered an excellent opportunity for the inter-\ndiction of the flow of German reserves from\nBologna which was attempting to stem the\nFifth Army advance. The raid was successful,\nthe road bridge in the town being destroyed,\nand much other damage being caused.\n",

The town was at the time being used as\na lateral communication route for enemy troops\nfacing the Eighth Anmy and as a normal rear\ncommunication route for those facing the Fifth\nArmy front. The attack was so successful that\nthereafter it could be said that Malalbergo\nceased to exist as a communications centre.\n\n295. The night intruders of Desert Air Force\nalso did extremely valuable work during this\nperiod, attacking villages immediately to the\nTear of the enemy’s front line, bombing cross-\nings, barges and pontoons on the Po and Adige\nRivers, adding weight to the attacks made by\nNo. 205 Group on key communication centres,\nand attacking all road movement to the\nenemy’s rear wherever it could be found.

The attack was extremely suc-\ncessful, and the roads of the town were entirely\ncovered with rubble and craters. The second\nattack—and this was the last made by the\nGroup in direct support of the Army—was\nmade on the night of rg9th/2oth April on Malal-\nbergo, on Route 64 between Bologna and Fer-\nrara. The town was at the time being used as\na lateral communication route for enemy troops\nfacing the Eighth Anmy and as a normal rear\ncommunication route for those facing the Fifth\nArmy front. The attack was so successful that\nthereafter it could be said that Malalbergo\nceased to exist as a communications centre.\n\n295. The night intruders of Desert Air Force\nalso did extremely valuable work during this\nperiod, attacking villages immediately to the\nTear of the enemy’s front line, bombing cross-\nings, barges and pontoons on the Po and Adige\nRivers, adding weight to the attacks made by\nNo. 205 Group on key communication centres,\nand attacking all road movement to the\nenemy’s rear wherever it could be found. A\ntribute to the work of these aircraft was paid\nby General Von Senger, commanding the Ger-\nman armoured forces, who stated: ‘‘ The night\nbombing ‘was very effective, and caused heavy\nlosses.’”\n\n296. A special air operation (bearing the code\nname “Herring ’’) added materially to the\nenemy’s discomfiture at the beginning of his\nretreat. This was on the night of 2oth/azst\nof April when a force of over 220 Volunteer\nItalian Parachutists was dropped just behind\nthe enemy’s lines in the Po Valley (mainly\nnorth and north-west of Bologna) by 15 C.47’s\nof the 51st Troop Carrier Wing. They achieved\nconsiderable success, killing or capturing over\n1,000 Germans and carrying out a varied pro-\ngramme of sabotage and demolition.\n\nTue FirtH aND EIGHTH ARMIES’ OFFENSIVE.\n\nast to 24th of April.\n\n297. In these four days the German Armies\nin the Po Valley were cut to ribbons. Consider-\ning the enemy’s small reserve and limited sup-\nplies of petro] and ammunition, normal military\nstrategy would have dictated withdrawal across\n",

But the German Commander, von\nVietinghoff, did not give the order to pull back\nuntil the Eighth Army had broken through the\nArgenta Gap and was across the Idice River\nnear Budrio, and Fifth Army troops had\nreached Route 9 west of Bologna. By then, an\norderly withdrawal would in any case have been\ndifficult as all reserves had been committed to\nthe battle; and the attempt that was made was\ncompletely smashed by the power of the Allied\nAir Forces.\n\n298. On the 21st April, Bologna was cap-\ntured, Polish troops of the Eighth Army enter-\ning it from the east at the same time as Ameri-\ncan troops of the Fifth Army entered it from\nthe south-west. The main part of the German\ngarrison had withdrawn during the previous\nnight.\n\n299. On the Eighth Army’s right flank, the\ndrive to the Po along Route 16 was completed,\nleading elements reaching it on the 23rd, and\non the 24th Ferrara was captured. The situa-\ntion was then that some five German divisions\nwere being contained against the Po east of\nFerrara, and were fully occupying the Eighth\nArmy troops in that area. But west of Ferrara\nto Bondeno the way was clear of the enemy,\nso it was decided to make a crossing there. By\nthe 25th a secure bridgehead had been obtained,\nand the division making the crossing later\nrevealed that the total forces opposing it con-\nsisted of 14 men.\n\n300. In the meantime Eighth Army troops,\nadvancing westwards south of Route 16, and in\nthe central sector, had linked up with the Fifth\nArmy troops advancing north between the\nRivers Reno and Penaro. Meetings were made\nnear Bondeno and Finale, and again near\nCento.\n\n3or. The Fifth Army had reached the Po\nRiver at San Benedetto on the evening of the\n2and and a crossing was made at this point\non the 23rd. On the 24th, the’ bridgehead was\nenlarged and Fifth Army troops began to pour\nacross the River.\n\n302. Meanwhile, another Fifth Army column\nwas racing west along Route 9, capturing\nReggio and approaching Parma. On the west\ncoast, La Spezia was occupied on 23rd April\nwithout ‘opposition.\n\n303: In this period many thousands of\nprisoners were taken and the complete dis-\norganisation of the German Armies was\n.achieved,\n\nSummary of the Air Effort from 21st to 24th\nApnil\n\n304. Since September, 1944, constant recon-\nnaissance of the Po River had been maintained,\nand an assessment made of the crossings which\nwould most probably be used by the enemy\nif and when he tried to retire across the river.\nWhen, therefore, aerial reconnaissance carried\nout.on the night of the 20th /2zst April revealed\nthat practically the whole stretch of the Po\nfrom Ostiglia to Crespini (halfway. between\nPolesella and Berra) was active with pontoon\nbridges and other crossing activity, plans which\nhad previously been prepared were carried into\neffect, and the full power of the Tactical Air\nForce was concentrated-on the task of making\nfhe German retreat a shambles.\n\n5581\n\n305. Constant attacks by the medium\nbombers made it impossible for the Germans\nto use the pontoom bridges and the ferries for\nheavy armour and motor transport. During\nthe four days, 21st to 24th April, B-25 aircraft\nof the 57th Bombardment Wing made 38\nattacks on active sites flying 605 sorties, At\nthe same time, fighter-bombers of XXII T.A.C.\nand D.A.F. kept constant patrols above the\nriver, and destroyed all craft which they found\ntrying to cross during the day. In the same\nfour days, some 220 boats and barges were\ndestroyed or damaged.\n\n306. In addition to attacking all attempted\ntraffic across the river, the Tactical Air Force\nfighter-bombers paid great attention to search-\ning out enemy movement on the roads and\ndestroying the vehicles when they were found,\nand to cratering roads to impede the retreat.\nFor instance, in the middle of the morning of\nApril 24th, a collection of enemy armour, motor\ntransport and guns was seen between Polesella\nand Berra—at that time the stipulated bomb-\nline. A special bomb-line was immediately laid\ndown, and under ‘‘ Rover’’ control, fighter-\nbombers attacked the target until late in the\nevening. In all, there were some three hundred\nvehicles in the area, and by the end of the\nday the majority of them had been destroyed.\n\n307. It was in this period too, that the night-\nintruders put out their greatest effort of the\noffensive, maintaining during the night the inter-\ndiction of traffic across the river established by\nthe medium and fighter-bombers during the\nday. They attacked pontoon bridges, ferries,\nboats and barges and concentrations of troops\nand vehicles assembled near the crossing points.\nFor example on the night of 22nd/23rd April,\nthe Bostons, Baltimores and Mosquitoes of\nD.A.F. flew a record number of sorties—174.\nAlmost every aircraft was flown twice during\nthe night and some crews made three sorties.\nThe results achieved were also a record—55\nmotor vehicles destroyed, and 105 damaged,\ntogether with six barges. In addition, many\ndirect hits were seen on bridges, wharves, ferry\npoints and pontoons.\n\n308. There can be no doubt that the efforts\nof the Tactical Air Force played a very im-\nportant part in the crippling losses in armour\nand equipment which were inflicted on the\nenemy south of the River. During the four\ndays 21st to 24th April 3735, motor vehicles\nwere destroyed or damaged by Tactical Air\nForce. At the same time, claims against occu-\npied buildings fell to 414 destroyed or damaged\nas compared with over 1,300 during the pre-\nvious four days, which is indicative of the\ngreatly lessened resistance put up against our\nadvancing troops.\n\n309. The air attacks carried out on the cross-\nings during this period undoubtedly caused\nthe enemy to abandon most of his equipment\non the south side of the river. In the stretch\nbetween Pontelagoscuro (due north of Ferrara)\nand Polesella, for instance, where 76 Panzer\nCorps crossed, goo vehicles, 100 guns of all\ncalibres, and 59 Mk.4 Tanks, were counted\nleft abandoned on the South side of the river,\nand this Corps was believed to have suffered\nfewer losses than other German formations.\nThe air attacks against the Po crossings played\na major part in rendering the enemy too weak\n",

Seventy-seven per cent. of these\nsorties were flown against Brenner line targets.\nResults of the interdiction policy during April.\n\n324. Definite blocks on the Brenner route\nvaried between five and eighteen throughout\nthe month, so that at no time was continuous\nthrough traffic possible.\n\n325. The three north-eastern frontier rail-\nway routes remained out by the destruction of\nbridges for the third month in succession. The\nimportant northern line was apparently given\npriority for repairs, but despite this, was never\nmade fully serviceable. Spasmodic attempts\nwere made to repair the central line for a\ntime, but at last the unequal struggle was\ngiven up altogether. This had been the case\nwith the southern lines for a long time.\n\n326. Further south, through traffic was at\nno time possible across the Venetian Plain.\nThe Brenta zone of interdiction was well main-\ntained; in particular, an attempt to make the\nPadua north railway bridge serviceable was\nforestalled by a M.A.S.A.F. attack on the 11th\nApril. More repair activity was apparent in\nthe Piave River zone, but here again,\nM.AS.A.F. heavy bombers prevented any\nreturn to serviceability of the Nervesa and\nPonte di Piave diversions. Less interdiction\nwas maintained at the Livenza River zone, but\nthis was comparatively unimportant owing to\nthe disruption at Nervesa, further west. In\nthe Tagliamento River zone, the Latisana\ndiversion was still incomplete when it fell into\nAllied hands, and that a Casarsa, kept out\nof action by M.A.T.A.F. fighter-bombers until\nthe r2th, was knocked out for the last time\nby M.A.S.A.F. on the 24th.\n\n327. In the north-central zone of the Po\nvalley, through traffic was impossible between\nVerona and Milan until the 22nd April, but\n\n5583\n\nthe few bridges which were made serviceable\nafter that date obviously availed the enemy\nlittle as the result of the campaign was then\na foregone conclusion.\n\n328. All the permanent railway bridges over\nthe Po from Bressana Bottarone to the east\ncoast remained out of action and no attempt\nwas made to repair them. :\n\nThe part played by M.A.C.A.F. in the final\noffensive.\n\n329. In my description of the part played\n‘by the Air Forces in the final offensive, I have\nnot thus far mentioned the work done by\nM.A.C.A.F. I should therefore like now to\nmake specific reference to its efforts.\n\n330. In operations connected with the\nItalian campai, ing the month of April,\nM.A.C.A.F. destroyed 328 motor vehicles and\ndamaged 234 more; destroyed or damaged 30\nlocomotives and over 230 units of rolling\nstock; and damaged three bridges. These\noperations were carried out especially at the\nwestern end of the Po Valley, thus enabling\nM.A.T.A.F. aircraft to be concentrated on the\nmain battle front.\n\n331. In its own particular sphere of activity,\n\nM.AC.A.F. during the month of April\ndamaged one ship over 1,000 tons, sank 12\nsmaller craft (including a midget submarine),\nand damaged 32 more. Air-sea rescue opera-\ntions resulted in the saving of 118 aircrew\npersonnel.\n\nOther Air Force activities during the battle\nperiod.\n\n332. With the very small air force at the\nenemy’s disposal, only a very small part of\nthe Allied Air Force’s effort was required in\ncounter-air activity. The enemy air effort was\nlimited to occasional unsuccessful attacks on\nAllied photographic reconnaissance aircraft,\nand to small-scale ground attack activity by\nStukas and Me. 109 fighter bombers in the battle\narea. This latter effort reached its peak on\nthe night 22nd-23rd April, when ten to fifteen\nsorties were reported on the Fifth and Eighth\nArmies’ fronts. After that date this harassing\nactivity quickly declined as the Allied ground-\nforces over-ran the bases at Villafranca (10\nmiles S.W. of Verona) and Ghedi (10 miles\n\n.SSE. of Brescia) and later at Thiene (15 miles\n\nN. of Vicenza).\n\n333. Both long-range and short-range recon-\nnaissance by the enemy was om a reduced scale\nduring the battle and quite inadequate to give\nthe German commanders any picture of\ndevelopments on our armies’ fronts and in the\nrear areas.\n\n334. On sixteen of the seventeen nights\nfrom 8th to 25th April, Tactical Air Force\nnight-fighters flew qeconnaissance _ flights\nover the Ghedi, Villafranca, Bergamo (30\nmiles NE. of Milan) and Thiene airfields, and\nmade attacks when opportune.

The dividends paid by the supply\ndropping became increasingly evident as the\nAllied armies made their advance. In addition\nto harassing the enemy’s retreating columns,\nthe Italian Partisans in many cases entered\ntowns ‘before the arrival of our troops and\nsucceeded either in occupying them, or ir\nreducing enemy opposition to our attacking\n‘orces.\n\nTue EMPLOYMENT OF AIR FORCES DURING THE\nBATTLE.\n\n336. By way of Summary I should like to\ndraw attention to the salient features of the\nemployment of the Air Forces during the\nbattle. Initially, before the armies could move\nwithout sustaining heavy casualties, the way\nhad to be blasted open by the Mediterranean\nAllied Strategic Air Force and kept open by\nthe Tactical Air Force. Whenever there was\na commitment too big for the Tactical Air\nForce to deal with, the heavy bombers of\nStrategic Air Force were called upor. On\nthe Tactical side, the development by Desert\nAir Force of fighter-bomber technique reached\nperfection. Strong points and defended\nobstacles a few hundred yards ahead of our\nground forces were habitually attacked on call\nfrom the ground forces concerned.\n\n337- The air attacks were maintained through-\nout the night as well as the day and caused\nheavy enemy losses. Before the battle, all our\nBoston and Baltimore Squadrons had been\ntrained for effective tactical bombing by night.\nJoined by a number of Mosquitoes, they were\nable to maintain at night the interdiction and\nclose support already successfully accom-\nplished by day; they did this with outstanding\nsuccess and gave the army tremendous help,\nfully justifying their-conversion from day to\nnight bombers\n\n338. The inclusion, also of No. 205 Group\n(Night Bombers) im the Strategical Air Force\nmade possible a round-the-clock employment\nof heavy bombers in a tactical role. The im-\nportance of this was not so much in the weight\nof bombs dropped, but in the fact that we had\nat our command a heavy night bomber force,\nso trained that it could paralyse at one blow a\nvital communications centre or a concentration\nof enemy troops. The perfection of a technique\nfor close support for twenty-four hours a day\nhelped the ground forces immeasurably in\nattaining their object of destroying the enemy\nSouth of the Po.\n\n339. The scope of the Air Force’s effort can\nbest be gauged by an ly Commander’s\nremark:—‘‘I don’t suppose there thas ever\nbeen a campaign where: the Army has\nasked so much of the R.A.F. and where\nthe R.A.F. has given such -wholehearted\nand devastating support, always in the\nclosest proximity to our men.’’ This close\nsupport by our aircraft gave our troops\ngreat mora] as well as material aid.’ Whenever\na difficult position or obstacle was reached by\nthe Army they were able to call on the air forces\nto attack and remove it. The positions were\ninvariably very close to our own: troops and to\nsee them reduce with such effective accuracy\nand without any air opposition’ by the enemy\nae the’ morale of our {oops at a vey high\npi mo\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 OCTOBER, 1951\n\n340. From the enemy’s own description,\ntaken from a captured document, a very clear\npicture of the intensity and ‘‘ attention to de-\ntail’’ with which our fighter-bombers pinned\ndown enemy movement can be obtained. The\nGerman document covers the few days from the\ngth to 13th April:—‘‘Even single despatch\nriders, isolated telephone line maintenance per-\nsonnel, messengers and bicyclists were attacked\nby fighter-bombers. Single tanks were attacked\nby as many as fifteen fighter-bombers at a\ntime.’’ It was little wonder that the Germans\nwere unable to move.\n\n341. The battle began, as indeed it continued,\nas an outstanding example of combination and\nco-operation, not only between the personnel of\nthe British and American nations, for that had\nalready been achieved, but within the Allied Air\nForces themselves. Day bombers, night\nbombers; day fighters, night intruders; all\nworked with perfect precision and unceasing\ndevotion to duty. Before the last day fighter\nhad landed, Mosquito intruders were airborne\nand covering the dusk period, closely followed\n‘by other Mosquitoes, Bostons, Baltimores and\nInvaders keeping the battle area, and beyond,\nconstantly covered throughout the night. In the\nmorning the day fighters were airborne before\nthe Mosquitoes flying through the dawn period\nhad landed. This constant vigil was maintained\ntill the German surrender. And reinforcing the\nconstant jabbing by these Tactical Air Force\naircraft, would come the sudden massive blows\nof the heavy bombers, who were employed both\nday and night closer to our forward troops\nthan ever before in the Mediterranean theatre.\n\nA Brier ASSESSMENT OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF\nPowER TO THE VICTORY IN THE\nITALIAN THEATRE.\n\n342. My object in the next few paragraphs\nis to set down some of the outstanding ways\nin which air power contributed to the victory\nin Italy. I do not pretend that it is anything\nlike an exhaustive analysis, since that would\nrequire an examination of many factors which\nare outside the scope of this despatch, and are\nrather matters for the historian, such as the\neffect of the Allied strategic bombing of Ger-\nman industry upon the ability of the German\nArmies in Italy to make war. I have confined\nmyself chiefly to the facts that were apparent in\nthe Italian situation, and the ways in which\nItalian-based air power was known to have\naffected that situation.\n\n343. In the first place, the enemy’s position\non the eve of the battle was undoubtedly\ncritical, and air power was the major factor in\ncausing this situation. Though his ground posi-\ntions were strong enough, he was desperately\nshort of all those things which are required\nto wage modern warfare successfully, e.g. fuel,\nammunition, transport, aircraft, tanks and\nguns. And it was the Air Forces which had\ncaused him to lack ail these vital things.\n\n344.

The dividends paid by the supply\ndropping became increasingly evident as the\nAllied armies made their advance.

By way of Summary I should like to\ndraw attention to the salient features of the\nemployment of the Air Forces during the\nbattle. Initially, before the armies could move\nwithout sustaining heavy casualties, the way\nhad to be blasted open by the Mediterranean\nAllied Strategic Air Force and kept open by\nthe Tactical Air Force. Whenever there was\na commitment too big for the Tactical Air\nForce to deal with, the heavy bombers of\nStrategic Air Force were called upor. On\nthe Tactical side, the development by Desert\nAir Force of fighter-bomber technique reached\nperfection. Strong points and defended\nobstacles a few hundred yards ahead of our\nground forces were habitually attacked on call\nfrom the ground forces concerned.\n\n337- The air attacks were maintained through-\nout the night as well as the day and caused\nheavy enemy losses. Before the battle, all our\nBoston and Baltimore Squadrons had been\ntrained for effective tactical bombing by night.\nJoined by a number of Mosquitoes, they were\nable to maintain at night the interdiction and\nclose support already successfully accom-\nplished by day; they did this with outstanding\nsuccess and gave the army tremendous help,\nfully justifying their-conversion from day to\nnight bombers\n\n338. The inclusion, also of No. 205 Group\n(Night Bombers) im the Strategical Air Force\nmade possible a round-the-clock employment\nof heavy bombers in a tactical role. The im-\nportance of this was not so much in the weight\nof bombs dropped, but in the fact that we had\nat our command a heavy night bomber force,\nso trained that it could paralyse at one blow a\nvital communications centre or a concentration\nof enemy troops. The perfection of a technique\nfor close support for twenty-four hours a day\nhelped the ground forces immeasurably in\nattaining their object of destroying the enemy\nSouth of the Po.\n\n339. The scope of the Air Force’s effort can\nbest be gauged by an ly Commander’s\nremark:—‘‘I don’t suppose there thas ever\nbeen a campaign where: the Army has\nasked so much of the R.A.F. and where\nthe R.A.F. has given such -wholehearted\nand devastating support, always in the\nclosest proximity to our men.’’ This close\nsupport by our aircraft gave our troops\ngreat mora] as well as material aid.’ Whenever\na difficult position or obstacle was reached by\nthe Army they were able to call on the air forces\nto attack and remove it. The positions were\ninvariably very close to our own: troops and to\nsee them reduce with such effective accuracy\nand without any air opposition’ by the enemy\nae the’ morale of our {oops at a vey high\npi mo\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 OCTOBER, 1951\n\n340. From the enemy’s own description,\ntaken from a captured document, a very clear\npicture of the intensity and ‘‘ attention to de-\ntail’’ with which our fighter-bombers pinned\ndown enemy movement can be obtained. The\nGerman document covers the few days from the\ngth to 13th April:—‘‘Even single despatch\nriders, isolated telephone line maintenance per-\nsonnel, messengers and bicyclists were attacked\nby fighter-bombers. Single tanks were attacked\nby as many as fifteen fighter-bombers at a\ntime.’’ It was little wonder that the Germans\nwere unable to move.\n\n341. The battle began, as indeed it continued,\nas an outstanding example of combination and\nco-operation, not only between the personnel of\nthe British and American nations, for that had\nalready been achieved, but within the Allied Air\nForces themselves. Day bombers, night\nbombers; day fighters, night intruders; all\nworked with perfect precision and unceasing\ndevotion to duty. Before the last day fighter\nhad landed, Mosquito intruders were airborne\nand covering the dusk period, closely followed\n‘by other Mosquitoes, Bostons, Baltimores and\nInvaders keeping the battle area, and beyond,\nconstantly covered throughout the night. In the\nmorning the day fighters were airborne before\nthe Mosquitoes flying through the dawn period\nhad landed. This constant vigil was maintained\ntill the German surrender. And reinforcing the\nconstant jabbing by these Tactical Air Force\naircraft, would come the sudden massive blows\nof the heavy bombers, who were employed both\nday and night closer to our forward troops\nthan ever before in the Mediterranean theatre.\n\nA Brier ASSESSMENT OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF\nPowER TO THE VICTORY IN THE\nITALIAN THEATRE.\n\n342. My object in the next few paragraphs\nis to set down some of the outstanding ways\nin which air power contributed to the victory\nin Italy. I do not pretend that it is anything\nlike an exhaustive analysis, since that would\nrequire an examination of many factors which\nare outside the scope of this despatch, and are\nrather matters for the historian, such as the\neffect of the Allied strategic bombing of Ger-\nman industry upon the ability of the German\nArmies in Italy to make war. I have confined\nmyself chiefly to the facts that were apparent in\nthe Italian situation, and the ways in which\nItalian-based air power was known to have\naffected that situation.\n\n343. In the first place, the enemy’s position\non the eve of the battle was undoubtedly\ncritical, and air power was the major factor in\ncausing this situation. Though his ground posi-\ntions were strong enough, he was desperately\nshort of all those things which are required\nto wage modern warfare successfully, e.g. fuel,\nammunition, transport, aircraft, tanks and\nguns. And it was the Air Forces which had\ncaused him to lack ail these vital things.\n\n344. His shortage of fuel was due directly to\nthe strategic use of air power, assisted by the\nadvance of the Russian Armies. This advance\nin itself was greatly assisted by that same\nstrategic air power. Whatever may have been\nthe overall supply position of ammunition, tanks\nand guns. for all the German Armies on all the\nfronts, those in Italy without doubt received\nsuch reduced supplies that their position was\n",

As for morale, in the words of the Ger-\nman Supreme Commander: “Allied air power\nwas decisive in that as a result of their com-\nplete lack of am air force of their own, and\nwithout the promise of the help of a like force,\nthe German troops felt still more the Allied\nsuperiority of materials.’’\n\n345. To add to the cares of the German\ncommanders, because of their limited ability to\nmake air reconnaissance they could have had\nonly a very imperfect knowledge of the detailed\npreparations that were being made for the offen-\nsive,.while the Allied commanders, through the\nunfettered freedom of air reconnaissance enjoyed\nby M.A.A.F. were completely informed about\nthe enemy’s defences and dispositions.\n\n346. The extreme effectiveness of the assist-\nance given by the Air Forces to the ground\nforces during the battle itself is also beyond\ndoubt. I shall not attempt to evaluate which of\nthe forces made the greater contribution—\nnothing would be gained by that since they were\nso essentially a team, working together in per-\nfect harmony, the one taking advantage of the\nopportunities created by the other; but the\nfollowing points show the great importance of\nthe part played by air power at this time.\n\n347. The air bombardment of the German\nfixed defences in the early days of the battle\nwas probably the decisive factor in enabling\nour ground forces to overcome them rapidly\nand with a minimum of casualties. German\nprisoners of war testified that the dropping of\nfragmentation bombs on such a large scale\ncaused many casualties, and, especially in the\nregion of Ferrara and Lake Comacchio, greatly\nreduced the resistance of the German: troops.\nAgain, communications between higher and\nlower commanders were completely disrupted;\neven radio and telephone communications were\ndelayed threefold. The German Supreme Com-\nmander’s statement testifies to the effect of this.\n‘* The smashing of all communications connec-\ntions was especially disastrous. Thereafter, the\norders failed to come through at all, or failed\nto come through at the right time. In any case,\nthe command was not able to keep itself in-\nformed of the situation at the front, so that its\nown decisions and commands came, for the\nmost part, too late.”’\n\n348. Even when those decisions were made,\nand the commands given, air power prevented\ntheir being carried out effectively. Movement\nof local reserves by day was to all intents and\npurposes prohibited by the inevitably high\nlosses which would have followed, while move-\nment by night, though still Possible, was also\nattended by heavy losses. quote the Ger-\nman Supreme Commander once , again:\n“Local reserves, which should have moved by\nday, often arrived with great delay at the\nordered position. Even tanks could not move\nby day because of the employment of fighter-\nbombers. The effectiveness of fighter-bombers\nlay in that their presence alone over the battle-\nfield paralysed every movement.”’\n\n349. Another important point was that be-\ncause of the complete air superiority enjoye' d by\nthe Allies, our Air Observation Post aire!\ncould operate completely unhindered and there-\nfore with maximum efficiency. The final re-\nsult was that these aircraft had only to appear\nwithin sight of the German artillery to cause\n\n5585\n\nthe latter to cease fire, and so in this manner,\nin vital phases of the battle, an essential\nelement of the enemy’s defence system was\ndenied him. ;\n\n350. Orderly retreats could not be conducted\nby the Germans because of the air attacks on\ntheir lines of communication in the battle area.\nThrough the destruction of almost all the cross-\nings of the numerous canals, trans-shipment\nwas made much more difficult, forcing\nthe enemy to leave much heavy equipment be-\nhind. In that way, retreat imposed by the\nground forces was turned into a rout by the\nair forces.\n\n351. And at the Po crossings, as I have\nalready shown earlier on in the description of\nthe battle, rout was turned into destruction,\nagain by the use of air power.\n\n352. Such were the effects of air power upon\nthe Germans. There was a reverse effect upon\nour own troops. Their morale was heightened\nby the constant presence of friendly aircraft,\nby the complete absence of enemy aircraft, and\nby the knowledge that their casualties would\nalways be kept to a minimum because the air\nforces would be there to lend a hand with the\ntask.\n\nFina REMARKS.\n\n353. In concluding this despatch I wish to\nplace on record the remarkable team work of\nthe three Services under the leadership of Field\nMarshal Alexander, the Supreme Allied Com-\nmander. The mutual understanding was com-\nplete at every level within the Theatre, between\nthe three Services themselves as between the\nAllied Forces generally. This atmosphere of the\nhappy family working for a single purpose,\nwith no thought except for the general good,\nwas a decisive factor in the success of the\noperations.\n\n354. Finally, I wish to pay my tribute to\nthe magnificent spirit shown by the officers and\nairmen under my command whose achieve-\nments I have described. When I assumed com-\nmand of them they had made a long journey\nfrom Egypt to Northern Italy. Many of the\nSquadrons had been engaged for over four\nyears in continuous and bitter fighting. The\nairfield strips were far from ideal. The Heavy\nBomber Squadrons on the Foggia plain had\nbeen living under canvas throughout the winter\nin camps which were often # sea of mud. The\nMaintenance and Administrative Units ‘had\nalso been operating under the most severe con-\nditions of weather and accommodation.\n\n355. Yet the spirit of all ranks in every unit\nremained at the highest level. The one desire\nof the Squadrons was to get to grips with the\nenemy, and if he was not to be found in the air\nthey sought him out relentlessly on the ground.\nThe maintenance personnel in Squadrons and\nin supporting units toiled ceaselessly to keep\nthe aircraft flying at the very high rate of effort\nthat the battle demanded. It was a joy and an\ninspiration to command such a force, whose\nmastery over the enemy resulted in so complete\na victory.\n\nGuy GarRop,\nAir Chief Marshal,\nlately C.-in-C., Royal Air Force,\nMediterranean and Middle East.\n\nAugust, 1946.\n",

As for morale, in the words of the Ger-\nman Supreme Commander: “Allied air power\nwas decisive in that as a result of their com-\nplete lack of am air force of their own, and\nwithout the promise of the help of a like force,\nthe German troops felt still more the Allied\nsuperiority of materials.’’\n\n345. To add to the cares of the German\ncommanders, because of their limited ability to\nmake air reconnaissance they could have had\nonly a very imperfect knowledge of the detailed\npreparations that were being made for the offen-\nsive,.while the Allied commanders, through the\nunfettered freedom of air reconnaissance enjoyed\nby M.A.A.F. were completely informed about\nthe enemy’s defences and dispositions.\n\n346. The extreme effectiveness of the assist-\nance given by the Air Forces to the ground\nforces during the battle itself is also beyond\ndoubt. I shall not attempt to evaluate which of\nthe forces made the greater contribution—\nnothing would be gained by that since they were\nso essentially a team, working together in per-\nfect harmony, the one taking advantage of the\nopportunities created by the other; but the\nfollowing points show the great importance of\nthe part played by air power at this time.\n\n347. The air bombardment of the German\nfixed defences in the early days of the battle\nwas probably the decisive factor in enabling\nour ground forces to overcome them rapidly\nand with a minimum of casualties. German\nprisoners of war testified that the dropping of\nfragmentation bombs on such a large scale\ncaused many casualties, and, especially in the\nregion of Ferrara and Lake Comacchio, greatly\nreduced the resistance of the German: troops.\nAgain, communications between higher and\nlower commanders were completely disrupted;\neven radio and telephone communications were\ndelayed threefold. The German Supreme Com-\nmander’s statement testifies to the effect of this.\n‘* The smashing of all communications connec-\ntions was especially disastrous. Thereafter, the\norders failed to come through at all, or failed\nto come through at the right time. In any case,\nthe command was not able to keep itself in-\nformed of the situation at the front, so that its\nown decisions and commands came, for the\nmost part, too late.”’\n\n348. Even when those decisions were made,\nand the commands given, air power prevented\ntheir being carried out effectively. Movement\nof local reserves by day was to all intents and\npurposes prohibited by the inevitably high\nlosses which would have followed, while move-\nment by night, though still Possible, was also\nattended by heavy losses. quote the Ger-\nman Supreme Commander once , again:\n“Local reserves, which should have moved by\nday, often arrived with great delay at the\nordered position. Even tanks could not move\nby day because of the employment of fighter-\nbombers. The effectiveness of fighter-bombers\nlay in that their presence alone over the battle-\nfield paralysed every movement.”’\n\n349. Another important point was that be-\ncause of the complete air superiority enjoye' d by\nthe Allies, our Air Observation Post aire!\ncould operate completely unhindered and there-\nfore with maximum efficiency. The final re-\nsult was that these aircraft had only to appear\nwithin sight of the German artillery to cause\n\n5585\n\nthe latter to cease fire, and so in this manner,\nin vital phases of the battle, an essential\nelement of the enemy’s defence system was\ndenied him. ;\n\n350. Orderly retreats could not be conducted\nby the Germans because of the air attacks on\ntheir lines of communication in the battle area.\nThrough the destruction of almost all the cross-\nings of the numerous canals, trans-shipment\nwas made much more difficult, forcing\nthe enemy to leave much heavy equipment be-\nhind. In that way, retreat imposed by the\nground forces was turned into a rout by the\nair forces.\n\n351. And at the Po crossings, as I have\nalready shown earlier on in the description of\nthe battle, rout was turned into destruction,\nagain by the use of air power.\n\n352. Such were the effects of air power upon\nthe Germans. There was a reverse effect upon\nour own troops. Their morale was heightened\nby the constant presence of friendly aircraft,\nby the complete absence of enemy aircraft, and\nby the knowledge that their casualties would\nalways be kept to a minimum because the air\nforces would be there to lend a hand with the\ntask.\n\nFina REMARKS.\n\n353. In concluding this despatch I wish to\nplace on record the remarkable team work of\nthe three Services under the leadership of Field\nMarshal Alexander, the Supreme Allied Com-\nmander. The mutual understanding was com-\nplete at every level within the Theatre, between\nthe three Services themselves as between the\nAllied Forces generally. This atmosphere of the\nhappy family working for a single purpose,\nwith no thought except for the general good,\nwas a decisive factor in the success of the\noperations.\n\n354. Finally, I wish to pay my tribute to\nthe magnificent spirit shown by the officers and\nairmen under my command whose achieve-\nments I have described. When I assumed com-\nmand of them they had made a long journey\nfrom Egypt to Northern Italy. Many of the\nSquadrons had been engaged for over four\nyears in continuous and bitter fighting. The\nairfield strips were far from ideal. The Heavy\nBomber Squadrons on the Foggia plain had\nbeen living under canvas throughout the winter\nin camps which were often # sea of mud. The\nMaintenance and Administrative Units ‘had\nalso been operating under the most severe con-\nditions of weather and accommodation.\n\n355. Yet the spirit of all ranks in every unit\nremained at the highest level. The one desire\nof the Squadrons was to get to grips with the\nenemy, and if he was not to be found in the air\nthey sought him out relentlessly on the ground.\nThe maintenance personnel in Squadrons and\nin supporting units toiled ceaselessly to keep\nthe aircraft flying at the very high rate of effort\nthat the battle demanded. It was a joy and an\ninspiration to command such a force, whose\nmastery over the enemy resulted in so complete\na victory.\n\nGuy GarRop,\nAir Chief Marshal,\nlately C.-in-C., Royal Air Force,\nMediterranean and Middle East.\n\nAugust, 1946.\n",

The cumulative\neffect of our air strategy and fighting had been\nso to reduce his numerical strength and ability\nto hit back, that during the final Italian offen-\nsive enemy air action could be virtually dis-\nregarded as an effective factor.\n\n16. Although the enemy’s air force in Italy\nwas a negligible quantity, he had in that\ncountry a formidable array of 1,000 heavy and\n2,200 light flak guns as well as countless small\narms in an anti-aircraft role. He was there-\nfore capable of putting up a very strong defence\nat important targets, and the Tactical Air\nForce had been compelled to develop a fairly\ncomplicated system of anti-flak tactics in order\nto avoid undue losses.\n\n17. The freedom of the air enjoyed by the\nAllies in the Italian theatre allowed the greatest\nflexibility in the use of air effort, resulting in\na high degree of efficiency. Moreover, its\neffect upon the morale of the German troops\nwas most depressing; it kept them constantly\nreminded of the great advantage in material\nand weapons enjoyed by the Allies.\n\nThe Naval Situation.\n\n18. The Allied Navies in the Mediterranean\nwere as much masters of the seas as the Allied\nAir Forces were masters of the air. There were\nno major enemy surface units left in the\ntheatre, while submarines had been driven\nfrom it by the thoroughness and efficiency of\nour combined naval-air operations, and by\nthe overrunning of their bases. |The chief\nthreat which remained was offered by small\ncraft and midget submarines.\n\n19. The major task of the Allied Navies\nwas to maintain the assault on the enemy’s\nfew remaining coastal sea routes, whose im-\nportance increased as the Air Forces’ policy\nof destroying the enemy’s land communica-\ntions achieved substantial successes. This\nassault was carried out by British and United\nStates Coastal Forces and destroyers, operating\nfrom Naval Advanced Bases at Ancona,\nLeghorn and in the South of France. In\naddition a mixed force of French, British and\nUnited States cruisers and destroyers, under\na French Admiral, was operating continuously\nin support of the seaward flank of the Allied\nForces holding the Franco-Italian frontier,\ngiving gun-support from the sea. This force,\nwhich was known as “ Flank Force,’’ was\nunder constant threat of attack from the\nenemy’s explosive motor boats and midget\nsubmarines,\n\n* 20. The enemy had carried out a programme\nof intensive mining, both to protect his coastal\nconvoy routes and to hamper naval operations\nin support of the coming offensive. As these\nmines could be easily and quickly laid from\nsmall craft of various types, and as he had\nan adequate stock of mines, the result was to\nproduce a minesweeping problem greater than\nany which had previously confronted the Navy\nim the Mediterranean. It was estimated that\nsome 7,000 mines had been laid in the Gulf\nof Genoa, and 12,000 in the Northern Adriatic,\nwhere the whole area was particularly suitable\nfor mine laying. The enemy also prepared\ndetailed plans for the denial of harbours by\n\n5559\n\ndemolitions, blocking and mining, in all of\nwhich work he had by this time had a great\ndeal of experience.\n\nThe Maintenance Aspect.\n\n21. By dint of the fine efforts of the R.A.F.\nMaintenance Organisation the degree of air-\ncraft serviceability was high when the land\nbattle started. The policy during the battle\nwas to use our air forces to the maximum ex-\ntent of which the aircrews and maintenance\npersonnel were capable. It was confidently\nbelieved that the enemy could be defeated\nwithin 21 days, and the event proved that this\nestimate and the policy of an all-out effort was\nsoun\n\n22. The same policy was followed by the\nArmy, which had sufficient ammunition and\nsupplies and reserves for only about ai days of\nintense operations.\n\n23. From the foregoing paragraphs it will\nbe seen that we had all the necessary superiority\nin equipment—especially aircraft and tanks—\nto launch a successful offensive. Most impor-\ntant was our predominance in the air, which\nmeant that our own army was safe from air\nattack and at the same time could be led for-\nward and constantly assisted by the Air Force.\n\nPart II.\nTHE ORDER OF BATTLE.\nORDER OF BATTLE ON MARCH I6TH, 1945.\n\n24. The Mediterranean Allied Air Force was\nformed on December roth, 1943. By March,\n1945, it had already built up a fine reputation\nof accomplishment, and I was privileged to be\nin command during its highest peak of achieve-\nment and ultimate victory. The work of this\nintegrated British-American Command has now\nfinished, but let us hope that the lessons and\nadvantages of co-operation which have been\nlearned will be put to even better use in peace.\n\n25. M.A.A.F. consisted of all operational\nunits in the Mediterranean Theatre (which in-\ncluded Turkey, the Balkans, Central and South\nWestern Europe, but excluded the Middle\nEast); the main components were the Royal\nAir Force (including units of the Dominion Air\nForces under its command) and the United\nStates Army Air Forces. Operational control\nof all these units was exercised by the Air Com-\nmander-in-Chief, who was responsible through\nthe Supreme Allied Commander to the Com-\nbined Chiefs of Staff. The Air C.-in-C. also\nheld the appointment of Commanding General\nUnited States Air Forces, Mediterranean Theatre\nof Operations.\n\n26. As Deputy Air Commander-in-Chief,\nM.A.A.F., I exercised such responsibilities in\nregard to the Allied Air Forces as might be\ndelegated to me by the Air Commander-in-\nChief.

M.A.S.A.F. was predominantly an\nAmerican organisation, and consisted of the\nUnited States rsth Air Force, and 205 Group\nof the Royal Air Force (Commanded by\nBrigadier J. T. Durrant, C.B., D.F.C.,\nS.A.A.F.). There were 109 U.S.A.A.F. and\n8 R.A.F. and Dominion Squadrons.\n\n31. M.A.S.A.F. formed part of the team of\nAllied Strategic Air Forces in Europe, the other\nmembers being the United States Eighth Air\nForce and the Royal Air Force Bomber Com-\nmand. The aim of these forces was the\nprogressive destruction and dislocation of the\nGerman military, industrial and economic\nsystem, and the direct support of land and\nnaval forces. All M.A.S.A.F, squadrons were\nbased in South-East Italy, chiefly on the Foggia\n\nin.\n\nMediterranean Allied Tactical Air Force.\n\n(Major-General J. K. Cannon, Commanding\nGeneral.)*\n\n32. M.A.T.A.F. was composed of the United\nStates 12th Air Force and the Royal Air Force\nDesert Air Force, which were roughly equal\nin size. The role of M.A.T.A.F. was to pro-\nvide the air support required for the opera-\ntions of Allied land forces in the Italian theatre.\nTo perform this task it had 89 Squadrons, con-\nsisting of 42 U.S.A.AF., 44 RAF. and\nDominion, 1 Brazilian and 2 Polish.\n\n* Major-General Chidlaw from April 5, 1945.\n\nSUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 29 OCTOBER, 1951\n\n33- There were four main operational forma-\ntions within the organisation of M.A.T.A.F.—\nthe Desert Air Force, 22nd Tactical Air Com-\nmand, the 57th Wing (Medium bombers) and\nthe 51st Troop Carrier Wing.\n\n34. The Desert Air Force, commanded by\nAir Vice-Marshal R. M. Foster, C.B., C.B.E.,\nD.F.C., consisted of a total of 43 squadrons,\nand was employed chiefly in support of the\nBritish Eighth Army. It was composed for\nthe most part of Royal Air Force and\nDominion squadrons (1x of which were South\nAfrican Air Force) but it had also under its\noperational control three squadrons of American\nlong range fighter-bomber aircraft in order to\n\nive it a flexibility not obtainable with the\nritish types of aircraft at its disposal.\n\n35. The 2and Tactical Air Command, com-\nmanded by Brigadier-General Chidlaw, was\nemployed chiefly in support of the American\nFifth Army and consisted mostly of U.S.A.A.F.\nsquadrons. It did, however, have under its\noperational control two R.A.F. tactical recon-\nnaissance squadrons and four R.A.F. and\nDominion short range fighter and fighter-\nbomber squadrons.\n\n36. The 57th Wing was a purely American\nformation controlling twelve squadrons of B.25\nmedium bomber aircraft, and’ was employed\nanywhere within the Italian theatre as required.\nThis wing played an outstanding part in the\nstrangling of the enemy’s communications.\n\n37. The 51st Troop Carrier Wing was also\na purely American formation, controlling twelve\nsquadrons of C-47 transport aircraft. It per-\nformed a wide variety of functions, including\nairborne assaults if required, supply dropping,\nand air ambulance work.\n\n38. Headquarters Desert Air Force and\nHeadquarters 22nd Tactical Air Command were\nalways located alongside Headquarters Eighth\nArmy and Fifth Anmy respectively.

Whitford, C.B., C.B.E.,\nAir Officer Commanding)\n\n39. The direction of M.A.C.A.F. was almost\nentirely an R.A.F. concern by March, 1945, by\nwhich date the formation consisted of seven\nR.A.F, and Dominion squadrons, four Italian\nsquadrons, four French squadrons and two\nU.S.A.A.F. squadrons. The operational role\nof M.A.C.A.F, was the air defence of Allied\nshipping, the attack of enemy shipping, the\nair defence of the Italian peninsula (with the\nexception of the forward areas where the\nresponsibility was M.A.T.A.F.’s) and finally\nthe operation of Air Sea Rescue services in\nthe Adriatic and the Western Mediterranean up\nto the area of responsibility of Air Head-\nquarters, Malta. By the Spring of 10945\nM.A.C.A.F.’s operational activities had been\ngreatly reduced, and in fact it had all but\nfinished its work, and had won a hard battle\nagainst what had once been great odds.\n\nThe Balkan Air Force.\n(Air Vice-Marshal G.

M.A.S.A.F. formed part of the team of\nAllied Strategic Air Forces in Europe, the other\nmembers being the United States Eighth Air\nForce and the Royal Air Force Bomber Com-\nmand. The aim of these forces was the\nprogressive destruction and dislocation of the\nGerman military, industrial and economic\nsystem, and the direct support of land and\nnaval forces.

M.A.T.A.F. was composed of the United\nStates 12th Air Force and the Royal Air Force\nDesert Air Force, which were roughly equal\nin size. The role of M.A.T.A.F. was to pro-\nvide the air support required for the opera-\ntions of Allied land forces in the Italian theatre.\nTo perform this task it had 89 Squadrons, con-\nsisting of 42 U.S.A.AF., 44 RAF. and\nDominion, 1 Brazilian and 2 Polish.\n\n* Major-General Chidlaw from April 5, 1945.\n\nSUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 29 OCTOBER, 1951\n\n33- There were four main operational forma-\ntions within the organisation of M.A.T.A.F.—\nthe Desert Air Force, 22nd Tactical Air Com-\nmand, the 57th Wing (Medium bombers) and\nthe 51st Troop Carrier Wing.\n\n34. The Desert Air Force, commanded by\nAir Vice-Marshal R. M. Foster, C.B., C.B.E.,\nD.F.C., consisted of a total of 43 squadrons,\nand was employed chiefly in support of the\nBritish Eighth Army. It was composed for\nthe most part of Royal Air Force and\nDominion squadrons (1x of which were South\nAfrican Air Force) but it had also under its\noperational control three squadrons of American\nlong range fighter-bomber aircraft in order to\n\nive it a flexibility not obtainable with the\nritish types of aircraft at its disposal.\n\n35. The 2and Tactical Air Command, com-\nmanded by Brigadier-General Chidlaw, was\nemployed chiefly in support of the American\nFifth Army and consisted mostly of U.S.A.A.F.\nsquadrons. It did, however, have under its\noperational control two R.A.F. tactical recon-\nnaissance squadrons and four R.A.F. and\nDominion short range fighter and fighter-\nbomber squadrons.\n\n36. The 57th Wing was a purely American\nformation controlling twelve squadrons of B.25\nmedium bomber aircraft, and’ was employed\nanywhere within the Italian theatre as required.\nThis wing played an outstanding part in the\nstrangling of the enemy’s communications.\n\n37. The 51st Troop Carrier Wing was also\na purely American formation, controlling twelve\nsquadrons of C-47 transport aircraft. It per-\nformed a wide variety of functions, including\nairborne assaults if required, supply dropping,\nand air ambulance work.\n\n38. Headquarters Desert Air Force and\nHeadquarters 22nd Tactical Air Command were\nalways located alongside Headquarters Eighth\nArmy and Fifth Anmy respectively.

The direction of M.A.C.A.F. was almost\nentirely an R.A.F. concern by March, 1945, by\nwhich date the formation consisted of seven\nR.A.F, and Dominion squadrons, four Italian\nsquadrons, four French squadrons and two\nU.S.A.A.F. squadrons. The operational role\nof M.A.C.A.F, was the air defence of Allied\nshipping, the attack of enemy shipping, the\nair defence of the Italian peninsula (with the\nexception of the forward areas where the\nresponsibility was M.A.T.A.F.’s) and finally\nthe operation of Air Sea Rescue services in\nthe Adriatic and the Western Mediterranean up\nto the area of responsibility of Air Head-\nquarters, Malta.

As the battle front moved\nnorthwards the importance of Malta as an\noperational base decreased. It still remained,\nhowever, a natural centre for the direction\nof oversea air operations in the Mediter-\nranean. Since Malta was a permanent R.A.F,\nbase, the A.O.C, Malta had responsibilities in\ntwo directions—-his responsibility to the Air\nMinistry for the implementation of R.A.F.\nlong-term policy, atid his responsibility to the\nAir C.-in-C, for such war commitments as he\nwas required to undertake. The latter con-\nsisted of the air defence of Malta and North\nAfrica, the conduct of all anti-submarine opera-\ntions within his operational area under the\ngeneral co-ordinating direction of A.O.C.,\nM.A.C.A.F., and air sea rescue services within\nhis area.

The\nlatter had, however, been dissolved before J\nassumed command when it became American\npolicy to make each of their air forces as self-\ncontained as possible. No. 336 Wing remained\nas a completely R.A.F. formation under the\noperational control of M.A.A.F. It met the\nphotographic reconnaissance requirements of\nall three services—Navy, Army and Air Force\nworking on priorities allotted to it by the\nMediterranean Photo Reconnaissance Com-\nmittee, which also co-ordinated the work of\nthe American photo reconnaissance elements\nof XIIth and XVth Air Forces.\n\n5561\n\nMediterranean Allied Transport Service.\n(Brigadier-General L.

Air Transport Command\noperated within the Air C.-in-C.’s theatre.\n\n47.

I had\nsuch responsibility with regard to them as\nwas delegated to me by the Air C.-in-C.\nHowever, as Commander-in-Chief, R.A.F.,\n, I was responsible for certain other\nformations which did not come within the\nqurisdiction of the Air C.-in-C. These were:—-\n(Headquarters R.A.F. Middle East and the\nDirectorate of Maintenance and Supply.\n\nHeadquarters, Royal Air Force, Middle East.\n\n(Air Marshal Sir Charles E. H. Medhurst,\nK.C.B., O.B.E., M.C., Air Officer Com-\nmanding-in-C hief.)\n\n49. Headquarters R.A.F. Middle East was\nthe basis from which the R.A.F. organisation\nin the Mediterranean had been created. It\nnow had very few operational commitments and\nits chief functions were the provision of opera-\ntional training and maintenance facilities, serv-\ning the requirements both of MEDME and Air\nCommand, South East Asia. In March, 1945,\nit had only four squadrons under its command\n—one air sea rescue, one general reconnais-\nsance, one photographic reconnaissance and one\nsingle-engined fighter.\n\n50.

The air defence and anti-submarine\nrequirements had almost completely dis-\nappeared, and A.O.C. Malta’s chief commit-\nment in this direction was the maintenance of\na skeleton organisation which could be rapidly\nexpanded should a new air or submarine threat\narise.\n\n43. The A.O.C. Malta had therefore under\nhis command only one air sea rescue squadron\nin Malta, and one air sea rescue squadron and\none French single-engine fighter squadron in\nNorth Africa.\n\nNe. 336 Wing.\n\n44. This wing, which consisted of one twin-\nengined and two single-engined squadrons, had\npreviously formed part of the Mediterranean\nAllied Photographic Reconnaissance Wing. The\nlatter had, however, been dissolved before J\nassumed command when it became American\npolicy to make each of their air forces as self-\ncontained as possible. No. 336 Wing remained\nas a completely R.A.F. formation under the\noperational control of M.A.A.F. It met the\nphotographic reconnaissance requirements of\nall three services—Navy, Army and Air Force\nworking on priorities allotted to it by the\nMediterranean Photo Reconnaissance Com-\nmittee, which also co-ordinated the work of\nthe American photo reconnaissance elements\nof XIIth and XVth Air Forces.\n\n5561\n\nMediterranean Allied Transport Service.\n(Brigadier-General L. V. Beau, Commanding\nGeneral.)\n\n45. M.A.T.S. was an integrated British-\nAmerican organisation whose principal function\nwas the co-ordination and direction of all air\ntransport activities within the limits of the\nCommand jurisdiction of the Air C.-inC.\nMAAF.  -\n\n46. M.A.T.S. was responsible for co-ordinat-\ning those services which the R.A.F. Transport\nCommand Group in MEDME (No. 216 Group),\nand the U.S.A.A.F. Air Transport Command\noperated within the Air C.-in-C.’s theatre.\n\n47. In addition M.A.T.S. had under its im-\nmediate operational control a pool of American\ntransport aircraft, which varied in strength, but\nwhich normally consisted of three squadrons. °\n\nR.A.F. Formations in MEDME Not UNDER\nCoMMAND OF AIR C.-IN-C. M.A.A.F.\n\n48. All the formations described above came\nunder the operational control of the Air C.-in-C.\nand therefore as deputy Air C.-in-C. I had\nsuch responsibility with regard to them as\nwas delegated to me by the Air C.-in-C.\nHowever, as Commander-in-Chief, R.A.F.,\n, I was responsible for certain other\nformations which did not come within the\nqurisdiction of the Air C.-in-C. These were:—-\n(Headquarters R.A.F. Middle East and the\nDirectorate of Maintenance and Supply.\n\nHeadquarters, Royal Air Force, Middle East.\n\n(Air Marshal Sir Charles E. H. Medhurst,\nK.C.B., O.B.E., M.C., Air Officer Com-\nmanding-in-C hief.)\n\n49. Headquarters R.A.F. Middle East was\nthe basis from which the R.A.F. organisation\nin the Mediterranean had been created. It\nnow had very few operational commitments and\nits chief functions were the provision of opera-\ntional training and maintenance facilities, serv-\ning the requirements both of MEDME and Air\nCommand, South East Asia. In March, 1945,\nit had only four squadrons under its command\n—one air sea rescue, one general reconnais-\nsance, one photographic reconnaissance and one\nsingle-engined fighter.\n\n50. There were located in Aden and East\nAfrica six general reconnaissance squadrons,\nbut these were under the operational control\nof Air Command South East Asia.\n\nThe Directorate of Maintenance and Supply.\n(Air Vice-Marshal C. B. Cooke, C.B.E., Direc-\ntor of Maintenance and Supply.)\n\n51. The Director of Maintenance and Supply\n(D.M. & S.) was responsible for all Mainten-\nance and Supply matters within MEDME Com-\nmand. The maintenance organisation was a\nfunctional one, and D.M. & S. was responsible\nto’ me for the technical direction of all main-\ntenance units and operational formations. His\nHeadquarters, named Rear Headquarters,\n(MEDME, was at Algiers, and he controlled\nthree maintenance groups—No. 206 in Egypt,\nNo. 214 in Italy, and No. 218 in North Africa.\nIn my headquarters at Caserta, there was a\nsmall maintenance policy and planning staff,\nheaded by the Command Maintenance and\nSupply Officer (C.M.S.0.), who was respon-\nsible for advising me on behalf of D.M. & S.,\nand also for informing D.M. & S. of all policy\ndecisions so that plans could be prepared to\nimplement them. . -\n",

A close liaison was maintained with the\nU.S.A.A.F. supply services, and where con-\nvenient, supplies of “‘ common user ’’ items\nwere pooled to achieve maximum efficiency. A\nparticular instance of this was 1,000 Ib. bombs,\nof which there was a shortage in both services.\n\nORDER OF BATTLE FOR THE FINAL ITALIAN\nOFFENSIVE.\n\n53. With but a few minor exceptions, the\norder of battle I have described above remained\nunchanged for the final Italian offensive, and\nin particular, no changes were made which\nwould impair the effectiveness of M.A.S.A.F.,\nM.A.T.A.F., or B.A.F. for giving support to\nthe ground forces.\n\n54. One change was the transfer of the two\nUS.A.A.F. special duties squadrons from\nB.A.F. to M.A.T.A.F., in order to increase the\neffort available for supplying the Italian\nPartisans in Northern Italy.\n\n55. On 16th March, I was informed by the\nChief of the Air Staff that in view of the services\noverall manpower deficiencies, which had\nalready arisen in the Royal Air Force, and\nwhich would increase still further in the next\nsix months unless corrective action were taken,\nit was essential that there should be a reduction\nin the number of R.A.F. first line squadrons.\nThe contribution that MEDME would be re-\nquired to make was:—\n\n(a) the rolling up of 6 heavy bomber\nsquadrons of No. 205 Group at the rate of\none per month, commencing in April;\n\n(6) the rolling up of 3 light bomber\nsquadrons of Desert Air Force immediately;\n\n(c) the rolling up of 4 day fighter or\nfighter-bomber squadrons at the rate of one\nper month commencing in April;\n\n(@) the transfer of 2 South African medium\nTange general reconnaissance squadrons to\nA.C.S.E.A., when operational, so that two\nRAF. squadrons could be rolled up in that\ntheatre;\n\n56. The Chief of the Air Staff emphasised\nthat he was prepared to consider alternative\nproposals provided that they produced no less\nsaving in manpower.\n\n57. I discussed this matter with my opera-\ntional commanders, and decided that in view\nof the forthcoming offensive in Italy, it was\nmost- important that the fighter and fighter-\nbomber strength of M.A.T.A.F. should not be\nreduced, and that because of the preliminary\nsuccess of Marshal Tito’s offensive in Jugo-\nslavia, the strength of B.A.F. should also be\nmaintained as far as possible. On 22nd March,\ntherefore, I replied to the Chief of the Air Staff,\nproposing an alternative programme of reduc-\ntions, which would provide the same savings\nin manpower, and yet not affect the air power\navailable for the direct support of the land\nforces. At the same time I strongly recommended\nthat earnest consideration should be given to\nthe possibility of postponing all reductions for\nthis theatre until after the end of May, when it\nwas expected that the operations then imminent\nwould have passed their critical phase; and if\nthat were not possible, that at least the post-\nponement of the disbandment of 2 heavy bomber\nsquadrons, and one light bomber squadron,\nwhich I had included in my programme, should\nbe considered.\n\nSUPPLEMENT To tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 29 OCTOBER, 1951\n\n58. As a result of these representations, I\nwas informed by the Air Ministry on the 2nd\nApril that I should be required to reduce my\nstrength in April by only 3 squadrons—one\nBeaufighter anti-shipping squadron, and 2\nfighter or fighter-bomber squadrons. More\nextensive reductions were to follow from June\nonwards.\n\n59. The three squadrons to be rolled up in\nApril were found from M.A.C.A.F. and B.A.F.,\nthe former supplying the Beaufighter anti-\nshipping squadron and a fighter squadron\nengaged on the escort of air sea rescue aircraft,\nand the latter a fighter squadron based in\nGreece. Thus the striking power available for\nthe direct support of the land forces was not\naffected.\n\n60. As events turned out, the war in Europe\nhad finished before the time had come to begin\nthe reductions scheduled for June, and an\nalternative programme was put into effect.\n\n_ Parr IIL.\n\nTHE BALKAN AIR FORCE AND AIR\nOPERATIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE\nJUGOSLAV FOURTH ARMY\nOFFENSIVE.*\n\nTse FORMATION OF BALKAN AIR FORCE AND ITS\n(CO-ORDINATING RESPONSIBILITIES.\n\n61. The situation in the Western Balkans,\nas the year 1944 progressed, was that con-\nsiderable German forces were holding the\nprincipal towns and the communications between\nthem in the face of numerous but ill-co-ordinated\nPartisan attacks. The Partisans were provided\nwith Allied arms and equipment and were\nsupported by small Allied raiding forces and\nby air and naval attacks. This support was,\nhowever, less effective than it might have been,\nbecause, while there was a measure of intelli-\ngence co-ordination which enabled the various\nair forces concerned to operate fairly success-\nfully, there was during the first half of 1944\nno Headquarters which provided operational\nco-ordination without need for constant refer-\nence to Allied Force Headquarters and\nM.A.A.F.\n\n62. In order to provide such co-ordination,\nit was decided in May 1944 to apply to trans-\nAdriatic operations the principle of three co-\nequal Commanders of whom one was to be\ncharged with the co-ordination of planning and\nexecution of operations. is was not quite\nparallel to the system in force at A.F.H.Q.,\nwhere the Supreme Allied Commander was a\n“commander ’’ and not a “‘ co-ordinator '’, nor\nto that in force in the Middle East where the\nthree service commanders were co-equal. So\nfar as the Balkans were concerned, moreover,\nit was appreciated that operations could not be\ndivorced from politics and were closely inter-\nrelated also to “‘ special ’’ activities.\n\n63. It was thus regarded as essential that\nsome machinery of co-ordination should also be\nprovided between the three service Commanders\nand the Foreign Office and State Department\nrepresentatives in Bari, and between the three\nservice Commanders and the Special Operations\nformation concerned with the Western Balkans.\n\n* As the final offensive in Jugoslavia started earlier\nthan that in Italy, it will be convenient to trace it to\nits completion before dealing with events in the main\ntheatre,\n",

In a directive dated 7th June 1944 from\nthe Air Commander-in-Chief, M.A.A.F., a new\ncomposite group was formed known as Balkan\nAir Force. The operational units of Balkan\nAir Force consisted on an average of twenty-\ntwo squadrons excluding those employed on\nspecial supply operations. They operated fifteen\ntypes of aircraft, flown by air-crew of eight\ndifferent nationalities (British, South African,\nTtalian, Greek, Jugoslav, and for the supply\ndropping operations, American, Polish and\nRussian). It will be seen how ‘‘ international \"”\nwere the responsibilities of the A.O.C., B.A.F.\nas an Air Commander.\n\n65. The responsibilities of A.O.C. B.A.F.*\nas co-ordinator of trans-Adriatic operations were\ncontained in a directive from the Supreme\nAllied Commander which became effective on\nthe 15th June 1944. In this directive it was\nlaid down that, apart from the air units coming\nunder his direct command, the A.O.C. B.A.F.\nwas also responsible for co-ordinating the plan-\nning and execution of trans-Adriatic operations\nby all the three services. The land forces affected\nwere known as Land Forces Adriatic (L.F.A.),\nwhile the naval forces concerned were those\nunder the command of Flag Officer, Taranto\nand Liaison with the Italians (F.O.T.A.L.I.).\nOther formations whose activities the A.O.C.\nB.A.F. was required to co-ordinate were:—\n\n(a) No. 37 Military Mission (known as the\nMaclean Mission) which was attached to the\nHeadquarters of Marshal Tito in Jugoslavia.\n\n(b) Force 399, which was responsible for\nMilitary Missions in Albania and Hungary\nand, in a liaison capacity, for missions and\nspecial operations in Greece.\n\n(c) Headquarters Special Operations\n({Mediterranean)—abbreviated title S.O.(M).—\nwhich was responsible for the co-ordination\nand general supervision of special operations\nthroughout the Mediterranean.\n\n66. It was, however, implicit in the directive\nthat while the Air Officer Commanding Balkan\nAir Force was responsible for the co-ordination\nof trans-Adriatic operations, the Naval and\nArmy Commanders were ultimately responsible\nto their respective service Commanders-in-\nChief for the day-to-day conduct of operations.\n\n67. The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean,\nhad always been of the opinion that it was\nunnecessary to associate the Flag Officer,\nTaranto and Liaison with the Italians\n(F.0.T.A.L.1.) so closely with the other two\nservice commanders as to necessitate moving his\nHeadquarters from Taranto to Bari. From the\npoint of view of naval strategy, too, it was desir-\nable that his Headquarters should remain at\nTaranto. He was accordingly represented at\nBalkan Air Force Headquarters by a Naval\nLiaison Officer who filled the position more\nof an additional Chief of Staff than an actual\nLiaison Officer. ‘\n\n68. Located in the same building at Bari was\nthe Rear Headquarters of the Maclean Mission.\nForce 399 was located partly in the R.A.F.\nbuilding and partly elsewhere in Bari.\n\n* A.V.M. Elliot was succeeded by A.V.M. Mills on\n33th February, 1945.\n\n5563\n\n69. There was therefore set up in one building\nin Bari what amounted to a miniature G.H.Q.\nMajor issues of policy were discussed at periodic\nconferences between the three commanders at\nwhich their political advisers and representa-\ntives of 37 Military Mission and Force 399 were\npresent as required. Day-to-day inter-service\ndiscussions also took place at a morning War\nRoom Conference and subsequently between\noperations and intelligence of the three\nservices at a conference presided over by the\nSenior Air Staff Officer, B.A.F.\n\n70. In order to deal with the various political\nproblems which are inevitably produced by war\nin the Balkans, representatives in Bari of the\nBritish Resident Minister, Central Mediter-\nranean, and of the U.S. Political Adviser,\nA.F.H.Q., were made the Political Advisers of\nthe A.O.C. Balkan Air Force, and he presided\nover a Policy Committee which, besides the\nother two service Commanders, included his\nPolitical Advisers and the representatives of the\nMaclean Mission, Force 399 and H.Q., S.O. (M).\n\n71. As part of the machinery of inter-service\nco-ordination and to effect the necessary liaison\nbetween the three services, the offices of the\npolitical representatives and the various\n“* special ’’ forces, an Inter-Service Secretariat\nwas added to the staff of A.O.C., B.A.F.\n\n72. Joint Planning and Joint Intelligence\nStaffs were also set up and the Intelligence\nStaff was given the task of providing Balkan\nintelligence on a wide scale to meet not only\nthe requirements of B.A.F. and L.F.A. but for\nForce 399 and S.O. (M). A small joint Public\nRelations Office was also set up.\n\n73. There was a Combined Signals organisa-\ntion and a Chief Signals Officer (Army) B.A.F.\nwas appointed who was responsible to the Air\nOfficer Commanding in his capacity as co-\nordinator of Balkan operations. Necessarily he\nworked in the closest touch with the Chief\nSignals Officer (Air) who was responsible for\nB.A.F. Signals.\n\n74. The joint organisation worked well. Inter-\nservice contacts were maintained all day and\nevery day and the close relations which were\nestablished with the political and special forces\nrepresented in Bari were of the utmost value\nin handling the various politico-military prob-\nlems of the Balkan war. So close was this\nday-to-day contact that in fact it was found\npossible to discontinue the meetings of the Com-\nmittee which had been set up to deal with\nSpecial Operations matters.\n\n75. Another feature of the joint organisation\nwas that a system of inter-service command\nresponsible to B.A.F., F.O.T.A.L,1. and L.F.A,\nwas established on the island of Vis and sub-\nsequently on the mainland at Zadar, which be-\ncame known as C.0.Z.A. (Combined Opera-\ntions Zadar).\n\n76. It was made clear in the A.O.C.’s direc-\ntive that the primary object of trans-\nAdriatic operations was ‘‘to contain and\ndestroy as many enemy forces as possible in\nthe Balkans.’’ From the Allied resources at\nthat time employed against the Germans it was\n\n- Bot to be expected there would be much to\n\nspare for operations in the Balkans. Moreover,\nit was the policy of the U.S. Chiefs of Staff\nthat U.S. forces, apart from some special service\nunits, should not be employed in an operational\n\nrole in the Balkans.\n",

Before proceeding to deal with Balkan\noperations, it is most important to note some\nof the main problems with which the Balkan\nAir Force was faced, in so far as they were\nspecial conditions which had hitherto not been\nmet by previous air forces. On the purely\ncombat side, implementation of the Directive\ncalled for two major tasks: —\n\n(a) air support for the Partisans, or, as\nthey were called from the beginning of 1945,\nthe Jugoslavy Army of National Liberation\n(J-A.N.L.),\n\n(b) attacks on the enemy’s road, rail and\nsea communications on which he was so de-\npendent for the maintenance of his position\nin the Balkans, and where, when he had to\nmove, he offered the best chance of being\neffectively engaged.\n\n78. The degree and kind of support afforded\nto those Partisans operating in the liberated\nsections of Jugoslavia, did not differ from that\ngiven to Partisans operating in the zones still\nunder the general control of the Germans. The\nboundary between the liberated and unliberated\nzones was at all times extremely uncertain.\n\nSupport Operations.\n\n79. Operations in support of the Partisans\nwere, throughout, seriously hampered by the\nguerilla nature of the forces, inadequate com-\nmunications between them and Balkan Air\nForce, and the inability of the Partisan leaders\nto appreciate what the Air Force could, or\ncould not, do for them. From the first, R.A.F.\nLiaison Officers with W/T links to B.A.F. were\nestablished with the Partisan Corps, but this\nsketchy W/T communication could not be\nmaintained on a 24-hour basis. These facts,\ncoupled with Partisan reluctance to disclose\ntheir plans or to frame time-tables to which\nit was possible for us to adhere, severely limited\nthe opportunities for really close support. A\nfurther drawback was the reluctance of the\nPartisans to make an attack in daylight and\nthe inability of our aircraft to attack at last\nlight and return the 200 miles or more to their\nbases in darkness.\n\n80. Added to this was the fact that the Parti-\nsans were primarily guerillas, and as such\nmoved rapidly and frequently; some villages\nchanged hands as many as fifty or sixty times,\nand areas that were Partisan controlled one day,\nwere often ovet-run by the enemy on the next\nand vice versa. This made the task of keeping\nup-to-date situation maps a big one.\n\n8x. Operations under this heading, therefore,\nnormally consisted of fighter-bomber, rocket\nprojectile, or bomber attacks on communica-\ntions leading up to, or strongpoints in, areas\nwhere the Partisans were engaging the enemy\noffensively or defensively on a considerable\nscale; or on strongpoints or enemy-held villages\nnear which isolated Partisan formations were\nbeing hard-pressed. Beaufighters, in par-\nticular, became highly effective in specialised\nattacks of this nature.\n\n82. For the Jugoslav Fourth Army offensive\nin Croatia in the Spring of 1945, these difficul-\nties were considerably reduced by an increase\nin the number of Liaison Officers and an im-\nprovement in communications; for instance, for\n\n, SUPPLEMENT to tag LONDON GAZETTE, 29 OCTOBER, 1951\n\nlong periods there was a direct telephone line\nfrom the Jugoslav 4th Army Headquarters to-\nBalkan Air Force Advanced Command Post .\nat Zadar. This allowed much better support\nto be given to the Partisans, though naturally\nit never reached the highest standard achieved\nbetween modern air forces and armies.\n\nAttacks on Communications.\n\n83. Apart from shipping attacks, operations\nagainst communications fell into three main\ncategories : —\n\n(a) attacks on large scale concentrations\nof Motor vehicles when the enemy moved in\nforce. A typical instance was the German\nwithdrawal from the Sarajevo salient in\nApril, 1945. On these targets all types of\naircraft were concentrated, and help was\ncalled for from other formations. The brunt\nof these attacks was, however, normally\nborne by fighter-bombers.\n\n(b) armed reconnaissance of railways and\ntoads, Railways provided profitable targets\nthroughout. In the first days roads also gave\ngood results, but later, unless large scale\nmovements were afoot, few targets were seen\nand the main value of the reconnaissance\nlay in denying the use of the roads to the\nenemy by day and forcing him to use them\nby night, when they were always liable to\nPartisan attacks. These armed recon-\nnaissances were almost entirely the task of\nSpitfires, Mustangs and P.39s.\n\n(c) attacks on marshalling yards, rail tracks\nand bridges. These were mainly the task\nof the light bombers and R.P. Beaufighters,\nwith incidental fighter-bomber attacks usually\nmade when no other targets were offered on\nthe particular stretch of road which was being\nswept. Apart from the actual casualties or\n\ne inflicted upon personnel and\nmaterial, these attacks occasioned sufficient\ndamage to installations to prevent the enemy\never really catching up with repairs, and\nthis had a definite effect in slowing up move-\nment by rail.\n\nAttacks on Sea Communications.\n\n8&4. These were the task of the Rocket Pro-\njectile Hurricanes and, occasionally, Beau-\nfighters. All enemy sea traffic up the Adriatic\ncoast and amongst the islands was virtually\nstopped after the establishment of the ad-\nvanced bases at Vis and Zadar brought it with-\nin effective range of the Hurricanes.\n\n85. In addition to attacks on the actual craft\nthemselves, attacks on enemy small naval craft\nbases in the Northern Adriatic played a major\npart in denying their use to the enemy and\nthus eliminating what was potentially a serious\nthreat. R.P. Hurricanes and Beaufighters\nproved very effective for this work. Anti-flak\nsupport was normally given for these targets by\nSpitfires or Mustangs. Several attacks of this\nkind were made in co-operation with light\nNaval forces. Special mention should also be\nmade of the highly successful attacks carried\nout by XV Air Force (U.S.A.A.F.) on Pola,\nTrieste and Fiume.\n\nBases. .\n86.

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 OCTOBER, 1951\n\nGargano, peninsula. _ Special Operations air-\ncraft operated from Brindisi and Lecce. On\noccasions, however, particularly when the\nGermans were withdrawing from Greece,\nBrindisi was used as an advanced base by all\n\n87. In addition to bases in Italy, an ad-\nvanced base was available on the island of\nVis throughout B.A.F.’s period of operations.\nOwing to the shortness of the landing strip and\nbad approaches, this was normally only used\nby fighter-bombers, with a daily average of\nsome 35 sorties. During 1945 it became more\nand more a special advanced base of the Italian\nSpitfire and P-39 squadrons. It was not suit-\nable for Macchis,\n\n88. From February onwards, an advanced\nlanding ground was established at Prkos, near\nZadar, and gradually developed until, by the\nend of April, No. 281 Wing, which by then\ncomprised all single-engined squadrons except\nthe Italians, was based there.\n\nOperational Conditions.\n\n8 9. The lack of adequate air bases on the\neast side of the Adriatic meant that a v\ngreat majority of sorties flown by Balkan Air\nForce involved a double sea crossing of at least\ntoo miles in each direction, and often much\nmore, which added considerably to the strain\non aircrew, particularly after facing heavy\nflak.\n\n90. Added to this were the dangers in-\nseparable from operations in . mountainous\ncountry during the extremely cloudy weather\nconditions prevalent during the winter. More-\nover, when aircraft reached the target area, the\ntugged mountainous nature of the country often\nmade attacks difficult to carry out, as for in-\nstance, when targets were road or rail move-\nment running through ravines, as was\nfrequently the case.\n\ngx. These conditions combined with the\nnature of the work to make operations in the\nBalkans, particularly by fighter-bombers and\nBeaufighters, as tough as those normally carried\nout in other theatres in spite of the almost com-\nplete lack of air opposition. On the other side,\nhowever, was the compensating advantage that\nif shot or forced down in the Balkans there was\nalways a good chance of falling into friendly\nhands and sooner or later getting back to Italy.\nTowards the end, missing aircrews would very\noften be back with their units within two or\nthree days.\n\ng2. Another result of these conditions was\nthat calls from the Partisans for support were\nvery often impossible to meet. The difficulties\nwere not always appreciated by the Partisans\nwho, except when weather conditions obviously\nmade an attack impossible, were apt to inter-\npret the non-fulfilment of a task as an example\nof bad faith and non-co-operation.\n\nBritish Liaison Officers and Target Information.\n\n93- With friendly forces located throughout\nJugoslavia and Albania, and with excellent in-\nformation being passed by the British Liaison\nOfficers attached to all main Partisan Head-\nquarters, a wealth of data on German forma-\ntions and enemy movement was always avail-\nable. A vast amount of intelligence of all kinds\nwas received at Headquarters, and collated and\nevaluated by the intelligence staffs of the three\nservices. .\n\n5565\n\n94. In a very great number of cases however\nwhen Partisan Headquarters desired air attacks\nto be made on specific targets they did not pass\nadequate or detailed information on the target\nthrough the British liaison officers, and often\nrequests to attack German isons: in towns\nfailed to give detailed aiming points. The\nobtaining of such vital information therefore\nled to delays before attacks could be carried\nout.\n\nTarget Clearance.\n\n95. One of the major difficulties encountered\nin operating over Jugoslavia was the fact that\ntargets could not be attacked without prior\nclearance from Partisan G.H.Q. This authority\nwas delegated, as regards tactical targets, to\nPartisan subordinate Army H.Q.’s; but as far\nas major strategical targets were concerned,\ndelays by Partisan G.H.Q. in giving clearance\noften seriously delayed or hindered attacks of\nconsiderable importance. On occasions, clear-\nance was refused and attacks could not be\nmade.\n\n96. One could understand the reluctance of\nthe Jugoslavs to clear targets in their own\ncountry for heavy air attack, with the inevitable\ndamage to their towns and civilians, but often\nthis permission was refused or withheld for\nlong periods in spite of the fact that the enemy\nwere obviously attaching great importance to\nthe targets and possibly taking advantage of\nsuch “‘immunity.”’ Thus Ljubljana marshal-\nling yard, which had over 1,000 units of rolling\nstock in the later stages, was not cleared for\nattack. It is only fair to state, however, that\npermission was normally withheld only when\ntargets lay in built-up areas.\n\n97. Balkan Air Force was responsible for\napproving all targets in the Balkans selected\nfor air attack. This was done by means of\ndaily signals to all other air forces and by\nholding daily target conferences which were\nattended by Intelligence and Operations Officers\nof the XV Air Force, 205 Group and 37 Mili-\ntary Mission.

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 OCTOBER, 1951\n\nGargano, peninsula. _ Special Operations air-\ncraft operated from Brindisi and Lecce. On\noccasions, however, particularly when the\nGermans were withdrawing from Greece,\nBrindisi was used as an advanced base by all\n\n87. In addition to bases in Italy, an ad-\nvanced base was available on the island of\nVis throughout B.A.F.’s period of operations.\nOwing to the shortness of the landing strip and\nbad approaches, this was normally only used\nby fighter-bombers, with a daily average of\nsome 35 sorties. During 1945 it became more\nand more a special advanced base of the Italian\nSpitfire and P-39 squadrons. It was not suit-\nable for Macchis,\n\n88. From February onwards, an advanced\nlanding ground was established at Prkos, near\nZadar, and gradually developed until, by the\nend of April, No. 281 Wing, which by then\ncomprised all single-engined squadrons except\nthe Italians, was based there.\n\nOperational Conditions.\n\n8 9. The lack of adequate air bases on the\neast side of the Adriatic meant that a v\ngreat majority of sorties flown by Balkan Air\nForce involved a double sea crossing of at least\ntoo miles in each direction, and often much\nmore, which added considerably to the strain\non aircrew, particularly after facing heavy\nflak.\n\n90. Added to this were the dangers in-\nseparable from operations in . mountainous\ncountry during the extremely cloudy weather\nconditions prevalent during the winter. More-\nover, when aircraft reached the target area, the\ntugged mountainous nature of the country often\nmade attacks difficult to carry out, as for in-\nstance, when targets were road or rail move-\nment running through ravines, as was\nfrequently the case.\n\ngx. These conditions combined with the\nnature of the work to make operations in the\nBalkans, particularly by fighter-bombers and\nBeaufighters, as tough as those normally carried\nout in other theatres in spite of the almost com-\nplete lack of air opposition. On the other side,\nhowever, was the compensating advantage that\nif shot or forced down in the Balkans there was\nalways a good chance of falling into friendly\nhands and sooner or later getting back to Italy.\nTowards the end, missing aircrews would very\noften be back with their units within two or\nthree days.\n\ng2. Another result of these conditions was\nthat calls from the Partisans for support were\nvery often impossible to meet. The difficulties\nwere not always appreciated by the Partisans\nwho, except when weather conditions obviously\nmade an attack impossible, were apt to inter-\npret the non-fulfilment of a task as an example\nof bad faith and non-co-operation.\n\nBritish Liaison Officers and Target Information.\n\n93- With friendly forces located throughout\nJugoslavia and Albania, and with excellent in-\nformation being passed by the British Liaison\nOfficers attached to all main Partisan Head-\nquarters, a wealth of data on German forma-\ntions and enemy movement was always avail-\nable. A vast amount of intelligence of all kinds\nwas received at Headquarters, and collated and\nevaluated by the intelligence staffs of the three\nservices. .\n\n5565\n\n94. In a very great number of cases however\nwhen Partisan Headquarters desired air attacks\nto be made on specific targets they did not pass\nadequate or detailed information on the target\nthrough the British liaison officers, and often\nrequests to attack German isons: in towns\nfailed to give detailed aiming points. The\nobtaining of such vital information therefore\nled to delays before attacks could be carried\nout.\n\nTarget Clearance.\n\n95. One of the major difficulties encountered\nin operating over Jugoslavia was the fact that\ntargets could not be attacked without prior\nclearance from Partisan G.H.Q. This authority\nwas delegated, as regards tactical targets, to\nPartisan subordinate Army H.Q.’s; but as far\nas major strategical targets were concerned,\ndelays by Partisan G.H.Q. in giving clearance\noften seriously delayed or hindered attacks of\nconsiderable importance. On occasions, clear-\nance was refused and attacks could not be\nmade.\n\n96. One could understand the reluctance of\nthe Jugoslavs to clear targets in their own\ncountry for heavy air attack, with the inevitable\ndamage to their towns and civilians, but often\nthis permission was refused or withheld for\nlong periods in spite of the fact that the enemy\nwere obviously attaching great importance to\nthe targets and possibly taking advantage of\nsuch “‘immunity.”’ Thus Ljubljana marshal-\nling yard, which had over 1,000 units of rolling\nstock in the later stages, was not cleared for\nattack. It is only fair to state, however, that\npermission was normally withheld only when\ntargets lay in built-up areas.\n\n97. Balkan Air Force was responsible for\napproving all targets in the Balkans selected\nfor air attack. This was done by means of\ndaily signals to all other air forces and by\nholding daily target conferences which were\nattended by Intelligence and Operations Officers\nof the XV Air Force, 205 Group and 37 Mili-\ntary Mission. A representative of B.A.F. also\nattended the i target conference of\nM.AS.A.F. In this way a most satisfactory\nliaison was kept up. Day attacks of the\nXV Air Force and 205 Group heavy bombers\nwere closely co-ordinated with sweeps by B.A.F.\nfighters and those of Desert Air Force.\n\nThe Bomb Line.\n8. Mention has already been made of the\nifficulty of maintaining up-to-date information\non Partisan positions and intentions. This was\nincreased when the Russians entered Jugoslavia\nand showed the same reluctance to give in-\nformation as the Partisans, while their com-\nmunications with the Mediterranean theatre\nwere even more circuitous and inadequate.\nThese factors led to the establishment of a\nbomb line which gave a very generous safety\nmargin except when close tactical support had\nbeen calied for by the Partisans. In the\nRussian case this was 80 miles ahead of their\nlast known position, unless previous clearance\nwas obtained through Moscow.\n\n99. In spite of these precautions, instances\nunfortunately occurred of Partisan forces being\nattacked by Allied aircraft, due in most cases\nto their having moved without intimation.\nThese, however, never led to serious reper-\ncussions.\n",
