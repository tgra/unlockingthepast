SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON

GRAFTON she was in danger of being tor-
pedoed. At that moment, 0250, GRAFTON
was torpedoed, COMFORT was lifted in the
air, and Captain of WAKEFUL washed over-
board. COMFORT was going full speed and as
she came round in a circle LYDD and
GRAFTON opened fire on her, evidently think-
ing she was an enemy ship. It is believed that
COMFORT crew, except one, and WAKEFUL
survivors, except four, were killed. LYDD
then bore down on COMFORT, rammed and
sank her.

Previously GRAFTON, who was proceeding
to Dover with troops, had observed a ship tor-
pedoed, and lowered her boats to pick up sur-
vivors, subsequently ascertained by signal to
LYDD to be WAKEFUL. A small darkened
vessel, thought to be a drifter, was signalled and
told to pick up survivors. Within a few seconds
of this, GRAFTON was torpedoed. The bridge
was also hit, either by a shell or grenade, and
the Captain killed instantly. LYDD then tried
to come alongside but after hitting starboard
side sheered off, and appeared to ram a vessel
on: port quarter. This was COMFORT.
GRAFTON opened fire under the impression
LYDD had rammed the M.T.B. Target was
then shifted to another vessel further away on
port quarter, and vessel was observed to blow
up with a bright flash. This may well have
been the enemy M.T.B.

28. During the forencon JAGUAR,
GALLANT and GRENADE were dispatched
via the new Middle Route X to test the opposi-
tion by shore batteries prior to introducing this
route as an alternative to the long Northern
route. GRENADE arrived Dunkirk, reported
no fire from shore batteries, but that she had
experienced heavy bombing. These three des-
troyers were attacked by dive bombers when
approaching Dunkirk at about noon, and
GALLANT was damaged. At least six attacks
were carried out, one enemy aircraft was
brought down by gunfire and others by fighters.
An hour Jater MALCOLM reported Dunkirk
heavily bombed with a large number of air-
craft and during the afternoon this bombing
extended up the coast to ships off Bray. During
the afternoon the Middle Route X was brought
into use for destroyers, but small ships were still
routed round the Northern route to Zuydecoote
Pass. LOCUST and MOSQUITO joined Dover
Command and were dispatched to work on the
beaches during the afternoon. Shortly after
noon enemy shore batteries near Nieuport began
to bring Zuydecoote Pass under spasmodi¢ gun-
fire and the state was being reached whereby
the new Middle Route would become the only
practicable daylight approach to Dunkirk and
the beaches. At noon, CALCUTTA, who was
able to get across to La Panne beach to receive
troops by small boats, embarked 1,200 troops
from the minesweepers and then sailed for Sheer-
ness, the minesweepers remaining to load up
again. At 1606, the New Route X having been
fully swept, all ships were ordered by the Vice
Admiral to use Route X, exercising navigational
caution, and those from Dover were instructed
to proceed by Route Z, the South route, pro-
vided the passage between Calais Bell Buoy
and Dunkirk be made in darkness.

Route X passed some 26 miles to the South-
Westward of the extreme N.E. point of the
Northern Route Y, the locality in which enemy
M.T.B. attack threatened, and was shielded by

the French minefields in the Ruytingen and
Dyck channels. It appears that the enemy
M.T.B. command failed to appreciate the with-
drawal of traffic to the S.W. and did not follow
up.

In the evening it was reported that there was
no congestion anywhere on the coast, except at
La Panne. The force at La Panne was accord-
ingly reinforced as ships became available.

29. An additional beach party of seven
officers and a number of ratings under
Captain J. Howson was sailed in SABRE at
1600 for Dunkirk, and Captain E. Bush, who
had already visited Dunkirk and was aware of
the general conditions, was sent to HEBE as
S.N.O. afloat off the beaches. An M.T.B. was
placed at the disposal of the S.N.O. on the

coast.

30. At about 1600 a heavy air attack com-
menced on the East Mole Pier, Dunkirk har-
bour, mainly by dive bombing, which lasted
continuously for more than two hours. At
the same time, other air attacks took place on
ships lying off Bray. Attacks were renewed
from time to time up till after 2000, not only
on Dunkirk, ‘but on ships off Bray, in the
Zuydecoote Pass and those in the Southern end
of X Route. These attacks were to have a
disastrous result on the evacuation arrange-
ments at Dunkirk. There were present along-
side the inner side of the Eastern Arm two
destroyers GRENADE and JAGUAR, three
trawlers ahead of the GRENADE and
JAGUAR, three more trawlers ahead of them
with CANTERBURY in the next berth, and
a French destroyer ahead of the CANTER-
BURY. Outside the harbour on the outside
of the Eastern Arm the Transport FENELLA
was berthed opposite the GRENADE and
JAGUAR and the CRESTED EAGLE opposite
the six trawlers. In addition, the MALCOLM
and VERITY were also in the harbour but fur-
ther inside. This presented a very good target
and the ships were soon hit and embarkation
of troops ceased for the time being. CANTER-
BURY, accompanied by JAGUAR, succeeded
in leaving harbour, but both were hit by bombs
and damaged. Both succeeded in reaching
Dover, though JAGUAR had to be towed part
of the way and was subjected to many attacks
on passage. CANTERBURY reached harbour
at 2115 and disembarked 1,950 troops but was
sufficiently damaged to prevent her being used
again in these operations. To return to Dun-
kirk, FENELLA was lying alongside on the
outside of the pier, and was hit and sunk.
GRENADE and one of the trawlers on the
East side were hit and the trawler sank in the
fairway. GRENADE sinking and on fire had to
be abandoned and appeared to be about to
sink in the fairway. A trawler was detailed to
tow her clear, VERITY, who witnessed this
occurrence: was continuously straddled by
bombs for 35 minutes. Passage all along the
pier having ceased, she cast off, and skirting
the burning GRENADE and trawler, proceeded
out of harbour, grounding slightly on a sunk
drifter in the entrance. At about 1800 KING
ORRY arrived to find the harbour occupied
only by burning and sinking ships, with no
sign of any one on the pier nor any boat moving
in the harbour. She was immediately subjected
to heavy bombing attacks, having previously
had her steering gear put out of action by a
dive bombing attack when about half mile
