arrange supply dropping. Eventually the
operations against the Mandalay-Lashio rail-
way were abandoned, and it was decided to
tecross the Irrawaddy and return to India. An
attempt to cross the Irrawaddy at Inywa (south
of Katha) was discovered by the enemy, and
failed. The order was therefore given for the
force to break up into Dispersal Groups—a
manceuvre which had been practised during
training—and to cross the river on a very wide
front and return to India independently. This
was successfully done, most Groups reached
the Chindwin in the area occupied by the 23rd
Division near Sittaung; one column crossed it
as far north as Tamanthi and went thence to
Kohima; one marched due north and won out
by Fort Hertz, one went east to Paoshan, was
hospitably received by the Chinese Army and
flown back to India by the Americans. The
majority of the force had returned by the first
week in June. The Brigade had spent four
months inside territory occupied by the
- Japanese.

28. The enterprise had no strategic value, and
about one-third of the force which entered
Burma was lost. But the experience gained
of operations of this type, in supply dropping
from the air, and in jungle warfare and Jap-
anese methods, was invaluable. The enemy
was obviously surprised and at a loss, and
found no effective means to counter the harass-
ment of our columns. The operations showed
the necessity for a very high standard of train-
ing and physical fitness in troops employed on
such expeditions. In general, Brigadier Win-
gate’s theories and leadership were fully
vindicated. A detailed and frank account of
the enterprise is given in his printed report of
the operations. As soon as the expedition
started, I had issued orders for the formation of
another brigade (11r Indian Infantry Brigade)
on similar lines.

OPERATIONS IN N.-E. Burma.

2g. Early in 1942 the construction of a road
from Ledo (in North-East Assam) towards
Myitkyina in Upper Burma had been begun.
Work had been interrupted by the evacuation
of Burma and by the monsoon; but had been
resumed in November. In December the
Americans took over the construction, with the
intention of eventually driving a supply route
through to China. By June 20 roadhead had
crossed the Paungsa Pass, 46 miles from Ledo.
The nature of the country and the climate made
the work extremely difficult. To protect the
construction, the Americans employed a part
of the Chinese*troops who had been trained in
India under American supervision (see para-
graphs 15 and 16 of my Despatch on operations
in the Easterti Theatre based in India, ‘Mar.-
Dec: 1942).*

30. I mentioned in my last Despatch* (para-
graph 22) the reoccupation of Fort Hertz in
the extreme north of Burma to support the
operations of the Kachin Levies towards

Myitkyina. These levies, under Lieut.-Colonel
* Gamble, did most valuable work in harassing

the Japanese forces in the Myitkyina area during
_ the early part of 1943; so much so that they

stung the enemy into retaliation. Early in

March a considerable Japanese force advanced

on Sumprabum, temporarily dispersed the

levies, and seemed to threaten Fort Hertz.

There was a moment when it was represented
io me that only a brigade could save Fort
Hertz. There was no brigade available; the
only means of communication with Fort Hertz
were by air; and very few transport aircraft
were available. I had one additional company
flown in to Fort Hertz. The Japanese did not
advance beyond Sumprabum and the levies
soon recovered their morale.

OPERATIONS OF R.I.N.

31. Apart from the assistance’ given by
small craft in the Arakan operations (see para-
gtaphs 6 and 20 above), there is little to re-
cord of the operations, of the Royal Indian
Navy, which carried on its normal escort and
patrol duties. There was no enemy naval ac-
tivity in the Indian theatre during the period.

AIR OPERATIONS.

32. During the period under review the
R.A.F. continued to expand in numbers and
began to receive more modern aeroplanes and
equipment. In 1943 itcan be said tohave passed
defimtely from the defensive to the offensive.
We were still, however, much below our re-
quirements, and our aircraft were deficient in
range and performance, and included many
obsolete or obsolescent types. The operational
strength of the R.A.F. by June 1943 was—

18 Fighter squadrons,
2 Squadrons long-range bombers,
2 Squadrons medium bombers,
rz Squadrons light bombers,
2 Squadrons torpedo bombers,
6 Squadrons Flying-boats,
2 Squadrons Transport aircraft,
2 General Recce. Squadrons,
1 Photographic Recce, Squadron,
x Coastal Fighter Squadron,
I Night Fighter Squadron.
The Fighter Squadrons were equipped with
Hurricanes and Mohawks; the heavy bombers
were Liberators, the medium bombers Welling-
tons, and the light bombers Blenheims and
Vengeances. The torpedo bombers were Beau-
forts, the flying-boats Catalinas,.and the trans-
port aircraft Hudsons and Dakotas. There
were also a few Spitfires and Hurricanes used
for photographic reconnaissance. The
General Reconnaissance Squadrons were
equipped with Hudsons whilst the Coastal
Fighter Squadron and the Night Fighter
Squadron were both equipped with Beau-
fighters.

The strength of the roth American Air Force
also increased and by June it’had available
approximately 60 fighters (Kittyhawks), 50
heavy bombers (Liberators) and 7o medium
bombers (Mitchells). | Working in close co-
operation, the R.A.F. and U.S.A.A.F. together
established air superiority over the Japanese
air forces operating from Burma.

33. The objects of the Air Force operations
during the period under review were:—
(a)'To establish and maintain air super-
lority in Burma;
(b) To support the operations of the Army;
(c) To disrupt enemy communications in
Burma; g
(d) To defend India against air attack; and
(e) To supply from the air, forces which
could not be supplied by normal means.
The first object was attained by attacks by
day and night on enemy-occupied airfields and
air installations and bases and by taking every
opportunity to engage the enemy in the air.
