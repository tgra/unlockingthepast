Jand at the beginning of the year with instruc-
tions to seview the whole problem of retention
of Italians and to make his own recommenda-
tions. That was the first intimation I had
received from any source of the existence of any
such instructions. The orders I had received
were never easy to execute. My difficulties
were increased ‘by contrary instructions to one
person and their non-disclosure to myself as
responsible authority.

In August, 1942, approval was given for the
figure of 500 retained Italians to be increased
to 700. Since then 600 who had been hiding
have been rounded up from country districts.
It would be too optimistic to suggest that the
country even now is clear of ‘‘ embusqués.”’

ERITREA.

‘When the East Africa Command came into
being, Eritrea formed part of it chiefly because
of a political supposition in some minds that
Eritrea and Ethiopia were indivisible.

Before the Command had been in existence
for many weeks it became apparent that this
arrangement was not workable, due to the mili-
tary fact that Massawa was to be developed as
a Middle East Base and that an American Air
Repair and Assembly Plant was to be estab-
lished at Gura. Both of these projects were
being carried out mainly for Milale East re-
quirements. On ist February, 1942, Eritrea
came once more under the command of General
Headquarters, Middle East,

ANGLO-ETHIOPIAN Agreement.

Before entering Ethiopia, the Emperor made
repeated attempts to obtain from His Majesty’s
Government a Treaty of Agreement establish-
ing the relations between Great Britain and
Ethiopia. Although His Majesty’s Government
found itself unable at that stage to enter into
any such formal agreement, the Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs made a pronounce-
ment in Parliament on 4th February, 1941,
which defined the British Government’s inten-
tions as regards the Emperor and his country’s
future. The text of this important pronounce-
ment was as follows:

“His Majesty’s Government would wel-
come the reappearance of an independent
Ethiopian State and will recognise the claim
of the Emperor Haile Selassie to the throne.
The Emperor has intimated to His Majesty’s
Government that he will need assistance and
guidance. His Majesty’s Government agree
with this view and consider that any such
assistance and guidance in economic and
political matters should be the subject of
international agreement at the conclusion of
peace. They re-affirm that they themselves
have no territorial ambitions in Abyssinia.

In the meanwhile the conduct of military
operations by Imperial Forces in parts of
Abyssinia will require temporary measures
of military guidance and control. These will
be carried out in consultation with the Em-
peror, and will be brought to an end as
soon as the situation permits.”’

In the letter formally communicating the
text of this pronouncement to the Emperor, the
Commander-in-Chief Middle East, General
Sir Archibald P. Wavell, G.C.B., C.MG.,
M-C., enlarged upon the final paragraph of the
Secretary of State’s pronouncement and ex-
plained the administrative machinery which he

obligations imposed upon him as the Com-
mander of the Army in Occupied Enemy Terri-

tory.

These obligations entailed the establishment
of a Military Administration to administer the
country in collaboration with the Emperor
during the interval which necessarily elapsed
between the return of the Emperor to his
Capital on 5th May, 1941, and the signing of
the Agreement some nine months later.

In accordance with the promise implied in
the final paragraph of Mr. Eden’s pronounce-
ment, it was decided as soon as military cir-
cumstances permitted, to put an end as far as
possible to the measure of administrative con-
trol exercised by the Occupied Territories
Administration on behalf of the Commander-
in-Chief Middle East and subsequently on my
behalf. The text of the Agreement which was
to achieve this object was prepared by the
Political Branch, East Africa Command, after
many discussions with the Emperor, and was
the subject of two visits to London by the
then Chief Political Officer, Major-General Sir
Philip Mitchell, K.C.M.G., M.C. As the result
of these discussions the Agreement in its final
form was presented by Sir Philip Mitchell to
the Emperor in December, 1941. The Emperor
raised a number of minor points but eventu-
ally accepted the text with only unimportant
modifications and the Agreement, and its
accompanying Military Convention, were signed
with due formality on 31st January, 1942.

The ability and patience with which Sir
Philip Mitchell conducted these negotiations
during many months against continuous diffi-
culties, the principal and most consistent of
which was that an ell was demanded for every
inch offered, were beyond praise.

As-a result of this Agreement, direct British
control in Ethiopia became limited to the
Reserved Areas comprising a belt of territory
25 miles wide along the border of French
Somaliland, an area occupied principally by
Somalis adjoining the British Somaliland
border; the territory occupied by the Franco-
Ethiopian railway; the Ogaden; and a number
of cantonments of which Addis Ababa, Harrar
and Diredaua were the most important.

In August, 1941, our troops were withdrawn
from Addis Ababa, care of the aerodrome there
being taken over by the British Military
Mission to Ethiopia.

Part JV.—OvuTBREAK OF WAR WITH JAPAN

AND Irs ErFect oN East AFRICA COMMAND.

Japan’s entry into. the war and her early
successes brought the threat of war to the East
African, coast. My immediate problems as a
result of this were re-orientation of the Com-
mand dispositions with the object of s en-
ing the defence of the coast, with particular
teference to the port of Mombasa; and the pre-
paration of East African formations for service
overseas. As a corollary to these problems,
some withdrawal of troops commenced from
Ethiopia and the Northern Frontier District of
Kenya where their retention could not be
described as essential for the main war effort.

Operations against Ethiopia had naturally
caused the Command to face North. It had
now to face East. There were few troops along
the coast. The few Coast Defence guns were
obsolete British ones or captured Italian ones.
There was not one anti-aircraft gun in the whole
Command. There were practically no British
artillery personnel, The training and expan-
