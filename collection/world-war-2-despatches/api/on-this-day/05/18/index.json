Late on the evening of 18th May General Catroux, th  Free French Commissioner in Middle East, came to me and said he had certain information that the French in Syria were withdrawing the whole of their troops into the Lebanon and were handing over the remainder of Syria to the Germans. He declared that the toad to Damascus was open and that it was urgently necessary to take advantage of the opportunity and to send a force into Syria immediately. He was most insistent that I should issue orders to this effect there and then. Previous experience had taught me to regard the information produced by the Free French from Syria with caution, and what General Catroux stated was not confirmed by intelligence I had received from other sources. Quite apart from this, as stated above, I had not the troops or the transport available to send a force into Syria. I therefore refused to take any immediate action but summoned a meeting for the following morning to consider the whole question. At this meeting there was general agreement as to the desirability of forestalling the Germans in Syria, but the only means available was by weakening the defence of Egypt in the Western Desert. In the meantime, I insisted on verification of the Free French information before.acting on it.",

It seemed possible that the object of this reconnaissance was to locate the ice-limits either with a view to an attack on Jan Mayen Island, or to assist some ship to break in or out of the North Sea, through the Denmark Strait. On x4th May, accordingly, I asked the Flag Officer-in-Charge, Iceland, for a report of the ice conditions round Jan Mayen Island. The report showed that the approach was possible only from between south and south-west, with ice blocking all other directions. Reports of troop movements in Norway, a false alarm of an air invasion of Iceland and an air reconnaissance of Scapa Flow all continued to direct my attention towards the Denmark Strait; and on 18th May I instructed SUFFOLK, who was cn patrol, to keep a special watch on the passage in both directions close to the ice.
