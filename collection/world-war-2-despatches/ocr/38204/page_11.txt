SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 11 FEBRUARY, 1048

The following Despatch was submitted to the
Lords Comsmsssioners of the Admiraliy on
the and February, 1944 by Rear Admiral
C.B Barry, D.S O., Admiral (Submarines).

and February, 1944.

With reference to my submission of 8th
November, 1943, be pleased to lay before the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty the
following further report on operations by X-
craft against the German main units (Operation
“* Source ’*),

2. It is now possible to reconstruct the
attacks carried out by His Majesty’s midget
submarines on the battleship TIRPITZ on 22nd
September, 1943, and to make some assessment
of the damage sustained by this ship as the
result of the attacks,

3. Three X-craft, X.5 (Lieutenant H. Henty-
Creer, R.N.V. R), X.6 (Lieutenant D.
Cameron, RN.R.), and X.7 (Lieutenant
B. C. G. Place, D.S.C., R.N.), failed to return
as a result of the operation, and, while it was
known that one or more of these craft succeeded
in carrying out a successful attack on
TIRPITZ, at the time of my previous report
no information was available as to which of the
craft had succeeded in this daring attack, nor
were there details of how it was accomplished.

4. It was the intention of each of the three
Commanding Officers, all of whom had
TIRPITZ as their target, to close the entrance
to Kaafiord at first light on the morning of the
2and September, having fully charged up their
batteries during the night. Having negotiated
the A/S* net at the entrance to Kaafiord they
would then attack TIRPITZ by passing under
the A/T} nets surrounding her, drop their
charges set to detonate at approximately 0830
G.M.T., and then retire to seaward, hoping to
be well clear of the fiord by the time of the
explosion. .

5. P.R.U. photographs had shown that the
close A/T nets around TIRPITZ consisted of
three lines of nets. The flotation indicated that
the nets were for anti-torpedo protection, and
it was considered unlikely that they would reach
the bottom in the depth of water, twenty
fathoms’ In fact it was estimated they would
only extend downwards about fifty feet.

6. The following is a reconstruction of the
movements of these three X-craft in their
attacks, as far as is known at present.

X 6 (Lieutenant D. Cameron, R N.R.)

7. At some time unknown the periscope of
X.6 became flooded. The Commanding Officer
was therefore completely “ bhnd”’ with no
means of conning his craft when dived.

Having negotiated the A/S net at the
entrance to Kaafiord and entered the fleet
anchorage, Lieutenant Cameron, with a complete
disregard for danger, préceeded on the surface
in broad daylight astern of a small coaster
through the boat gate entrance in the nets,
situated only two hundred yards away from
TIRPITZ.

After passing safely through the entrance on
the surface, X 6 dived, and steering straight
for TIRPITZ, proceeded to attack.

8. X.6° had, however, been sighted from
TEIRPITZ off the port bow, as Lieutenant

Cameron must have realised that he would be.
The time of sighting is reported as 0800 G.M.T.
The alarm was raised, and hand grenades
thrown at him from the deck of TIRPITZ, and
a pinnace started to drop depth charges.

g. Lieutenant Cameron continued to carry
out his attack, and on passing under the bridge
of TIRPITZ, he probably released one charge.
Having passed under the ship, X 6 failed to
turn to starboard in time and ran into the nets
on the starboard side of TIRPITZ before he
could carry out the second run of the attack.

Finding himself foul of the nets Cameron
was obliged to go astern to clear himself, and in
so doing went astern into TIRPITZ.

ro. Lieutenant Cameron, realising that he
had been sighted, released his second charge,
and surfaced his ship almost alongside the
TIRPITZ. Cameron then saw all his crew
safely out of the craft before scuttling her.

Lieutenant Cameron and the crew of X.6
(Sub-Lieutenant J. T. Lorimer, R.N.V.R.,
Sub-Lieutenant R. H. Kendall, R.N.V.R.,
E.R.A.4 E. Goddard, C/MX 89069) were
picked up and taken on board, the time being
then approximately 0805.

X.7 (Lseutenant B. C. G. Place, D.S.C., R.N.)
11. In the meantime X.7 had also attacked.
Proceeding according to plan, X.7 penetrated

safely past the A/S nets at the entrance to the

fiord, and Lieutenant Place decided to attack
by passing under the close A/T nets.

Here he met unexpected difficulties, for in-
stead of the expected gap under the nets he
found that they extended to 120 feet, which,
with a depth of water of only twenty fathoms,
meant that the nets were almost,' if not quite,
down to the bottom.

Lieutenant Place was not to be deterred, and
at the third attempt he managed to worm X.7
along the bottom under the nets to carry out
a successful attack, dropping one charge under
the funnel and one under the after turret.

12. In negotiating the A/T nets he was able
to ascertain its details which were fine wire 4”
mesh—a most formidable type of A/T net.

13. Having completed the attack undetected,
Place was then faced with the difficulty of
getting through under the nets again to make
hus escape. To add to his difficulties the tide
was by then-ebbing, which meant that the nets
would be even nearer to the bottom than before.

.Once again X 7 found herself foul of the
nets; and as they were only 170 feet from
TIRPITZ and from the line on which the
charges had been laid, and with the time for
the explosion drawing nearer every minute, the
feelings of those on board while they were
struggling to extricate themselves may well be
imagined.

As ‘it was, X 7 cleared the nets with only a
few minutes to spare, as at 0830, when the ex-
plosion took place, X 7 was only some 400
yards to seaward of the nets.

Even at this distance the force of the ex-
plosion so damaged X.7 that she was put out
of action, and Lieutenant Place decided to re-
main on the bottom for the next hour and
await events.

Around about 0930, when depth dhicryes were
being dropped indiscriminately about the fiord,
although they did no damage to the craft,
Lieutenant Place realised that owing to damage
