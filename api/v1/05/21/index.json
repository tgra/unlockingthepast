Since the enemy had reacted most energetically so far to the \u2018\u2018Circus,;\u2019 against a target near Bethune on 17th June and another against a target in that area on 21st May, we\u2019 concluded that the industrial area which included Bethune, Lens and Lille was probably his most sensitive spot. By attacking this area it was hoped to induce him to concentrate in North-East France such fighter units-as he still had in the West. \u2018Bombers without escort might then \u2018hope to reach \u2018West and North/West Germany in day- light round the flank of the defences, and this in turn might force the enemy to bring back fighters from the Eastern Front in order to defend the Fatherland."

Although the political situation in Egypt has required constant watchfulness, and the rise in prices has led to increased pilfering and made additional train and other guards neces- sary, no serious problems have occurred. The decision of Admiral Godefroy to bring the French fleet at Alexandria over to the Allies, on 21st May, 1943, relieved a state of consider- able tension and enabled me to release troops, detailed for action in case Admiral Godefroy should reach a different decision, to other duties."

He said that nothing but a large force could attempt the occupation of Syria. Meanwhile I had been receiving telegrams from General d\u00e9 Gaulle in West Africa, couched in imperative language, enquiring why the Free French troops were not already on the march to Damascus.

The perimeter was held by four divisions and the Engineer Regiment and in reserve were i Armoured, 3 and 36 Infantry Divisions and the Special Service Force. 1 and 5 British Divi- sions, holding the left flank, were put directly under command of Fifth Army; they were to revert to command of my headquarters after the capture of Rome. I issued the orders for the op\u00e9ration on 21st May; this was not three days\u2019 warning but it did give General Truscott the two nights he had asked for and proved quite adequate, The plam of attack by VI Corps envisaged two phases: first a penetration of the enemy defences to seize a firm base on an arc of about a mile radius round Cisterna, and secondly an advance through Artena on Val- montone. The first phase was the task of I Armoured and 3 Infantry Divisions and the Special Service Force; when it was completed 36 Division, the freshest formation in the bridge- head, was to pass through and advance to a line running across the valley below Velletri, supported by 1 Armoured Division. Then, re- inforced by 3 Division, it was to advance on Valmontone. The enemy force opposing numbered five divisions. Almost all the armour im Fourteenth Army had been sent to the main front* leaving only the assault guns of 3 Panzer Grenadier Division and a handful of Tigers and Panthers. The Hermann Goering Division was on its way but its leading elements had got no further than Viterbo the day the attack began. The last hope would have been 29 Panzer Grenadier Division but that, released at last from its fruitless guard over Civitavecchia, had been rushed down to Terracina where it went into action against II Corps on the 2and. Once again Kesselring\u2019s mobile reserves had been misdirected. :"

At the conference at Ypres on the evening of 21st May, His Majesty the King of the Belgians had agreed that, if forced to abandon the positions on the Lys, he would withdraw to the Yser, maintaining touch with the left of the B.E.F. Now, however, signs were not wanting that the Belgian Army were being forced to withdraw northwards and away from the Yser canal. If so, the task of defending the whole line as far as the sea appeared likely to fall on ourselves and the French, as actually did happen."

In this they were highly successful, and proved conclusively their superiority to the Japanese in this type of operation. As an example, at Konin on the 21st May a patrol of 99 Brigade in one encounter killed 148 Japanese at a cost to themselves of 4 wounded."
