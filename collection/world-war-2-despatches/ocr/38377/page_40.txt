Seems possible that a photographic recon-

Mhaissance was being carried out by the enemy.
This formation remained in the vicinity for
some time but no attack developed.

17. At 1545 Rear-Admiral, Aircraft Carriers
informed me that one of our aircraft had force-
landed, bearing 022°, 23 miles away. WEST-
COTT was ordered to proceed to search for the
pilot and join Force R before dark. The pilot
was recovered and WESTCOTT then joined
Force R as directed.

18, Paravanes were streamed by battleships,
cruisers and M.T. ships at 1635.

The Dusk Attack on the Force,

Ig. From about 1700 until the atiack
developed at 2045, Force F was continuously
snooped by three or more enemy aircraft and
the fighters were kept extremely busy.

20, At 1634 I received Vice-Admiral

Commanding, North Atlantic’s 1446A/zz
warning me that the enemy would
probably make a JU.88 attack at
dusk. The fleet was by now in the

second degree of H.A. readiness and at 1854
I ordered Captain (D), 6th Destroyer Flotilla
(then the Senior Officer of destroyers in the
absence of Captain (D), rgth Destroyer
Flotilla, who was oiling) to station Hunt class
destroyers close to the flanks of the .2avoy
as-in Cruising Disposition No. 17 by sunset;
also that the screen were to increase their
distance fom the convoy to 6,000 yards in the
event of an attack.

21. Radar reports made it evident that a
raid was coming in at 2030, and not many
minutes later sighting reports of enemy aircraft
were received from the screen. The last des-
troyers to oil, which included> LAFOREY
(Captain D.19), joined at this time, thus bring-
ing the force up to full strength.

22. At 2056, 15 minutes after sunset, firing
began from destroyers on the port bow followed
almost immediately by the cruisers and battle-
ships.

23. The attack was by a number of JU 88s
which dived from about 8,000 feet to 2/300
feet and by some torpedo bombers; the latter
did not press home their attack though some
tracks were seen and avoided. The attack
lasted until about 2130 and the barrage put up
by the force was most spectacular. Three
enemy aircraft were shot down for certain by
ships’ gunfire.

Force R to the south’ard also came in for
attention, one JU.88 dropping two bombs, one
of which fell between the oilers and the escort,
another diving on JAUNTY who was about
‘seven miles‘ to the westward endeavouring to
join. She claims to have damaged it with
Oerlikon fire. No damage was done to any
ship in these attacks.

A‘number of friendly fighters were in the area
throughout but were unable to locate the
enemy in the failing light. They had to be
landed on after dark, and in doing so some
-were fired on by our’ own ships.

‘24. During the above air attack, QUENTIN
in position A on the screen confirmed an asdic
contact, carrying out three depth charge attacks
before rejoining at 2140.

25. No further incident occurred during the

.night and the force proceeded to the. eastward
unmolested.

At dusk Beaufighters from Malta attacked
Elmas and Decimomannu aerodromes with
results reported by Vice-Admiral, Malta as
having been highly satisfactory.

By night two Liberators from the Middle
East, operating from Malta, bombed
Decimomannu aerodrome.

Wednesday, 12th August (D.3).

26. Radar reports of enemy snoopers began
to come in at first light and all ships went to,
the first degree of readiness for H.A. and L.A.* ,
at 0530. Twelve fighters were flown off at
0610, and this number was maintained in the
air throughout the day, being reinforced a
necessary. There were few moments whe!
neither aircraft, submarines, torpedoes nor
asdic contacts were being reported. Cruising,
Disposition No. 17 was formed at o600.

27. Information having been received of a
probable concentration of U-Boats in the area
to the northward of Galita, I ordered Capiain
(D), roth Destroyer Flotilla, as an additional
A/S measure, to reduce the distance apart of
destroyers in the ahead and wing positions on
the screen while shortening the distance of the
screén ahead -of the convoy and lengthening
the distance apart of destroyers in the beam
and quarter positions. ‘7 Ed

28. The first raid of the day by about 20
high level bombers approached at 0907. They
were engaged*by-16 of our fighters who were
observed to shoot down one. The aircraft
came in over the fleet from right ahead at 0914,
dropped their bombs and were away in about
six minutes. Two JU.88s were observed to be
shot down and a third retired to the south’ard
on fire fore and aft and losing height. Our
fighters shot down 8 certain,“3 probable and
2 damaged. No damage was done to any
ship.

29. FURY on the starboard wing of the
screen confirmed an‘ asdic contact at 0935 and
was joined in the hunt by FORESIGHT. This
was-about 12 minutes after LAFOREY in posi-
tion B had counterattacked a confirmed con- }

ay,

tact and it is possible that a U-Boat having
escaped from LAFOREY, by diving under the
convoy, was detected by FURY. Ay

Soon there were four destroyers investigating ;
contacts on the starboard side and at 0940 all
destroyers were ordered to rejoin by Captain |
(D), 19th Destroyer Flotilla, as the U-Boat, if,
there was one there, was no longer a danger,
to Force F. ‘

30. In order to fill gaps in the screen due to
destroyers falling out for asdic contacts two
Hunts from the convoy close screen were
stationed astern of positions B and P to act
as reserve destroyers.

31. Meanwhile spasmodic firing by the screen
at snoopers which came within range continued
of , course, the carriers and _ their
“ chickens ’’ were, as always, extremely busy.

32. PATHFINDER in position C (port bow)
confirmed an asdic contact and heavily attacked

it. She was assisted in the hunt by ZETLAND
who was in the' spare position. The hunt

‘lasted from 1135 until 1150 when both ships
