In the absence of such favourable circumstances he had usually avoided combat. In this sense the operations. had proved slightly disappointing. On the other hand, statistically the results were fairly satisfactory so far as they went, the“destruction of t6 aircraft and probable destruction of a substantial number of others being claimed for the loss of 25 of our pilots; and much valuable experience had been gained.

The main weakness was the lack of troops to man the defences but Kesselring had all the same ordered the strongest resistance. Eighth Army between zoth and 22nd May was preparing for the assault. Following the failure of the surprise attack on Aquino on the evening of the 18th heavier, but still hasty, attacks had been mounted on the rgth by 78 Division on the right and x Canadian Division on the left; these ran into heavy fire which showed the defences ito be as formidable as had been expected. An attack in full strength would be nec . _ The main blow was to be delivered by the Canadian Corps north of Pontecorvo while 13 ‘Corps would maintain pressure at Aquino and concentrate forward teady to advance abreast of the Canadians. The Poles, who had captured Villa Santa Lucia on the roth, were to continue the attack against the strongly defended hill town of Piedimonte which they had started on the zoth. 8 Indian Division, after its relief by the Canadians, had been sent back east of the Rapido; General Leese now decided to bring it forward again to reinforce 13 Corps, together with 6 British Armoured Division.
