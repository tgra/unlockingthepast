As soon as these regulations were rigidly enforced, casualties were reduced to small dimensions. Our sweeping was also largely successful. By 3rd July it was estimated that, including spontaneous detonations, nearly 500 mines had- been accounted for by our minesweepers, and at this date, although the threat had not been completely mastered, it was felt that the worst was probably over and that the build-up and our operations generally would develop as desired in spite of mining. ~",

            "description": "The battles for the Trasimene line may be considered as having lasted from aoth to 30th June. They were most severe in the centre where the Germans opposed xo and 13 Corps; on the west coast, although the  American advance was considerably slowed down, as compared with the first two weeks after the fall of Rome, the Germans were unable to prevent a steady gain of ground. IV Corps on the left, with 36 and xr Armoured Divisions leading, captured Follonica on 24th June and Piombino on the 25th. Then stiffer resistance was met, particularly inland where 1 Armoured Division, opposed by a skilful enemy and difficult country, lost seventy-one tanks in the course of these ten days. The stiffest resistance was at Cecina, at the mouth of the river of the same name; the battle for the town lasted from 2gth June to 1st July and cost 34 Division, which had relieved the 36th, fairly heavy casualties. 16 S.S. Division had been brought in here to strengthen the German defence and fought with skill and fanaticism. The French, directed on Siena, were held up from the 22nd to the 26th June on the River Orcia and were able only to make an advance of some two miles. On the night of the 27th, however, the Germans began to withdraw and only delaying actions were fought south of Siena, which was entered on 3rd July. By the 7th, with the capture of Colle di Val d Elsa, the whole of Route 68, from its junction with Route 2 to the sea, had been secured.",

            "date": "3rd July",
            "description": "IV Corps on the left had a very bitter struggle for Rosignano, which the $.S. Panzer Grenadiers defended against 34 United States Division with the same stubbornness as they had shown at Cecina. The town is situated on a hill top, very compactly built of large masonry houses with an ancient castle in  the centre. In these circumstances street fighting was bound to be a long job; it lasted in fact from 3rd July until gth July. Naturally only part of our force was directed into the town itself and the remainder endeavoured to outflank it to the east, but here too resistance from 26 Panzer Division was strong. Further east I United States Armoured Division was relieved by 88 United States Infantry Division which on the 8th captured the   far-famed hold  of Volterra.",
