As our threat to that objective developed, five Italian destroyers based at Massawa left harbour in a Northerly direction on 2nd April. This force was located and attacked on 3rd April by Swordfish of the F.A.A. (H.M.S. Eagle) by No. 14 Squadron (Blenheims) and No. 223 Squadron (Wellesleys). The Swordfish torpedoed two of the destroyers, sinking one of them and leaving the second in a sinking condition, the latter being subsequently bombed and sunk by a Blenheim. A further two destroyers were driven aground on the Hedjaz Coast twelve miles South of Jedda, where they were bombed and destroyed by Blenheims and  Wellesleys operating in conjunction with H.M.S, Kingston.

However, when the offensive started on 1gth March, it very soon became evident that it was going very well and that the risk of incursion by German land and sea forces had considerably diminished. Accordingly, on zand March I pressed the Supreme  ALied Commander to approve a modified form of Operation   Accomplish   named Operation   Bingham,  and he agreed that this operation should take place at the earliest possible date. It was therefore started on the 2nd April, and as a result No. 281 Wing, which comprised all the short range single-engined fighter squadrons in B.A.F, except the Italian ones, was fully established at Zadar by the end of April. The effect of this was to enable B.A.F. to give an in-  , and closer Air Support to Marshal Tito s"

The attacking force consisted of the 5th German Light Armoured Division and two Italian divisions (one armoured, one motorised). It was supported by a considerable air force, the enemy being numerically superior throughout the operations, although they did not make full use of this superiority, largely as a result of the initiative and aggressiveness of our R.A.F. During the first three days the 2nd Armoured Division withdrew slowly northwards, and by the evening of 2nd April was north of Agedabia. The enemy so far had not pressed his advance with much vigour. Our intention was that the armoured force should maintain a position from which they would be on the flank of any enemy advance by the main road to Benghazi and would also block any attempt to turn our positions in Cyrenaica by taking the desert route to Mechili. The Commander of the 2nd Armoured Division had originally intended to counter attack the enemy north of Agedabia if opportunity offered; but on being warned that no tank reinforcements were available and that he should not attack unless a specially favourable opportunity offered, he decided to continue the withdrawal. ."

The enemy put up some resistance to frontal attacks, but about half a mile from his main position a place was found where the tiver could be waded, and as soon as he discovered his flank was being turned he withdrew. A new road bridge was built and the advance was continued next day, 3rd April. The aand E.A. Brigade reached Adama that day, and were instructed to try to cross the river Auasc at Ponte Malcasa, and attempt to cut off the enemy column which was known to be withdrawing by Sire. The bridge had been destroyed and the enemy offered considerable resistance. .A large part of the enemy column therefore escaped, though the capture of the road junction south of Ponte Malcasa some days later resulted in the cutting off of some units."

He made the proviso that the decision as to whether the second (follow-up) division should actually be committed would be taken later. On the 17th April he confirmed his approval in an Operational Directive addressed to his Commandersin-Chief, in which we were instructed  To carry out an amphibious/airborne operation with the object of the early capture of Rangoon should this not have been previously achieved by Fourteenth Army from the north.  D-Day for the initial amphibious assault was to be the 2nd May, and this date should be borne in mind when the progress of Fourteenth Army's advance southwards is followed in the next section of the Despatch."
