caused me some anxiety. Although the
defences were doing so well, the air-launched
flying bomb was still a dangerous weapon
because of its mobility. We could not deploy
guns everywhere at once; and the bomb might
be used against other targets besides London.
At that time the country was being bombarded
with rockets as well as flying bombs: a
simultaneous increase in the scale of attack by
both weapons was a contingency against which
I felt bound to provide.

133. On the transfer of the Air Commander-
in-Chief’s main headquarters to the Continent
in the autumn of 1944 I had acquired at least
a nominal responsibility for directing and co-
ordinating offensive as well as defensive
counter-measures against flying bombs and
long-range rockets. So many authorities whose
interests alternately coincided and conflicted
were concerned in this matter that my respon-
sibilities were inevitably somewhat indeter-
minate. Moreover, I was in an even less
favourable position than the Air Commander-
in-Chief had been to discharge such a respon-
sibility. Like him, I could not help knowing
that our striking forces had many tasks to
perform besides that of attacking ‘‘ crossbow ”’
targets. Unlike him, I could not call at my
discretion on the tactical, let alone the strategic,
air forces for this work. The area from which
tockets were being fired against London was
within fighter range, and I was able to send
fighters and later fighter-bombers to intervene.
But the bases of the flying-bomb air-launching
unit in north-west Germany were beyond the
reach of all my aircraft except those used for
long-range ‘‘ Intruder ’’ work.

134. Thus, so far as offensive counter-
measures to the flying bomb were concerned
the only thing I could do in practice was to
make representations. My staff kept a close
watch on the activities of the air-launching
unit, and as soon as it was plainly seen to be
expanding I urged that its bases be attacked.
That the response was not more active was per-
haps an inevitable consequence of the multi-
plicity of calls upon the strategic and tactical
air forces, and of the very success which the
defences had achieved against the flying bomb
up to that time. Even so, a number of attacks
on the bases were made by our own Bomber
Command and the American Eighth Bomber
Command.

135. As a further precaution against a pos-
sible extension of the flying bomb campaign
General Pile and I took steps to counter any
attempt that the Germans might make to turn
the northern flank of the defences. A scheme
was worked out whereby 50} batteries of guns
could be rapidly deployed between Skegness
and ‘Whitby if an attack should develop in
that area. *

136. This eventuality was realised, without
any specific warning on Christmas Eve, 1944.
Early on that day about 50 He. rr1s—almost
the entire operational strength of the air-
launching unit—launched bombs in the direc-
tion of Manchester from a position off the
coast between Skegness and Bridlington.
Thirty bombs came within range of the report-
ing system, and all thirty crossed the coast.
Only one of them reached Manchester, but
six came down within ten miles.of the centre

of the city and eleven within fifteen miles.
Thirty-seven people were killed and 67 seriously
injured.

137. This was one of the few occasions on
which the Germans showed resource in exploit-
ing the capacity of the air-launched flying
bomb to outflank the defences. Happily for
us they were seldom so enterprising; for how-
ever carefully our plans were laid, we could
not deploy the defences on every part of the
East Coast at once, and if more such attacks
from novel directions had been tried, they
would inevitably have achieved at least a
fleeting success, as on this occasion.

138. Immediately after this attack I ordered
that deployment north of the Wash should
begin. Shortly afterwards I secured the
approval of the Chiefs of Staff to a more com-
prehensive scheme for the defence of the coast
as far north as Flamborough Head. I also
arranged that plans should be worked out for
the defence of the areas Tees-Tyne and Forth-
Clyde. But here again, as in the case of
Manchester, I could not afford to order deploy-
ment in these areas, at the expense of others,
merely on the ground that the enemy might
attack them at some future date. Conse-
quently, if he had followed up his attack on
Manchester with a series of carefully-spaced
attacks at other points north and south of the
Wash on succeeding nights, he would un-
doubtedly have scored some success and set
us something of a problem.

139. However, either this did not occur to
the Germans, or such an enterprise was be-
yond the capabilities of an organisation whose
spirit was shaken and which was running short
of fuel. No more bombs came from north of
the Wash; and three weeks later the air-launch-
ing unit ceased operations. The last air-
Jaunched flying-bomb to reach this country
came down at Hornsey at 0213 hours on the
r4th January, 1945.

140. This was not the last of the flying bomb.
In the meantime the Germans had been work-
ing on the problem of increasing the range of

“the weapon. Fragments of some of the bombs

fired from Germany into Belgium in February
showed that they were adopting methods of
construction which might solve this problem
and enable them to attack London from ramps
in south-west Holland. Reconnaissance photo-
graphs of that area were taken, and showed
that two launching sites were being constructed,
one at Ypenburg, near the Hague, the other
at Vlaardingen, six miles west of Rotterdam.
In addition the German built a third site near
the Delftsche Canal; but of this we were not
aware till later.

. 141. To meet this new threat General Pile
and I decided to reinforce the gun defences
between the Isle of Sheppey and Orfordness by
transferring 96 heavy guns from the northerly
part of the “‘ strip’ and adding a number of
batteries then under training to the remaining
defences in the latter area. Instructions for
the move to begin were given on the 27th Feb-
ruary and by the 6th March nine batteries out
of twelve had taken up their new positions,
