SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1941 5903

the weight of modern aircraft, has made it neces-
sary to construct concrete runways, often of
considerable extent, on the principal aero-
dromes in use. A number of special units of
the Royal Engineers had consequently to be
raised, and a large amount of plant, grass seed
and materials had to be provided.

Frontier Control,
19. The sector of the frontier occupied by the

British Expeditionary Force presented a very ~

difficult control problem. There were initially
over ten thousand Belgians working on the
beet harvest in the British zone and on the
average considerably more than twenty thousand
local inhabitants passed the frontier daily on
their normal business.

The strength of the frontier organisations
charged with the control of the frontier traffic
had been seriously reduced on mobilisation. It
was therefore essential to supplement the normal
machinery of control.

The system devised in co-operation with the
ist French Region and the commander of the
‘fortified sector of Lille included a primary
control on the frontier proper and a secondary
control: on the line of the foremost anti-tank
obstacle wherever the latter did not coincide
with the frontier.

Co-operation with the French authorities
has been close and harmonious throughout.
The Field Security Police have played an
important role in this unusual and difficult
task and have contributed largely to the success
of the organisation.

Intelligence.

20. Conditions on the operational side of
intelligence work in the field have naturally
been abnormal. Much valuable preliminary
work and re-organisation has been carried out
and full advantage has been taken of the unusual
situation, to complete the training of the
Intelligence staffs, Co-operation with the French
Intelligence service has been close and cordial,

It became apparent at an early date that the |

staff and organisation provided for dealing with
wireless intelligence were inadequate for this
increasingly important branch of operational
intelligence. The expansion of the wireless
intelligence units is now, therefore, in progress.
Closest co-operation has been maintained with
the French Wireless Intelligence Service.

It has been necessary to increase the air intelli-
gence section of the Intelligence branch at
General Headquarters, which has performed
valuable work in the collection and distribution

* of information.

The problem of security has presented many
unusual difficulties. This has been largely due
to the long period of inactivity, the geographical
position of the Force, the length of the Lines of
Communication, and the congestion in the rear
areas owing to the presence of evacuees. The
French authorities have co-operated most
closely in the matter of civil security and have
throughout given all the assistance in their
power.

Censorship.

The postal censorship discipline of the British
Expeditionary Force is on the whole good.
Very considerable increases in have
been found i: neceaiarys in order to snipoat the

requisite selective censorship on the abnormally
large number of letters now despatched daily.
Extremely useful reports on the outlook of the
British Expeditionary Force as a whole and on
its relations with the local French inhabitants
are produced periodically. These are based
largely on information supplied by the censorship
organisation supplemented by reports from the
Field Security Police,

Publicity and Propaganda,

The section of the Intelligence branch dealing
with publicity and propaganda has worked in
close co-operation with the organisations con-
cerned both in England and France, and has
fulfilled a réle which has assumed far more
importance than in previous campaigns, Much
has been done to counter German prop:
Material has been provided for the Miniform
Committee in Paris in this connection, and
information bulletins are issued. periodically toall
units of the British Expeditionary Force.

Cipher Personnel.

Up to date the whole of the cipher work in the
Force has been carried out most efficiently
by Army Educational Corps personnel. This
personnel is now required tos tevert kf its normal
duties in the United Kingdom and is being
replaced,

Press.

21. The significance and requirements of the
Press and of the ps and cinematographic
publicity in the field in modern war have proved
greater than was appreciated prior to the out-
break of hostilities, Shortly after mobilisation
a Public Relations unit was hastily formed and
incorporated in the Intelligence branch of
General Headquarters.

Since its formation in October this unit tag
administered and arranged facilities for a total
of some fifty-five War Correspondents perma-
nently accredited to the British Expeditionary
Force, besides representatives of the principal
news-reel companies. Some sixty visiting
editors, correspondents, broadcasters and cine-
matographers, in addition to selected repre-
sentatives of the neutral Press, have been given
facilities for visiting the Force.

There has also been a small unit of the British
Broadcasting Corporation with the Force since
October, and facilities have been provided for
selected official photographers to meet the
requirements of the British Press.

The Newspaper Proprietors Association gener-
ously makes a large supply of papers available
free daily for the Force. In the matter of
distribution, close touch has been kept with
them and with the ‘Continental Daily Mail,”
which supplies the troops with their latest news.

The Press and photographic censorship is now

: working efficiently and co-operation with the

French is close and harmonious.

Development of the Rearward Services.

22. The work of the administrative statis
and services in back areas has in many respects
been fully as heavy as it would have been if
fighting had been in progress. It was their
duty, while maintaining a continually growing
‘force, to make and put into execution long term
plans in preparation for the arrival of future
contingents.
