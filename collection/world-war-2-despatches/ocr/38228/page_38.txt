which had become serious on the 2oth April
rapidly deteriorated. On the 21st April it was
reported that the whole of the Chinese 55 Divi-
sion had been scattered by the Japanese
attack, and on the 22nd that the Japanese
had captured Hopong and were advancing
north towards Hsipaw and Lashio with
armoured forces and motorised infantry. It
was never possible to discover the exact
strength of the Japanese thrust but of the weak-
ness of the Chinese forces between them and
Lashio there could be no doubt. A good deal
of damage was done by panic in the rear areas,
especially at Lashio, and I sent Brigadier
Martin, my chief liaison officer with the
Chinese forces, to attempt to restore order
and confidence there, which he succeeded in
doing. Under the orders of General Stilwell,
28 Chinese Division (less one regiment) was
moved during this period from Mandalay to
Hsipaw, but the disorganisation of the rail-
ways made this movement very slow. I there-
fore took steps to protect my rear by sending
a detachment from the British Infantry Depot
at Maymyo to hold the Gokteik Gorge on the
Lashio Road. On 23rd and 2qth April the
Chinese 200 Division captured Taunggyi and
advanced towards Hopong. On the aqth April
I asked General Stilwell to come and see me
at Maymyo. The situation, however, did not
permit of his leaving his Headquarters and
therefore on the morning of the 25th April, in
company with my M.G., G.S., I went to
General Stilwell’s Headquarters at Kyaukse
“and I arranged to meet there General Slim,
Commander 1x Burcorps. Here I learned that
the enemy were putting heavy pressure on the
Chinese 96 Division which was holding the
front, that this Division was breaking up and
that the Japanese were advancing from

inmana on Pyawbwe. One regiment in the
Thazi area had been moved to the Shan States.
In consequence, Meiktila was now devoid of
infantry. General Stilwell was not sanguine
about the operations in the Shan States and I
formed the impression that Chinese resistance
on the Pyawbwe front was likely to collapse
altogether very soon. I therefore issued orders
for the plan of withdrawal north of Mandalay
to be put into operation commencing on the
night of the 25th/26th April. I also ordered
rt Burcorps to take over rear guard from the
Chinese on the axis Meiktila—Mandalay and
to cover the withdrawal of the Chinese 22 and
96 Divisions north of Meiktila. My decision
was telephoned to Army Headquarters at 1300
hours and evacuation of units and installations
remaining in Maymyo was begun.

50." Decision to dispose Imperial Forces for
Defence of India. 1 now considered that the
situation had clarified sufficiently for me to
decide on the future role of the Imperial
Forces I was of the opinion that the capture
of Lashio by the Japanese was only a question
of time and that there would be nothing to stop
them moving on Bhamo, thus turning my com-
munications with Myitkyina. Subsequent
events proved this opinion to be correct, but
it was impossible for me to disengage any
forces to send to Bhamo. I also thought that
the condition of the Chinese armies precluded
the possibility of being able to hold Mandalay
and the Irrawaddy” line for very long, In these
circumstances, I decided that my main object

SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948

was the defence of India, out I had two sub-
sidiary objects : —
(a) to maintain touch with the Chinese,
and
(b) to get as much as possible of the
Imperial Force back to India so that it could
be reorganised.

51. I issued to General Slim, Commander
x Burcorps, on the 26th April, a D.O. letter
embodying my plan which was to be imple-
mented after the Mandalay—Irrawaddy line
was given up. This was as follows: —

(a) for the defence of India two infantry
brigades astride the Chindwin to delay the
enemy as far south as possible, and

(®) a strong detachment in the Myittha
Valley.

The above to be maintained eventually
from Kalewa, as well as the detachment
in (c) below.

(c) the remainder of the force to move
via Ye-U on Kalewa leaving a detachment
to cover this route.

(d) I determined to keep contact with the

-Chinese. I hoped to be able to keep the

38 Division which was fighting so well under

the command of r Burcorps.

This plan was subsequently modified as
will appear later.

52. The execution of the amended plan of
withdrawal to the Mandalay—Irrawaddy line
was most expeditiously put into effect by
xr Burcorps, the 17 Division, with the 7
Armoured Brigade under command taking
over rear guard on the axis Meiktila—
Mandalay. On the 26th April the 7 Armoured
Brigade attacked and dispersed an enemy
column eight miles south of Meiktila and the
withdrawal of the rear parties of the 63 Infantry
Brigade and 7 Armoured Brigade from this
area was delayed until midnight 26th/27th
April in order to cover the 22 and 96 Chinese
Divisions and the Fifth Army Troops, which
had been ordered back from the Kalaw area.

On the 26th April I moved my Head-
quarters to Shwebo and preparations were put
in hand for making the Ye-U—Kalewa road fit
for M.T. as far as possible and for stocking the
road with supplies and water. Major-General
Wakely, Commander L. of C. Area, was
placed in charge of all work on the road.

53- On the 27th April reliable information
was received that a large Japanese force was
in the Nagape area (west of Magwe) date un-
certain, but probably between the r5th and
zoth April, and that this force was moving
north via Myittha Valley with the intention
of cutting the Assam road at Kalemyo. In
view of this information I visited Headquarters
t Burcorps on 28th April and made there the
following alterations to the plan for a further
withdrawal when the Mandalay-Irrawaddy
position had to be.abandoned :

The force moving up the Myittha Valley had
already been increased to include the whole of
the 2 Burma Brigade, which was on the right
bank of the Irrawaddy. I confirmed this and
in addition arranged for one infantry brigade
of the 1 Burma Division to be sent by river
to Kalewa and thence to Kalemyo. As a result
of these alterations, -the force astride the Chind-
win would consist of one infantry brigade of
the 1 Burma Division and one brigade of the
