(c) Anti-Tank Defence.—Forward’ field
guns to be used for anti-tank and anti-per-
sonnel roles. The necessity for a physical
obstacle, to be covered by fire, wherever it
was intended to stop tanks was stressed.

304. Commanders.—At the request of the
Commander 3 Indian Corps I appointed
Brigadier Key to command the rz Indian Divi-
sion in place of Major-General Paris. The
reason for this was that we considered that
an Indian Army Officer was now required to
pull together and re-establish confidence in
what remained of the rz Indian Division.
Brigadier Lay, who had now returned to duty,
was appointed to command the 8 Indian
Infantry Brigade and Col. Challen took over
command of the 6/15 Indian Infantry Brigade
in lieu of Brigadier Moorhead.

305. The Withdrawal of 3 Indian Corps.—At
o600 hrs., gth January, the 1r/1q Punjab
Regiment on the right of the Batang Berjuntai
position was suddenly attacked and suffered
considerable losses. In the afternoon the 6/15
Brigade Group fell back to the Batu Arang
area. On the West Coast road our troops
after some skirmishing fell back to a position
about three miles north of Klang. On the
main road the 28 Brigade Group occupied a
position at Serendah without being pressed.

306. For the withdrawal of 3 Indian Corps
there were in the West Coast area two main
roads available, i.e., the main trunk road
Kuala Lumpur—Seremban—Tampin—Gemas—
Segamat, and the coastal road Klang—Morib—
Port Dickson—Malacca. The 9 Indian Division
had the tortuous and little-used road Bentong.—
Durian Tipus, thence either via Kuala Pilah
or Bahau to join the main trunk road two miles
south of Tampin.

In the States of Selangor and Negri Sembilan
and the Settlement of Malacca through which
the withdrawal was to take place the roads are
much more numerous than they are in the
States of Perak and Pahang. The beaches
also are sandy and more suitable for landings.
These facilities conferred on the enemy greater
freedom of action and made our task more
difficult.

307. The plan was for the 11 Indian Division
and L. of C. Troops to occupy two delaying
positions during the withdrawal, the one cover-
ing Seremban and Port Dickson and the other
covering Tampin and Malacca. The existence of
the lateral road Kuala Pilah—Seremban and
the convergence of the two divisional routes at
Tampin made it necessary that the 9 Division
should be clear of Kuala Pilah and Tampin
respectively before the first and second delay-
ing positions were vacated by the rz Division

308. Soon after dawn on the roth January
the enemy attacked the 28 Brigade Group at
Serendah and, adopting his usual tactics,
quickly enveloped both flanks. Some fierce
fighting went on during the day, our troops
gradually falling back to Sungei Choh Village,
which they found already in possession of an
enemy force which had come from the West.
They managed to force their way through, how-
ever, though suffering severe losses, and late in
the afternoon embussed for Tampin leaving
behind a party to cover the engineers work-
ing on road demolitions.

The 6/15 Brigade Group, which had been
withdrawn the previous night from the Batu

Arang area, followed the 28 Brigade Group
through Kuala Lumpur. The last bridge in
the Federal Capital was blown at 0430 hrs.
11th January and the Brigade, leaving a small
force to cover further demohtions, moved to the
Labu area west of Seremban.

309. The 12 Indian Infantry Brigade, now
only some 600-700 strong, was already in posi-
tion guarding the Mantin (Setul) Pass, a
nartow hilly defile a few miles north of
Seremban. A battalion of the newly arrived
45 Indian Infantry Brigade had also been
sent forward with requisitioned transport (it’s
own having not yet arrived) to the Sepang
area.

310. On the coastal road Port Swettenham
was evacuated on the afternoon on the roth
January and the big bridge at Klang was rather
ineffectively blown at 2030 hrs. that night.
After some local engagements with the enemy,
all troops were withdrawn during the night
Toth/1ith January to positions covering Port
Dickson.

311. During the 11th and rath January there
was no contact on the front, though the
Japanese aircraft were active on both days
reconnoitring and bombing. On the night
I2th/13th January the 6/15 Brigade withdrew
to the Alor Gajah area and the remnants of
the 12 Brigade entrained at Gemas for Singa-
pore. On the coast road the L of C. troops
fell back to a position covering Malacca. The
9 Indian Division moved in conformity.

+ 312. On the evening of the 13th January,
the final stage of the long withdrawal started.
As there is only a ferry crossing over the broad’
tiver at Muar, all wheeled transpart had to pass
through Segamat which thus became a bad
bottleneck. By the 14th January, however,
all troops of 3 Indian Corps were clear and
the command of the forward area passed to
the Comdr. Westforce. The Commander 3
Indian Corps assumed responsibility for South
Johore at 2000 hrs. 14th January.

313. During the withdrawal demolitions were
carried out on all roads. In particular gaps
were blown in all bridges over what might
constitute an anti-tank obstacle.

314. On completion of the withdrawal the.
formations of 3 Indian Corps were disposed as
under : —

Headquarters 3 Indian Corps,

Bahru.

Headquarters 1r Indian Division, Rengam.
6/15 Indian Infantry Brigade and 11

Divisional Artillery, Kluang.

28 Indian Infantry Brigade,

Kechil.

3 Indian Cavalry, Independent Company-
aoe one Company Malay Regiment, Batu
ahat.

315. On the 13th January the Supreme Com-
mander South West Pacific visited Malaya. At
Segamat he discussed the defence dispositions
with the Commander .Westforce.

316. As a result of our rapid withdrawal
from North and Central Malaya there had.
naturally been losses in material and reserve
stocks. This was particularly the case as
regards petrol, which required more transport
for its removal than was available. On the
