I was to assume command of this, which would involve responsibility for the entire conduct of opera.tions in Tunisia; I was also appointed Deputy Commander-in-Chief, ‘Allied Expeditionary Force. My Headquarters was known as Eighteenth Army Group, combining the numbers of First and Eighth Armies; I proposed to make it a very small and mobile Tactical Headquarters to direct the battle from close up. The staff to form this headquarters was flown round by transport aircraft from Cairo; I myself arrived im ‘Algeria on 15th February and assumed command on i1gth February. In a directive from General Eisenhower issued on the 17th* I was instructed that my mission was the early destruction of all Axis forces in Tunisia.",

            "description": "ing enemy only with hght forces. 7 Armoured Division (now 23 Armoured and 13x Lorried Infantry Brigades) maintained pressure along the coast road but were hampered by mines and demohtions. To hasten the enemy’s withdrawal 30 Corps used 4 Light Armoured Brigade in a series of outflanking movements south of the main road. By the end of the month the enemy had retired to the edge of the marshes which stretch along the Tunisian frontier from the coast southwards for about forty miles. 4 Light Armoured Brigade patrols pressed on into southern Tunisia but enemy resistance lingered on in the marshes, blocking any further advance down the road. General Montgomery therefore decided to throw more weight into the outflanking movement, using 8 Armoured Brigade, which had been resting near Tripoli and now relieved 23 Armoured Brigade. Moving round by way of El Assa 8 Armoured Brigade secured a_ bridgehead across the marshes and took up positions astride the track leading to Ben Gardane. The enemy reacted hastily to this move and brought 15 Panzer Division forward from Ben Gardane to support the strongpoint which he had prepared at Taguelmit. At this point, however, heavy rain began to fall again and it was necessary to build a causeway over the marshes before our advance could proceed. As the causeway was nearing completion the enemy withdrew and on 15th February 30 Corps entered Ben Gardane, the first important town in Tunisia, without meeting opposition.",

On the 10th December, I had issued an Operation Instruction, based on plans made and instructions received before I took over command, for the mounting of an amphibious operation from Chittagong. 26 Indian Division (MajorGeneral C. E. N. Lomax) was earmarked for this assault, which was scheduled to take place about the 15th February but it looked as if it might have to be made later, since the landing craft of Naval Assault Force “ W” were only partially assembled. In this original plan the choice of a landing beach caused a good deal of anxiety. The tests recommended by the Scientific Advisers to the Supreme Allied Commander had not yielded any conclusive results on the consistency of the ‘beaches, and inland swamps and waterways limited the landing places from which deployment was practicable. It was, however, decided that a beach on the south cost of the island, between",

This was followed by a revised scale for British troops on the Ist March, 1945, and for African troops on the Ist May. These scales were not only of great calorific value but provided a more varied and palatable diet. Starting in November, 1944, 585 tons of frozen meat per month were delivered into Assam, Eastern Bengal and Arakan by nine aircraft sorties six days a week. A large proportion of British and African troops benefited from this scheme, though local distribution was still somewhat restricted by the full quota of insulated lorries not yet being available. From November also, 40 tons per month of frozen meat were being shipped to Chittagong, where two 16 ton cold storage plants had just been installed, and six others were in course of erection. Rail delivery ot frozen meat into Assam began in January, and the fly-in of this commodity could then be stopped. Rail delivery into Eastern Bengal also began directly the cold storage plants in that area were ready (15th February). A 3,000 ton refrigerated store ship arrived from the UX. in February, and was located at Chittagong as a floating store. A 500 ton cold storage plant was also installed at this port in March.",
