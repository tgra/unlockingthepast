(Sumatra) Reinforcement Situation Thus some air reinforcements, urgently

268. From the 8th December onwards many messages had been interchanged between the Air Ministry and the Far East on the subject of reinforcements, which, commencing with a long-range policy of supply, developed, with the steady advance of the Japanese Army, into an emergency arrangement of diverting to the Far East squadrons from other Commands which it was hoped could arrive in time. By the 25th December, the position as understoud by A.H.Q. was: 

Hudson II's 6 arrived from Ausitalia on 25/12 to reinforce Nos. 1 and 8 (GR) squadrons, R.A.A.F.

Hudson ITI's 52 to be flown out from England commencing about 20/72.

Blenheim IV's 12 from Middle East 7 arrived by 25/12: remainder en route.

Hurricanes 51 in crates with 24 pilots en route by sea due on or about 8th January, 1942. These had left England as reinforcements for the Middle East but were diverted to Singapore whilst at sea,

Catalinas 4 en route with 2 spare crews. The Plan for their disposition was: 

Hudson III's to (a) re-equip No. 62 (B) Squadron: and .

(b) reinforce Nos. I and 8 (GR) Squadrons IR.A.A.F.

Blenheim IV's to be absorbed into No. 34 (B) Squadron.

Hurricanes to be used from Kallang and Johore in defence of Singapor&# it was anticipated Buffalo Squadrons would pe whittled away by the time these Hurricanes arrived.

Catalinas One to remain at Ceylon, remainder to reinforce No. 205 (FB) Squadron at Seletar.

wanted, were now on their way despite  he still critical state of the war m Europe from which they had had to be diverted to Singapore

NARRATIVE FROM 25TH DECEMBER, IQ41, TO 30TH JANUARY, 1942

Changes in Higher Command

269. Before proceeding further with the narrative, it is appropriate to mention some changes in the Higher Command in the Far East which were about to take place during . the next few weeks.

On 27th December, General Sir Henry Pownall] relieved Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke Popham as Commander-in-Chief, Far East. The former's instructions differed from those of the latter, as described in para. 3. General Pownall was instructed to deal with  matters of major military policy and strategy  , but that it was not the intention that he should   assume operational control  . These instructions were given before the outbreak of the Japanese war,  which occurred however whilst he was en route. As their consequence, the system described in para. 3, under which G.H.Q. was responsible for the control of operations, now came to an end.

270. On ist January, 1942, the small Fighter Control H.Q in Singapore was expanded, albeit on-a restricted scale It became known as No. 224 (F) Group. Group Captain E. B. Rice remained in command, Circumstances, however, did not permit full administration of its units and stations being transferred, to it from A.H.Q.

297%. On 4th January, Air Vice Matshal P. C. Maltby arrived in Singapore as Chief-of-Staff
