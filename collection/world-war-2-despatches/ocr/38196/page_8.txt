the southern flank still more. “ Accordingly on
Ist September General Montgomery concen-
trated the three armoured brigades in the
area between 44 Division and the New Zealand
Division. 1 South African Infantry Brigade
was moved from 30 Corps area to the east end
of Ruweisat ridge. Early on that morning the
enemy resumed the attempt to batter his way
on to the west end of Alam el Halfa ridge and
again suffered heavily. His tanks first tried
another frontal assault on 22 Armoured
Brigade; when that failed they attempted to
work roundseither flank of the brigade. After
two hours the enemy drew off to the south.
He refuelled and reorganised during the middle
of the day and returned to the attack in the
late afternoon, when he began to probe for
soft spots, tapping 23 and 22 Armoured
Brigades in turn. This gave him no encourage-
ment and le drew off again without staging a
heavy attack. :

The first two days of the battle had ended
without any decisive success for the enemy
and this was already a decisive success for us.
On 2nd September, Rommel changed his tac-
tics. -Instead of continuing the attack he
decided to put himself in a posture of defence
and await the counter-attack which he felt
confident that we should shortly deliver; he
therefore massed the bulk of his armour south
of Alam el Halfa and threw out a screen of
anti-tank guns in front of them. On the left
of the armour 90 Light and Trieste Divisions
consolidated their positions to keep open the
corridor through the minefield. It was not
our intention, however, to gratify him by a
frontal attack on the Africa Corps but rather
to operate against the two infantry divisions
further west in order to close the gap in the
minefield behind the main armoured force.
Orders for this operation had been issued the
previous day and 5 Indian Infantry Brigade
and 7 Medium and 49 Anti-tank Regiments
Royal Artillery, from 30 Corps were moving
south to reinforce 13 Corps. At the same
time 2 South African Brigade was drawn into
reserve. On request of Eighth Army I sent
up 151 Brigade from 50 Division at Amiriya
to strengthen the south-western end of Alam
el Halfa’ ridge. Should the plan prove
successful the enemy would be so weakened
that an immediate advance might be
possible; General” Montgomery ordered for-
ward H.Q. ro Corps in case he should need it
to command a pursuit force. It was instructed
to be prepared to push through to Daba with
all reserves available and possibly the
Australian Division. Meanwhile the enemy
concentrations provided an excellent target to
our aircraft and artillery which gave them no
respite. Armoured car patrols to the south
and east observed the enemy closely and 7
Armoured Division continued to, attack his
unarmoured vehicles with great success.

_ Under these various forms of attack, but
without provoking our armour to descend from
the ridge and give battle, the enemy lay all
day of 2nd: September. A new and serious
crisis in his fuel situation had arisen, for we
had been once more successful in our attacks
on his tankers, sinking three in two days. As
the day wore on it was evident to him that
the last hope had failed and,: since it was
‘impossible to remain in this advanced position,
he would have to withdraw. It was the nearest

the Germans ever got to the Delta. At first
light on 3rd September it was reported that
they were withdrawing slightly to south and
south-west. It was still not clear whether this
was the start of a real retreat or another feint
to entice our armour into battle; in any case
13 Corps followed up with armoured cars only.
By the afternoon there was every indicatior
that the westward movement was developing
into a withdrawal. 7 Armoured Divisior
moved westwards to the area. between Gaballa
and Himeimat to operate against the southern
fiank of the retirmg columns and heavy air
action was organised against the concentrations
east of the minefield.

At 2230 hours on 3rd September the New
Zealand Division, with 132 Brigade of 44 Divi-
sion under command, began to attack south-
wards as the first stage in closing the gap.
They were opposed by go Light Division to the
west and Trieste to the east; both fought well
and the attack was only partially successful.
5 New Zealand Brigade on the east gained
their objective, 28 (Maori) Battalion fighting a
particularly gallant action. 132 Brigade were
unsuccessful and had heavy losses and to the
west 6 New Zealand Brigade also failed to
reach their objective. At dawn and again on
the evening of 4th September the enemy put
in heavy counter-attacks against the three
brigades. AH were repulsed but during the
night the infantry were withdrawn from their
exposed positions, leaving mobile troops to
operate southwards. Throughout 4th and 5th
September -the retreating enemy was assailed
from the north, east and south by our mobile
troops and heavily bombed by our aircraft.
It was unfortunate that on 4th September an-
other dust-storm made observation difficult and
flying impossible during the afternoon. By the
evening of 5th September the enemy’s slow and
stubborn withdrawal had brought him back
to the area of our minefields. Here he turned
to stand and it was clear that he intended to
make a strong effort to retain this much at
least of his gains. Accordingly at 0700 hours
of 7th September the battle was called off
and Rommel was left in possession of a thin
strip of ground which had advanced his posi-
tions on the southern flank to a line running
from the eastern end of Deir el Munassib to
include the peak of Himeimat. The latter was
valuable for the excellent observation which
it gave as far north as Ruweisat ridge.

This meagre gain of some four or five miles
of desert could in no way be set off against
the material losses. Forty-two German tanks
and eleven Italian, and nearly seven hundred
motor vehicles,- were abandoned on the field,
together with thirty field and forty anti-tank
guns. Casualties were more difficult to assess
but we estimated that the enemy had lost two
thousand Italians and two thousand five hun-
dred Germans in killed and wounded; three
hundred were taken prisoner. Our own losses
were sixty-eight tanks, one anti-aircraft and
eighteen anti-tank guns; killed, wounded and
missing numbered sixteen hundred and forty.
But the battle“of Alam el Halfa was far more
important than would appear from any statis-
tics of gains and losses or the numbers involved.
It was the last throw of the German forces
in Africa, their last chance of a victory before,
as they -calculated, our increasing strength
would make victory for them impossible. It
