SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 8 JANUARY, 1048

47. Captain Maund returned to A.N.C.X.F.’s
Headquarters on’ the 16th May and was then
given a directive placing him as A.N.C.X.F.’s
representative in charge of the naval element at
O.K.W. and of O.K.M. :

48. After the dissolution of O.K.W. on the
23rd May and the arrest of Admirals Doenitz
and Von Friedeberg amongst a number of
other German Senior Naval Officers, command
of O.K.M. was assumed by Admiral
Backenkohler; he was succeeded on the 25th
May by Admiral Warzecha.

49. Captain Alleyne was succeeded on 27th
May by Captain E. Hale, R.N., who on Cap-
tain Maund’s withdrawal became the senior
‘naval representative at O.K.M.

50. The policy for the control of O.K.M. was
laid down by the Allied Naval Commander-in-
Chief in a message to Captain Maund on the
6th June. The complete dissolution of O.K.M.
was envisaged in this message, but during the
first phase the main structure of the organisation
was to be retained until certain investigations
had been completed, transfers of German per-
sonnel completed and decisions reached on sail-
ings of War and Merchant ships to the United
Kingdom: or Allied ports; and arrangements
made for the use of facilities in.German naval
dockyards. When this programme had been
completed, it was envisaged that the opera-
tional side of O.K.M. should be disbanded
completely and the administrative side reduced
to four or five departments.

51. This phase was achieved on the rath
July, when the dissolution of O.K.M. was
started and a new organisation for the adminis-
‘tration of the German minesweeping forces em-
ployed on mine clearance was established. The
new organisation was brought into force on 21st
July, a week after the Supreme Commander
had laid down his office.

52. It remains to transfer these German mine-
sweeping forces to the Mine Clearance Board
which is being established under civil auspices.

53. Apart from the long term tasks of control
of the disarmament of the German Navy and
the disbandment of its personnel, there
were two immediate naval problems to be
dealt with after the surrender. One of these
was the opening of the sea routes to the North
German Ports and the other the collection of in-
telligence, particularly that which might have
a vital bearing on the prosecution of the War
against Japan.

The opening of the sea routes to the North
German Ports.

54. This problem had to be tackled with
energy, as it was essential to open the North
German Ports to traffic soon so that warships
and merchant ships required by the Allies
could be removed, so that British warships
could visit German naval ports and so. that the
import programme could be started. It was
élear that unless imports of food were made
soon, a large percentage of the German popu-
lation would starve before long and apart from
humanitarian scruples, starvation of the Ger-
man population would have an immediate effect
on the economic life of the lately occupied coun-
tries which it was our first aim to rehabilitate,
particularly if famine lowered the output of
coal from the Ruhr,

rg7.

55. With this in mind, minesweeping of the
North Sea route to Heligoland had begun well
before the surrender and by the gth May a
force of 44 ships was based at Cuxhaven for
sweeping the Elbe and its approaches.

56. By this time it was clear that the Ems
had been mined at Emden and the Weser above
Bremerhaven, before the surrender brought
about the cessation of the enemy’s policy of
fouling all ports before abandoning them. The
Weser to Bremerhaven, the Elbe, the Kaiser
Wilhelm Cana] and all the West Baltic Ports
were reported clear of enemy mines.

57. It was decided that the risk of enemy
mines could be disregarded in order to admit
urgent shipping to ports to which reliable intelli-
gence indicated the routes were clear, and
urgent traffic was first admitted to Hamburg
on the gth May.

58. British mines had still to be considered
but by mid-May, Bremerhaven, Emden and
Kiel (via the Canal) were declared open to
urgent traffic.

By the 1st June, Hamburg and Kiel (via the
Canal) were open to normal traffic and by
mid-June Bremerhaven also.

The Collection of Naval Intelligence.

59. Progressively, as the German forces were
rolled back, Iptelligence objectives were over-
taken and exploited until the collapse of the
enemy put us in possession of virtually all
his naval secrets. The phase was one more
of organising the full exploitation of what came
into our hands than of seeking the targets
themselves, although only the dash and skill
of 30 Advance Unit and of the U.S. Naval
Technical Mission in Europe saved many of
the more important ‘‘ finds ’’ from destruc-
tion. The work of the Royal Naval Field
Intelligence Unit also did much to reveal and
preserve these targets.

The Removal of A.N.C.X.F.’s Headquarters to
German soil,

60. Since late September, 1944, A.N.C.X.F.’s
Headquarters had been located at the Chateau
d’Hennement, St. Germain, about six miles
from Versailles and ‘thus convenient to the
main departments of S.H.A.E.F.

6x. It ‘was a natural conclusion that
A.N.C.X.F. should move to Frankfurt so as
to be alongside the Supreme Commander’s
Headquarters, and early in May arrangements
to this end were well in hand.

62. The intention then was _ that
A.N.C.X.F.’s “‘ Post Hostilities ’’ Staff, under
Rear-Admiral W. E. Parry, C.B., should move
from London to Minden, where this staff would
be best located to put into execution the plans
for the control and disarmament of the German
Navy. At Minden they would be ten miles
from Bad Oeynhausen, where 21st Atmy
Group Headquarters was being established,
while Lubbecke to which the British Control
Commission was shortly to move is eight miles
away.

63. But soon after the surrender it seemed
likely that the Supreme Allied Command
would terminate somewhat sooner than had
‘been envisaged and with this in mind it
seemed preferable for A.N.C.X.F.’s Main
