SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948 1677

ready to give his personal attention to any de-
mand made on his Department, also to Major
Taylor who was the officer in charge of the
whole of the warning system in Burma.

15. A A. Artillery. When I arrived in Burma
some A.A. equipment for the locally raised
Burma Auxiliary Force (B.A.F.) units had
just come from India. Later on, both British
and Indian light and heavy batteries arnved
and it was possible to organise a thin scale of
defence for vital points. All -units acquitted
themselves well and a very considerable
number of enemy aircraft were shot down—
including one by the third shot fired by the
i Heavy A.A. Regiment B.A.F.

II. REINFORCEMENT POLIcy.

16. Reinforcements. The first reinforcement
to reach Burma was the 46 Indian Infantry
Bngade which arrived towards the end of
January in time to take part in the fighting
west of the River Salween. It consisted of
young troops and had been destined for Iraq
where it was intended it should complete its
training. It was not really fit for active opera-
tions without further training and had no ex-
perience in jungle warfare.

The only other reinforcements in sight from
India consisted of six Indian battalions which
it was intended td withdraw from the frontier
and equip on the lower scale for service over-
seas. These eventually constituted the 48
Indian Infantry Brigade, consisting entirely
of Gurkhas which arrived about Ist February,
and did very good work on the Bilin River,
and the 63 Indian Infantry Brigade,
which arrived just before the fall of
Rangoon. Two East African Brigades
which had done excellent service in the
Italian campaign, were accepted by India for
service in Burma, one to arrive at the end of
January and one a month Iater. Neither of
these materialised, though it was only’ late in
February that Burma was informed that they
had been diverted elsewhere. There is no doubt
that they would have been invaluable at a
critical period.

17. British Battahons. A further reinforce-
ment sent in response to my urgent demands
for British troops, both for internal security,
as reinforcements to 17 Indian Division, and
for reasons of morale, consisted of three British
battalions taken from the garrison of India.
One, the 2 D-W.R. (Duke of Wellington’s
Regiment), arrived in time to take part in the
battle of the Sittang, and the others, 1
Cameronians and 1 W. Yorks (West York-
shire Regiment) did very good work during the
fighting near Pegu. These battalions had, been
given only a few days notice of mobilization
and embarkation and some were incomplete in
transport, but none the less showed magnificent
spirit throughout the operations—a tribute to
the value of trained and experienced British
troops even though not specially trained for
jungle warfare conditions.

18. Armoured Troops. A further reinforce-
ment, which proved invaluable, was the 7
Armoured Brigade whose fighting spirit and
efficiency were the admiration of the whole
Army. Unfortunately it only arrived after the
battle of Sittang when it was instrumental in
enabling the 17 Indian Division to re-
organise round Pegu.

19. Summary. It will be seen, therefore,
that the reinforcements provided for Burma
after the outbreak of war consisted of an
Armoured Bngade, three British battalions and
three Indian brigades. Of these only two
infantry brigades arrived before the battle of
the Sittang, which, as will be seen later, prac-
tically settled the fate of Rangoon.

The three Indian Brigades, though good
material, all suffered from the weakness of
having a large proportion of inexperienced
officers and recruits in their ranks, and also
from having had no training in jungle war-
fare. The 48 Indian Infantry Brigade did
especially well, and also some of the Battalions
of the 46 Indian Brigade. As regards the
63 Indian Infantry Brigade, I was informed
by Genera] Hartley that it required a period of
training before being employed in operations.

III. Co-opzRATION WITH THE CHINESE.

20. Situation on Arnval On my arrival in
Burma one regiment of 93 Division ‘‘ Force
Trellis,’ was already moving towards the
Southern Shan States with the object of taking
over the defence of the Mekong River, west
of the road Kengtung-Mongpayak, with H.Q.
at Mongyawng.

The rest of the Division was located about
Puerh in China and we were responsible for
supplying it with rice. .

The remainder of the Sixth Army, which in-
cluded the 49 and 55 Divisions was
stationed near Paoshan on the China road. The
Fifth Army was on the Yunnan-Kweichow
border. Shortly afterwards the 49 Division,
“* Force Zigzag,’’ moved up to the border of
Wanting in reserve.

21. Command. It had been laid down by the
Generalissimo that all Chinese troops were to
be under my command and he was most in-
sistent that all breaches of discipline were to
be reported to him personally, He was
anxious, however, that they should be given
their own area and not be mixed up with our
own troops. We were to be responsible for
the supply of rice and any other requirements
that could -be spared imcluding if possible
medical stores and mosquito nets.

On about r5th January, 1942, I visited
Kengtung and discussed the possible move of
the remainder of the 93 Division from China
to'the Kengtung area. On 19th January when
the situation in Tenasserim area became
serious, the move of this Division was ordered
and 1 Burma Brigade gradually withdrew
from their positions south-east of Kengtung.

It was laid down in my directive that no
additional Chinese troops were to be brought
into Burma without reference to H.Q. South-
West Pacific Command (A‘B.D.A. Command)
‘On 21st January, 1942, however, I obtained
General Wavell’s permission to bring in
another Chinese Division, the 49; the Governor
was consulted and agreed.

On 2oth January it was decided that the
49 Division should comezinto the Southern
Shan States via Lashio, and take over the
area east of the River Salween about Takaw,
and that 55 Division should move forward to
Wanting (Chinese frontier) to complete train-
ing and equipment.
