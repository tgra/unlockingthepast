On the roth July, therefore, I decided to prohibit fighters from entering the gun-belt, whatever the circumstances, after the 17th July. At a conference held to discuss this change, General Pile pointed out that an obvious corollary to it was to move all the guns inside the belt, so as to have them all in one place and provide both guns and fighters with clearly-defined spheres of operation. The logic of this argument was irrefutable; and I agreed to examine detailed proposals for moving all the guns into the belt except a few which would remain on the coast to act as ‘‘ markers ’’.",

For the moment, until arrangements for forward maintenance could be perfected, these forces were to concentrate in the general area of Assisi with some elements to the west near Siena. On 17th July Eighth Army Headquarters produced a detailed appreciation. The conclusions were that the attack should be made by two Corps, each with two divisions forward, operating up the axes Florence-Firenzuola and FlorenceBologna, The Poles were to hold on the Adriatic coast and would be connected with the central front by a Corps with a defensive réle. A cover-plan had already been put into force by my headquarters on 3rd July to suggest to the enemy that the main attack would come on the Adriatic coast.",
