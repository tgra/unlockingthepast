diféctly the Group had landed, collected the
chiéf Quisling, took over the telephone exchange
arid, beforé leaving, wrecked the instruments.

34. In thé meanwhile Group 3 had been in-
structed (0925) to send a party by landing craft
to destroy the herring oul factory at Mortenes,
and at 1015 Captain A. S. Romald landed witha
his troops 1m the area of the factory and com-
pleted its destruction without meeting oppost-
tion.

35. From 1000 hours onwards, the situation
became confused in South Vaagso, where Group
2 were encountering strong opposition in the
northern end of the town. The destruction of
communications with the forward troops ren-
déred control by the Flagship difficult.

36. By 1020 hours the whole of Group 4 had
been despatched to the assistance of Group 2,
and were committed on the left flank. '

37. BY 1030 hours house-to-house fighting in
the centre and northern end of the town had
become bitter, resulting in severe casualties,
especially in officers and sénior N.C.O.s.
Group i arrived fromi Halnoesvik and was com-
niittéd in sfipport of No, 4 Troop in the centre.

quest the latter despatched No. 6 Troop.

of the énémy in South Vaagso.

39. No. 1 Troop (Group 2) secured the land--

ing place, cleared the southern end of the town;
capturing a prominent Quisling, and prepared
thé miain demolitions.

40. At 1230 hours Lieutenant-Colonel Durn-
ford-Slater, after personally directing operations
in the town, reported to Force Headquarters

that resistance was nearly overcome and that

demolitions were in progress.

41. As the majority of the industrial targets
vad Been destroyed and as landing craft were
becoming dispersed in ferrying wounded and
Norwégian volunteers out to the ships and
Yhight take some time to reorganise for with-
drawal purposes, the Military Commander, in
agreernent with the Naval Commander,
ordered re-embarkation at 1250 hours.

42. The withdrawal of all proups was
catried out without opposition. | The Firda
factory, which was the last of the industrial
targets, aid the Seternes Lighthouse were
Jstholished before’ the troops re-embarked.

43.° Group 5, who had been delayed in their
southward move along thé é¢oast road by the
shelling of beached rerchant shipping in
Ulvésiind, were ordered to re-embark in
ORIBI to the north of Som Vaagso.

. 44.. At ¥408 hours Licutenant-Colonel
Durnford-Slater reported that al troops had

- left the shore, and returned himself in the last

landing craft.

_45. The re-embarkation had been com-
pleted and all landing craft hoisted by 1434

46. In considering the course of the opera-
tién particular attention is drawn to the follow-
itig factots which both had important bearings
‘on the course-of the fighting: in the first place,

the hampering, effect of the desire to comply
strictly with the orders which had been issued
to avoid all possible damage to Norwegian
property; and in the second place; the con-
flicting claims of the comparatively short time
limit imposed by the whole nature of the opera-_
tion, and of the restrictions on speed which
are inherent in all street fighting but particu-
larly when it is conducted against determined
opposition. .

47. It here requires mention that the oppo-
sition was overcome, and all the demolition
tasks completed, often under heavy enemy
fire, well within the time limits laid down and
that such results could not possibly have been
obtained had it not been for the personal leader-
ship of Lieutenant-Colonel J. F. Durnford-

‘Slater, and for the sense of discipline, the

initiative and courage that was shown time and
again iby junior leaders, both officers and
N.C.0.s. .
