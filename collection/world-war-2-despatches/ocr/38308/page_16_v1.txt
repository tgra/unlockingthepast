UGANDA, whilst casting off  from her tanker, inadvertently,  lay back om one gil hase,

is she was able:to clear by the use of shallow water divers. . By 1530 fuelling was completed. The Fleet  took departure for the operations ~ area and the Tanker Group for area Cootie, . The plan for the opening of operations was: ~

(a) To make airfields of the Sakishima Gunto unserviceable by bombing runways and air installations.  

- (0), To conduct an offensive against flak positions and to assist in cratering runways by - ship bombardment.

(c) To maintain an offensive CAP. over the islands. .

The particular plan for the first day was for the  bombarding force to bombard Miyako airfields" and flak positions at about noon, -from medium range, with the Carrier Force about . 30 miles to the southward. 4th May.

Ten minutes later enemy air activity in the vicinity: of Sakishima was detected, the general trend  of traffic being to the eastward. One small group approached the Fleet and Hellcats shof down one Zeke before the others

* escaped in cloud.

Bomber  strikes were flown off at obits for Miyako and. at 0815 for Ishigaki.

At Miyako the-weather was good, visibility

epair work on the airfields had apparently been proceeding by night since the day  strikes by TF 52. All A.A. batteries opened fire on our aircraft. Runways at Hirara were well bombed and a direct hit on an A.A. position observed. Conditions for bombardment  appeared good.

At Ishigaki one runway: of Miyara airfield was found serviceable and left well cratered.

At 0800 the Diimbo aircraft provided by CTF 51 arrived, and. was stationed between

the target and the Carrier Force until 1700.
