increased number of convoy sailings and move-
ments of naval forces. One U-boat was known
to be in the Maldives area, and on the 16th
another made an attack off Pondicherry, sink-
ing one vessel. A Catalina assisted in the
rescue work, but the offensive anti-submarine
search which was immediately instituted
proved fruitless. What was probably the
same submarine was sighted and attacked by
a Catalina of No. 240 Squadron returning from
a convoy escort on the 22nd. Probable
damage was done in spite of the difficult con-
ditions of light and angle of attack, and a
hunt to exhaustion was immediately initiated
using Catalinas of both 225 and 222 Groups.
The enemy was not destroyed, although depth-
charges were dropped on a possible sighting,
and no further attacks were made on convoys
in the area.

119. 225 Group aircraft continued to search
for the submarine until after dawn on the
25th, but the 222 Group detachment returned
to Ceylon to provide cover for units of Eastern
Fleet. Beauforts carried out anti-submarine
sweeps in front of Trincomalee harbour, while
the Catalinas escorted the arriving ships to
port.

120. In spite of defensive air patrols, one
independently routed merchant vessel was
sunk in the Maldives area, but aircraft again
located survivors and guided a cruiser to the
spot.

121. Considering the great amount of ship-
ping activity, the month witnessed compara-
tively few attacks. It is probable, however,
that enemy submarines were being employed
on reconnaissance, particularly of the growing
concentration of naval forces. There is no
doubt that the provision of patrols and escorts
of the greatest density possible with the forces
available was responsible for denying to these
enemy reconnaissance submarines much useful
information.

122. In February the number of enemy sub-
marines estimated to be in the Indian Ocean
rose to ten, and patrol activity was intensified
to meet the threat. It became necessary to
augment air cover for the threatened areas
around Ceylon with Catalinas and Wellingtons
from 225 Group. Sinkings were heavy during
the month, but one submarine was destroyed
by escort vessels with the co-operation of the
covering aircraft, and another, after it had
sunk H.M.T. KHEDIVE ISMAIL, by H.M.
destroyers who were guarding the troopship in
such a strength that no air escort was deemed
necessary.

123. The sinkings necessitated many rescue
operations by aircraft, and the survivors of
three ships were located and covered while
surface craft were guided to them. The out-
standing rescue was that of survivors of a ship
torpedoed fourteen days earlier 800 miles from
the mainland.

124. The other major operation of the
month, which absorbed a considerable number
of aircraft hours, was the cover given to a
slow-moving floating dock from Bombay to
Trincomalee—cover which would probably not
have been afforded had the “Stipple” pro-
cedure been in force.

125. Towards the end of February there

arose a potential threat to the east coast of -

India from the move of a considerable portion

of the Japanese Fleet to Singapore. Plans
were laid for the assembly and despatch of
air striking forces including all heavy bomber
squadrons should the occasion arise. Bases
in Southern India and Ceylon were prepared
and stocked for the possible advent of large
forces from Bengal, and No. 200 (Liberator
G.R.) Squadron from West Africa and No. 47
(Torpedo) Beaufighter Squadron from the
Mediterranean arrived as reinforcements. No.
27 (Coastal Fighter) Beaufighter Squadron was
detached from Bengal to work with No. 47
Squadron at Madras. The threat did not
materialise but the organisation built up has
been retained in skeleton form.

126. March witnessed a peak of activity
which began on the first of the month with a
hunt to exhaustion following the sinking of a
merchant vessel twenty-five miles south-west
of Galle. In the forty-fourth hour of the
search a Catalina sighted and attacked a sur-
faced submarine by moonlight. The enemy
U-boat was not seen after the attack, and
although it was probably damaged the search
was continued for two more days.

127. Further enemy attacks resulted in two
sinkings in the Arabian Sea, four in more
southerly waters, and one of a troopship in
the northern Bay of Bengal, an area hitherto
almost completely immune from submarine
attacks. There were regrettable delays in re-
porting the sinking, and thus the assembling
of forces to search for the submarine, but the
limited number of aircraft available to 173
Wing which controlled the area, eked out by
Beaufighters from 224 Group, carried out a
modified search until the arrival of reinforce-
ments. The flying effort and quick turn round
of the few aircraft available, however, was
particularly creditable, one Liberator of No.
354 Squadron being airborne again forty-seven
minutes after landing.

128. No. 230 (Sunderland) Squadron arrived
in the Command during March, but it did not
begin to operate fully until later, since lack
of spares kept its serviceability low.

129. In April the number of submarines
operating in the Indian Ocean fell to an esti-
mated two. One was believed to be in the
Maldives area and the other to be operating
on the trade routes between Freemantle and
Colombo, out of range of aircraft operating
from the Maldives. Beaufort aircraft were
thus employed on coastal convoy escort, and
long-range aircraft were held at Ceylon in
readiness for a threat further afield. No ships
were sunk in the waters around India during
the month, and the gradual change-over from
the defensive to the offensive was symbolised
in this month by the successful escort pro-
vided to Eastern Fleet in their strike with
carrier-borne aircraft against Sabang in North-
West Sumatra.

130. In May, Eastern Fleet was again
covered during its journey to and from Soura-
baya. During the month, it became possible
to discontinue the Arakan coast patrols. No
sightings of any importance had been made
in the six months that the patrols had been
carried out, and the continued absence of a
threat in this area now allowed of a diversion
of these aircraft to more positive work.

131. The loss of Liberators (B.24) engaged
on photographic reconnaissance of the
Andamans, Nicobars and North Sumatra led
