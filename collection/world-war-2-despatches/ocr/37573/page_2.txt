one of which was the Tenth Army (General
Altmayer), with which the B.E.F. was operat-
ing—and that considerable gaps existed between’
the groups.

The Armies, he explained, would continue
to fight under the orders of their own Corn-
manders, but co-ordinated action of the force
as a whole would no longer be possible.
Reserves were exhausted and many formations
worn out.

He then informed me that, in accordance
with a decision taken by the Allied Govern-
ments, Brittany was to be defended by holding
a line across the peninsula in the vicinity of
Rennes. He suggested that we should proceed
to General Georges’ Headquarters to discuss
with him the details of this project.

We then went to General Georges’ Head-
quarters, at Briare, where we continued the dis-
cussion, I pointed out that the length of the pro-
posed line was some 150 kilometres which would
Tequire at least fifteen Divisions. I gathered
from both General Weygand and General
Georges* that they did not consider the
Brittany project to be a feasible pro-

position with the forces that now
remained available in the Tenth French
Army including the B.E.F. General

Weygand referred to the project as ‘‘ roman-
tic,’’ and said that it had been adopted with-
out military advice. General Weygand
stated, however, that, since the Allied Govern-
ments had issued instructions for the defence
of Brittany he must carry out their orders.
Consequently, in consultation with General
Georges, he had drawn up instructions for the
participation of the B.E.F. in the scheme.
Being under the impression that H.M. Govern-
ment had approved this plan, I signed the
document which prescribed the réle of B.E.F.
in it. (Copy attached at Appendix ‘ A’).

6. In view of the gravity of the situation
which General Weygand ‘had described to- me,
I immediately sent a telegram to inform the
C.I.G.S. I also requested Major-General Sir
Richard Howard-Vyse to proceed to the War
Office as soon as possible to report more fully to
the C.LG.S., and to take to the C.1.G.S. a copy
eid document reproduced in Appendix

7.1 then returned to my Headquarters at
Le Mans, arriving at 1615 hours. I spoke to
the C.I.G.S. by telephone at 1630 hours and
explained the situation. I asked whether the
Brittany scheme had H.M. Government’s ap-
proval and told him that both Generals
Weygand and Georges appeared to consider it
impracticable with the force available. . The
C.1.G.S. informed me that he knew nothing of
the Brittany scheme, but said he would refer
the matter to the Prime Minister.

Z told the C.1.G.S. that, in view of the
general state of disintegration which was -begin-
ning to spread in the French Army, I con-
sidered that all further movement of troops
and material to France should be stopped, and
that arrangements should be started for the
evacuation of the B.E.F. from available ports.
The C.1.G.S, informed me that orders had
already been issued to stop the dispatch of
further troops and material to France.

8. An hour later (1715 hours) the C.I.G.S.
telephoned to say that the Prime Minister knew

* General Georges was C.-in-C., North-Eastern
Theatre of Operations. -

SUPPLEMENT to THe LONDON GAZETTE, 22 MAY, 1946 |

nothing of the Brittany plan, and that all
arrangements were to start for the evacuation
of those elements of the B.E.F. which were
at that time not under the orders of the Tenth
French Army.

As H.M. Government had not been con-
sulted with regard to the Brittany scheme, and
the withdrawal of the B.E.F. had been ap-
proved, I considered that I was no longer
a position to carry out the dispositions settled
with Generals Weygand and Georges. I there-
fore requested the C.1.G.S. to inform General
Weygand, and I understood this was to be
done. The instructions which I received later
(see paragraph ro below), stating that I was

-no longer under General Weygand’s orders,

confirmed this opinion.

Orders outlining the arrangements for the
evacuation were at once issued, and an officer
was dispatched to Lieutenant-General J. H.
Marshall-Cornwall requesting him to come to
my Headquarters.

g. The C.I.G.S. telephoned again at 2075
hours and said that it was most important that
everything should be done to ensure good rela-
tions between ourselves and the French, and fo
avoid, in every possible way, giving the im-
pression that the B.E.F. was deserting them.
I replied that I would most certainly see that
this was done, that I was moving no troops
engaged with the Tenth Army, but that I’ was
arranging to move back all other troops and
material towards the ports.

At this stage the Prime Minister himself spoke
and asked about the employment of those éle-
ments of the 52nd Division which were not
under the o:ders of the Tenth French Army.
I assured him that I considered that no use-
ful purpose could be served by adding them
to the forces already with that Army. They
could not possibly restore the situation on that
front, nor could they close the gap of some 30
miles which now existed between the Tenth
French Army and the Amny of Paris.

The Prime Minister then agreed to my pro-
posal that the troops under orders of the Tenth
French Army should remain fighting with that
army for the present, whilst the withdrawal-of
the remainder of the B.E.F. should, proceed,

Moves to ports of embarkation were therefore
continued, Canadian forces moving on Brest,
corps troops on St. Malo, 52nd Division’, (less
elements with Tenth French Army) on Cher-
bourg, L. of C. troops and material- on St:
Malo, Brest, St. Nazaire, Nantes. and ‘La
Pallice. Finally those elements ‘with Tenth
French Army were to embark at Cherbourg
when the situation admitted of their withdrawal
from that Army. .- 3 es

ro. At 2235 hours I spoke to the C.I.G.S.
and told him of the-Prime Minister's approval
for evacuation. The C.1.G.S. informed me that
I was no longer under the orders of General
Weygand, and that the B-E:F. was to act-as
an independent force. I was, ‘however, +o
continue to co-operate in“every way possible
with the Tenth French Army. ;

1x. During the night of 14th/15th June, my
staff and myself were busily engaged in per-
fecting the arrangements for the embarkation
and evacuation of ‘approximately 150,000 per-
sonnel, with large: stocks of vehicles and
material which had’ been. accumulated since
September, 1939. | Major Macartney’ of the
