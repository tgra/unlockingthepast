From air reconnaissance carried out on Ist and 2nd October, it was known that a considerable enemy convoy was at sea; on the and it was sailing east in Naxos area, and the garrison commander on Cos assumed it was a reinforcement for Rhodes. The enemy's air superiority made it impossible for the Royal Navy to intercept the convoy by day, and a sweep carried out by destroyers on the night of 2nd October failed to locate it, At first light on the following day R.A.F. Beaufighters attacked the convoy, but without success. The garrison was therefore only conducting its ordinary routine precautions when, at 0500 hours on 3rd October, the enemy assault on Cos began, The seaborne invading forces, consisting of troops from the Greek mainland and from Crete, landed from merchant vessels, landing-craft and caiques, covered by aircraft and three destroyers, while a strong force of parachute troops, flown from the Greek mainland, was dropped on Antimachia airfield, which our aircraft were unable to use since it had been badly cratered in the air-raids which",

The enemy, on the other hand, taking full advantage of the proximity of his air bases, was able to make our reinforcements of Leros difficult. The dropping of flares at night hindered unloading operations on certain occasions, and the laying of minefields also added to our difficulties; in spite of all this enemy activity the strength of the Leros garrison was built up to the strength of a brigade. The original garrison, which had arrived between the 17th September and the 2nd October, was the 234th Brigade Headquarters, and the 2nd Royal Irish Fusiliers, with a company from the 2nd Royal West Kents, the remainder of the battalion being on Samos. This was reinforced by 4th November by the 4th Buffs, although their Headquarters Company was lost at sea, and early in November the Ist King's Own completed the Brigade.",

In its final form it proposed that, after the Germans had been driven back to their Adige line, Fifth Army should become wholly responsible for operations in Italy, taking under command the Polish Corps, whose employment in Jugoslavia might have been politically embarrassing. Eighth Army should prepare a base in the area of the ports of Split, Sibenik and Zadar, occupying them with light forces, and then, in early spring, bring in their main forces, in the strength of at least six divisions, for a rapid advance on Ljubljana and Fiume. I would retain a Corps of two Indian divisions in Army Group reserve, ready to support either Army. A good",

            "description": "The furthest point in Fifth Army's advance down the Imola road had been reached with the capture of Monte La Battaglia on 27th September. While the enemy was expending his strength in vain counter-attacks to recapture this vital position, attempts which continued until they died down from exhaustion on 6th October,t General Clark decided to take advantage of the progress made by the left wing of II Corps to concentrate the main weight of the Corps on the axis of Route 65, the direct road to Bologna. The factors which had militated against the choice of this axis for the original attack no longer applied, since we had now left well behind the strong defences and difficult terrain of the Futa Pass and were over the Radicosa Pass as well. Accordingly 13 Corps were to take over responsibility for the Imola axis and were to relieve 88 Division on Monte La Battaglia. I felt that this new drive would be the climax of our operations in the mountains; the season was already far advanced, and the break in the weather had come earlier than  usual; unless we could get through now we were likely to be stuck in the mountains for the winter. In order, therefore, to give the maximum weight possible to the attack, and since all three divisions in 3 Corps were very tired after continuous fighting, I decided on 2nd October to reinforce it with 78 Division, my only fresh formation, just back from a restful tour of duty in the Middle East. Even with this addition, as I reported on the same date, I feared that   we may not be quite strong enough to carry it",

On 2nd October the relief of 88 Division on Monte La Battaglia began, in the first place by 1 Guards Brigade. The badness of the roads and tracks in rear of the position severely hampered the relief; the rain also continued remorselessly. On the left of II Corps good progress was made. On 2nd October 91 Division captured the village of Monghidoro, twenty-five miles by road from Bologna, and on the 3rd 34 Division captured Monte Venere, a commanding height to the west of the large village of Loiano. On the right 85 Division had reached the head waters of the River Idice. By the 4th II Corps had made good an advance of some four miles in two days against strong resistance and in abominable weather. Loiano, twenty-two miles from Bologna, fell to 9x Division on the sth. On the same day 6 South African Armoured Division came. under direct Fifth Army command with the task of operating on the left of II Corps up the Prato-Castiglione road; it had under it 24 Guards Brigade, an an independent Indian battalion (6/13 Frontier Force Rifles) and Combat Command   B   of x U.S. Armoured Division.",
