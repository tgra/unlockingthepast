for the Asiatic population were so great that
they could not put forward a satisfactory solu-
tion. As a result, when hostilities broke out,
only a modrfied and limited scheme existed.
In the light of subsequent experience it
appears that it should have been possible to
produce a workable scheme, though it is true
that during the campaign there was no shortage
of focdstuffs for the civil population.

71. Water.—It is only necessary here to
explain the water supply in the Singapore
Island area. In othér parts of Malaya there
was little or no danger of a water shortage.
Singapore Island was dependent upon two main
sources of supply (a) reservoirs at Gunong
Pulai in Johore (10 miles west of Johore Bahru)
and (6) rainwater catchment areas and open-
air reservoirs on Singapore Island i.e. the
Seletar, Peirce and MacRitchie Reservoirs.
From the former water was brought by above-
ground pipe line to Singapore Town where it
filled two high-level covered reservoirs at Pearls
Hill and Fort Canning. Branches from the
Johore pipe-line supplied the Naval Base and
Army and Air Force barracks in that area.

The Peirce Reservoir fed by gravity into the
MacRitchie Reservoir whence water was
pumped into the distribution mains serving the
Singapore and Changi areas against the Johore
water coming via the Pearls Hill and Fort
Canning Reservoirs. The supply from the
Seletar, Peirce and MacRitchie Reservoirs was
ample to give a restricted supply indefinitely
even if the population was increased by
tefugees, provided the control of these reser-
voirs remained in our hands and the machinery
for distribution continued to operate.

72. Medical._The hospital accommodation
which had been prepared in peace-time was of
course quite inadequate for the increased
garrison The A.IF. had their own Base
Hospital which was housed in one wing of the
new civil hospital at Malacca. The Base
Hospital for other Europeans of all three Ser-
vices was at the Alexandra Military Hospital on
Singapore Island. The Indian Base Hospital
was in hutted accommodation also on Singapore
Island. On the mainland forward hospitals were
established—often in schools taken over for the
purpose There were also convalescent camps
and ‘‘change of air’’ camps for both
Europeans and Indians, and steps were being
taken for the construction of a large ‘‘ change
of air ’’ station at Cameron Highlands.

Large reserves of medical supplies were held
in the Tanghn (Singapore) area.

With a view to increasing the hospital accom-
modation in the Singapore area in the event of
active operations arrangements had been made
with the owners of certain large houses for a
portion of them to be used, if required, as over-
flow convalescent hospitals.

The Civil Medical Services were well devel-
There were excellent modern hospitals
and a plentiful supply of medical stores. The
standard of efficiency of the medical officers
was high and there were some exceptionally
clever specialists.

73. Red Cross —There were Red Cross
organizations working for both British and
Indian troops. The Australian Red Cross was
responsible for all the British troops.

74, N.AA.F, 1_The N.A.A.F I, organisa-
tion, which had been established in pre-war
days, was expanded to supply the needs of the
British troops. By special arrangements with
the Government of India it also in 1941 under-
took responsibility for the Indian troops. This
branch of its activities was, however, never
fully developed, partly owing to the time re-
quired to bring in the additional supplies and
partly also to the difficulty in finding suitable
men to act as branch managers

975 Accommodation—In Malaya, as in other
Eastern countries, the problem of accommoda-
tion for troops differs widely from that in
European countries. There are no farms, large
empty houses, or village halls, while billeting
on the civil population, mostly Asiatic, has
obvious objections. In most places there are
good schools and these were made available,
when the emergency demanded, by the civil
authorities. A hmited amount of tentage was
also available. A great deal of new construc-
tion, however, became necessary. This took
the form of wooden hutments erected by civil
contractors. Water supplies and_ eventually
electric light had to be laid on. Delays were
caused by the shortage of materials, some of
which had to be brought from ovétseas. The
R.E. Works Services received valuable help
from the Public Works Department in the
preparation of these camps.

Sites for the camps were selected in accordance
with tactical requirements. Some of those in
the North had been erected before my arrival
in rubber plantations with a view to providing
them with cover from air observation. From a
health point of view, however, these camps
were definitely unsatisfactory and caused me
much uneasiness. The thick rubber tree-tops
prevented the sun and light from penetrating to
the camps, which in consequence were damp
and depressing. This had an adverse physical
and mental effect on the troops, some of whom
were in consequence not as fighting fit at the
end of 1941 as they otherwise would have been.
I attempted to improve conditions by thinning
the tree-tops and also by organising ‘‘ change of
air ’’ camps on Penang Island and elsewhere to
which troops could be sent in turn for short
periods.

76. Recreation._Everything was done to
provide recreational facilities, both outdoors
and indoors, for the troops. In some places,
however, the nature of the country did not
lend itself to outdoor recreation grounds. Clubs
for the troops were organized and special build-
ings erected in Singapore and other of the
larger towns In this connection many of the
civilians were both hospitable and generous in
their help.

77. Married Families.—In peace-time married
families accompanied the troops to Malaya.
After the outbreak of World War II, however,
no married families of the Army or the Air
Force were allowed to enter Malaya, but those
already there remained there. The same policy
applied to officers’ families. The famihes of
officers coming to Malaya from China were sent
to Australia, where living was very expensive
as it was also in India. In consequence, a num-
ber of officers of both the British and Indian
Service, especially those who had children in
the United Kingdom, became financially embar-
rassed. On the other hand, women were
