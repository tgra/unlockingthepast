Clearly another Group would be needed to take © charge of the Sectors which were to be formed in Wales and the West Midlands. Accordingly, No. 9 Group began to form at Preston early in August, 1940, and on 16th September its first Air Officer Commanding, Air Vice-Marshal W. A. McClaughry, D.S.0., MC., D.F.C., took up his appointment. :",

In this letter I pointed out that the Air Staff Estimate of the number of Fighter Squadrons necessary for the defence of this country was 52, and that on the outbreak of war I had the equivalent of 34 (allowing for the fact that some Auxiliary Squadrons were only partially trained and equipped).",

            "description": "its capture of the Giogo pass to press down into the valley of the Santerno, On aist September, 85 Infantry Division captured Firenzuola, and, pressing on north, stormed the strong position of Monte la Fine, west of the Imola road. On its right Il Corps had put in, on the 2zst, its last fresh division, 88 Infantry, with the task of clearing the east side-of the Imola road. The 88th pressed on over desperately difficult country and on the 27th seized Monte La Battaglia, a great mountain mass dominating the Senio and Santerno valleys on either hand and only ten miles from Imola and the Emilian plain, The enemy now reacted with great vigour and began a series of most violent counter-attacks with elements of four divisions; these and the increasing difficulties of our communications brought a halt to our advance on Imola. 13 Corps during this time had had the task of protecting II Corps’ right; it had still the same three divisions forward with which it had fought its way up from the Amo valley. Its sector of operations was dictated by the road-net and its main efforts must be down the roads to Faenza and Forli. On 24th September it captured Marradi on the former and San Benedetto on the latter. Meanwhile the left of II Corps had also been making good progress where 91 and 34 Divisions were advancing up the direct routes from Florence to Bologna. On the 21st the fate of the strong Futa’ Pass positions was sealed by the capture of Monte Gazzarro (or Guzzaso) on its eastern flank and by the 28th Route 65 was clear as far as the northem end of the Radicosa Pass, the second main pass on the Florence-Bolo toad. On the Prato-Bologna road 34 Divisicn ie ba level midnigh a a change of corps undaries at midnight 28th. mber, they were relieved by the Sout Ate when just short of Castiglione dei Pepoli. Between them and the coast the task of IV Corps was to follow up the enemy; this had brought us by the 28th to a line some five miles north of Pistoia and running from there over the mountains north of Lucca to the coastal plain about three miles short of Massa where the western end of’ the ‘‘ Gothic * line was secured by strong defences anchored on the sea. Viareggio was entered on r6th September by a British converted anti-aircraft battery of ‘‘ Task Force 45°’. 6 Regimental Combat Team of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force took over a sector of the line on 16th September. This was the first contingent of an Allied South American state to see action in this war. While it was gaining battle experience it played a valuable réle in holding an important part of the defensive front. _ The “Gothic” line was now completely turned at its eastern end and pierced over a wide front in the centre. By the end of September the enemy had decided: to abandon such of the prepared positions as still remained in his hands except for a small sector in the extreme west. In thus depriving the enemy of the permanent defences on which he had worked so long the Allied Armies in Italy had scored a great success, won at a great price, but it was difficult to exploit. The furthest advance had been made, as was intended, by the Eighth Army, which had advanced some thirty miles in twenty-six days. In a letter to me summing up the results of the action to date, written on",
