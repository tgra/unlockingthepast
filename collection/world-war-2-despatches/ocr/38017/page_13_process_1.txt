As regards the bearing and behaviour of the troops, British and French, prior to and during the embarkation, it must be recorded that the earlier parties were embarked off the beaches in a condition of complete disorganisation. There appeared to be no Military officers in charge of the troops, and this impression was undoubtedly enhanced by the difficulty in



distinguishing between the uniforms of such officers as were present and those of other ranks. It was soon realised that it was vitally necessary to despatch Naval Officers in their unmistakable uniform with armed Naval beach parties to take charge of the soldiers on shore immediately prior to embarkation. Great credit is due to the Naval officers and Naval ratings for the restoration of some semblance of order. Later on when troops of fighting formations reached the beaches these difficulties disappeared.
