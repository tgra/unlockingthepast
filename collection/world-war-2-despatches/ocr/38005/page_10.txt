General Remarks,

67. The safe return of ESKIMO and
COSSACK to Skjel Fiord was a fitting conclu-
sion to an operation which I consider was an
unqualified success.

Seven or eight enemy destroyers and one sub-
marine—the total German Naval Forces present
—were sunk without the loss of a British ship.

(The enemy destroyer “‘ already scuttled ’”’ in
Rombaks Fiord vide paragraph 4o may have
been abandoned after the attack by the and
Destroyer Flotilla on roth April, 1940.)

68. Our casualties also were comparatively
small—28 killed, 55 wounded, while the casual-
ties amongst enemy destroyers with their com-
plement of 280 each must have been very
heavy.

6g. I canaot speak too highly of the vigour
and determination with which our destroyers
went into the attack—they had to bear the
brunt of the enemy’s defence, and it was only
by the skilful handling of their ships that they

70. Our destroyers enjoyed a tactical advan-
tage in their ability to fire a heavy armament
on forward bearings.

71. The enemy reports made by WAR-
SPITE’S aircraft were invaluable. I doubt if
ever a ship-borne aircraft has been used to such
good purpose as it was during this operation.
In addition the aircraft bombed and sank an
enemy submarine.

72. Apart from the effective fire developed
by WARSPITE her presence undoubtedly gave
great confidence to our own destroyers and put
fear into the hearts of the enemy, who must
have realised that they were caught like rats in
a trap.

73. The precision and coolness with which
WARSPITE was handled during the approach,
and when both main and secondary armament
were engaging the enemy was typical of the
