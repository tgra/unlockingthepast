            "description": "Rommel now decided not to risk destruction by staying and ordered a further retreat. The withdrawal began, apparently, at about midday on the 16th December and was continued throughout the night. Fearing this develop-. ment, General Ritchie had already ordered a column of the Support Group to be sent to hold the cross roads at Carmusa which would make it difficult, if  not impossible, for the enemy to-hold Derma. This column  left in. the early hours of the 17th December and occupied Carmusa at about midday on the 18th. A far more substantial success might have been scored, however, if we had been able to cut the main road further east. The 7th Anmoured Division seemed to be in a position to do this with armoured cars, mobile columns and even the 4th Armoured Brigade, all of which were operating to the west of Gazala. But the difficult country to the south, which made the movement of, supply columns slow and on occasion impossible, prevented it. The Eighth Army now devoted all its energies to carrying out a relentless pursuit. ."

            "description": "The 4th Indian Division set out at once on the morning of the 17th December. The 7th Infantry Brigade on the southern flank travelled at great speed, and within twenty-four hours reached Carmusa where one of its battalions relieved the Support Group column which had been sent on ahead. Another battalion captured Martuba landing ground, and the third the aerodrome at Derna, where a number of aircraft were destroyed and much transport and many prisoners taken. The 5th Infantry Brigade, originally directed to advance on Martuba by a more northerly route, traversed very rough country all the way and fell behind considerably. As the country round Derna appeared to be falling into our hands without great trouble, the objective of the 5th Brigade was altered, and it was instructed to secure the cross-roads at Giovanni Berta and at Lamluda, so as to cut off any enemy remaining in the Derna region. By making a wide turning moverhent over country the enemy had believed impassable, the 5th Brigade reached Lamluda on the r9th December and took many prisoners there. Giovanni Berta proved more difficult to capture as the enemy had left a detachment to cover it, but by the evening of the zoth that place, too, was in our hands. Derna was occupied on the 19th December, and by the 2st the 4th Indian Division had overrun the whole of the country east of Appollonia, Cirene, and El Faidia. After offering some resistance, Barce was taken during the afternoon of the 23rd. Bengasi itself was taken by a detachment from the 7th Armoured Division. By December 26th all organised resistance in the Gebel Akhdar had ceased, and the 4th Indian Division became responsible for restoring law and order in the hill country up to Bengasi."

The difficulty of comibating the Japanese attacks on our aerodromes resulted on the 16th and 17th December in the evacuation and demolition of Butterworth, Taiping and Kuantan aerodromes, and our aircraft were forced further South. Ipoh, too, was now being bombed, and the aerodrome petrol dump was hit. . On land, the enemy, having advanced in Kelantan (as far as the Sungei Nal) and in Kedah, was now also attacking detachments of our troops in Perak round about the Grik area. The 3rd Indian Corps was accordingly authotised to withdraw behind the line of the Perak River to protect the communications of our forces North of Kuala Kangsar. The rth Indian Division began withdrawing from the line of the River Muda Southwards behind River Krian, linking up with the 28th Indian Infantry Brigade and protected all the time on the right flank by the z2th Indian Infantry Brigade. During this period the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders made counter-attacks with gallantry and skill. This withdrawal was carried out successfully, the enemy being repulsed with loss at his first attempt to cross the river."

By the 16th December, some ten warships had been sighted in company with a tanker off Miri and Lutong, and these ships became the object of our attacks. On the 17th December, 6 Glenn Martins and 5 Buffaloes of the Netherlands East Indies Air Force delivered an attack from Sinkawang, but scored neither hits nor near misses. The same day, Dutch bombers from Samiuwkoa located and attacked this force, a Dutch navy Dornier scoring a direct hit on a destroyer. Encounters between Dutch Buffaloes and the Navy Zero fighters revealed the clear superiority of the Japanese aircraft. Reports of a Japanese landing at Lutong and Baram Point were received, and on the 18th December renewed attacks on enemy shipping in this area were made, without success, by a mixed force. Eight Glenn Martins from Sinkawang had to return without delivering their attack owing to the bad weather, The following day 6 Netherlands East Indies Glen Martins claimed a  hit on a cruiser and some near misses. The roth December, however, was also marked by Japanese air attacks, Kuching aerodrome and town being bombed by about 15 heavy bombers and one seaplane. Civilians suffered approximately 100 casualties, while the main material damage was the destruction of the Borneo Company Benzine Stores, The air war was also carried to Dutch Territory by a heavy attack on Pontianak, much of the city  being destroyed."

General Stilwell was anxious, in spite of the administrative difficulties, to secure as much of northern Burma as possible, in order to cover the construction of a road from Ledo by Myitkyina to Paoshan to join the Burma Road, and also to secure the airfield at Myitkyina. The construction of the Ledo-Myitkyina road had now been undertaken iby the Americans. It was agreed that all preparations should be continued with the object of an advance into Upper Burma from Yunnan (Chinese force), Ledo (Chinese Corps from Ramgarh) and Manipur (British IV Corps), to begin on the rst March if the progress of road-making and administrative situation permitted."

Asiatics serving in the Volunteers were given the option of being evacuated or of staying. The majority decided to stay to protect their families.

It was reinforced by two platoons of the Perak Battalion F M.S.V.F. It now became clear that the enemy had directed the main body of his Patani Force down this road, difficult as it was for wheeled transport, and was endeavouring to cut off the 11 Indian Division by reaching the main road at Kuala Kangsar. Indeed, reports from Japanese sources have subsequently indicated that this was a strong attack and that their grand strategy was to cut off and annihilate the whole of the troops in Kedah and Province Wellesley."
