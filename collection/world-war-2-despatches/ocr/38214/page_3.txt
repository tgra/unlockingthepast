1g. When information was received at Singa-
pore at 1204 that Force Z was being attacked
by aircraft, the fighter squadron which was
standing by at Kallang was immediately des-
patched. Six Buffaloes took off at 1215 and
armived on the scene of action just as, the
PRINCE OF WALES was sinking and when
all enemy aircraft had taken their departure.

Destroyers, having made a thorough search
for survivors, returned to Singapore, arriving
between 2310 and 2400.

20. Japanese aircraft.

(2) The T/Bs were twin engined mono-
planes (Naval type 96) and it is probable that
H.L.B.s were the same, ‘viz. shore-based
aircraft.

(6) Four T/B squadrons each of 9 aircraft
were used. Three H.L.B. attacks were made,
possibly all by the same squadron.

{c) Torpedoes were dropped at ranges be-
tween 1,000 and 2,000 yards and at a height
noticeably greater than we do. Torpedoes
Tan very straight and the tracks were readily
visible. There 1s no indication that the pistols
were other than contact.

(d) The get-aways appeared clumsy, doubt-
less partly due to the heavy aircraft. In
many cases they contmued across the line
of advance quite close to their targets Some
opened fire with their machine guns.

(e) No attempt was made to interfere with
the rescue of survivors.
