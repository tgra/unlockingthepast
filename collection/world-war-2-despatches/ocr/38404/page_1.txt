AIR OPERATIONS BY FIGHTER COMMAND FROM 25th NOVEMBER
1940 TO 31st DECEMBER 1941

The following report was submitied to the
Secretary of State for Air on 2oth February,
1948, by Marshal of the Royal Aw Force Sw
Sholto Douglas, G.C.B., M.C., D.F.C. (now
Lord Douglas of Krrtleside), former Air
Officer Commanding-n-Chuef, Fighter Com-
mand, Royal Air Force

Part I: OPERATIONS.

Night Operations.

(a) The Situation on 1st November, 1940

1. At the beginning of November, 1940, the
most urgent problem confronting the air defences
was that presented by the night bomber. For the
first ten months of the war the Luftwaffe had
undertaken only minor operations against this
country; but in June, 1940, the enemy began
a series of small-scale night attacks on ports
and industrial towns. During the next two
months, while the daylight battle of Britain
was being fought, this night offensive gathered
momentum. On September 7th London be-
came its main objective, and the scale of attack
increased once more. By the end of October
the night offensive had become in many re-
spects a bigger threat to the kingdom than the
day offensive, which, for the moment at least,
had been successfully beaten off.

2. At that stage London had been raided on
every night but one for the last eight weeks.
On every night bit four during those eight
weeks at least a hundred tons of bombs had
fallen on or around the Capital; Coventry,
Birmingham and Liverpool had all suffered
attacks of some weight. So far no intolerable
harm had been done to industry or the public
temper, although many people had been killed
and much material loss and hardship had been
caused. But there was every reason to ex-
pect that the attacks would continue and per-
haps grow heavier; for during the last two
months the defences had claimed the destruc-
tion of only 79 night bombersâ€”a number

equivalent to about a half of one per cent. of
the number of night sorties that the Germans
were believed to have flown in that time.
Obviously, losses of this order were not likely
to act as a deterrent.

3. The directive by which I found myself
bound when I assumed command on 25th
November, 1940, required me to give priority
to the defence of the aircraft industry. No
formal variation of this directive was needed
to make it clear that the defeat of the night
bomber must be one of my main tasks.

4. It would be wrong to give the impression
that hitherto this problem had been ignored.
On the contrary, it had long been foreseen that
if the enemy found day attacks too expensive,
he would probably turn -to night bombing on a
substantial scale. But with limited resources
it had-been necessary to place the emphasis
on high-performance, single-seater fighters
capable of defeating the enemy by day. Before
the war, and in the early stages of the war
it was hoped that, with the help of searchlights,
these aircraft would also be effective at night.

5. This hope had proved vain. Except at the
beginning of the night offensive, when the
enemy flew at 12,000 feet or lower, the search-
lights were incapable of doing what was re-
quired of them This was partly because they
telied on sound locators, which were unsuited
to modern conditions, and partly because very
often cloud or moonlight prevented pilots from
seeing the searchlight beams at the height at
which they had to fly.

6 A method of night interception which did
not rely on searchlights had been under de-
velopment (although not continuously) since
1936. This method rested upon the installation
in twin-engined, multi-seater aircraft of the
radar equipment known as AI. .

7. On November Ist, 1940, the Command had
Possessed six squadrons of aircraft fitted with
this equipment All were Blenheim Squadrons,
