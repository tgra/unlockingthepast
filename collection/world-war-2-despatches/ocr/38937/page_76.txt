2954

The consequences of this policy were ex-
pounded in a letter to both Army Commanders
dated roth October. For the reasons given
the offensive must be continued, but it was
already necessary to plan ahead and consider
the question of when to call a halt; that it
would be necessary to call a halt was deduced
from the fact that there was no certainty’ of
the war against Germany ending in 1944 and
that a major offensive in 1945 would therefore
be necessary. In order to meet that require-
ment it was vital, in view of the close approxi-
mation of the opposing strengths, to make a
pause at some time to rest, reorganize and
train our own troops. During this pause
Eighth Army was to plan, and prepare to carry
out, operations across the Adnatic. If north-
west Italy were cleared it would be occupied
by a British District Headquarters with one
division under command (6 South African
Armoured Division was tentatively nominated).
The conclusions drawn were: that active
operations with all available forces should con-
tinue as long as the state of our own troops and
the weather permitted in the hope that by then
we should have at least succeeded in driving
the enemy back to the general line of the
Adige and the Alps and in clearing up north-
western Italy. Secondly, when full-scale
operations ceased, there should be a period
of active defence during which the minimum
forces would be committed against the enemy
and the maximum attention paid to the rest,
teorganisation and training of all formations in
preparation for a renewal of the offensive as
soon as the weather should permit.

This aoa was brought up to date
on 23rd October in a further letter to Fifth
and Eighth Armies. In this, operations in
Jugoslavia were brought more into the fore-
ground for the major réle in the proposed
spring offensive and the question of when to
halt the offensive in Italy was more closely
studied. Between roth and 23rd October the
fiercest fighting on Fifth Army front had left
us still short of Bologna, the exhaustion of our
troops had increased and the lack of replace-
ments, both British and American, had made
itself felt. In this second paper, therefore, it
was assumed that we were unlikely to have
driven, the enemy back to the line of the Adige
by the time that it became necessary to halt
the offensive; instead our immediate objectives
were limited to the capture of Bologna and
Ravenna. The plan proposed was that Eighth
Army should continue their offensive with all
available forces at least until 15th November
in order to capture Ravenna and, to draw off
the enemy from Fifth Army. The latter was
to go on to the defensive forthwith (this was
ordered on 27th October), withdraw forces
from the line to rest and prepare them for
one more offensive effort and then launch them
as secretly as. possible in a final attack on
Bologna. If this plan was unsuccessful, then
-we should have to accept the best winter
position that could be managed; Eighth Army
must endeavour, however, to capture Forli and
open Route 67 to improve lateral communica-
tions between the two Armies. I held a con-
ference at my Headquarters to discuss this
plan on 2gth October. The principles of the
plan were agreed to but I decided to advance
the date at which the offensive efforts of both
Armies must cease from 15th November to
15th December; Fifth Army’s final attempt to

capture Bologna was accordingly postponed
anil about ath November. Eighth Army was
to continue to attempt the capture of Ravenna
and should be in a position to launch an attack
with that object also by 30th November. I
laid down, however, that the offensives were
only to be launched if the weather was favour-
able and there appeared te be a good chance
of success.

A critical shortage of artillery ammunition
was among the other difficulties of this period.
To a force which relied so much on artillery,
the only effective superiority we possessed for
a campaign in an Italian winter, this was a
most serious matter, the more so as it was
not an isolated phenomenon but a world-wide
shortage both on the British and United States
side. It had naturally been aggravated by our
hea expenditure during the ‘“‘ Gothic”
line battles. The root cause, however, as I
was informed by a signal from the War Office
on 17th August, was a reduction in ammunition
production all over the Allied-controlled world.
This was a condition of affairs which could
not hastily be improved and, although I was
on 20th October authorized to draw on the
Supreme Allied Commander’s reserve up to
the full extent which the operational situation
might necessitate, there was a serious danger
that not only would current operations be
severely limited but there might not be suffic-
jient stocks on hand for the spring offensive.
I drew this conclusion in a letter to General
Wilson on 13th November: .

“* As far as I am.able to forecast I have
just enough British ammunition for the
current operations of Eighth Army and for
an all-out offensive in December lasting about
fifteen days. American ammunition is, how-
ever, only sufficient for about ten days in-
tensive fighting between now and the end of
the year. Deliveries in the first quarter of
1945 in the case of both British and American
types are so limited that it will be necessary
to exercise the strictest economy for several
months to build up large enough stocks to
sustain a full-scale offensive in 1945 ’’.

I have referred to plans for operations in
Jugoslavia as part of our p! ed spring offen-
sive and although the necessity for such opera-
tions did not arise the plans themselves are
of interest in illustrating the strategic problems
which faced us in the autumn of 1944. If
we were wholly successful in our attack on the

pennine positions we should be faced with
a situation resembling that of September, 1943,
before the German decision to stand south of
Rome: that is the enemy would be withdraw-
ing at his leisure to a prepared position in rear ~
and we should be unable to make him stand
in Italy. Just as in the preceding September,
therefore, I turned my eyes to the other side
of the Adriatic, where we could be certain of
bringing the Germans to battle on ground of
our choosing rather than theirs. From the point
of view of containing the maximum number of
German divisions, the line of the Apennines on
which the Germans found themselves in October
was the best suited to my purpose. Once driven
off that, amy other line they could stand on,
or at least any other line north of and in-
cluding the line of the Po, would require less
troops to hold. It was considered that, once
Bologna fell, the enemy would withdraw to a
line based op the rivers Po and Ticino, aban-
doning north-west Italy, and that he was not
