the one thought to be present penetrated further
than the northern Route Y. It may well be
that this U-Boat laid moored mines, which are
thought to have caused the loss of two A/S
trawlers.

8. AIR CO-OPERATION*

It is unnecessary to stress the vital necessity
for effective air co-operation in an operation of
this nature. Not only did German air effort
interrupt and reduce seaborne traffic, but it
also prevented embarkation by suspending
troop movement. To both Naval and Military
observers on the coast, the situation at times
was extremely disheartening. Rightly or
wrongly, full air protection was expected, but
instead, for hours on end the ships off shore

were subjected to a murderous hail of bombs
and machine gun bullets.

Required by their duty to remain offshore
waiting for the troops, who themselves were
unable to move down to the water for the
same reason, it required the greatest determina-
tion and sense of duty, amounting in fact to
heroism, on the part of the ships’ and boats’
crews, to enable them to complete their mission.

In their reports, the Commanding Officers of
many ships, while giving credit to the R.A.F.
personnel for gallantry in such combats as were
observed from the ships, at the same time ex-
press their sense of’ disappointment and sur-
prise at the seemingly puny efforts made to
provide air protection during the height of this
operation, though the gallantry of our out-
numbered airmen was the admiration of all.

Notes:

(x) It will be observed that the number of patrols decreased from 27th May onwards, whilst there was an
increase in the daily flying hours. This is due to the fact that the fighters were employed in increasingly bigger

patrols as the enemy air opposition increased.

(2) Operation “‘ Dynamo ”’ suffered most from enemy air effort on 29th May and on 1st June, after which
latter date the combination of enemy air attack and shore artillery fire led to the suspension of the operation

by day.

* Air Ministry footnote:

It was not to be expected that all air action would
be visible from points on the coast; many enemy
raids were in fact intercepted and enemy aircraft
destroyed. Moreover, fighter patrols formed only one
part of the air operations in connection with Dunkirk,
as a considerable reconnaissance and bombing effort
Sirectly connected with the operation was also being

6.

2. Air protection could not be complete for the
following reasons :— .

(a) the enemy air force had the initiative and
could choose the times of their attacks.

(b) the operations were outside the range of con-
trolled jataccepHon provided by radar stations in
the United gdom. In consequence, all that
could be done was to put up patrols and to trust
that these would intercept or generally discourage
enemy air attacks.

(c) the demand for continuous fighter cover, with
the limited size of our fighter force, meant that
patrols were necessarily weak in numbers of aircraft,
and our fighters were thus placed on disadvan-
tageous terms with the enemy. When evacuation
was eventually limited to the dusk and dawn hours
it was possible to concentrate our fighters in much
greater strength for these periods, with a corre-
sponding improvement in the cover provided.

3. Only in conditions of complete air supremacy
could the Dunkirk evacuation have been completed
without interference from the enemy. Such air
supremacy could only have been attained by pro-
longed previous air operations or by the local con-
centration of a far greater force of fighters than the
R.A.F. then had.

Aa

ro. The position of enemy batteries had been
located by air reconnaissance by nightfall on
31st May, and additional batteries in the Grave-
lines area on the 1st June. Air »ombardment of
these batteries during the 1st and and June un-
doubtedly reduced their fire during dusk and
dawn on each of the nights 2nd/3rd June and
3rd /4th June, when seaborne traffic was passing
within range of the enemy batteries command-
ing the south end of X Route, the Dunkirk
Roads and Dunkirk Harbour. This was a valu-
able ¢ontribution by the R.A.F to the success-
ful outcome of the operation. A similar benefi-
cial result was obtained by the bombing of the
batteries which had Dunkirk Pier and roadstead
under fire.

IX. CONTROL oF ALLIED TROOPS.

In the earlier stages the large number of
British troops located in the dunes off the beach
were of rear formations with few officers. There
was little control over these mixed units, aggra-
vated no doubt by the fact that Army Officers’
uniform is indistinguishable from that of other
ranks which makes the presence of an Army
Officer difficult to recognise by troops other than
those under their own Commands. The appear-
ance of Naval Officers, in their unmistakable
uniforms, helped to restore order and the troops
responded to commands in a disciplined manner.
In the early stages, in the absence of anv Army
