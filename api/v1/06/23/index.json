            "description": "force being cut off, the. 4th Armoured Brigade was given the: order to retire to the southern flank of.the Matruh position, where it came under the command of the 1st Armoured Divi- sion, Thexzaznd Armoured Brigade had already been withdrawn, so that by the 23rd June the columns of the two motor brigades above the escarpment, and of the 69th Infantry Brigade below it, were the only troops remaining in contact with the enemy. : F \u2018Meanwhile changes had been made in the arrangements for fighting a decisive battle round Matruh. On the 22nd June it was decided that the New Zealand Division was more suitable for a mobile role than the roth Indian Division, and orders were issued for it to pass to the com- mand of the 13th Corps as soon as the roth Indian Division arrived from the frontier. There was a great shortage of field artillery, and, as a disproportionate amount of infantry were likely to prove an encumbrance, instruc- tions were-given for the infantry divisions, or what remained of them, \u2018to be organised\u2019 into battle groups. These battle groups had as their foundation the maximum number of field guns that could be provided for each, and only just as many infantry as were needed to protect them. \u2018The idea was that in this way the defence could be kept mobile, the battle groups being moved rapidly to that part of the front where the danger was greatest. Moreover, these groups, being comparatively weak in infantry, were not encumbered with large numbers of vehicles and could therefore .be. used in the closest co-operation with the armour. I visited Eighth Army: Headquarters on the 22nd June and confirmed these arrangements,"

My first Despatch* covered the period from the formation of 11 Army Group, 16th November, 1943, to the re-opening of the Kohima - Imphal road on the 22nd June, 1944, when at 1245 hours, at Milestone 109, the lead- ing troops of the 2 British Division (33 Corps) met the forward troops of 5 Indian Division (4 Corps), and thus shattered the Japanese dream of conquering India. This Despatch describes the operations from the 23rd June, 1944, to the 12th November, 1944, when I handdd over command of 11 Army Group to Lieuti-General Sir Oliver Leese."

            "description": "So far I had been conducting operations on the assumption that the forces which had been withdrawn provisionally for ANVIL, or which were still to be withdrawn, might yet be re- turned to my command for the exploitation of the Italian campaign if the decision went against ANVIL. As the time lengthened during which that decision hung in the balance it be- came urgent to plam what could be done with the forces available on either hypothesis, I therefore called a conference of my Army Com- manders on 23th June and explained what my plans would be if I were assured the same forces as at present. The object of operations in Italy must be to invade southern Germany by an overland advance through north-eastern Italy and the Ljubljana gap. By this means we should strike directly at territory which it was vital for the Germans to defend, even at the cost of diverting strength from other fronts, and have the possibility of joining hands with the southern wing of the Red Army and with Marshal Tito\u2019s partisan forces. The alternative,. an advance into Southern France across the Maritime Alps, would be less profitable and more difficult. I appreciated that the enemy intended to hold the Northern Apennines until driven from that position in overwhelming force but, with the troops then available to him, he would be unable to do so and would be risking certain disaster, provided we could bring our whole strength against him. Coming down to tactical details, I considered that the \u2018* Gothic \u2019\u2019 line should be attacked in the centre both for topographical reasons, which I shall discuss later, and because that would-lead most directly to the important objectives in Northern Italy. The conference agreed to the plan as outlined but took note that if ANVIL were launched it would not be practical. In particu- lar the administrative organisation of the Allied Armies in Italy would be \u2018\u2018 hamstrung \u2019\u2019, in General Robertson\u2019s expression. General Clark also made the point about the bad effect of the present state of indecision on the morale and efficiency of the troops now engaged."

            "description": "The shipping resources available were, as ever, strictly limited, and it was decided that the assault should be carried out by a Corps. 34 Corps, formed in embryo in India for the Phuket operation under Lieut.-General O. L. Roberts (see para. 94) was therefore allotted to the new task of undertaking operation Zipper. General Roberts and the Naval and Air Force Commanders examined the prob- lem, and. produced by the 23rd June an appre- ciation and outline plan. They divided the operation into three phases ; the securing of the bridgehead, the advance to the Johore Cause- way and the assault on Singapore. The last phase was Mailfist, and the two projects were combined into one."
