On the afternoon of 23rd May the atmo- spheric conditions in the Denmark Strait were unusual, being clear over and close to the ice, and misty between the ice and the land. SUFFOLK took advantage of this to move further to the eastward across the top of the minefield than would otherwise have been prudent and kept close to the edge of the mist so as to have cover handy if the BISMARCK were sighted at close range. NORFOLK patrolled 15 miles on the beam of SUFFOLK\u2019s patrol."

The War Establishment of Fifteenth Army Group initially approved included the Administrative Staffs of all Services and departments, but was not im- plernented in full, only those officers immediately required for planning being appointed.. It was later decided that these Services and depart- ments would not be required until the allied forces had been established on the mainland of Italy and that for the Sicilian campaign HO Fifteenth Army Group would only fulfil the function of operational command and co- ordination as HQ Eighteenth Army Group had. done during the Tunisian campaign."

It was clear that Frankforce was becoming dangerously hemmed in. Two roads were still available for their extrication and at about 7 p.m. I decided that there was no alternative but to withdraw Frankforce. This withdrawal had necessarily to -be in an easterly direction. 5th and soth Divisions had been engaged with the enemy all day and had inflicted very severe losses; they were now ordered to withdraw to the area around Seclin, where they would be well placed to take part in any further counter-attack to the southward which might be staged. Petre- force was withdrawn to an area north of Seclin."
