            "date": "6th October",
            "description": "28. The Military situation, stabilised on D+6, 15th September, gradually improved; indications of a general German withdrawal were seen on D+7. On 19th September, Eboli and, on 20th, Campagna and several other towns in the vicinity were captured. Five days later the port of Salerno was reopened, followed quickly by the capture of Castellammare on 28th and of Torre Annunziata the next day. Naples was entered on lst October and with its capture, Operation   Avalanche   drew to a close. The port of Naples had been carefully and methodically wrecked by the withdrawing enemy, but even so, two days later five Liberty ship berths, six coaster berths and eight holding berths were cleared. By the 6th October discharge over the Salerno beaches was almost completed, the port of Naples was functioning slowly, and on that day Operation   Avalanche  was officially deemed to have been completed."

            "date": "6th October",
            "description": "To conceal -the reinforcement of 30 Corps careful calculations were made to determine what the area would look hike from the air immediately before the battle; the same picture was then reproduced by ist October by disposing transport in the areas which would be occupied on 23rd October. Dummy lorries were erected in the areas which would be occupied by the artillery regiments so that the guns and limbers could be moved in by night and concealed under the dummies. The additional dumps were elaborately camouflaged, for.which purpose the hummocky area near El Imayid station was well adapted. The new tracks could-not be concealed, and they were the most revealing indications of our purpose. The only solution which offered itself was to delay until the last the completion of those parts of them which would be most sigmficant to the enemy. In the 13 Corps sector the intended concentrations of artillery were first represented by dummy guns which were later replaced by teal guns Most elaborate measures were taken to conceal the movement of ro Corps. The two assembly areas were filled by about 6th October with approximately two thousand vehicles in each with over seven hundred dummy vehicles to be placed over the tanks of the three armoured brigades. The Corps moved from its training area to two staging areas on I9th October; these moves were carned out openly as training moves. From the staging areas to the assembly areas the moves were made largely by night and all tanks and guns moved entirely by night. As units moved out of the staging areas they were replaced by dummy tanks, some mobile and some static, dummy guns and transport and by over two thousand real motor vehicles."

            "description": "117. Whether X.10 could have been brought into port is doubtful. The expected gale did not materialise until the 6th October, Even so, at the slow speed at which X.10 had to be towed, STUBBORN could not have arrived at Lerwick by that time. The loss of X.r0, after all she had done and all the efforts to bring her safely home, is very much regretted however."

            "date": "6th October",
            "description": "128. At some time between  2000/27 and 0030/28, HERMIONE lost her port paravane. From the state of the end of the wire recovered there is little doubt that it was cut by an explosive cutter or other anti-sweep device. The route followed was identical with that taken by HERMIONE during Operation   Substance , on which occasion the starboard paravane towing wire when recovered at Malta was severely crippled and showed signs of having fouled a mine mooring. It therefore appears possible that a minefield exists on the Talbot Bank, the depth there being considerably less than too fathoms. This occurrence was reported in my message 0931 of 6th October."
