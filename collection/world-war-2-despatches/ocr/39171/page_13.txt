SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951

and the toll taken by disease, from which, on
their own admission, they suffered severely.
The total Japanese casualties on this front,
after they crossed the Chindwin in March up
till the middle of June, may safely be put at
not less than 30,000. Against this, our own
losses in killed, wounded and missing, from the
4th March to the -17th June totalled 12,525,
of whom only 2,669 were killed. We captured
a large amount of equipment, including nearly
100 guns,

97. The results achieved had been due to the
determination and skill shown by all Com-
manders in surmounting difficulties and the fine
fighting spirit displayed by the troops who had
shown a marked superiority over the Japanese.
4 Corps was entirely dependent on supplies
brought in by air and in spite of the splendid
work of Air Transport Command, which is
mentioned later in this Despatch, there were
occasions when our stocks of ammunition ran
dangerously low. Rations too had to be cut
although the numbers of mouths to be fed had
been greatly reduced by the movement out of
Imphal, by road, before the Japanese cut it,
and subsequently by air, of every man whose
presence was unnecessary. In spite of these
handicaps the spirit of 4 Corps remained as
high as ever and officers and men fought
splendidly throughout the long battle. This,
coupled with the determination and vigour dis-
played by 33 Corps, led, in the words of the
Supreme Allied Commander, to the Japanese
Army suffering a defeat greater than ever
before in its history.

Fort Hertz.

98. This isolated outpost, in the extreme
north of Burma, was originally occupied by a
‘small detachment in September 1942, in order
to protect the landing ground and to raise and
support Kachin Levies to operate towards
Myitkyina. These Levies have carried out
many very successful operations and, indeed, at
one time, became such a thorn in the side of
the enemy that the Japanese made a direct
threat against Fort Hertz. To counter this,
the 4th Battalion, The Burma Regiment was
are there from India at the end of November

99. In November 1943, the Americans agreed
to maintain the Fort Hertz garrison by air, as
there was no road link with India. Command
of this detachment was transferred to General
Stilwell in February 1944,

100. These troops, including the Levies, after
many skirmishes, subsequently made a steady
advance down the Mali Hka Valley (which con-
stitutes the headwaters of the Irrawaddy), in
conjunction with General Stilwell’s forces
moving south from Ledo. They did most use-
ful work, inflicting many casualties on small
enemy parties, and by the 19th March they had
occupied Sumprabum: From the beginning of
June they co-operated with the Chinese-
American troops in the Myitkyina area.

Northern Burma-Ledo-Myitkyina.

101. The réle allotted to the Chinese troops
which were under the command of General
Stilwell in India, in January, was to advance
on Mogaung and Myitkyina with the object
of covering the construction of an overland

1361

route to China via Ledo and Myitkyina and of
securing the air route from Assam to China.
This force, known originally as the Chinese
Army in India (C.A.1_), which had been trained
with the help of American officers and
equipped with American material, comprised
initially 22 and 38 Chinese Divisions, and was
joined later by 30 Chinese Division. These
three divisions were subsequently reinforced
by 50 and 14 Chinese Divisions, which were
flown from China in April and May respec-
tively. The force was completed by the addi-
tion of U.S. 5307 Provisional Regiment, con-
sisting of three battalions of Long-Range
Penetration troops which had trained with
Major-General Wingate’s Special Force in
India and were now being used as medium-
range penetration battalions. Known officially
by the code name “Galahad Force”, they
were more usually referred to—after the name
of their commander—as Merrill’s Marauders.

102. General Stilwell, the Deputy Supreme
Allied Commander, South-East Asia Com-
mand, personally assumed command of these
troops in the Field. They never formed part
of my Army Group, but General Stilwell
agreed, until C.AJ. forces had captured
Kamaing, to accept instructions from General
Slim, who was, of course, under my command.

103. On the 17th May, C.A.I. had reached
the outskirts of Myitkyina and captured the
airfield, Galahad Force having contributed
much to this very notable advance. Kamaing
was captured on the 16th June and Mogaung
invested. The situation in the Mogaung Valley
on the 22nd June was that the Japanese in
the Kamaing area were being forced into the
southern end of the valley; while Special
Force was attacking their supply lines in the
area north of Indaw. Special Force also had
a detachment, known as “ Morrisforce”,
blocking the Myitkyina—Bhamo road.

104. Supply of all forces was largely by air,
as owing to the weather the construction of
the Ledo Road did not keep pace with the
advance of the troops.

Special Force.

105. I have already mentioned Special
Force. This Force consisted of six Long-
Range Penetration Brigades, which were
specially selected, trained, organised and
equipped by the late Major-General Wingate
to give them the maximum mobility in jungle
fighting. The plan was to concentrate this
Force within a circle of forty miles radius from
Indaw, with the objects of :—

(@) Assisting the advance of the Chinese-
American forces on Myitkyina by drawing
off and harassing the Japanese forces op-
posing them, and by preventing reinforce-
ments reaching them.

(b) Creating a situation which would en-
able the Chinese forces to advance from
‘Yunnan.

(c) Causing confusion, damage and loss to
the enemy forces in North Burma.

I hoped that General Wingate’s operations
might also interfere with the Japanese advance
against Imphal.

106. The operations of both Special Force
and the Sino-American forces moving south
from Ledo were co-ordinated by the Com-
mander, Fourteenth Army.
