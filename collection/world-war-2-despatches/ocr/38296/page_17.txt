SUPPLEMENT 1o tae LONDON GAZETTE, 24 MAY, 1948

44. During the passage to Sphakia, C.S.15’s
force was attacked by aircraft on three occa-
sions between 1825/31st May and 1905/3Ist
May. None of the bombs fell very close and
it was believed that one JU.88 was damaged.
Many bombs were seen to’ be jettisoned on the
horizon, indicating successful combats by our
fighter aircraft,

45. .C.S.15 arrived at Sphakia at 2320/ 31st.
ee fully loaded M.L.C.s which had been left
behind from the previous evacuation, imme-
tely went alongside the ships, thus saving a
cece 40.minutes.* The embarkation pro-
led so quickly that for a time the beach was

empty of troops. This was unfortunate, as it

caused a last minute rush. of troops, some of .

whom had necessarily to be left behind.

46. Some medical stores were landed by the
ships and finally the three M.L.C.s were sunk
or disabled. The force sailed at 0300 on -the
Ist June, having embarked nearly 4,000 troops.

47. During the night 3rst May/1st June,
Major Gencral Weston, acting on instructions
from the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East,
embarked in a Sunderland flying boat at
Sphakia and returned to Egypt.

48. Before leaving Sphakia, General Weston
handed written orders to the Senior British
Army Officer remaining behind, to come to
‘ernie with the enemy. Among those left
behind were many who had taken ina
gallant rearguard action, which had enabled
others to get away from the island. Included
in the rearguard, who were left behind, were
a large number of the Special Service Troops
landed as a final reinforcement at Suda and
many Royal Marines of the M.N.B.D.O. Of
the 2,000 Royal Marines employed in Crete,
only 1,000 got back to Egypt. .

49. In order to provide additional pro-
tection to C.S. 15’s force, the A.A. cruisers
CALCUITA and COVENTRY were sailed
from Alexandria early on the rst June to
rendezvous with the returning ships.” At ogoo
aircraft were detected by R.D.F. approaching
from the north, and at og17 the ships hoisted
the red warning. It was unfortunate that an
‘*up sun’? barrage was not then fired as five
minutes later two JU. 88s dived on the cruisers
from the direction of the sun. A stick of
bombs from the first machine just missed
COVENTRY but two bombs from the second
machine hit CALCUTTA, who settled fast and
sank within a few minutes. COVENTRY was
able to pick up 23 officers and 232 men with
whom she at once returned to Alexandria.

50. The force with CS. 15 had an unevent-
ful passage to Alexandria where they arrived
‘at 1700 on the rst June.

51..In the early hours of the rst June the
Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, received
a message from the First Sea Lord, stating that
if there was a reasonable prospect of embarking
any substantially formed body of men on the
night xst/2nd June he thought the attempt
The Commander-in-Chief,
Mediterranean, replied that General Weston had
returned with the report that the 5,000 troops ©
remaining in Crete were incapable of further
resistance owing to strain and lack of food.
The troops had, therefore, been instructed to
capitulate. In the circumstances, no more
ships would be sent.

52. The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean,
later sent a subsequent message to the Ad-
miralty in which he pointed out that the only
ships available for an evacuation on the night
ist/and June were two battleships and five
destroyers. The remaining ships were either
damaged or too slow. Fighter protection for
the ‘ships was thin and irregular... In view of
the situation developing in ‘the Western Desert
and Syria any further reduction in the strength
of the fleet was out of. the question.

53- The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean,
informed the Admiralty that with C.S. 15’s
arrival, the evacuation had terminated. He
drew attention to the fact that owing to the
inevitable confusion, the figures given to him
for evacuation varied very greatly. Up to
late on the 30th May, he had hoped that the
last trip, that of C.S. 15, would result in
almost everyone being brought off. The
figures, however, suddenly increased by 5,000
on that day.

54. The Battle of Crete was now ended, and
the Mediterranean Fleet could claim to have
played a worthy part. The Royal Air Force
had given what little protection was possible
to the fleet; operating their aircraft far out to
sea to the limit of their endurance. Whilst
the land fighting was in progress, the fleet had
landed reinforcements for the Army and had
prevented any seaborne invasion from taking
place. When orders were given for the troops
to be withdrawn, some 17,000 British and
Imperial troops were brought safely back to
Egypt and provisions and stores were landed
for those who had to bé left behind. The
Royal Marines, after manning the island’s
defences, fought gallantly with the rearguard
and had to leave half their number behind.
The Mediterranean Fleet paid a heavy price for
this achievement. ‘Losses' and damage were
sustained which would normally only occur
during a major fleet action, in which the enemy
fleet might be expected to suffer greater losses
than our own. In this case'the enemy fleet
did not appear (though it had many favour-
able opportunities for doing so) and the battle
was fought between ships and aircraft.
