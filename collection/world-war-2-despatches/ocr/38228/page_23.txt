SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948

for this task. The arrival of reinforcements
now made it possible, however, for more effec-
tive steps to be taken, and on the 18th Febru-
ary, the Pegu Force was formed. This Force
consisted of the 1 W. Yorks, F.F.6 and de-
tachments of the Burma Military Police, and
was given the role of protecting Pegu from the
south east linking up with the 17 Division
at the Sittang Bridge. An armoured train was
provided to operate in the Delta area. A similar
organisation consisting of a company of the rst
Glosters, F.F.7 and some Military Police were
responsible for the approaches to Syriam from
the sea.

92. 7 Armouved Brigade. In anticipation
of the arrival of the 7 Armoured Brigade every
effort had been been made. to strengthen
bridges, and to convert railway bridges for the
passage of tanks in order to give them
as large an area in which to operate as possible.

All possible steps were also taken to ensure
that the disembarkation of the Brigade could
be carried out as quickly as possible after its
arrival, and that there would be no delay in
moving the units to their concentration areas.
It was obviously doubtful whether the Brigade
would be in time to assist in the defence of
the area east of the River Sittang, but the
Brigade arrived in Rangoon on the 21st and,
thanks to the excellent work of all concerned,
it was got forward in time to impose consider-
able delay on the enemy west of the River
Sittang and to relieve the pressure on the tired
troops in the Pegu area.

93 Bihn Position, It 1s now necessary to
turn back to the operations on the Front of the
17 Indian Division which was occupying the
Bilin position.

During the 8th the enemy definitely in-
creased his pressure against our troops and
succeeded in crossing the river to the south of
the village of Bilin.

In this area a counter attack was delivered
by the 48 Indian Infantry Brigade which,
while succeeding in holding up the enemy ad-
vance, did not succeed in pushing him back
over the river. Further to the north the
enemy were working round the flank of the 16
Indian Infantry Brigade. The 2 K.O.Y-L.I.
which had put in a gallant counter attack,
had suffered heavy casualties, but was holding
its own. It should also be mentioned that
on this date some very effective bombing was
carried out by the R.A.F. on enemy troops
south of the Bilin River. The night passed with
our troops in close contact with the enemy
along the north bank of the River.

On the 18th a wide turning movement was
initiated by 4/12 F.F.R. with the object of
attacking the enemy’s right flank. The opera-
tion achieved considerable success and heavy
fighting ensued. It left the Division, however,
without any reserves and weak along the
coast, The troops were becoming very weak
and exhausted. The enemy also established
himself in the rear of the right flank—presum-
ably by landing from the sea. In view of the
situation, I ordered up the 2 D.W.R., the
only unit I had in hand, to protect the rear of
the Division. .

94. Question of Withdrawal, During the
morning of the 19th I visited the Division. A
counter attack by 2/5 R.G.R. had not
altogether succeeded in driving the enemy out
of Thattkyon in rear of the right flank. The

1689

enemy was well established in the centre of the
position and there was every indication that
he was bringing up strong forces against the
left flank. The situation was, therefore, such
that there appeared to be grave risk of not
being able to disengage the troops unless a
further withdrawal was ordered.

In view of the strong position on the River
Sittang in rear, the anticipated arrival of re-
inforcements and especially tanks, a decision
‘to fight it out ’’ on the River Bilin had little
to recommend it. In view of subsequent events
there is little doubt that had the withdrawal
been further deferred the Division would have
been practically destroyed and Rangoon left
open to the enemy. -

I, therefore, told the Divisional Commander
to make all necessary preparation for with-
drawal and to judge for himself when the
necessity for doing so had arrived. Subsequent
orders were issued to the effect that all trans-
port should be got across the River Sittang
at an early stage of the withdrawal, and that
the 2 D.W.R. should be sent back to guard
the bridgehead as early as possible. I myself
had personally ordered the retention of one
company at that place, in view of the weak-
ness of the garrison.

On 18th February, I’ sent to A.B.D.A. Com-
mand and the War Office an appreciation which
after referring to the severe check that
had been inflicted on the enemy on the
Bilin River indicated that if, as appeared
probable, he was able to renew his
attack with fresh troops, it might not
be possible to continue to hold the position.
It also pointed out that if the battle went
badly, the enemy might succeed in crossing the
River Sittang- without much difficulty which
would render the evacuation of Rangoon an
imminent possibility. After reviewing the
meagre resources of troops available, and
future reinforcements, it is stated that prob-
ably the best that could be hoped for was that
it would be possible to hold up the enemy on
the line of the River Sittang. This would, how-
ever, involve an immediate threat to the main
road and railway from Rangoon to Mandalay
which was the main route of supply of China
and for the evacuation of civilians, stores and
base installations from Rangoon. After refer-
ring to the difficult problem of whether to start
evacuation of non-essential personnel at once,
with its obviously bad effect on morale, or risk
congestion and confusion at a later stage, it con-
cluded by stating that five divisions in all were
essential to the defence of Burma of which
two would be required for the defence of the
River Sittang. It expressed doubts, however,
as to whether sufficient troops could arrive in
time to save Rangoon and said that unless they
could do so more quickly than was at the time
visualised, the risk of losing Rangoon within
the next few weeks was considerable. The
accuracy of this was very fully borne out by
events. On the 2oth February, after the de-
cision to withdraw to the River Sittang, a
further telegram was sent which, after describ-
ing the condition of the troops, dealt in some
detail with the necessity for taking preliminary
measures for the evacuation of Rangoon. It
stated that after consultation with the Governor
and Combined Commanders, it had been de-
cided to commence certain measures under the
evacuation scheme which would not, however,
