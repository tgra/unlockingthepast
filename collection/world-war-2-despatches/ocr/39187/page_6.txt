35. The second phase of these operations,
which took place concurrently with the first
phase which I have already described, was
the advance of 20 Indian Division along the
Imphal - Ukhrul road to join the forces about
Ukhrul and sever all possible lines of escape
of the enemy. Like the first phase, the period
was one of great activity, and much fierce
fighting. A Japanese force some 2,000 strong
had been isolated and was trying to escape to
the south-west. Bitter fighting developed
between a desperate enemy trying to fight his
way out of the net thrown round him and
troops equally determined to hold him. Very
heavy casualties were inflicted, but our losses
were not light. The enemy’s forces were
gradually compressed into a small area and
20 Indian Division made contact with 7 Indian
Division on the 11th July.

36. On the 17th July, 20 Indian Division
was withdrawn from the Ukhrul sector after
destroying the remnant, about 300 strong, of
this Japanese force and capturing all its guns
-and transport. The Division was now con-
centrated to rest and refit about Wanjing, 16
miles south-east of Imphal, where it could, if
necessary, easily move in either direction and
act as a reserve to 23 Indian Division on the
Tamu road or to 5 and 17 Indian Divisions
about Bishenpur. 50 Indian Parachute Brigade
(two battalions) which had been operating
most successfully on the flank of 20 Indian
Division across the tracks running south from
the Imphal - Ukhrul road, was similarly with-
drawn for rest and re-organization in India.

37. The operations of 23 L.R.P. Brigade,
which belonged to Special Force (Long-Range
Penetration troops), but which had not been
flown into North Burma with that formation
in March, deserve special mention. In their
advance south from Kharasom to the Ukhrul
area, they operated in eight small columns
across exceptionally difficult country and
inflicted severe casualties on 31 Japanese
Division retreating from Kohima. Four of
these columns, advancing from the north, co-
ordinated their movements with those of 7
Indian Division on Ukhrul from the west.
The other four columns moved to the east
and south-east of Ukhrul to cut the enemy’s
communications.

By the 11th July, all tracks leading east
towards Homalin on the Chindwin had been
blocked and many enemy destroyed, our own
casualties being negligible. In the third week
in July, 23 L.R.P. Brigade was concentrated
at Ukhrul before being withdrawn to India.

38. 23 Indian Division—Tamu Sector. By
the middle of July, the enemy had been
driven from the area, and the
operations ended with the complete rout of
the Japanese, who retreated down the tracks
to Humaine and Tamu abandoning guns and
lorries and leaving many dead. With the
withdrawal of 20 Indian Division and 23
LRP. Brigade, interest switched to the Tamu
sector where 23 Indian Division was engaged
in driving the enemy from his strongly pre-
pared positions east and south-east of Palel.

For some time past, the enemy had been
active in this sector, but his counter-attack
failed to make any headway. His only success
was early -in the month when a small raiding
party reached the Palel airstrip at night and
damaged three aircraft. By the middle of

SUPPLEMENT To tas LONDON GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 1951

July, however, he had lost the initiative and
was being driven back. The fact that over
100 Japanese were taken prisoner in one week
was some evidence of decreasing morale.

39. The opening of 23 Indian Division’s
offensive down the Tamu road in the middle
of July began another phase of the campaign
to drive the Japanese forces across the
Chindwin. The situation on the 24th July
was that one brigade, after making a wide
turning movement via the Sibong track, had
outflanked the enemy’s positions, established
blocks on the Tamu road south of Sibong and
in the Lokchao bridge area, and achieved com-
plete surprise. The enemy was thus caught
between these blocks and the two brigades
advancing on them from the north which, on
that date, had captured the strong Japanese
positions at Tengnoupal after severe fighting.
The enemy’s defence in this area disintegrated
and they withdrew, abandoning much heavy
equipment, including some guns. By the 25th,
we had cleared an enemy block at Milestone
49 and were exploiting to the south-east.

40. 23 Indian Division continued its
advance down the Palel-Tamu road sup-
ported by tanks, over-running successive enemy
positions and capturing nine guns. 268 Indian
Lorried Infantry Brigade, an independent
formation, operating north of the road, pro-
tected the left flank of 23 Indian Division.
Enemy casualties in the last week of July had
been heavy and his stubborn resistance had
been fruitless.

41. On the 31st July, 33 Corps assumed com-
mand of 5 and 17 Indian Divisions and took
over responsibility for the Tiddim road sector.
On the Ist August, Headquarters, 4 Corps,
was withdrawn to India for rest and training
in mobile operations.

Summary of Operations in July.

42. Arakan. Apart from local patrolling in
typical monsoon weather, there was no activity
on either side.

43. Chin Hills and Chindwin. Our troops
continued to press the Japanese withdrawal : —

In the Ukhrul sector, the enemy were
driven back to a point 18 miles south of

Ukhrul.

In the Palel area, 23 Indian Division
reached a point five miles north-west of
Tamu.

On the Imphal-Tiddim road, 5 Indian
Division reached the area 21 miles south
of Bishenpur, capturing a number of guns,
tanks and armoured cars in this advance.
44. The general situation at the end of July

was that the Japanese were still retiring and
it seemed likely they might decide to hold
the line Tiddim-Kalewa and northwards,
along the Chindwin River, for the rest of the
monsoon. Rain continued to hamper our
operations, floods and continual landslides
impeding our progress and breaking our
communications.

45. North Burma. Operations against
Myitkyina had continued. 77 L.R.P. Brigade
(Special Force) which had been operating
under General Stilwell’s command in the
Mogaung area, and some columns of
111 L.R.P. Brigade, had been withdrawn
to India by air. On the 19th July, 14 L.R.P.
Brigade captured Ngusharaung, an important
