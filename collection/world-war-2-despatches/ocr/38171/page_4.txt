16. It was considered that the submarine
sical did not warrant the risk of LORRAINE
taking part in Operation ‘‘ Jupiter,’ and
DUQUESNE and the pens, ‘only took
part. DUQUESNE had previously embarked
at Casablanca a full outfit of ammunition for
herself and replenishments for the destroyers,
and the assault on the Ile d’Oleron was carried
out on 30th April with the French ships bom-
barding gun batteries and other targets
throughout the day. Twenty-four L.C.V. (P)
were used as lift for assaulting troops and by
nightfall all the southern portion of the island
was in French hands, and only one of the
L.C.V. (P) was lost.

17. The subsequent clearance of the Gironde
and Garonne Rivers was carried out by French
naval units, assisted by the 31st Minesweeping
Flotilla and the 4th Minesweeping M.L.
Flotilla, all the naval units continuing under
the command of Commander Task Force 122.

Relief of the Channel Islands.

18. Plans for the occupation of the Channel
Islands after a German surrender, had been
started in June, 1944, under the code-name
“* Nestegg,”’ the operation being mounted from
Plymouth. Early in May, 1945, it seemed that
the capitulation of the German garrison in the
Channel Islands was imminent and on the 2nd
May the Supreme Commander asked for a

, British warship to be at 24 hours’ notice to
carry his representatives to accept the German

surrender. H.M.S. BULLDOG, escorted by
H.M.S. BEAGLE, escorted the Supreme Com-
mander’s representatives, headed by Brigadier
Snow, to St. Peterport on the 8th May and in
the early hours of the gth May the surrender
negotiations were completed on the Quarterdeck
of H.M.S. BULLDOG.

zg. On 8th May, the “‘ Nestegg ’’ convoy,
consisting of 3 L.S.T., zo L.C.T.*, mine-
Sweepers and suitable escort sailed from Ply-

mouth bringing occupational troops and food..

Half the convoy went to Jersey and half to
Guernsey and a detachment was later sent to
Alderney.

20. During the next few days some 22,000

“prisoners were evacuated from the Channel

“Islands in the same ships and craft and on ‘the

.

16th May naval responsibility for the Islands
passed from A.N.C.X.F. to the Admiralty.

The Relief of Holland. .

2z. The introduction of food supplies to Hol-
land, where by March, 1945, lack of essential
food-stuffs was causing both actual starvation
and an acute political problem, had long been
planned under the code-name “‘ Placket ”’. The
Commander-in-Chief, The Nore, and Flag
Officer, Holland, under A.N.C.X.F., ‘were
mainly responsible for the execution of this
Project which had to be planned for a variety
of circumstances. From the naval aspect, these

_ included the ferrying of food in minor landing

craft through the inland waterways, the open-
ing of a route from the Scheldt to Dordrecht by
which schuyts and barges could pass, the open-
ing of the main Dutch ports from seaward and
the landing of supplies over selected beaches
if the enemy concentrated his resistance in

“* fortresses ’’ commanding the ports. It was
always an essential condition that enemy resist-
ance must have ceased before civil relief could
begin, but once this condition was fulfilled, the
problem became one of providing food and coal
with the least possible delay as the people of
West Holland had no reserve whatsoever to fall
back on. It was therefore necessary to have
a considerable number of minesweeping and
landing craft at short notice, and to make provi-
sion for the latter to be augmented should it be
necessary to land over the beaches, which
would also have entailed the use of beach
clearance and beach parties. A Port Repair
Party for Rotterdam under Captain C. D.
Maud, D.S.O., R.N., had been held in readi-
ness in Belgium since the previous autumn, and
plans were made to introduce this party with
the minimum delay.

22. With the realisation that their defeat was
imminent, the Germans showed their willing-
ness towards the end of April to come to some
agreement whereby food and other necessary
supplies could be introduced into Holland under
flag of truce. By the 1st May details of the
scheme had been agreed with the Germans, and
Allied Air Forces commenced dropping emer-
gency food-stuffs to the Dutch population in ten
selected areas. Royal Air Force and United
States heavy bombers continued to drop some
1,500 tons of food a day until 8th May, when:
the first Allied coasters arrived in Dutch waters
and were given safe conduct and access to the
port of Rotterdam,

Occupation of North German Ports.

23. For several months preparations for the
despatch of Naval Parties required for the
occupation of North German Ports had been in
hand under my Chief of Staff (P.H.)*, Rear-
Admiral W. E. Parry, C.B., at his Head-
quarters in London.

24. As it was not possible to form these Naval
Parties in time to enable them to be ready on

‘the Continent to move into their ports when

required, extemporised arrangements had to be
made for naval representation and advice to be
at the disposal of the British and Canadian
Army Commanders who would make the
advance into the ports.

25. This was done by sending the Naval
Officer-in-Charge (designate) to join the Army
Formation concerned. Rear-Admiral G. C.
Muirhead-Gould, D.S.C. (Flag Officer,
Wilhelmshaven (designate)), was appointed tem-
porarily to the staff of the Commander-in-
Chief, 2st Army Group. At the same time
officers of captain’s rank were sent to the
Headquarters of the First Canadian and
Second British Armies. The officers at these
three Headquarters were later relieved by
officers appointed specifically as Naval Liaison
Officers, Rear-Admiral Muirhead-Gould being
relieved on 3rd May by Captain R. S. Warne,
€.B.E., R.N,

* 26. The ‘‘ Eclipse ’’{ Naval Parties moved
across the Channel as soon as they were formed
and with little or no training. The stores,
which it was essential should arrive in the ports
at the same time as the Parties, had been sent
