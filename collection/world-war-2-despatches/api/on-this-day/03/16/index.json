Commander gth Indian Infantry Brigade planned to assault Fort Dologorodoc at dusk from the south with two battalions: right 3/1z2 Frontier Force Regiment; left 3/5 Mahrattas. These two attacks were successful in capturing two subfeatures of Fort Dologorodoc, known as Pimple and Pinnacle, by midnight. Touch with these two battalions was lost, but Commander gth Indian Infantry Brigade ordered 2 West Yorks on to the col between Pimple and Pinnacle where they arrived shortly after midnight. Before first light the eremy from the Fort itself counter-attacked strongly, but met the whole of the gth Indian Infantry Brigade in line.

On 16th March 4/6 Rajputana Rifles less two Companies attacked Brigs Peak, but was unable to make any progress beyond that already achieved. Confused fighting continued throughout the day, the enemy, who consisted of Bersaglieri and the Savoy Grenadiers, fighting determinedly, were holding positions under the rocks which were practically immune from shell fire. During the evening, a report was received that Brigs Peak was captured, and that only a few enemy remained on M. Sanchil. On receipt of this information, roth Indian Infantry Brigade, which was being held as force reserve, was put under command 4th Indian Division and sent to Cameron Ridge in order to move over the col separating M. Sanchil and Brigs Peak; and exploit into the plain west of Keren. Unfortunately this report was premature.  The leading battalions of this brigade were committed during the night to attacks on M. Sanchil and Brigs Peak. 3/18 Garhwal Rifles in particular suffered heavy loss. The Commanding Officer and all other British officers except one became casualties. The enemy still held ground from which he could direct effective machine-gun and mortar fire against advancing troops."
