the East, and the forward troops had to fight
hard for a time to maintain their positions;
this forward movement by the enemy enabled
him to bring the landing beach under fire for
an appreciable period during which Com-
mandant Paris, Chief of Staff to General
Bethouart, was killed in a landing craft. The
counter attack was beaten off, and the advance
inland resumed. Two French tanks were also
ferried across in motor landing craft and
landed successfully, but unfortunately they
were bogged on the beach and played no part
in the operation for the capture of the town.

66. Arrangements had been made for a con-
tinuous patrol to be flown by our two
squadrons of fighter aircraft over the area
throughout the operation. This was carried out
from 1915 hours on 27th May until 1615 hours
on 2gth May with the one brief enforced
interval mentioned below. No enemy aircraft
appeared in the area until about 0500 hours, a
circumstance which seems to show that the
operation came as a surprise to the enemy.
Unfortunately just about this time our own air-
craft became fogbound on Bardu Foss aero-
drome, 50 miles to the North and could no
longer protect the ships and troops. From
0500 hours to 0700 hours numerous enemy air-
craft, often flying in formation, made repeated
bombing atacks upon H.M. Ships round Narvik
and on the troops on shore. By this time, how-
ever, the task of the ships had been substantially
completed, and, by constant manoeuvring, they
succeeded in avoiding serious damage, though
the flagship, H.M.S. Cairo, was hit by two
bombs and lost 30 men killed and wounded.
The casualties to the landing forces from bomb-
ing amounted to only one small craft loaded
with ammunition,

67. Once the initial landing had succeeded
the progress of General Bethouart’s troops was
steady and continuous. From reports sub-
sequently received it appears that the enemy
withdrew in considerable haste eastwards along
the Beisfjord, and by 2200 hours the whole
Peninsula west of a line from Fagernes to
Forsneset was in French hands, together with
some 200 prisoners.

68. After an initial set-back the Polish troops
also pressed forward along the Ankenes Penin-
sula and established themselves on high ground
overlooking Beisford.

69. Thus ended an operation which, in ‘my
opinion, reflects great credit on the judgment
and pertinacity of General Bethouart and on
the fighting qualities of his troops. Recon-
naissance after the capture of the town revealed
the full difficulties of landing on the beaches
close to the town and the wisdom of the plan
finally adopted. Though he knew of the deci-
sion to evacuate Norway before the operation
started, General Bethouart persevered with his
plan and the vigour with which the advance
eastwards was pressed after the capture of the
town drove the enemy back on to his main
position covering Sildvik and Hundalen, thus
making it difficult for him to attempt a counter-
attack against Narvik at short notice; this en-
abled the subsequent evacuation to be carried
out under more favourable tactical conditions
than at one time seemed likely.

70. Nevertheless, it is my considered opinion
that the operation was carried out with the
barest margin of safety, and for this reason

might well have resulted in failure. Not only
had the strength of the first echelon to be put
ashore to be limited to 290 men, but this small
force had to maintain itself unsupported for
forty-five minutes. Had the enemy been able
to launch an immediate counter attack the
tesult might have been disastrous. It must
always, in my opinion, be unwise to embark
on operations of this character unless landing
craft are available to land a first flight of ade-
quate strength, and, in addition, provide an
adequate floating reserve to meet unforeseen
contingencies. Moreover, the absence of
bomber aircraft deprived the attack of one of
the most effective means of repulsing an enemy
counter attack, as has already been mentioned
the broken and intricate nature of the ground
prevented accurate observation by the support-
ing ships and artillery. The risk, however, was,
in my opinion, worth taking, and, as things
turned out, was justified.

71. I wish particularly to commend the work
of Commander Hubback, R.N., of the Naval
Staff, upon whom rested practically the whole
responsibility for the co-ordination of the Naval
share in the operation with that of the French
troops. It is no exaggeration to say that the
success of the operation was largely due to his
anremitting application to the work in hand,
and his excellent judgment and sound common-
sense. The work of the Naval officers and
ratings who manned the landing craft and super-
vised the difficult task of embarkation and dis-
embarkation on open beaches, often under fire,
was, in my opinion, magnificent and deserving
of the highest praise.

The evacuation of Bodo.

72. Prior to the receipt of instructions from
His Majesty's Government to evacuate Northern
Norway, it had been my intention to use every
means to reinforce the troops in the Bodo area.
I had already in mind a plan to send down a
battalion of Chasseurs Alpin, in order to have
troops specially trained in mountain warfare to
oppose the advance of the German infantry
which was being carried out with great skill and
vigour. Once the decision to evacuate Norway
had been made however, it was obvious thai
the evacuation of the troops from Bodo must
be carried out as promptly as possible, as I
had already received reports from Brigadier
Gubbins that, without further reinforcements,
he was doubtful whether he could hold on
for more than a few days.

73. On receipt of the instructions for evacuation
from the Chiefs of Staff I therefore immediately
despatched Colonel Dowler, my G.S.0.1, to
Bodo in a destroyer, which was conveying the
last company of the South Wales Borderers to
join the rest of its battalion, to concert plans
with Brigadier Gubbins for the withdrawal of
his force.

74. In view of the heavy and repeated air
attacks which were being made upon the town,
docks and aerodrome at Bodo, it was decided
in consultation with Lord Cork, that evacua-
tion ‘by destroyers provided the best chance of
evacuating personnel without serious loss. This
decision meant abandoning the few wheeled
vehicles and guns with the force, but in view of
my instructions that the first consideration was
to save personnel, and also in view of the fact
that no suitable ship for embarking wheeled
vehicles and stores was immediately available,
no other course was practicable. :
