prepared and was to have been launched at
1oco hours; but just before that hour an
Iranian Officer arrived with a white flag and
the request for a truce was granted.

Lt. General Quinan arrived at Zibiri whilst
Major General Slim was still discussing terms
with the Iranian envoy and he approved the
terms offered. He also instructed Major
General Slim to advance and occupy Kerman-
shah in order to secure the oil refinery and
tinning factory there.

The refinery area was occupied on 2gth
August by a detachment and on 30th August
the remainder of the 2nd and oth Armoured
Brigades reached Kermanshah.

from 25th to 28th August in Iran were as

46. On 29th August Major-General Slim at
Kermanshah was ordered to despatch to Hama-
dan a force under Brigadier Aizlewood consist-
ing of the 14/20th Hussars, one Gurkha
Battalion and a troop of artillery, with ancillary
units, with the object of making friendly contact
with the Russians.

A report was received that Russian forces
were advancing on Kermanshah from the
direction of Senna and on Hamadan from
Kazvin. A detachment was despatched there-
fore along the Senna road as well as that to
Kazvin.

The Russian forces were met at Senna at
2z00 hours 2gth August and just South of
Kazvin on the afternoon of 31st August.

47. On 2oth August the General Officer Com-
manding Iraq was instructed to report his views
and plan for dealing with the situation in Iran.
He stated that it was proposed to: —

(i) station troops at Hamadan, Kerman-
shah, Shahabad and thence along the Line
of Communications to Khaniqin;

(ii) hold Khuzistan with the minimum
forces, with Headquarters at Ahwaz. <A
detachment could be maintained at Sultana-
bad for railway protection;

(iii) withdraw to Iraq all troops not
required in Iran.

Owing to the shortage of motor transport it
was not found possible to maintain any forma-
tions beyond Hamadan. The shortage of trans-
port had been aggravated by the arrival of the
5th Indian Division (less one brigade group)
in Iraq on the 6th Seplember without any
maintenance transport. is division had been
sent to Iraq from Middle East as an additional
garrison in accordance with a previous decision
when operations in Iran appeared likely.

The Commander-in-Chief, India, arrived at
Baghdad on 31st August, confirmed the above
plan and instructed Lt.General Quinan to
poner close contact with the Russian forces
in Iran,

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 14 AUGUST, 1946

48. From ist September onwards reports
were received of tribal risings in Iranian
Kurdistan. The situation rapidly deteriorated
although active patrolling was carried out by
the oth Armoured Brigade from Senna and
Kermanshah and also by the 21st Indian In-
fantry Brigade on the line of communication
between Kermanshah and Khaniqin. Con-
siderable quantities of arms and ammunition
hidden or sold to tribesmen by Iranian Army
deserters were recovered,

49. A small detachment of British troops
with Colonel Popov of the Russian Mission was
sent to contact the Russian troops at
Saujbulagh on 7th September.

50. On gth September orders were issued for
the gth Armoured Brigade (less one Regiment)
with one Indian Infantry Battalion under

‘command, to be ready to move to Teheran at

short notice.

51. The 13th Lancers which had been with-
drawn from Khuzistan, arrived at Kermanshah
on t2th September and moved on to Hamadan
next day, less one squadron which was retained
for employment in the Kermanshah-Senna
area,

52. There were indications that the Persians
did not intend to satisfy our demands for the
surrender of Axis nationals and on 14th Sep-
tember the War Office intimated that a joint
Anglo-Russian advance to Teheran would
begin as soon as mutual arrangements with the
Russian Commander had been campleted. The
Russians agreed to a simultaneous entry into
Teheran at 1500 hours on 17th September by
the British from the South and the Russians
from the East and West. This was carried
out according to plan, relations between our
troops and the Russians were most cordial.

Meanwhile Khuzistan remained quiet and all
except one Infantry Brigade and a battery of
Field Artillery were withdrawn to Iraq.

But in Kurdistan fighting still continued be-
tween gangs of Kurds and Iranian troops
garrisoned in various forts. Active patrolling
was continued to give moral support to the
Iranian Commander at Kermanshah.

The Headquarters of the 6th Indian Division
(Major-General J. N. Thomson) arrived at
Basra on 12th September with the 27th Indian
Infantry Brigade, and was ordered to relieve
the 8th and roth Indian Divisions in Khuzistan
and West Iran respectively.

Other local moves were carried out, and on
26th September and 3rd October respectively
the 9th Armoured Brigade from Teheran and
the 5th Indian Division (less one Brigade
Group) from Kirkuk began to return to Middle
East Command.

53. On roth October information was re-
ceived from His Majesty’s Government to the
effect that a proposal had ibeen made to the
Russian Government for the withdrawal of both
Russian and British troops from Teheran and
its neighbourhood and that plans should imme-
diately be made with the Russian Commander
for joint withdrawal to take place as soon as
possible. The withdrawal was carried out on
18th October after a combined British-Russian
parade on 17th October. The Russians with-
drew to Kazvin and Pahlevi and our troops to
Sultanabad and Hamadan.
