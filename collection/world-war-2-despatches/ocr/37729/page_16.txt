enemy aircraft were destroyed or damaged, in-
cluding 44 destroyed in two raids by Welling-
tons on the Catania aerodrome.

Another heavy attack, this time mostly by
night, took place over a period between 28th
April and ist May when 9 enemy aircraft were
destroyed and a ‘‘probable’’ 6, for a loss
of 6 Hurricanes.

It is noteworthy that once the German Air
Force was established in Sicily, Italian bombers
scarcely again appeared over Malta. C.R.42’s
continued to act as escorts and to make a few
low machine-gun attacks, but the Germans
clearly preferred escorts of their own Me.109’s
or 110’s for their dive-bombers,

To deal with these attacks the number of
Hurricanes of No. 261 Squadron was gradually
increased to 34 aircraft, partly by reinforce-
ment from the Middle East and partly as a
tesult of operations by Aircraft Carriers from
the Western Mediterranean, in which Hurri-
canes were ‘‘ flown off’’ to Malta. In addi-
tion, pilots were double-banked to cope with
the increased raids and larger number of enemy
aircraft taking part in them, This Squadron
was in action almost every day and on many
nights. Though losses of our own aircraft were
serious, a fair proportion of pilots were saved.

66. At the end of the period under review,
despite the enemy’s persistent air effort, Malta
could still be regarded as an effective air base
for fighters for a limited offensive against enemy
communications in the Mediterranean and as a
‘stage post’ for the reinforcing aircraft en
route for Egypt. The damage done to build-
ings and hangars made conditions of life and
work uncomfortable and repair work was
difficult.

In spite of these drawbacks, the fact that
operations had been carried on throughout this
testing period is a great tribute to the spirit
and determination of the pilots, aircrews and
ground personnel under the very able direction
of Air Vice-Marshal F. H. M. Maynard, A.F.C.
Amongst those under his Command who ren-
dered valuable service during this period may
be mentioned the Senior Air Staff Officer, Group
Captain A. C, Sanderson, D.F.C.; Group Cap-
tain R. G. Gardner, D.S.C.; Wing Commander
A. D. Messenger, the Senior Signals Officer;
Squadron Leader P. S. Foss, No. 148 Squad-
ron, and Flying Officer A. Warburton, D.F.C.,
of the Glenn Martin Reconnaissance Unit.

Palestine and Trans Jordan.

67. During ithe period covered by this
Despatch there is little to record of the activities
in this area. No further enemy raids took place
on Haifa, or elsewhere. Agqir aerodrome was
completed and opened early in the year. Gaza
was developed and Lydda taken over as an
R.A.F. Station. These aerodromes were pre-
pared for and subsequently occupied by the
Squadron personnel evacuated from Greece, for
the purpose of re-forming and re-arming them.

Iraq.

68. The political situation described in my
previous Despatch continued to deteriorate, par-
ticularly after the coup d’état by Raschid Ali
and the subsequent removal.of the Regent
Emir Abdulla Ali. We were at this period
more than fully occupied in Greece and the

Western Desert, and the only aircraft available
in Iraq were those of No. 4 F.T.S. at Habbaniya
and the Vincents of No. 244 Squadron at
Shaibah, Towards the middle of April it
became obvious that air reinforcements would
be necessary. The training aircraft of No. 4
F.T.S. had as far as possible been placed on an
operational footing, but it was not until the
28th April that it was possible to spare some
Wellingtons for Iraq. On that date 10
Wellingtons of No. 37 Squadron flew to
Habbaniya and 10 Wellingtons of No. 70
Squadron to Shaibah, followed on the 1st May
by a detachment of No. 203 Squadron
(Blentieims) .

By this time a landing of British troops at
Basra had been effected and ships with addi-
tional troops were nearing Basra. It was at
this moment, on the 30th April, that the Iraqis
disclosed the result of their Axis intrigue by
surrounding Habbaniya with a strong Iraqi
force, including artillery.

Egypt.

69. At the beginning of January the Fighter
defence of Egypt consisted of No. 252 Fighter
Wing under Group Captain C. B. S. Spackman,
D.F.C., who had most ably improvised an
organisation which operated one Squadron at
Amriya and a Sector Headquarters at Helwan,
controlling the defensive patrols of the 2
R.E.A.F. Fighter Squadrons at Almaza and
Suez respectively. Information was provided
by No. 256 A.M.E.S. Wing.

During January, as a result of minelaying
attacks on the Suez Canal, it was decided to
build up an organisation, on the lines that had
proved so successful in the U.K. Nos. 252
and 256 Wings were amalgamated as the con-
trolling authority, the Sectors being at Amriya,
Heliopolis, Fayid and Port Said. As an
interim measure, a temporary Sector was formed
at Ismailia to deal with the Suez Canal Zone.

In March I décided to re-form No. 202
Group, under Air Commodore T.. W. Elmhirst,
A.F.C., to co-ordinate ali operational problems
concerning the air defence of Egypt, and to
co-operate with H.Q., B.T.E., on problems
concerning A.A. artillery and searchlights.

Experience showed that communications in
Egypt were so poor that it proved impossible
to operate even 3 Sectors efficiently from one
controlling authority, and accordingly the
decision was taken to divide the Delta into
two by a line from Baltim through Mansura,
thence approximately South Eastwards to the
Gulf of Suez, and to form two separate Wings
each with its own filter room. No. 250 Wing
formed at Ismailia to control the Sectors at
Port Said and Fayid and be responsible for the
defence of the Suez Canal Zone and Eastern
portion of the Delta Area. No. 252 Wing was
then made responsible for the control of the
Sectors at Amriya and Heliopolis, and the
defence of Alexandria, Cairo and the Western
portion of the Delta.

70. During the actual period of this report
the enemy’s effort against Alexandria, Suez,
Port Said and the Canal, was small in com-
parison to his activities elsewhere considering
the many important and tempting targets open
to him, There were, however, two or three
effective raids on the Suez Canal which resulted
in its being closed for periods up to a week or
ten days on account of mines. Only one attack
