SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 20 OCTOBER, 1948

29. Much, therefore, remained common to
both plans. Both plans, for example, relied on
the ability of our existing radar chain stations
to detect pilotless aircraft in the same way as
they detected ordinary aircraft. After taking
expert advice I had come to the conclusion that
the stations would be able to do this, and that
we should be able to tell pilotless from piloted
aircraft by ‘‘ track behaviour ’’—that is to say,
the characteristics of their flight as interpreted
by the radar responses. Similarly, members
of the Royal Observer Corps would, pre-
sumably, be able to recognise pilotless aircraft
by their appearance and the noise they made.*
All that was required under this head, then,
was to lay down a procedure for reporting

. pilotless aircraft by the means already in exist-

ence, and instruct all concerned in its use.
For this both plans provided.

30. Again, at every stage the principal object
that General Pile and I had in mind was the
defence of London, which was the target
threatened by the vast majority of the ‘‘ ski
sites ’’. Secondly, we.had to provide for the
defence of Bristol, which was threatened by a
smaller number of “‘ ski sites ’’ near Cherbourg.
Thirdly, we had to bear in mind the possibility
that, as a counter-measure to our preparations
for the European operations, pilotless aircraft
might be used against assembly areas on the
south coast, and particularly round the Solent.

31. In each case, fighter aircraft were to be
the first line of defence. For the defence of
London the arrangement envisaged in both
plans was that whenever an attack in daylight
seemed imminent, fighters of No. 11 Group
would patrol at 12,000 feet on three patrol lines,
20 miles off.the coast between Beachy Head and
Dover, over the coastline between Newhaven
and Dover, and between Haywards Heath and
Ashford respectively. Once an attack had
begun, additional aircraft would patrol these
lines at 6,000 feet. At night, fighters would
patrol under the control of G.C.I., Type 16,
and C.H.L. radar stations, and would be rein-
forced, if necessary, by further aircraft under
Sector control.

32. At Bristol and the Solent the facts of
geography promised a longer warning and more
room to manoeuvre as well as a lighter scale of
attack. Consequently I did not propose to fly
standing patrols for the defence of those places.
Should attacks appear imminent, however,
fighters would be held ready to intercept by
normal methods.

33. Under both plans, guns and searchlights
would provide the next line of defence, and
would, of course, become the first line of de-
fence if at any time the state of the weather
or any other factor prevented the fighters from
operating. For the defence of London, General
Pile and I proposed under the first plan to
deploy 400 heavy A.A. guns in folds and
hollows on the southern slopes of the North
Downs, where their radar equipment would be
liable to the minimum of interference from
“" jamming ’’ by the enemy. We also proposed
to use 346 light A.A. guns, to be deployed
largely on searchlight sites, and 216 search-
lights. ‘In front of Bristol we proposed to put
96 heavy A.A. guns and 276 light A.A. guns,

* All these assumptions proved correct.

5589

with 132 searchlights. Thirty-two heavy A.A.
guns, 242 light A.A. guns and a smaller number
of searchlights would defend the Solent.

34. It was here that the most important
differences between the two plans lay. The
original plan called for the deployment of a
grand total of 528 heavy and 804 light A.A.
gums and more than 350 searchlights. Clearly,
to muster as many guns and searchlights as this
would not be easy. General Pile and I proposed
to find half the required number of heavy A.A.
guns from within Anti-Aircraft Command by
depleting the defences of places not directly
threatened by pilotless aircraft; the other half *
would have to come from the resources of 21
Army Group and Home Forces, and thus would
consist very largely of guns already earmarked
for the European operations. In the case of
light A.A. guns and also of searchlights, 2
Army Group would have to provide an even
higher proportion of the total.

35. Some risk would, of course, be involved
in removing guns from places like Oxford,
Birmingham, and the Clyde to defend London,
Bristol, and the Solent against flying bombs.
But the risk was one that I felt we should be
justified in taking, since otherwise there was no
possibility of finding the resources required for
adequate defence against the threat from pilot-
less aircraft as we conceived it in December,
when the plan was made.

36. By February, when we came to draw up
the revised plan, the position had changed.
Virtually every gun and searchlight that could
be spared would shortly be needed for the
European operations; and it was essential that
the ‘' Diver’’ defences should make the
smallest inroad on the ‘‘ Overlord ’’ resources
that was compatible with an adequate scale of
defence. Fortunately, the success of the bomb-
ing attacks on the “ ski sites ’’ held out the
hope of achieving an adequate scale of defence
on cheaper terms than had seemed possible two
months earlier.

37. Accordingly, General Pile and I carefully
reviewed this part of our original plan. We
came to the conclusion that substantial savings
in both guns and searchlights could and must
be made. We therefore proposed to reduce the
number of heavy A.A. guns to be deployed on
each of the sites in the belt defending London
from eight to four. This would save 208 guns.
We hoped that by the time the attacks began
128 American go mm. guns, using electrical
predictors and a new type of radar called
§.C.R.584, might be available to replace a
corresponding number of our 3.7-inch guns with
their mechanical predictors and G.L. Mark IIT
radar; for there was every indication that the
S.C.R.584 and electrical predictors would be
particularly effective against pilotless aircraft.
But as this equipment had yet to arrive from
the United States and crews be trained in its
use, we dared not count on it: we therefore
prepared alternative plans to cover either con-
tingency. We also proposed to reduce the
number of light A.A. guns in front of London
from 346 to 246.

38. No reduction in the number of heavy
A.A. guns defending Bristol seemed po:sible,
and we decided to ieave this figure at 96. In
view of the great need of light A.A. guns for
‘* Overlord ’’ we proposed, however, to reduce
