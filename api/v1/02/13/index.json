A new bridgehead was established by 33 Corps opposite Myinmu, in the teeth of determined opposition on the part of the Japanese, who took it to be part of a major encircling movement against Mandalay in conjunction with the forces in the Singu bridgehead to the north. They accordingly threw in most of their available reserves to combat it. A feint crossing was made far to the south, opposite Seikpyu, while the main thrust was made a little upstream, opposite Myitche, where 4 Corps was able to establish a foothold against comparatively light opposition from the enemy, who still underestimated the threat to his left flank. When this bridgehead had been consolidated, a motorised brigade was concentrated behind its lines.",

By 1st February the enemy was on the move, pursued by the mechanised column consisting of the carriers of 9th Indian Infantry Brigade and a Motorised Company of 3/12 Frontier Force Regiment, preceded by a detachment of 21 Field Company, Sappers and Miners. The enemy’s retirement on this front was much less hurried than on the 4th and 5th Indian Divisional lines of advance and great delay was imposed by his lavish use of mines along the seventy miles from Metemma to Chelga. It was in clearing these mines that Second-Lieutenant Bhagat of 21 Field Company, Sappers and Miners, earned his V.C. for cool and conspicuous gallantry and endurance over a long period. After crossing the River Gandwa, where our mechanised column first made contact with the remnants of the Italian garrison of Karawa which was retreating in disorder harassed by the patriots, steady progress was made, and by roth February, contact was made with the Abyssinian patriots jn Wahni. By 13th February, 9th Indian Infantry Brigade, less 3/12 Frontier Force Regiment, was concentrated in Gedaref, leaving 3/12 Frontier Force Regiment supported by 144 Field Regiment, less one battery, 21 Field Company and one troop of ‘ X ’’ Light A.A.

            "description": "82. The area finally selected for the crossing of 20 Indian Division was at the bend, south of the village of Allagappa. The river here is about 1,500 yards wide. and the current is strong (three knots). High ground to the south-east gave the enemy observation over the area initially. Not being an ideal crossingplace, it was only lightly defended. Moreover it was the junction of 31 and 33 Japanese Divisions, which, as was hoped, led to confusion when we struck. The crossing was made by 100 Brigade on the night 12th-13th February, and, by the following night, a bridgehead six miles wide by two miles deep had. been developed. The success of this operation was in great measure due to the diversionary attacks made elsewhere by 32 Brigade which attracted troops away from the real crossing. This crossing by 20 Indian Division is also notable for the fact that it was supported by the only Corps artillery concentration attempted during the whole campaign. Generally, the artillery’s réle was unspectacular but it should not be thought for that reason. that it was unimportant. The often few guns in action, brought forward sometimes by tremendous effort, played a vital réle and Commanders repeatedly commented on the effectiveness of the fire support that was provided.",

The difficulties likely to be encountered in an event of a forced withdrawal across this river were especially stressed. It also pointed out that the loss of Pegu would be likely to seal the fate of Rangoon and referred to the policy of stocking bases in Ceniral Burma with a view to continuing the campaign and covering the road to India in the event of Rangoon being lost. It ended with an appeal for more troops, especially British, as early as possible. .",
