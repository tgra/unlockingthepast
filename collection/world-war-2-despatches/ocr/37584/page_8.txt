was then, to hold the Otta position for two or
three days, and that he would do his best ‘o
cover the Norwegian detachment’s with-
drawal. The Otta position required two bat-
talions to hold it, and as the Y. and L. would
have found difficulty in defending the Sjoa
position they were ordered to withdraw on the
night 27th/28th to reinforce the Green
Howards on the Otta position.

This withdrawal was not as successful as on
the previous night. The enemy had antici-
pated it, and made every effort to work round
the flank. Parties of the enemy (dressed as
Norwegian troops) succeeded in cutting cif
some of the forward companies, and eventu-
ally only some 12 officers and 300 men were
available to assist the Green Howards on the
Otta position. Many of r Y. and L. who
had been thus cut off rejoined subsequentiy
after an adventurous passage of the hulls on
the flanks of the valley.

43. At about o500 hours the liaison officer
who had taken up the motor transport for the
withdrawal of r Y. and L. returned to General
Paget’s headquarters with the news of the diffi-
culties experienced by this battalion. In his
opinion the Y. and L. were not in a fit state
to hold their sector of the Otta position, which
would have to be held solely by the Green
Howards.

This situation necessitated some precaution-
ary measures. Movement of troops in the open
or on the Lines of Communication by daylight
could be justified only as a last resort; but
there were still some two and a half hours left
before the usual time of arrival of the German
morning air reconnaissance. Throughout the
operations the enemy was methodical in his
air action, and his probable active hours could
be forecast with accuracy.

44. The company of the Green Howards in
Dombis was, therefore, ordered into a conceal-
ment area some two miles to the South of
Dombis, with motor transport immediately
available for a further forward movement if
necessary.

At the same time the K.0.Y.L.I. in Domb&s
were placed at one hour’s notice to move.

While these adjustments were being made,
the first news of the intended evacuation reached
headquarters. The War Office telegram re-
quested acceptance of a plan or a suggested
alternative. General Paget considered he could
not answer this without reference to General
Ruge, as the evacuation was not possible with-
out his co-operation.

He therefore went to his headquarters and
told him frankly the situation, which at the
first General Ruge was unable to accept.

Finally, he did so, on General Paget’s assur-.

ance that British troops would cover the with-
drawal of the Norwegian Army and would not
telinquish Dombis until this had been effected.

45. Meanwhile the situation of the Green
Howards and Y. and L. was causing anxiety
at the headquarters of the 15th Infantry
Brigade. Y. and L. had not recovered from
the severe handling they had received during
the previous night’s withdrawal, and thovgh
Green Howards were in good heart they were all
too few to cover an extensive position. The
enemy had gained contact at 1030 hours, and
quickly began a methodical bombardment of
the forward troops with artillery and mortars.

forward troops were the heaviest experienced
up to that time. It was apparent that to hold
the position until dark and then extricate the
forward battalions might be a matter of con-
siderable difficulty.

46. The time and space problem of the with-
drawal had now to be considered. The major
factors were:—

(a) The. obligation to cover the withdrawal
of all Norwegian troops in this area.

(b) The shipping available on the nights
ag /30th April, 30th April/1st May, rst/and

ay.

(c) The withdrawal would be dependent on
one single railway line and one road over a
distance of 100 miles.

(d) The physical endurance of the troops.

It was obvious from the start that demolition
must play a large part in the plan. A vital
point was the bridge over the Rost& gorge be-
tween Dovre and Otta If this was successfully
blown, the enemy would be unlikely to get
tanks, guns or wheeled vehicles forward of the
gorge for at least 48 hours.

One section of the 55 Field Company, R.E.,
was withdrawn at once from the forward area
to prepare the Rost& demolitions, and the com-

iy of Green Howards, then in concealment
South of Domb&s, was sent to cover their pre-
parations.

47. During the afternoon and early evening
the Green Howards on the Otta position fought
splendidly. One medium and two light tanks
were destroyed by the 25 mm. Anti-Tank Com-
pany. Other targets included reconnaissance
parties and groups of enemy in buildings. There
is no doubt that the enemy suffered many
casualties in this battle and his subsequent
actions showed little desire or ability to press
home an attack. It was, however, irritating
in the extreme, owing to lack of artillery, to be
unable to deal with the German close support
guns, which came into action in the open,
outside the range of British light machine guns
and 3 in. mortars.

At about 1800 hours the K.O.Y.L.I. were
ordered to occupy the position South of Dom-
bis, ich had been reconnoitred in the
morning.

48. The plan for the night withdrawal is
worth considering in some detail, because it was
the first of a series of precarious operations,
where the balance between success and disaster
was extremely slender.

Otta is some 25 miles from Domb&s, where
lay the next secure base occupied by the
K.O.Y.L.I. The only means of transport avail-
able were the train and a very limited amount
of motor transport, both of which had to be
wheedled out of the Norwegians. The motor
transport was allotted to the rear parties. The
train was assembled at Domb&s and the motor
transport at Dovre, with a staff officer in charge
of each. Both started about zoco hours. The
train ran forward to Rudi and the motor trans-
port to Formo, both of which were close behind
the front line. At about 2030 hours the fighting
slackened on the whole front and the with-
drawal started at 2300 hours, the troops falling
steadily back on the train and motor transport
column.

The train left’ Rudi about 0230 hours, and
the troops detrained into assembly areas at
Domb&s between 0500 and 0600 hours, where
