The 13th Corps took command of operations in the forward area, and the headquarters of the 30th Corps Iwent back to direct operations against the enemy - garrisons in the frontier positions."

The Kroh forces were being forced backwards over the frontier, while our right in Northern Kedah was also driven back, necessitating the 6th Indian Infantry Brigade withdrawing on the left to conform-and hold a line River Bukit (north of Alor Star) to Penang, Penang was the subject of daily air attacks at this period. Two days of heavy fighting then saw our forces pushed back twenty miles south of Alor Star, the 11th Division taking up a position in the Gurun area. Some of the infantry units in this division reported losses up to 50 per cent., but this included missing, many of whom re- joined later."

The defence of the position was thus left to the German mobile forces, who could delay their departure (without undue risk until our attack appeared imminent. There was still a chance, however, that the outflanking movement of the New Zealand Division might be able to catch some of his rearguards and the greater the losses we could inflict on his German troops the less chance there was of his being able to starid on his next position. Accordingly the date of the attack was advanced as much as possible;:the New Zealanders started off from El Haseiat on 12th December, 51 Division starting active raid- ing against the positions north and south of the Sebkha on the 11th to distract attention from the move, and the frontal attack was planned for the 14th."

Eventually the 3/16 Punjab Regiment withdrew through the 5/14 Punjab Regiment to Kroh. Their strength, including 50 reinforcements, was now about 400.

Headquarters, Allied Armies in Italy, was disbanded; part came with me to Allied Force Headquarters and part, \u2018in particu- lar the operations and intelligence staff, went to General Clark\u2019s headquarters. I should like to express here my appreciation of the work of my staff throughout the campaign. This narra- tive will have made it clear that our successes were never won by force of numbers, never by a simple marshalling of overwhelming resources, but always by stratagems, secret concentrations and surprise moves. It is the task of the Commander-in-Chief to think out the broad lines of such a strategy but it is for his"

Nicholson) remained concentrated in the Yazagyo area until the 12th December, when it began its forward move to the Kalewa bridgehead. The leading Brigade. the 6th, passed through 11 (East African) Division on the 21st and advanced rapidly along the road from Kalewa towards Pyingaing. West of Pyingaing the advance was checked by a strong rearguard position. With the assistance of 32 Brigade of 20 Indian Division as stated above, the enemy was cleared, and Pyingaing was captured on the 24th. Determined resistance was again encountered in the Wainggyo Gorge, nine miles south-west of Pyingaing, but was overcome with tank support. The advance of 2 British Division continued with great speed. Dominating features astride the road 12 miles east of Pyingaing were cleared, and a large enemy detachment was successfully ambushed on the 28th December. On the 31st, the Kabo Weir, 11 miles north of Ye-U was captured intact. This was an important economic gain, since the Kabo Weir controls the irrigation of an extensive area of rice-growing country. It was a propitious entry into the Shwebo plain\u2014 the enemy\u2019s demolition party, sent to blow up the weir, arrived to find us in occupation. On the 2nd January, 5 Brigade had established itself at Ye-U and the Division was driving the enemy back on to Shwebo, the northern out- skirts of which were reached by the 8th January. 64 Brigade of 19 indian Division had already reached the eastern outskirts on the 7th, having come via Kanbalu. Shwebo town was finally occupied on the 10th January, after the Japanese rearguard had fought to the last. man. 6 Brigade of 2 British Division was then concentrated at Shwebo after relief by 268 Indian Brigade in the Kabo Weir area. This advance of 150 miles in 20 days was a fine per- formance by an all-British Division."
