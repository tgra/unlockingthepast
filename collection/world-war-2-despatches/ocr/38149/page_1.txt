THE ANTI-AIRCRAFT DEFENCE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
‘FROM 28TH JULY, 1939, TO 15TH APRIL, 1945.

The following despatch was submitted to the
Secretary of State for War ow the 21st
October, 1946, by GENERAL SIR
FREDERICK A. PILE, Bt, G.C.B.,
D.S.0., M.C., General Officer Commanding-
in-Chief, Anti-Aircraft Command.

PART I.
PREAMBLE.

rae have been commanded by the Army
Council to submit a report on the Anti-Aircraft
defence of the United Kingdom during the war
and have the honour to present my despatch
herewith.-

2. For convenience the report has been
divided into two parts and in this first part
I propose to deal with events from the ee
of war until May, 1941.

Section I—GENERAL. ,
3. In September, 1939, the Anti-Aircraft
defences of the country were organised in a
Command Headquarters, seven - Divisional
Headquarters, 4 varying number of Brigades in
each Division and a number of gun and search-
light units in each Brigade.

4. Anti-Aircraft Command Headquarters was
Situated at Stanmore, adjacent to the Head-
quarters of Fighter Command, R.A.F., and
with them was jointly responsible for the Air
Defence of Great Britain, the A.O.C.-in-C.
mene Command being in operational com-

ae saystons of responsibility such as this ob-
viously entailed the closest liaison and willing
co-operation on both sides. I wish to put on
record that the relations between my Head-
‘quarters and Fighter Command Headquarters
‘were always most cordial.

5. The areas allotted to each of the seven
Divisions were as follows: —

tst~The Metropolitan area of London.

2nd—Northern East Anglia, the East
Midlands and Humber,
3rd—Scotland and Northern Ireland.
4th—North-west England, the West Mid-
lands and North Wales.
5th—South Wales, south-west and southern
England.
6th—South-east England and southern
East Anglia.
7th—North-east England. .
An additional organisation, . directly con-
trolled for operations from my Headquarters,
was responsible for the defence of the Orkneys
and Shetlands. It is essential to emphasise
that A.A. Divisions were in no way comparable
to Divisions in the Field Army, being of no
fixed size and at times being up to four times
as large and covering many thousand square
miles of country.

6. The failure of our first overseas campaign
in Norway confirmed my opinion of the para-
mount importance of the Anti-Aircraft defences;
if we could obtain. mastery in the air, there
would be no invasion; if we could not, no ex-
peditionary force could be launched from the
United Kingdom. I therefore pressed for and
secured a large expansion of our Anti-Aircraft
defences during 1940.

7. At the end of 1940 I felt it essential to
propose a considerable re-organisation in order
to relieve. the burden on the existing Command
and Divisions and also to achieve closer co-
ordination of boundaries with Fighter Com-
mand. Five new Divisions were created as.
follows:— -

8th—covering the south coast as-far east as
Bournemouth.

gth—South Wales.

*roth—Humber.

r1th—the West Midlands and central
Wales.

r2th—Clyde and Northern Ireland.
