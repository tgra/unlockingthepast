OPERATIONS IN EASTERN THEATRE, BASED ON INDIA, FROM
. MARCH 1942 TO DECEMBER 31, 1942

The following Despatch was submitted to the
Secretary of State for War on September 27th
1943, by FIELD-MARSHAL The
VISCOUNT WAVELL, G.C.B., C.M.G.,
M.C., A.D.C., Commander-in-Chief, India.

1. This despatch deals with the arrange-
ments for the defence of India against
' Japanese invasion, ‘which Ibecame a serious

threat after the fall of Rangoon early in March
1942, and with the preparations later in 1942
to undertake an offensive to recapture Burma.
There was little fighting during the period, but
the story of the events and of the measures
taken is not without interest.

2. When Rangoon fell, in March 1942, it was
obvious that the whole of Burma might be
occupied by the Japanese and that india itself
and Ceylon lay under imminent threat of
invasion,

The forces available for defence at this time
were dangerously weak. The Eastern Fleet
had only ne modernised battleship imme-.
diately available and the fleet as a whole was
in no position to dispute with the Japanese
. fleet command of the Bay of Bengal or of the
waters round Ceylon. There were only one
British and six Indian divisions available for
the defence of the whole of India and Ceylon,
apart from forces for defence of the N.W.

ntier and for internal security, both of
which were well below the strength estimated
as necessary for these commitments. No single
one of these divisions was complete in ancillary
troops or fully equipped or adequately trained.
Three of them had two brigades only.

The number of A.A. guns (heavy or light)
to defend Calcutta (India’s largest city), her
most important war industries and other vital
points, which were or were soon likely to be
within effective bombing range, was less than
150, against an estimated total requirement of
some 1,500.

The Air Force available for the commitments
of defending India and Ceylon and of swpport-
ing the army in Burma was similarly inade-
quate, as was the number of airfields. For the
defence of Calcutta one fighter squadron was
available with eight serviceable Mohawks.
Fifty Hurricanes were delivered to Ceylon in
March, and the three fighter squadrons allotted
to the defence of the island were equipped
during March, just in time to meet the enemy
air raids in April.

The remaining air force available (two fighter
squadrons and one light bomber squadron) was
allotted to Upper Burma, where the greater
part of it was destroyed by enemy attack at
Magwe on the 21st and 22nd March. The
remnants were withdrawn to India to re-form
for its defence.

The airfields in Eastern India were quite
inadequate and the warning system was only
in a rudimentary stage.

3. On the 7th March, just before the fall of
Rangoon, I cabled to the Chiefs of Staff a
short appreciation. I expressed grave doubts
of my ability to hold Burma, and anticipated
a subsequent attack by the Japanese on N.E.
India, J considered at this time that an undue
proportion of our very inadequate land and
air resources in the East was being allocated
to the defence of Ceylon. In particular the
diversion to Ceylon of a brigade of the 70
British Division, the only British division
available in India, caused me concern. Ceylon
already had two Indian Brigades and two
brigades of local troops; two Australian
brigades were being lent to its defence and an
East African brigade was on its way there.
My view was that if we lost command of the
sea and air around Ceylon an additional
brigade would be of no avail to secure the
naval bases at Trincomalee or Colombo, which
the Japanese could destroy without landing, in
the same manner as at Pearl Harbour or
