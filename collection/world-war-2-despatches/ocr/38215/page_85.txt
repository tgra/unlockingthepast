SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

Section LX.—JaPaNEse STRATEGY.

606. The Japanese attack on Malaya was
very carefully planned and there is now no
doubt that preparations had been going on for
a very long time before hostilities actually
-started. The Japanese themselves admitted that

-the terrain of Malaya, our battle methods and

our equipment were all carefully studied for
years before the outbreak of war. The Com-
mander-in-Chief of the 25th Japanese Army de-
tailed for the Malayan campaign had spent six
months in Germany before taking over com-
mand. He was given the best possible senior
staff officers. The Japanese Divisions employed
in Malaya are known to have ‘been among the
best in the Japanese Army. In particular the
Guards Division and the 5 Division, both of
which had been very highly trained for the type
of warfare to be undertaken in Malaya, had
been specially sent from Japan. To give them
further experience they took part in April,
1941, in a landing operation on the coast of
China followed by a quick thrust inland. They
then went to Hainan where they did further
training in landing operations and jungle war-
fare. The Island of Hainan was for a Jong time
used as a springboard for the southward
advance.

607. The Japanese strategy consisted in a
continuous land and air offensive pressed with
the utmost vigour with the object of advancing
into South Malaya and capturing Singapore
before our reinforcements could arrive. This
offensive was supported by their Navy on the
east coast of Malaya. Their Navy also co-
operated with coast-wise operations on the west
coast as soon as landing craft could be made
available. These special craft were originally
landed at Singora and transported across the
peninsula by road to the west coast in the State
of Kedah where they were launched on the
22nd December. These sea-borne operations
had good and continued air cover. Had there
been available at Singapore some fiotillas of fast
armoured and properly equipped coastal craft it
is certain that the enemy would not have been
able to exercise the constant threat to our com-
munications with sea-borne forces which they
did in fact succeed in doing.

In carrying out this strategy the Japanese
undoubtedly took risks as regards the security
of their Lines of Communication and the main-
tenance of their supplies. They relied to a great
extent on the resources of the country.

608. The immediate object of the Japanese
at the outset of the operations appears to have
been (a) to cripple our Air Force and (b) to cut
off and destroy the whole of our forces in Kedah
by a rapid thrust from Patani via Kroh to cut
the west coast communications west of the
River Perak. In this way they hoped to reach
the line of the River Perak in two days.

The campaign opened with intensive air
operations in which the Japanese Air Force
based on Indo-China made full use of the aero-
dromes which it had occupied in South Thai-
Jand. In the course of the first three days the
Japanese succeeded in inflicting serious losses
on our Air Force and driving it back off the
northern aerodromes. The Japanese, however,
did not succeed in cutting off and destroying
our forces in Kedah, though we suffered very
severe losses both in men and material, For
a time the situation was very critical and it

was only by a great effort that the Japanese
plan was frustrated. It actually took them six-
teen days instead of two to reach the line of the
River Perak.

The Japanese attack on the State of Kelantan
appears to have had the double object of cap-
turing the three aerodromes located there and
of providing a base from which land operations
against Kuantan could be developed.

609. After crossing the River Perak the
Japanese continued their drive down the west
coast arteries of communications and supported
it by sea~-borne operations on the west coast and
by a land advance against Kuantan on the east
coast. All these operations were closely sup-
ported by the Japanese Air Force which
attacked our aerodromes in Central Malaya, our
troops in the forward areas and columns on
the move, as well as providing cover for their
sea-borne operations and carrying out strategi-
cal and tactical reconnaissances. a

During January the Japanese Air Force
attacked objectives in the Singapore area, first
by night and later, when they were able to
support their bombers with fighters based on
the Central Malaya aerodromes, by day. The
aerodromes continued to be the main target
but the Naval Base and, in the later stages, the
Singapore Docks were also heavily attacked.
There was bombing also, possibly not inten-
tional, of areas in Singapore Town.

Towards the end of January a Japanese
force landed at Endau on the east coast of
Johore, *

610. On reaching the Straits of Johore the
Japanese, pursuing their previous strategy,
attacked Singapore Island with the least possible
delay with the results already recorded in Part
TII of this Despatch. That they were able to
assemble their forces, bring forward a large
number of special landing craft and launch the
attack in little more than a week was without
doubt a remarkable performance. The landing
craft were transported by road from Pontian
Kechil on the west coast of Johore to the rivers
which flow into the western branch of the
Straits of Johore.

611. The Japanese, in commenting on the
Malayan campaign, have attributed their suc-
cess to their pre-war preparations, to the fact
that this campaign was the centre of interest
throughout their whole Army, to the fact that
their commanders, senior staff officers and
troops were specially selected, and to the fact
that their land operations were closely sup-
ported by their Navy and by their Army and
Navy Air Forces.

Other important factors in their success were
undoubtedly:—

(a) The great superionty, both as regards
the quantity and quality of their machines, of
the Japanese Air Force;

(6) The freedom of manoeuvre conferred
on+the Japanese Army, and conversely the
crippling effect of the ever present threat to
our own communications and bases, resulting
from the Japanese strategical nava] suprem-
acy off the east coast of Malaya and, to a
lesser degree, from their tactical supremacy
off the west coast also; ,

(c) The inclusion in the Japanese Army of
a_ strong “modern Armoured . Component,
while we on our side had “to rely on

“armoured cars and Bren gun carriers.
