a stout resistance, and the Commander 1 Bur-
corps put in an immediate counter-attack with
the few troops at his disposal. Information of
the attack on Monywa was received at Army
Headquarters at 22.00 hours and orders were
immediately issued for one squadron of tanks
to move via Ondaw on Monywa, and during the
night of 1st/2nd May the squadron of tanks
which I had moved north of Shwebo for the
protection of the left flank was also ordered to
move on Monywa via Ye-U.

62. The situation created by the Japanese
occupation of Monywa was serious since it cut
off all the Imperial Forces west of the River
Mu from the direct approach to Ye-U through
Monywa and also prevented the move of any
forces up or across the Chindwin. Further,
there was no regular formation of Imperial
Forces in position to oppose an enemy advance
‘direct on Ye-U. The Commander x Burcorps
at once ordered the 16 Infantry Brigade to
move with all speed via Shwebo to cover the
approaches to Ye-U from the south. The
situation in Monywa, however, improved due to
the prompt action of Commander x Burcorps
and the courage and tenacity of the troops and
by the morning of the 1st May the town was
again temporarily in our hands.

63. Meanwhile, at 2045 hours on 30th April,
orders were issued by x Burcorps for 1 Burma
Division to advance on Monywa as quickly as
possible. 63 Infantry Brigade was due to
arrive by train at Chaungu early on Ist May
and this Brigade and 48 Infantry Brigade at
-Myinmu were placed under command xr Burma
Division, Later, however, 48 Infantry Brigade
was ordered to move via Shwebo on Ye-U.

Orders were also issued, in pursuance of the
original plan, for 13 Infantry Brigade to cross
to the west bank of the River Chindwin but
this move did not prove possible and had to be
abandoned.

64. Early on 1st May the enemy crossed the
River Chindwin south of Monywa and, assisted
by local guides, attacked H.Q. 1 Burma
Division, capturing a wireless set. - This some-
what disorganised, the chain of command. The
enemy also re-occupied Monywa. During the
day 1 Burma Division, with 63 Infantry Brigade
and one squadron 2 R. Tanks under command,
advanced to the south-east outskirts of
Monywa with a view to attacking on the
morning of 2nd May One squadron 7 Hussars
moved via Ye-U to the north of Alon,

65. My Headquarters, Headquarters 1 Bur-
corps and Headquarters 17 Division moved to
Ye-U on 1st May. Before leaving Shwebo
I had arranged for General Stilwell to meét me
at Ye-U at 1800 hours that evening in order to
co-ordinate plans for the withdrawal from the
Mandalay-Irrawaddy position. At this meeting,
at which Commander 1 Burcorps was present,
General Stilwell agreed that a withdrawal could
no longer be delayed and the code words to
put this into effect were issued at 1845 hours.
General Stilwell also agreed that the situation
at Monywa demanded the withdrawal of
7 Armoured Brigade from its position in sup-
port of 38 Chinese Division east of the River
Mu and orders were therefore issued for
7 Armoured Brigade to move forthwith on the
axis Ye-U—Monywa. General Stilwell | in-
formed me that he intended to withdraw the

SUPPLEMENT ro tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948

Chinese Fifth Army to the Katha area but was’
uncertain of his further plans. Preparations
were, however, in hand for a possible with-
drawal to India. :

I did not see General Stilwell again until his
arrival at Dinjan at the end of May and, owing
to the failure of his wireless, did not have any
further communication with him.

66. On and May, 7 Armoured Bngade, which
had arrived south of Ye-U during the night of
1st/2nd May, attacked Monywa from the north
assisted by improvised forces of infantry from
i Glosters and F.F. Columns, 1 Burma Duvi-
sion attacking from the south-east cleared the
outskirts of Monywa, but the attack was not
pressed home since 1 Burma Division succeeded
in moving round Monywa via Ettaw and in
reaching the Ye-U road south of Budalin.

Part VI.—THE WITHDRAWAL TO INDIA.

67. The Race for Kalewa.—The operations
had now developed into a race with the enemy
for the possession of Kalewa. A warning was
sent to General Wakely at Kalewa to establish
local protection and to block the river
approaches As a result of this, a boom was
constructed across the Chindwin to the south
of Shwegyin and the detachment of Royal
Marines, which had done such good work on
the Irrawaddy, was despatched with Breda guns
to cover this obstruction. G.H.Q. India were
also requested to order air attacks on enemy
craft moving up the Chindwin. I learned later
that such attacks were made on the 3rd or 4th
May and I have no doubt that they imposed
considerable delay on the enemy’s advance
up the river. There was also the possibility
that the enemy might land at some point short
of Kalewa and cut in on the Ye-U—Kalewa
road. The most likely point for this to happen
was at Maukkadaw from which place a chaung
gave easy access to the road at Pyingyaing.
A detachment of the Bush Warfare School,
reinforced by British infantry from the depot
at Maymyo, was therefore sent to Maukkadaw.
This detachment was later reinforced by two
companies of Gurkhas. At this time I assumed
that the 1 Indian Infantry Brigade was moving
from Palel to Kalewa and I requested G.H.Q.
India to hasten this movement, as I still had
reason to believe that a Japanese force was
advancing on Kalemyo via the Myittha Valley.
I learned on 5th May that x Indian Infantry
Bngade would not move into Burma, as it was
not considered possible to maintain it in Kalewa,
in addition to the troops from Burma that would
also be in that area.

68. Co-ordination with the Chinese Rear
Guard.—On the morning of the 3rd May, I
received a visit at my Headquarters at Kaduma
from General Li Jen Sun, commanding
38 Chinese Division. This Division was ordered
to act as rear guard to the Chinese Fifth Army.
General Sun felt that his task was difficult and
he was anxious that the movements of his
Division should be closely co-ordinated with
those of 1 Burcorps. I had already issued orders
about this but as a result of General Sun’s visit
I again impressed on the Commander x Bur-
corps that he must not withdraw from the Ye-U
area until the Chinese 38 Division had passed
to the north ‘of Shwebo. In view of the
excellent manner in which General Sun had
always co-operated with the forces under my
