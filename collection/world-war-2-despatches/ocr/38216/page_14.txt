covered by the fortress A.A. umbrella. Sabo-
tage was regarded as ithe main threat,
particularly during the initial stages of war.

-116. The defence of aerodromes on the main-
land was a more difficult problem. There were
three areas of major importance: —

(i) N.£. Malaya—Kelantan aerodromes.
(ii) B. Coast Malaya—Kuantan.
(iii) N.W. Malaya—Kedah aerodromes,

It was some of these aerodromes which had
been sited in tactically weak positions for the
reasons given in para 114. Some were even in
exposed positions close to favourable landing
beaches. The desirablility, from an administra-
tive view-point, of selecting sites close to
existing communications and sources of labour
had contributed to this dangerous situation.

It meant that the Field army on the west
coast, down which the main enemy thrust on
land was expected to develop, had to make
large detachments to protect aerodromes on
the east coast.

117. On the east coast, the direct defence
of aerodromes was the prime function of the
Army. Accordingly, the Brigadiers at Kota
Bahru and Kuantan were, by agreement
between the A.O.C. and G.O.C., appointed
Aerodrome Defence Commanders in their re-
spective areas. The arrangement, with certain
safeguards, worked well and resulted in good
co-ordination of the resources available for
defence.

118. The training, experience, quality and
numbers of the forces manning the defences
of the aerodromes other than those at Kota
Bahru and Kuantan were much under require-
ments. They were mostly Indian State troops,
who had had little opportunity for training in
this specialised work. A further handicap was
a general paucity of weapons of all kinds,
particularly A.A. guns and their equipment.

119. Every effort was made to improve the
defences of -aerodromes against ground attack.
Old tanks, armoured cars and any form of
weapons were sought from other Commands
and from the U.S.A. H.Q.M.C. did its best,
but the men and weapons required could not
be made available. Assistance was also given
by the Naval Base and later by the Dutch.
Financial authority was given by the A.O.C.
in the autumn to put in hand urgent work on
defence schemes of mainland aérodromes with-
out the necessity for prior reference to A.H.Q.

120. Joint Army and R.A.F. Aerodrome
Defence Boards were set up about July, 1941,
throughout Malaya to co-ordinate defence
schemes; and thereafter care was taken to
ensure that the defence aspect was considered
at the outset when new aerodrome construction
was put in hand.

12r, Full instructions were prepared and
issued to guide local Commanders in preparing
denial and destruction schemes, and arrange-
ments were made for obstructing airfields not in
use.

122. The first two major aerodrome defence
exercises were held in the late summer in the
presence of large numbers of Army spectators
for instructional purposes: one was held at
Tengah with the co-operation of Fortress troops,
and one at Kluang in Johore with the Australian
Division.

123. Finally, in conjunction with A H.Q. and
H.Q.M.C., G.H.Q. produced about this time a,
handbook on aerodrome defence which detailed
the probable scale of attack to which each
would be subject, the minimum defences
required, and the priority of their provision.

Co-operation with A.A. Defences.

124. During the latter half of 1941, A.A.
equipments rapidly increased in number, in
Singapore especially, and demands for air co-
operation for the training of A.A, crews multi-
plied accordingly. Special aircraft for the
purpose were few, so A.A. defence exercises
were combined with other forms of training in
order to make full use of flying hours. Never-
theless, this resulted in many flying hours of
operational units, which were all too precious
for their own training, being expended on this
work; yet the A.A. Defence Commander's
requirements were never approachéd.

Photographic Survey.

125. Photographic survey of large areas in
Malaya for both the Army and the Civil Gov-
ernment was another commitment which had to
be met. It necessitated the allotment and
training of a special flight.

126. During July, 1941, a staff conference
was held at H.Q. Malaya Command which was
attended, it is believed, by representatives of
G.H.Q., H.Q.M.C., IIE (Indian) Corps and
A.H.Q. It was called to consider a War Office
project for the occupation of the Kra Isthmus
by a joint Army/R.A.F, force from Malaya,
the object of which was to deny to the Japanese
the port and aerodrome facilities in it (which,
if exploited, constituted the main threat to.
Malaya) by meeting and defeating him on the
beaches.

127. It was evident that the development of
the aerodromes there by the Siamese could only
be linked up with the spread of the Japanese
over Indo-China and their increasing influence
in Bangkok. It appeared obvious that they
would soon contain all the facilities required by
Japanese aircraft, particularly fighters, which
would then be abie to support effectively land-
ings in Southern Siam and Northern Malaya.
The A.H.Q. representative was consequently in
favour, at the least, of a raid to destroy these
facilities.

Planning: Operation

128. The conference finally adopted a plan
for seizing and holding the Singora area and
“‘ The Ledge ’’ position on the Patani Road,
but only if:— 5

(a) a minimum of 24 hours’ start of the
enemy was available;

(6) the opportunity occurred during the
North-East Monsoon, (Qctober/ March), i.e.,
when the Japanese would not ape able to
employ tanks off the roads,

This plan. was known as ‘‘ Operation
Matador’, The A.H.Q. representative was
strongly pressed to state definitely what squad-
rons would be available to take part in it, with
particular reference to breaking the railway run-
ning south from Bangkok, along which it was
presumed a Japanese advance would come con-
currently with any attack from seaward. An
offer was made of a Singapore III flying boat to
