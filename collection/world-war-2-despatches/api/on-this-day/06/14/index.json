Our losses in pilots during the first two weeks of the intensive period had been far lighter than at the height of the Battle of Britain; and our losses in aircraft over the same period not beyond our capacity to replace. Bomber Command had lost fifteen aircraft in   Circus   operations since 14th June, and in the course of a daylight attack on German capital ships at Brest and La Pallice had suffered the rather more serious loss of sixteen bombers out of 115 despatched."

            "description": "150. Up to this time 46   Circus   operations had been carried out since 14th June. In those six weeks escort and support had been given to 374 bomber sorties and over 8,000 fighter sorties flown. We had lost 123 fighter pilots but it was hoped that many more German fighters than this had been destroyed. In addition, over 1,000 fighter sorties had been flown in support of 32 bomber operations against shipping, including the operations against the German capital ships on 24th July and an attack on the docks at Le Havre on roth June. Fighter sweeps without bombers accounted for approximately another 800 sorties, and operation   Rhubarb  resumed on 16th July after a month's pause for a further 61. Altogether the six weeks  intensive effort had meant the expenditure of nearly 10,000 offensive sorties by my Command. This was an impressive total, but to preserve perspective it must be remembered that the effort devoted to defensive purposes was still greater, approximately this number of sorties being expended during the same period on the protection of shipping alone. :"

A similar operation on 16th June was followed on 17th June by the most ambitious  (Circus  yet attempted. This involved an attack on a Chemical Plant and Power Station near Bethune by eighteen Blenheim bombers, escorted by no less than 22 squadrons of fighters. The enemy fighter force reacted vigorously, and although we lost nine pilots, those who weturned reported a very favourable outcome of their combats, It seemed that the long-expected   fighter battle on terms tactically favourable to ourselves   had come at last. aoa"

On 14th June I received an answer from Gazzera to my message, in which he stated at considerable length that he had left General Bisson to negotiate and that outrages against the civil population would be the responsibility of the British. To this I replied curtly that there was no military or political advantage to me in the occupation of Sirs, for the present, and I accepted no responsibility for the safety of the city. I also told Brigadier Fowkes that I would be satisfied with the surrender of all troops south of Mendi, which was in fact the whole of the Italian Southern Command."

On 14th June the Germans renewed their pressure on the Tenth French Army front, but most of their tanks and aircraft appeared to have been diverted on a south-easterly axis towards Paris. A fairly sharp infantry attack developed on the left flank of the 157th Infantry Brigade, which suffered some 50 casualties, and the French infantry on their left, as well-as the French artillery supporting them, retired hastily, leaving the brigade in the lurch. Asa result of this pressure the Tenth French Army withdrew south-west a distance of 30 miles to the wooded area north-west of Mortagne. As the Arm e de Paris was retiring almost due south on the Loire, this divergence of the lines of retreat of the two armies created a gap of some 30 miles on the right flank of the Tenth Army."

Kesselring had at last managed to shift sufficient strength westwards to feel secure against a serious outflanking by Fifth Army up the west coast and he was beginning to feel the benefit of the fresh reinforcements he had received from elsewhere. He could now put twenty to twenty-one of his twenty-six divisions into the line. The revival of his strength was shown by the stiff action at Bagnoregio which delayed the fall of Orvieto to 78 Division until 14th June. IV Corps on the extreme left also had to fight hard for Orbetello and Grosseto; the latter fell on the 15th but little advance had been made beyond it by the zoth, for the Ombrone river was a difficult obstacle.

This was the system on which I had worked in Tunisia and Sicily and, now that the comparatively static period of the winter was over, I was anxious to be as close behind the Armies as possible. On rqth June I opened this advanced headquarters at Frascati, using for offices a small building which had previously been used for the same purpose by Field-Marshal Kesselring. This was soon left too far behind by the speed of our advance, and on 25th June I moved to a camp site on the eastern shores of Lake Bolsena."
