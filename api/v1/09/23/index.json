            "description": "I flew to Diego Suarez on 23rd September to discuss the possibility of landing with RearAdmiral Tennant. After an exhaustive examination, we reluctantly came to the conclusion that such an operation was not feasible. The swell and surf prevalent at that time of the year, and poor beaches, offered no chance of getting ashore, undamaged, even the minimum of mechanical transport. The same conditions obtained at Fort Dauphin. At Tulear in the South-West the situation was slightly better, but it was still not possible, in a reasonable time, to land sufficient mechanical transport. The port had some facilities which, together with the airfield and possibilities of establishing a sea-plane base, would make it of use for patrolling the Mozambique Channel. It was decided to establish a small garrison there. This was effected by H.M.S. \u2018\u2018 Birmingham,\u201d H.M.S. \u201c Inconstant,\u2019\u201d\u201d H.M.A.S. \u201c\u2018 Napier \u2019\u2019 and H.M.N.S. \u2018\u2018 Vangalen \u2019\u2019 landing two companies of the Pretoria Regiment and a few armoured cars from Diego Suarez on 29th September."

In view of impending developments, chiefly the absorption of A.E.A.F. into S.H.A.E.F., these plans were not put into operation. Headquarters, Advanced A.E.A.F. was therefore merged into Headquarters Main A.E.A.F. at 1200 hours on 23rd September, 1944."

A darkened vessel was sighted at about 2100Z off the entrance to Langfiord but was lost to sight in a snow squall, The western end of Stjernsund was reached by 2350Z.
