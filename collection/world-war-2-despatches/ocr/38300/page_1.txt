WEDNESDAY,

THE CARRIER BORNE AIRCRAFT
ATTACK ON KIRKENES AND PETSAMO.

The following Despatch was submitted to the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on the
rath September, 1941, by Admiral Sty John
C. Tovey, K.C.B., D.S.O., Commander-in-
Chief, Home Fleet. <

Home Fleet.
1ath September, 1941.

Forwarded. The material results of this
operation were small and the losses heavy.
This had been expected. The heaviest losses
occurred in the squadrons from the
VICTORIOUS and there is no doubt that
some of the survivors felt that an attack on
such poor targets against heavy opposition was
not justified and their morale was rather shaken
until they appreciated the political necessity

4 for the operation.

2. Attacks by low performance aircraft in
broad daylight where fighter opposition is
present can only hope to achieve results com-
mensurate with their losses if complete surprise
is obtained. On this occasion the force was
extremely fortunate in thé weather conditions
which allowed it to make the long approach
to the flying-off position without being seen;
but the good fortune did not last quite long
enough, and they were reported by an enemy
aircraft just before the Striking Force left.

3. It would perhaps have been better to time
the attack to take place during the night, even
in this region of perpetual summer daylight, in
the hope that the enemy reconnaissance and
defences would then ‘be less alert. This would
also have avoided an approach directly into the
sun.

4. The lack of enterprise on the part of the
enemy which enabled the force to withdraw

without being attacked . by aircraft. is

encouraging.

5. I concur in the remarks of the Rear
Admiral Commanding, First Cruiser Squadron,
in paragraph 53 of his report. The lack of time
for traming and preparation was mainly
responsible for such small errors in execution
as took place. I concur also in paragraph 54.
It was not possible for the force to provide its
own reconnaissance without sacrificing the vital
factor of surprise. I consider it essential that
steps should be taken to remedy the present
complete lack of air reconnaissance in Northern
and Noithwestern Norway.

6. With reference to paragraph 52 of the
report of the Rear Admiral Commanding, First
the importance of the
Command being in the carrier’ in purely air
operations is appreciated; but, although the
question did not arise on this.occasion, it is
considered preferable in the case of surface
attack that the Senior Officer. should be in a
ship of the supporting force.

7. The gallantry of the aircraft crews, who
knew before leaving that their chance of sur-
prise had gone and that they were certain ‘to
face heavy odds, is beyond praise. The
conduct of the operation by the Rear Admiral
Commanding, First Cruiser Squadron, the
handling of ships by their Commanding Officers
in most difficult conditions, the keenness and
efficiency of all officers and men, especially of
the deck handling parties in the carriers, are
much to be commended. I trust that the
encouragement to the morale of our Allies was,
proportionately great.
