The enemy was, therefore, prepared to yield ground and the fact that he was fallang back voluntarily as we advanced made it difficult for him to detect the greater weight of our attacks on this occasion compared with tthe following-up attacks by which the Poles had up to now been pressing him back up the Adriatic coast.

After 25th August, 1943, supply convoys, which hitherto had come from North Africa and Middle East, began to arrive direct from the United Kingdom and United States. This shifting of the base back to the producer countries meant that it was necessary to submit long-term forecasts of requirements sometimes weeks before arrival. The effect was a loss of flexibility with a consequent waste of shipping and congestion of ports, due to convoys arriving with stores which were not immediately needed, or in excess of current requirements.",

In the eastern halt there are only the two roads which lead to Forli and Cesena and both these run northeast instead of due north. Lateral communication is infinitely better on the northern side of the mountains than on the southern. On the latter movement from east to west is limited to a few poor roads across the mountains but on the Germans  side the Via Emilia, Route g, runs along the whole length of the position. It is a broad, straight road on the flat, with numerous short roads leading  off it into the mountains, for the crest line is nearer the southern than thea northern edge and the secondary road system on the latter is therefore much more developed. This is an enormous advantage to the defender, for in the defence of a line it is vital to be able to move forces rapidly from one sector to another where the threat is greatest.   The original German plan for Italy, as Hitler told Mussolini at the Feltre conference in July, 1943, was to hold nothing south of the line of the Northern Apennines so that the preliminary reconnaissances for the   Gothic   line were probably carried out about that time.  Work appears to have begun in September, 1943. The first work was done at the two ends, in the coastal plain south of La Spezia and behind the Foglia river on the Adriatic, and in the centre, where elaborate defences were constructed on the Futa Pass. Italian forced labour and a Slovak Technical Brigade were used; but as the winter of 1943 progressed most of the labour force was diverted to work on the   Gustav ,   Hitler ? and   Caesar   lines, and it was not until the fall of Rome that priority was restored to the  * Gothic   line and the work was pushed ahead at the highest pressure. It was principally to gain more time to allow for the   Gothic   line to ber completed that Kesselring fought the battles of Lake Trasimene and Arezzo. At one time it was expected that it would be ready by 30th June but in fact our attack on the Adriatic on 25th August found many of the defences on the Foglia still unfinished while in some of the more inaccessible mountain sectors they were only in the early stages of development. The total length of the line of defences was about two hundred miles. In the west the . approaches to La Spezia and the valley of the Magra were barred by a system of anti-tank defences in depth with two artificial obstacles seven miles apart; this was the only example of defence in depth in the system. From the tegion of Carrara the line swung south-east",
