            "description": "His Majesty's Government were at length persuaded that the delay was inevitable. They were warned that even then the attack could be launched, only if no more of our forces were withdrawn to the Far East. Moreover it was imperative that both Malta and the Middle East should be reinforced with aircraft, and heavy bombers in particular, so that we might effectively impede enemy shipping to Libya which our existing naval and air forces were practically unable to do. But, when His Majesty's Government found themselves unable to provide the reinforcements we asked and were obliged  to order more of our air forces to be sent to the Far East, the Middle East Defence Committee were compelled to represent to them that the offensive could not now be undertaken before the middle of June. We pointed out the grave dangers to which the northern flank would be exposed in the event of Soviet resistance collapsing and our continuing with the offensive in North Africa. The whole matter was thoroughly reviewed, and His Majesty's Government ruled that the offensive should be launched by the 15th June notwithstanding."

            "description": "By this time the process of encirclement had begun. On the 15th June the enemy left Acroma in peace for the time being and turned his attention to El Adem; at the same time he pushed strong patrols forward to Belhamed and Sidi Rezegh. The goth Light Division, supported by tanks, attacked E] Adem three times. But the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade, with the help of columns from the 7th Motor Brigade from the south and from the rth Indian Infantry Brigade from the north, repulsed all three attacks. Our air forces also gave effective and unstinted assistance."

Longprepared defence plans were immediately put into operation. Direct responsibility for this defence was allotted to Air Marshal Sir Roderic Hill, K.C.B., M.C., A.F.C., the Air Marshal Commanding Air Defence of Great Britain. Additional guns and balloons were deployed to counter these weapons, whilst airborne and fighter patrols were put up both over the Channel and south of London. The United States forces contributed wholeheartedly to this defence with A.A. guns and fighter patrols. Large scale bombing operations were also undertaken against the launching sites and their ancillary installations. The diversion of effort from   Overlord   tasks now assumed larger proportions."

In this directive it was laid down that, apart from the air units coming under his direct command, the A.O.C. B.A.F. wag also responsible for co-ordinating the planning and execution of trans-Adriatic operations by all the three services. The land forces affected were known as Land Forces Adriatic (L.F.A.), while the naval forces concerned were those under the command of Flag Officer, Taranto and Liaison with the Italians (F.O.T.A.L.I.).

I therefore decided to attack on 15th June."

I came to the conclusion that so small an effort did not justify the major re-disposition of the anti-aircraft defences required by the   Overlord-Diver   Plan. The Chiefs of Staff agreed. I therefore gave orders that the plan was not to be put into effect until we could see more clearly what was going to happen. In. the meantime the existing defences were authorised to engage pilotless aircraft on the same terms as ordinary aircraft. I had already arranged that a visual reconnaissance of the most likely launching areas should be flown; and at the instance of the Air Ministry several attacks were made on three of the socalled   supply sites   on the 13th, rq4th and 15th June.

I therefore asked the Emperor to send down his representatives to divert the patriots to fighting the Italian forces, leaving only sufficient to maintain the pressure on Gimma. On 17th June the Emperor's representatives arrived on the spot, but it was reported to me that they had failed in their task.
