            "description": "Our hopes of reaching Bengasi in time were soon dashed. The recent rains had been unusually heavy and many parts of the southern slopes of the Gebel Akhdar, which the Support Group had to traverse, were under water. Their own progress was greatly retarded, and that of their supply echelons was rendered even more difficult, with the result that in a short while they were held up for lack of petrol. On the 21st December, therefore, General Gott decided to abandon the attempt and ordered the Support Group to advance on Antelat instead, leaving only a small column to press on to Bengasi."

It was essential to maintain this momentum and take full advantage of the enemy weakness. Thus the situation demanded that quicker, and therefore simpler, ways of capturing the island be devised than the original fairly large-scale amphibious operation in mid-February or later. Accordingly Lieutenant-General Christison, with Rear-Admiral Martin and Air Commodore the Earl of Bandon, prepared new plans. These were considered by the Supreme Allied Commander, with the Naval and Air Commandersin-Chief and myself, at a conference at my Advanced Headquarters at Barrackpore on the . 21st December. From the outset it was realised that, in the event of the enemy weakening further, even these new plans would be too slow and elaborate, and it was agreed that if circumstances allowed it, emergency plans for the quickest possible occupation of the island \u2014known as Operation \u201c Lightning \u201d\u2014should be carried out. The plans for a fully opposed landing were, nevertheless, very carefully examined. It should be remembered that this operation was the first combined operation to be undertaken in the theatre, and the importance of its complete success, as affecting the subsequent larger ones we were going to underexe pa very much in the minds of all concerned."
