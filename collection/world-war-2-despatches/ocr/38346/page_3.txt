HOUSTON, the latter with very little ammuni-
tion and her after turret out of action, from
previous bombing. No destroyers remained in
company.* .

No further reconnaissance reports of the
enemy convoy had been received since night-
fall. The Allied cruisers were under continual
air observation and illumination by flares. To
continue the action was clearly hopeless and
PERTH had no hesitation in deciding to with-
draw the remnants of the striking force.
HOUSTON was ordered to follow and course
was shaped at high speed for Tanjong Priok.

20. The withdrawal was not opposed by
enemy surface forces. HOUSTON and PERTH
were located by enemy reconnaissance aircraft

. a.m. 28th when within 60 miles of Priok. In
response to a ‘“‘Help’”’ call from PERTH,
fighter aircraft were sent out from Batavia and
escorted the cruisers in; no air attack developed
on them. They arrived at Priok at 1330.

az. It should be noted that throughout this
action the Allied forces suffered ,from com«
munication difficulnes. The force as a whole
had never acted before as a tactical unit.
Visual signalling was restricted to simple signals
in English by flashing lamp in Morse Code.
British Liaison Officers with small signal staffs
were on board DE RUYTER and JAVA, but
it had not been practicable to adopt a common
system of flag signalling.

Action Narrative—Day and Night Action Off
Sourabaya, 27th Febrwary, 1942.

(All times zone — 74.)

At about 1425 the Striking Force was ap-
proaching the minefields off Sourabaya.
Squadron consisted of DE RUYTER (Flag),
EXETER, HOUSTON, PERTH, JAVA,
ELECTRA, ENCOUNTER, JUPITER, two
Dutch destroyers and four U.S. destroyers. The
force was returning from an abortive. sweep,
édrried out the night before.

2. At 1427 a message was received giving the
position of the convoy in the vicinity of
Bawean Island.

DE RUYTER immediately turned 180° and
led the force off to intercept. British destroyers
were spread ahead, Dutch on the port quarter
and U.S. destroyers astern. The order of the
cruisers was as in paragraph 1. HOUSTON’s
after turret was out of action due to a previous
bombing attack.

3. At 1550, squadron was on course 315°,
24 knots. At 1614 an enemy cruiser was sighted
on starboard bow. Speed was increased to
26 knots. Enemy now appeared as two 8 in.
cruisers (Natai class) and ahead of them was

one cruiser (Zintu class) and six destroyers
(Asashio class). At 1616 the enemy 8 in,
cruisers opened fire at a range of 30,000 yards
directing their fire mostly on EXETER and
HOUSTON. ZINTU opened fire about the
same time on ELECTRA, at 1617 EXETER
opened fire, HOUSTON at 1618.

4. DE RUYTER led round about 20° to port
and range of 8 in. cruisers remained at about
26,000 to 28,000 yards for some time. PERTH
could not open fire as the range was outside
extreme, but at about 1625 PERTH opened
fire on the right-hand destroyers (the destroyers
appeared to be moving in preparatory to
attack). | The second salvo hit, but umme-
diately this destroyer and the others made
smoke and retired behind a very effective screen
with the cruisers. Several “ follow up”
salvos were fired into the smoke.

accurate, mostly pitching very close short or -
over. The spredd was incredibly small, never

extremely small splashes.

Enemy aircraft were overhead the whole
time, no doubt spotting.

6. At 1635 DE RUYTER led towards the
enemy on course 267°. About this time the
rear enemy cruiser was evidently hit in the
boiler room as she emitted. very large clouds
of black smoke for some time, but continued
firing. As the smoke cleared one enemy
destroyer was seen to be on fire, and PERTH
now came under a very accurate fire from the
rear cruiser for a long period. The other
cruiser was firing straight at EXETER and
HOUSTON. PERTH was straddled several
times and the salvos rarely fell less than one
cable over or short. Every effort was made
in handling the ship to estimate the correction
the enemy would use. .

7. The tear enemy cruiser was. now on fire.
PERTH was still out of range of enemy
cruisers and I found a long period of being
** Aunt Sally ’’ very trying without being able
to return the fire. (Range was still over 26,000
yards.) The Dutch cruisers all this while were
firing occasionally. At 1700. enemy cruisers
checked fire. At 1702, the leading enemy
cruiser appeared to be hit aft but both cruisers
opened fire again. At 1707 the enemy de-
stroyers delivered a long range torpedo attack
and Alhed cruisers had to turn away to let
torpedoes comb the line. Allied cruisers ceased
fire. Enemy still firing but shots falling short.
At 1714 EXETER stopped and reported hit in
boiler room. She shortly proceeded at 15 knots
and I closed her and screened her with funnel
smoke and all available smoke floats. While
doing this the Admiral made ‘‘ All ships fol-
low me’”’ but I continued to smoke screen
EXETER and reported her damage to the
Admiral who told me by V/S* to follow him,
when I proceeded to do so.

8. At 1715 an Allied destroyer (I think
ELECTRA) suddenly blew up close ahead of
me,f having, I think, been struck in the
engine room by a torpedo. She capsized and
