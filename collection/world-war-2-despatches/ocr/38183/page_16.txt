was not until the 13th November, 1941, that
permission was given to send up bombs. The
petrol and bombs were consigned to the
Chinese, who took charge of them.

71. The second form of assistance to China
was with their guerillas. It was agreed that
fifteen special Chinese guerilla companies should
be formed initially, and that each should have
a squad of fifteen British and Indian personnel
attached to it. These squads would be specially
trained in the use of explosives and in carrying
out demolitions, and would be kept supplied
by us with the necessary material. It was
proposed eventually to double the number of
guerilla companies, and consequently of the
squads. These squads went through a thorough
training in Burma, including living under the
conditions they would experience when operat-
ing with the Chinese guerillas.

72. The whole organisation for the supply
to the aerodromes and to the guerilla squads
was based on Barma. It was known first as
Chi Base and later as Tulip. Lieutenant-Colonel
McFeat was in charge; his own headquarters
were at Rangoon, the training of guerilla squads
was catried out at Maymyo, and stores of all
sorts were sent up to Lashio and to Bhamo.
A mechanical transport organisation for for-
warding stores and supplies was in progress,
but by no means complete in vehicles by the
qth December. Signalling and medical facili-
ties were deficient for most of the guerilla
squads. Tulip was directly under my head-
quarters till war with Japan broke out, when
it was transferred, as planned, to General
Officer Commanding, Burma.

73. On their part, the Chinese promised not
only to help in the defence of Burma with the
American Volunteer Group (see para. 25
above), but also to send troops to Burma if
required, and to threaten the Japanese northern
flank should they advance against Burma via
Chieng Rai. They also peomied to help in the
defence of Hong Kong by an advance towards
Canton.

They kept their promises.

74. A Chinese Military Mission visited Burma
and Singapore in April and May, 1941, and
various Chinese officers also paid visits indi-
vidually, including General Mow, of the Chinese
Air Force, who was in Singapore from the roth
to the 25th June, x941, and stayed in my
house. Certain members of my staff visited
Chungking.

Siam and Indo-China.

75. The dominating factor influencing the
actions of the Siamese authorities was fear.
Our attitude towards the Siamese was governed
by the desire to keep on as friendly terms as
possible, and to encourage them to resist any
encroachment by Japan. The latter was some-
what difficult because it was quite impracticable
for us to take any effective military action to
prevent Japanese penetration of Siam. Further,
as the Siamese quite rightly pointed out, they
were very short of equipment, especially air-
craft and anti-aircraft, tank-and anti-tank, so
that, if they could not get help from us or the
United States, there was little they could do but
to comply with Japanese demands. Definite
proposals were made in October, roqr, for
giving the Siamese a few weapons, but nothing
was actually sent.

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 22 JANUARY, 10948

It was suggested in March, 1941, that we
should adopt a strong line with the Siamese.
ft is, however, at least doubtful whether, if
we had done so, the Siamese would have been
willing or able to render any effective aid when
the Japanese attacked their country. As events
turned out, in spite of statements by the
Siamese Prime Minister, the resistance offered
by the Siamese for us lasted only a few hours
at Battambang on the frontier east of Bangkol.
whereas British troops advancing into Southern
Siam were opposed by the Siamese after the
Japanese had landed.

76. At the time of my arrival in Singapore,

the Japanese had troops in Tongking, at the
northern end of Indo-China. This in itself
was no direct threat to Burma or Malaya. To
some extent it was a threat to the Chinese
section of the road from Burma to China, but
there seemed some reason to believe that the
original purpose for which these troops were
sent there was to extricate Japanese forces in
Kwangsi, who were malaria-ridden and in a
difficult position.
- 77. In the latter part of 1940, Siamese
Ministers, possibly encouraged by the Japanese,
had stimulated their country to demand the
return to Siam of certain areas that had been
taken by the French some years before. This
eventually led to a mild form of hostilities
between the two countries concerned.
Endeavours were made at Singapore by the
Governor, Commander-in-Chief, China, and
myself to bring about a settlement without
posing as official mediators, but these en-
deavours were unsuccessful. By the end of
January, 1941, the Japanese had been recog-
nised as the mediators, and thus scored a diplo-
matic success.

98. We had concluded an economic agree-
ment with the Vichy French authorities in Indo-
China, and they professed themselves anxious
to develop friendly relations. In spite of this
an agreement between them and the Japanese
was announced on the 24th July, 1941. Its
terms allowed the Japanese to maintain forces
in the South of Indo-China. A Japanese con-
voy began to arrive at Saigon on the 26th,
and by the end of July Hig Japahes were well
established in that town. More important still,
this movement gave the Japanese complete
control of Camranh Harbour, and they quicklw
started to make or improve aerodromes to the
South and West of Saigon. As was expected,
the Japanese did not limit themselves for long
to the terms of the agreement, and the French
authorities made practically no effort to oppose
either the original terms or the successive en-
croachments. The effect of this expansion on
the defence of the Far East is indicated below
(paras. 93 et seq.).

VIII.â€”-DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRITISH AIR
FORCES IN THE Far East.
General Position.

79. In their paper of the 15th August, 1940,
the Chiefs of Staff estimated the air strength
necessary for the Far East as 336 first-line air-
craft, to which, of course, had to be added
reserves.

In the Singapore Conference of October,
1940, the final strength of the Royal Air Force
recommended for the Far East was 582 air-
craft, an increase of sixteen over that given
in the appreciation dated the 16th October,
