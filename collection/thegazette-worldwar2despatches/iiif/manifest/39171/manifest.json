In spite of these\nhandicaps the spirit of 4 Corps remained as\nhigh as ever and officers and men fought\nsplendidly throughout the long battle. This,\ncoupled with the determination and vigour dis-\nplayed by 33 Corps, led, in the words of the\nSupreme Allied Commander, to the Japanese\nArmy suffering a defeat greater than ever\nbefore in its history.\n\nFort Hertz.\n\n98. This isolated outpost, in the extreme\nnorth of Burma, was originally occupied by a\n‘small detachment in September 1942, in order\nto protect the landing ground and to raise and\nsupport Kachin Levies to operate towards\nMyitkyina. These Levies have carried out\nmany very successful operations and, indeed, at\none time, became such a thorn in the side of\nthe enemy that the Japanese made a direct\nthreat against Fort Hertz. To counter this,\nthe 4th Battalion, The Burma Regiment was\nflown there from India at the end of November\n\n99. In November 1943, the Americans agreed\nto maintain the Fort Hertz garrison by air, as\nthere was no road link with India. Command\nof this detachment was transferred to General\nStilwell in February 1944,\n\n100. These troops, including the Levies, after\nmany skirmishes, subsequently made a steady\nadvance down the Mali Hka Valley (which con-\nstitutes the headwaters of the Irrawaddy), in\nconjunction with General Stilwell’s forces\nmoving south from Ledo. They did most use-\nful work, inflicting many casualties on small\nenemy parties, and by the 19th March they had\noccupied Sumprabum: From the beginning of\nJune they co-operated with the Chinese-\nAmerican troops in the Myitkyina area.\n\nNorthern Burma-Ledo-Myitkyina.\n\n101. The réle allotted to the Chinese troops\nwhich were under the command of General\nStilwell in India, in January, was to advance\non Mogaung and Myitkyina with the object\nof covering the construction of an overland\n\n1361\n\nroute to China via Ledo and Myitkyina and of\nsecuring the air route from Assam to China.\nThis force, known originally as the Chinese\nArmy in India (C.A.1.), which had been trained\nwith the help of American officers and\nequipped with American material, comprised\ninitially 22 and 38 Chinese Divisions, and was\njoined later by 30 Chinese Division. These\nthree divisions were subsequently reinforced\nby 50 and 14 Chinese Divisions, which were\nflown from China in April and May respec-\ntively. The force was completed by the addi-\ntion of U.S. 5307 Provisional Regiment, con-\nsisting of three battalions of Long-Range\nPenetration troops which had trained with\nMajor-General Wingate’s Special Force in\nIndia and were now being used as medium-\nrange penetration battalions. Known officially\nby the code name “Galahad Force”, they\nwere more usually referred to—after the name\nof their commander—as Merrill’s Marauders.\n\n102. General Stilwell, the Deputy Supreme\nAllied Commander, South-East Asia Com-\nmand, personally assumed command of these\ntroops in the Field. They never formed part\nof my Army Group, but General Stilwell\nagreed, until C.AJ. forces had captured\nKamaing, to accept instructions from General\nSlim, who was, of course, under my command.\n\n103. On the 17th May, C.A.I. had reached\nthe outskirts of Myitkyina and captured the\nairfield, Galahad Force having contributed\nmuch to this very notable advance. Kamaing\nwas captured on the 16th June and Mogaung\ninvested. The situation in the Mogaung Valley\non the 22nd June was that the Japanese in\nthe Kamaing area were being forced into the\nsouthern end of the valley; while Special\nForce was attacking their supply lines in the\narea north of Indaw. Special Force also had\na detachment, known as “ Morrisforce”,\nblocking the Myitkyina—Bhamo road.\n\n104. Supply of all forces was largely by air,\nas owing to the weather the construction of\nthe Ledo Road did not keep pace with the\nadvance of the troops.\n\nSpecial Force.\n\n105. I have already mentioned Special\nForce. This Force consisted of six Long-\nRange Penetration Brigades, which were\nspecially selected, trained, organised and\nequipped by the late Major-General Wingate\nto give them the maximum mobility in jungle\nfighting. The plan was to concentrate this\nForce within a circle of forty miles radius from\nIndaw, with the objects of :—\n\n(@) Assisting the advance of the Chinese-\nAmerican forces on Myitkyina by drawing\noff and harassing the Japanese forces op-\nposing them, and by preventing reinforce-\nments reaching them.\n\n(b) Creating a situation which would en-\nable the Chinese forces to advance from\n‘Yunnan.\n\n(c) Causing confusion, damage and loss to\nthe enemy forces in North Burma.\n\nI hoped that General Wingate’s operations\nmight also interfere with the Japanese advance\nagainst Imphal.\n\n106. The operations of both Special Force\nand the Sino-American forces moving south\nfrom Ledo were co-ordinated by the Com-\nmander, Fourteenth Army.\n",

The operations of Special Force began\non the night of the 5th-6th March, and be-\ntween then and the night of the 10th-11th\nMarch nearly six hundred Dakota and one hun-\ndred glider sorties carried 77 and 111 L.R-P.\nBrigades, totalling 9,500 troops and 1,100\nanimals, into the heart of Japanese-occupied\nBurma. The initial réle of these glider-borne\nforces was to secure sites for and to prepare\nlanding strips west of the Irrawaddy. Last\nminute air reconnaissance disclosed that one of\nthe two potential strips selected, thirty-five miles\nnorth-east of Katha (called “ Piccadilly ”) had\nbeen deliberately obstructed. General Sim, who\nwas present at the starting point when this\nnews was received, was faced with the difficult\ndecision whether to launch the operation, since\nit appeared that the enemy had got wind of\nit, or to postpone it until fresh plans could\nbe made. He decided to let the operation go\nforward and on the first night the landings\nwere confined to one strip only, called “ Broad-\nway ”, which was some twenty-seven milessouth-\neast of Hopin on the Myitkyina—Mandalay\nrailway.\n\n108. The landings at Broadway, and subse-\nquently on another strip (‘ Chowringhee ”)\nsome twenty miles south-south-east of Katha,\nachieved complete surprise and until the 12th\nMarch no ground opposition was met. Air\nattacks did not begin until the 10th and were\ndirected against the Chowringhee strip which,\nby that time, had fulfilled its purpose and had\nbeen abandoned. The Broadway strip was not\nattacked until the 13th March, when our\nfighters were present and A.A. defences had\nbeen established. The Japanese lost about\n50 per cent. of their attacking aircraft.\n\n109. Our losses during the initial fly-in\namounted to only one per cent. of the total\npersonnel transported. The only animal casualty\nwas one mule. The smallness of these losses is\nremarkable in view of the fact that, at the\npeak period of the fly-in, double the planned\neffort was achieved, and aircraft were coming\nin and taking off at the rate of one “ landing ”\nand one “ take-off” every three minutes.\n\n110. A special American air force, called\nNo. 1 Air Commando, had been formed to\nco-operate both tactically and administratively\nwith Special Force. It was a composite force\ncomprising some 250 aircraft—long- and short-\nrange fighters, light bombers, Dakotas and\ngliders. This force carried out the hazardous\nand difficult glider-borne operations, flying fully\nladen gliders, some in double tow, over 9,000\nfoot mountains by night, a distance of 300 miles\nto the selected area. Equally important was\nthe action of the fighters and bombers of this\nforce, before, during, and after the actual\n‘landings, against targets which it was vital to\nattack. No. 221 Group, R.A.F., also did splen-\ndid work in these operations. I wish to ex-\npress my appreciation of the work carried out\nby these air forces, without whose assistance\nSpecial Force could not have operated.\n\n111. 77 and 111 L.R.P.

Brigade, whose fly-in was com-\npleted by the 4th April. 3 (West African)\nBrigade, which formed part of Special Force,\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\nwas to have operated in the same way as the\nother brigades of the Force. But before the\noperations actually started, it was decided to\nsplit up the brigade and attach one battalion\nto each of the 77, 111 and 14 Brigades, to act as\na garrison for the stronghold which was to\nform the base of each of the three above-men-\ntioned brigades. 3 (West African) Brigade com-\npleted its fly-in by the 12th April. These for-\nmations used airstrips established near Manhton\n(“ Aberdeen ”), twenty-seven miles north-north-\nwest of Indaw ; Mawlu (“White City ”), twenty.\nmiles north of Katha, and in the Hopin area.\nDuring this second phase some 6,000 troops,\n850 animals and 550,000 Ibs. of stores were\ntransported with the very slight casualties of\n15 killed (all in one aircraft) and six injured.\n\n112. General Wingate originally estimated\nthat about twelve weeks would be the maximum\nperiod which troops would be able to with-\nstand the rigorous conditions under which they\nwould be called upon to operate. His original\nplan, therefore, was (i) to march in 16 L.R.P.\nBrigade from Ledo, because the route was\nknown to be practicable and this formation\nwould be able to co-operate more closely with\nGeneral Stilwell’s forces advancing in the same\narea, and (ii) later to fly in 77 and 111 L.R.P.\nBrigades, retaining the other brigades as a\n“second wave” which might, or might not,\nbe used to operate during the monsoon, in relief\nof the three brigades sent in initially. This\nplan was later modified, however, as General\nSlim decided to fly in 14 and 3 (West African)\nBrigades early in April. On the 5th February\n16 Brigade marched in from Ledo as planned,\nvia Singkaling Hkamti, after a long march\nduring which it had a few minor engagements,\nand began operations in the Indaw area in\nMarch. 23 L.R.P. Brigade was sent into\nBurma, but was subsequently employed by\nthe Army Commander in the Naga Hills and\nManipur area in co-operation with 33 Corps.\n\n113. It is impossible, in a report of this\nnature, to give a detailed summary of the\nvaried activities of the five brigades of Special\nForce which operated independently in North\nBurma. The damage they inflicted on the\nenemy, both human and material, was con-\nsiderable, comprising, at it did, the laying of\nmany ambushes, the destruction or blocking of\nrail and road communications, and the destruc-\ntion of supply dumps and other military instal-\nlations.. The operations carried out by these\ncolumns, combined with the story of how\nAmerican aircraft released their gliders, filled\nwith British troops and American engineers,\nto make their landings in jungle clearings in\npitch darkness, forms one of the outstanding\nepisodes of the war, but an account of the\noperations will not be given until a subsequent\nDespatch. :\n\n114. I have nothing but praise for the organi-\nzation of the initial landings, and the gallantry\nand endurance displayed by all ranks in the\noperations which followed. Events have shown,\nhowever, that these operations had less effect\nupon the enemy than I hoped for. The enemy\ndid not divert troops from his forward areas,\nnor did he alter his main strategical plan.\nIn fact, the results achieved did not prove to.\n",

The operations of Special Force began\non the night of the 5th-6th March, and be-\ntween then and the night of the 10th-11th\nMarch nearly six hundred Dakota and one hun-\ndred glider sorties carried 77 and 111 L.R-P.\nBrigades, totalling 9,500 troops and 1,100\nanimals, into the heart of Japanese-occupied\nBurma. The initial réle of these glider-borne\nforces was to secure sites for and to prepare\nlanding strips west of the Irrawaddy. Last\nminute air reconnaissance disclosed that one of\nthe two potential strips selected, thirty-five miles\nnorth-east of Katha (called “ Piccadilly ”) had\nbeen deliberately obstructed. General Sim, who\nwas present at the starting point when this\nnews was received, was faced with the difficult\ndecision whether to launch the operation, since\nit appeared that the enemy had got wind of\nit, or to postpone it until fresh plans could\nbe made. He decided to let the operation go\nforward and on the first night the landings\nwere confined to one strip only, called “ Broad-\nway ”, which was some twenty-seven milessouth-\neast of Hopin on the Myitkyina—Mandalay\nrailway.\n\n108. The landings at Broadway, and subse-\nquently on another strip (‘ Chowringhee ”)\nsome twenty miles south-south-east of Katha,\nachieved complete surprise and until the 12th\nMarch no ground opposition was met. Air\nattacks did not begin until the 10th and were\ndirected against the Chowringhee strip which,\nby that time, had fulfilled its purpose and had\nbeen abandoned. The Broadway strip was not\nattacked until the 13th March, when our\nfighters were present and A.A. defences had\nbeen established. The Japanese lost about\n50 per cent. of their attacking aircraft.\n\n109. Our losses during the initial fly-in\namounted to only one per cent. of the total\npersonnel transported. The only animal casualty\nwas one mule. The smallness of these losses is\nremarkable in view of the fact that, at the\npeak period of the fly-in, double the planned\neffort was achieved, and aircraft were coming\nin and taking off at the rate of one “ landing ”\nand one “ take-off” every three minutes.\n\n110. A special American air force, called\nNo. 1 Air Commando, had been formed to\nco-operate both tactically and administratively\nwith Special Force. It was a composite force\ncomprising some 250 aircraft—long- and short-\nrange fighters, light bombers, Dakotas and\ngliders. This force carried out the hazardous\nand difficult glider-borne operations, flying fully\nladen gliders, some in double tow, over 9,000\nfoot mountains by night, a distance of 300 miles\nto the selected area. Equally important was\nthe action of the fighters and bombers of this\nforce, before, during, and after the actual\n‘landings, against targets which it was vital to\nattack. No. 221 Group, R.A.F., also did splen-\ndid work in these operations. I wish to ex-\npress my appreciation of the work carried out\nby these air forces, without whose assistance\nSpecial Force could not have operated.\n\n111. 77 and 111 L.R.P.

They\ndelayed for one month up to three batta-\nlions of 15 Japanese Division, which might\notherwise have reached the Imphal Front\nearlier.\n\n(c) Although they severed the rail com-\nmunications of 18 Japanese Division for\nabout three months, only one battalion (from\nthe 18 Divisional Reserve) was actually\ndiverted from the front of General Stilwell’s\nforces and that only for about a month.\n\n(@ On the other hand, the Japanese were\ncompelled to collect troops to meet the\nthreat but they did not amount to more than\ntwelve battalions at any one time, although\nthe number of enemy battalions which were\nemployed at one time or another added up\nto sixteen. The concentration of twelve\nbattalions was not complete until two months\nafter the original landings,\n\n115. 16 L.R.P. Brigade, which had originally\nmarched in from Ledo, was evacuated by air\nearly in May. On the 17th May, the three\nremaining brigades of Special Force came\nunder the command of General Stilwell in the\nNorthern Combat Area Command and subse-\nquently operated, in a normal infantry réle,\nin the Kamaing—Mogaung—Myitkyina sector.\n\n“Dahforce”, which was composed of Kachin\nLevies, was flown in with Special Force and\nlater amalgamated with three columns of 111\nBrigade, the whole being re-named “ Morris-\nior ” {already briefly mentioned in paragraph\n\nBefore leaving the subject of Special Force,\nI wish to pay tribute to its gallant commander,\nMajor-General Wingate, whose death occurred\nin a flying accident late in March. He was that\nrare combination of the dreamer and the man\nof action and his example and spirit will remain\nan inspiration to the men he trained. He was\nsucceeded by his Second-in-Command, Major-\nGeneral W. D. A. Lentaigne, CB, CBE,\n\nLessons of the Campaign.\n\n116. The following important facts emerge\nfrom a study of the operations undertaken\nduring the first six months of 1944:—\n\n. (@) The reinforcements received were well\ntrained, thanks to the training arrangements\nmade by the Commander-in-Chief, India,\nand our troops, both individually and collec-\ntively, were able to engage the Japanese\nwith confidence.\n\n(6) Our ability to make full use of air\nsupply by virtue of our air superiority has\nfundamentally altered the tactical picture,\nand enabled our troops not only to operate\nin country hitherto considered impassable\nand so attack the enemy, but also to hold\npositions when the enemy has cut their\nlines of communication.\n\n(©) The operations have shown that ordin-\nary formations can be transported quickly\nby air. They have also shown the need, for\nfighting under Far Eastern conditions, of a\n* Standard Infantry Division ” which can be\nreadily transported by rail, sea, M.T. or air.\n\n1363\n\n(@) The urgent need for plenty of infantry\nin this theatre of war has again been\nemphasised. All divisions, except 19 Indian\nDivision which was the only reserve at the\ndisposal of the Commander-in-Chief, India,\nwere engaged in the course of the fighting\nand no proper relief of formations was pos-\nsible. The relief of tired troops is most\nimportant and it was not solved satisfactorily\nowing to shortage of troops.\n\nSome of my divisions had, by last June, been\nin the forward areas for twenty-eight months.\nI need not stress the mental and physical strain\nwhich jungle warfare, under adverse climatic\nconditions, imposes on the soldier.\n\nNaval Operations.\n\n117. I wish to acknowledge the assistance\ngiven by coastal forces in the Arakan opera-\ntions, which carried out valuable raids against\nvulnerable points on the coast, and were pro-\ntection against possible small sea-borne raids\nby the enemy.\n\nIn March, 3 Commando Brigade (No. 5\nCommando and No. 44 Royal Marine Com-\nmando) carried out successfully a small am-\nphibious operation in the Alethangyaw area\nfrom St. Martin’s Island, with the object of\ncontaining the enemy in that area and prevent-\ning the movement north of reinforcements\nduring our main attack on the Maungdaw—\nButhidaung road.\n\nAlthough there was no large-scale naval\nactivity in conjunction with land forces dur-\ning the’ period under review, it was the ever\npresent threat of amphibious operations which\ntied nearly two Japanese divisions to coastal\nareas.\n\nAir Co-operation.\n\n118. Tasks. The general tasks performed by\nEastern Air Command during the first six\nmonths of the year were as follows: —\n\n(@ Strategic air offensive to destroy\nenemy forces, transportation, and mainten-\nance installations.\n\n(b) Support of Fourteenth Army opera-\ntions.\n\n(c) Air defence of Calcutta and the\nadjacent industrial areas and, also, of the\nairfields used by the American Air Trans-\nport Command in North-East Assam for the\nChina ferry service.\n\n@) Air transportation for airborne and air\ntransit forces.\n\n(e) Photographic reconnaissance.\n\n119.

They\ndelayed for one month up to three batta-\nlions of 15 Japanese Division, which might\notherwise have reached the Imphal Front\nearlier.\n\n(c) Although they severed the rail com-\nmunications of 18 Japanese Division for\nabout three months, only one battalion (from\nthe 18 Divisional Reserve) was actually\ndiverted from the front of General Stilwell’s\nforces and that only for about a month.\n\n(@ On the other hand, the Japanese were\ncompelled to collect troops to meet the\nthreat but they did not amount to more than\ntwelve battalions at any one time, although\nthe number of enemy battalions which were\nemployed at one time or another added up\nto sixteen. The concentration of twelve\nbattalions was not complete until two months\nafter the original landings,\n\n115. 16 L.R.P. Brigade, which had originally\nmarched in from Ledo, was evacuated by air\nearly in May. On the 17th May, the three\nremaining brigades of Special Force came\nunder the command of General Stilwell in the\nNorthern Combat Area Command and subse-\nquently operated, in a normal infantry réle,\nin the Kamaing—Mogaung—Myitkyina sector.\n\n“Dahforce”, which was composed of Kachin\nLevies, was flown in with Special Force and\nlater amalgamated with three columns of 111\nBrigade, the whole being re-named “ Morris-\nior ” {already briefly mentioned in paragraph\n\nBefore leaving the subject of Special Force,\nI wish to pay tribute to its gallant commander,\nMajor-General Wingate, whose death occurred\nin a flying accident late in March. He was that\nrare combination of the dreamer and the man\nof action and his example and spirit will remain\nan inspiration to the men he trained. He was\nsucceeded by his Second-in-Command, Major-\nGeneral W. D. A. Lentaigne, CB, CBE,\n\nLessons of the Campaign.\n\n116. The following important facts emerge\nfrom a study of the operations undertaken\nduring the first six months of 1944:—\n\n. (@) The reinforcements received were well\ntrained, thanks to the training arrangements\nmade by the Commander-in-Chief, India,\nand our troops, both individually and collec-\ntively, were able to engage the Japanese\nwith confidence.\n\n(6) Our ability to make full use of air\nsupply by virtue of our air superiority has\nfundamentally altered the tactical picture,\nand enabled our troops not only to operate\nin country hitherto considered impassable\nand so attack the enemy, but also to hold\npositions when the enemy has cut their\nlines of communication.\n\n(©) The operations have shown that ordin-\nary formations can be transported quickly\nby air. They have also shown the need, for\nfighting under Far Eastern conditions, of a\n* Standard Infantry Division ” which can be\nreadily transported by rail, sea, M.T. or air.\n\n1363\n\n(@) The urgent need for plenty of infantry\nin this theatre of war has again been\nemphasised. All divisions, except 19 Indian\nDivision which was the only reserve at the\ndisposal of the Commander-in-Chief, India,\nwere engaged in the course of the fighting\nand no proper relief of formations was pos-\nsible. The relief of tired troops is most\nimportant and it was not solved satisfactorily\nowing to shortage of troops.\n\nSome of my divisions had, by last June, been\nin the forward areas for twenty-eight months.\nI need not stress the mental and physical strain\nwhich jungle warfare, under adverse climatic\nconditions, imposes on the soldier.\n\nNaval Operations.\n\n117. I wish to acknowledge the assistance\ngiven by coastal forces in the Arakan opera-\ntions, which carried out valuable raids against\nvulnerable points on the coast, and were pro-\ntection against possible small sea-borne raids\nby the enemy.\n\nIn March, 3 Commando Brigade (No. 5\nCommando and No. 44 Royal Marine Com-\nmando) carried out successfully a small am-\nphibious operation in the Alethangyaw area\nfrom St. Martin’s Island, with the object of\ncontaining the enemy in that area and prevent-\ning the movement north of reinforcements\nduring our main attack on the Maungdaw—\nButhidaung road.\n\nAlthough there was no large-scale naval\nactivity in conjunction with land forces dur-\ning the’ period under review, it was the ever\npresent threat of amphibious operations which\ntied nearly two Japanese divisions to coastal\nareas.\n\nAir Co-operation.\n\n118. Tasks. The general tasks performed by\nEastern Air Command during the first six\nmonths of the year were as follows: —\n\n(@ Strategic air offensive to destroy\nenemy forces, transportation, and mainten-\nance installations.\n\n(b) Support of Fourteenth Army opera-\ntions.\n\n(c) Air defence of Calcutta and the\nadjacent industrial areas and, also, of the\nairfields used by the American Air Trans-\nport Command in North-East Assam for the\nChina ferry service.\n\n@) Air transportation for airborne and air\ntransit forces.\n\n(e) Photographic reconnaissance.\n\n119. Strategic Air Force. 1 am, of course,\nchiefly concerned with the air transport and\ntactical support given to Fourteenth Army,\nbut I wish to acknowledge the assistance ren-\ndered by the Strategic Air Force. Their attacks\non Rangoon and Bangkok, and, also, those on\nSaigon by 14 U.S.A.AF. from China, have\ngreatly impeded the flow of Japanese reinforce-\nments and material into Burma. In fact, up till\nthe time when monsoon conditions reduced air\nactivity, Rangoon was practically denied to the\nenemy as a port.

Tactical Air Force. The successful pro-\nvision of ground support in this Theatre,\nalthough facilitated by our complete air\nsupremacy, is faced by two difficulties :—\n\n(@ the problem of target recognition in\ndense jungle (enhanced, as it is, by the\nenemy’s skill in camouflaging his positions\nand dumps), and\n\n(b) the Japanese skill in building field de-\nfences which require direct hits from heavy\nbombs to neutralise them.\n\nThe difficulty of target recognition was, to\na great extent, overcome by use of smoke and\nwireless.\n\n121. The occasions when air support has\nbeen called for and most effectively provided\nare too numerous to mention but it has not\nalways been easy to assess the results\nachieved. I have no hesitation in stating, how-\never, that neither in offence nor defence could\nthe Army have achieved the success it did,\nhad it not been for the casualties inflicted\non the enemy, and the disruption in forward\nareas of both their land and water communica-\ntions by Eastern Air Command. Further,\nthe effect produced on the morale of our troops\nby the obvious evidence of our air superiority\nhas been most inspiring. Conversely, its dis-\nheartening effect on the enemy is evidenced by\nthe statements of prisoners and from captured\ndocuments.\n\n122. Air Transport Operations. In November\n1943, only one R.A.F. Transport Squadron was\navailable for operations with Fourteenth Army,\nbut two Troop Carrier Squadrons, U.S.A.A.F.,\nwere working with General Stilwell’s forces in\nthe Northern Sector, and other squadrons, both\nBritish and American, were on their way as\nreinforcements. Other reinforcements were sent\nsubsequently from the Mediterranean and else-\nwhere.\n\nUnified operational control of these forces\nwas effected in December by the formation of\nTroop Carrier Command, Eastern Air Com-\nmand, under Brigadier-General W. D. Old of\nthe U.S.A.A.F., with Headquarters at Comilla,\nwhere were situated the Headquarters of both\nFourteenth Army and 3 Tactical Air Force, as\nwell ds the main supply bases. On the Ist May,\nin order further to integrate air transport with\narmy operations, Troop Carrier Command was\nplaced under the control of the Air Com-\nmander, 3 Tactical Air Force, until it was dis-\nsolved on the 4th June—a measure rendered\nnecessary by the increasing dispersal of the\noperational areas and the growing intensity of\n\neral Stilwell’s operations in North Burma.\n\n123. It is only possible for me here briefly\nto mention the major air transport operations\ncarried out during this period. These were, in\nchronological order: —\n\n(a) The routine supply-dropping missions\nto our detachments in the Chin Hills, which\n\nI mention because of the hazardous flying\n\nconditions.\n\n(b) The maintenance of 81 (West African)\n\nDivision in the Kaladan, which was entirely\n\ndependent on air supply.\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THs LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\n(c) The maintenance of the Chinese\n\ndivisions advancing south-east from Ledo,\nwhich included supplies for our Fort Hertz\ngarrison and the Levies operating in that\narea.\n(d) The delivery by air of some 2,000 tons\nof supplies of all kinds to 7 Indian Division\nduring the fighting between the 8th February\nand the 6th March.\n\n(e) The fly-in of the Brigades of Special\nForce to the centre of Burma.\n\n() The move by air of 50 Indian Para-\nchute Brigade from Northern India to the\nImphal area, followed by the transfer of the\npersonnel of 5 Indian Division, two brigades\nof 7 Indian Division, together with a pro-\nportion of their heavy equipment, including\nartillery, from Arakan to the same area. An\ninfantry brigade of 2 British Division was\nflown from the Calcutta area to Jorhat in\nNorth-Eastern Assam.\n\n(g) The air supply, on an unprecedented\nscale, of 4 Corps during the period that the\nline of communication to Imphal was cut.\n\n(#) The evacuation by air of 16 Brigade\nof Special Force from the Hopin area to\nIndia.\n\n@ Concurrently with all the above, the\nevacuation of casualties from Arakan, North\nBurma and Imphal, which had a most\nbeneficial effect on the morale of the troops\nengaged.\n\n124. It is not within the scope of this De-\nspatch to give a detailed account of the opera-\ntions, but I wish to comment on two of them:\nthe maintenance by air of 7 Indian Division,\nwhen cut off in the Arakan, and that of 4 Corps\nwhen surrounded in Imphal. The former was\nthe first occasion, in this theatre of war, when\na large formation was supplied by air, and\nwas thus able to maintain its positions after\nits land communications had been severed.\nThis allowed us to inflict a crushing defeat\non the enemy. The latter—the air supply of\n4 Corps—deserves a more detailed account:\n\nThe magnitude of the effort involved in keep-\ning an Army Corps of four divisions and the\nair forces based at Imphal supplied, was\nenormous, when it is regarded in relation to\nthe number of aircraft available.\n\nCalculations showed that the Army required\n323 tons per diem, and the supporting R.A.F.\n\nuadrons 75 tons, if we were to hold Imphal.\nThis target figure was, generally speaking,\nmaintained, though we had anxious periods\nwhen a shortage of aircraft seemed probable\nand when bad weather restricted flying. There\nis no doubt that, if we had not had air supply,\nwe should have lost the Imphal Plain and the\nposition on the eastern frontier of India would\nhave been grave.\n\n125. It is with gratitude and admiration that\nI acknowledge the immense debt which the\nArmy owes to the Air. No one who, like my-\nself, has watched them, is likely to forget the\ncourage, determination and skill of pilots and\ncrews who have flown through some of the\nworst weather in the world, and over appalling\ncountry in performing their allotted tasks.\n\nEnemy Strengths and Dispositions.\n\n126. To trace the Japanese build-up in\nBurma, it is necessary to go back to July, 1943,\nwhen their total strength consisted of four\n",

Tactical Air Force. The successful pro-\nvision of ground support in this Theatre,\nalthough facilitated by our complete air\nsupremacy, is faced by two difficulties :—\n\n(@ the problem of target recognition in\ndense jungle (enhanced, as it is, by the\nenemy’s skill in camouflaging his positions\nand dumps), and\n\n(b) the Japanese skill in building field de-\nfences which require direct hits from heavy\nbombs to neutralise them.\n\nThe difficulty of target recognition was, to\na great extent, overcome by use of smoke and\nwireless.\n\n121. The occasions when air support has\nbeen called for and most effectively provided\nare too numerous to mention but it has not\nalways been easy to assess the results\nachieved. I have no hesitation in stating, how-\never, that neither in offence nor defence could\nthe Army have achieved the success it did,\nhad it not been for the casualties inflicted\non the enemy, and the disruption in forward\nareas of both their land and water communica-\ntions by Eastern Air Command. Further,\nthe effect produced on the morale of our troops\nby the obvious evidence of our air superiority\nhas been most inspiring. Conversely, its dis-\nheartening effect on the enemy is evidenced by\nthe statements of prisoners and from captured\ndocuments.\n\n122. Air Transport Operations. In November\n1943, only one R.A.F. Transport Squadron was\navailable for operations with Fourteenth Army,\nbut two Troop Carrier Squadrons, U.S.A.A.F.,\nwere working with General Stilwell’s forces in\nthe Northern Sector, and other squadrons, both\nBritish and American, were on their way as\nreinforcements. Other reinforcements were sent\nsubsequently from the Mediterranean and else-\nwhere.\n\nUnified operational control of these forces\nwas effected in December by the formation of\nTroop Carrier Command, Eastern Air Com-\nmand, under Brigadier-General W. D. Old of\nthe U.S.A.A.F., with Headquarters at Comilla,\nwhere were situated the Headquarters of both\nFourteenth Army and 3 Tactical Air Force, as\nwell ds the main supply bases. On the Ist May,\nin order further to integrate air transport with\narmy operations, Troop Carrier Command was\nplaced under the control of the Air Com-\nmander, 3 Tactical Air Force, until it was dis-\nsolved on the 4th June—a measure rendered\nnecessary by the increasing dispersal of the\noperational areas and the growing intensity of\n\neral Stilwell’s operations in North Burma.\n\n123. It is only possible for me here briefly\nto mention the major air transport operations\ncarried out during this period. These were, in\nchronological order: —\n\n(a) The routine supply-dropping missions\nto our detachments in the Chin Hills, which\n\nI mention because of the hazardous flying\n\nconditions.\n\n(b) The maintenance of 81 (West African)\n\nDivision in the Kaladan, which was entirely\n\ndependent on air supply.\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THs LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\n(c) The maintenance of the Chinese\n\ndivisions advancing south-east from Ledo,\nwhich included supplies for our Fort Hertz\ngarrison and the Levies operating in that\narea.\n(d) The delivery by air of some 2,000 tons\nof supplies of all kinds to 7 Indian Division\nduring the fighting between the 8th February\nand the 6th March.\n\n(e) The fly-in of the Brigades of Special\nForce to the centre of Burma.\n\n() The move by air of 50 Indian Para-\nchute Brigade from Northern India to the\nImphal area, followed by the transfer of the\npersonnel of 5 Indian Division, two brigades\nof 7 Indian Division, together with a pro-\nportion of their heavy equipment, including\nartillery, from Arakan to the same area. An\ninfantry brigade of 2 British Division was\nflown from the Calcutta area to Jorhat in\nNorth-Eastern Assam.\n\n(g) The air supply, on an unprecedented\nscale, of 4 Corps during the period that the\nline of communication to Imphal was cut.\n\n(#) The evacuation by air of 16 Brigade\nof Special Force from the Hopin area to\nIndia.\n\n@ Concurrently with all the above, the\nevacuation of casualties from Arakan, North\nBurma and Imphal, which had a most\nbeneficial effect on the morale of the troops\nengaged.\n\n124. It is not within the scope of this De-\nspatch to give a detailed account of the opera-\ntions, but I wish to comment on two of them:\nthe maintenance by air of 7 Indian Division,\nwhen cut off in the Arakan, and that of 4 Corps\nwhen surrounded in Imphal. The former was\nthe first occasion, in this theatre of war, when\na large formation was supplied by air, and\nwas thus able to maintain its positions after\nits land communications had been severed.\nThis allowed us to inflict a crushing defeat\non the enemy. The latter—the air supply of\n4 Corps—deserves a more detailed account:\n\nThe magnitude of the effort involved in keep-\ning an Army Corps of four divisions and the\nair forces based at Imphal supplied, was\nenormous, when it is regarded in relation to\nthe number of aircraft available.\n\nCalculations showed that the Army required\n323 tons per diem, and the supporting R.A.F.\n\nuadrons 75 tons, if we were to hold Imphal.\nThis target figure was, generally speaking,\nmaintained, though we had anxious periods\nwhen a shortage of aircraft seemed probable\nand when bad weather restricted flying. There\nis no doubt that, if we had not had air supply,\nwe should have lost the Imphal Plain and the\nposition on the eastern frontier of India would\nhave been grave.\n\n125. It is with gratitude and admiration that\nI acknowledge the immense debt which the\nArmy owes to the Air. No one who, like my-\nself, has watched them, is likely to forget the\ncourage, determination and skill of pilots and\ncrews who have flown through some of the\nworst weather in the world, and over appalling\ncountry in performing their allotted tasks.\n\nEnemy Strengths and Dispositions.\n\n126. To trace the Japanese build-up in\nBurma, it is necessary to go back to July, 1943,\nwhen their total strength consisted of four\n",

Chindwin and\nHukawng Valley, 18 Division ; Salween River,\n56 Division. By November, 31 Division, a new\none raised from formations in Central China\nand elsewhere, and, also, 24 Independent\nMixed Brigade (four battalions) had arrived,\n34 Division from Java followed in February.\nReinforcements during February and early\nMarch amounted to two more divisions, the\n15th coming from Central China, and the 2nd,\noriginally destroyed in Guadalcanal, but re-\nformed in the Philippines in June 1943. In\nFebruary, also, a second Army Headquarters,\nthe 28th, was created to control the forces in\nSouth Burma.\n\n127. The strength of the Japanese army in\nBurma at the beginning of March was, there-\nfore, eight divisions and one independent mixed\nbrigade, giving a total of seventy-six infantry\nbattalions. These forces were under the con:\ntrol of two Army Headquarters: the Southern\n(Twenty-Eighth) Army containing thirty-two\nbattalions and the Northern (Fifteenth) Army\nforty-four.\n\n128. In May, a fresh division made its\nappearance : the 53rd, coming from Japan, via\nMalaya. It was located in the Mogaung area.\nThus the total Japanese strength in Burma had\ngtadually been augmented from four divisions\nto nine in the twelve months ending June 1944.\n\nJapanese Subversive Agencies.\n\n129. There are certain non-Japanese forces\nwhich the enemy raised to oppose us in Burma,\nthe most prominent being :— .\n\n(a) The Japanese-inspired Indian Fifth\n\nColumn.\n\n(6) The so-called Indian National Army\n\n(LN.A,).\n\n© Forces of disaffected Burmans.\n\nThe first-named. are known as J.I.Fs., a term\nwhich, strictly speaking, should only be applied\nto Indians working for the enemy, who are not\nmembers of the IN.A. These J.I-Fs. have\nbeen used in an intelligence offensive against\nIndia and the Indian Army since the outbreak\nof the Japanese war, mainly on propaganda\nand espionage tasks. Some have been landed\nin India by submarine or parachute, and con-\nsiderable numbers have infiltrated across the\nIndo-Burman border. This movement, which\nhas been in the main a matter for India Com-\nmand to counter, was largely defeated. Its\neffects on the troops under my command have\nbeen negligible.\n\n130. The I.N.A. is principally composed of\nIndian prisoners of war taken in Singapore,\nthough civilians are now also being recruited.\nThis army, which had a rather ill-starred\nbeginning in 1942—at the end of which year it\nwas disbanded by the Japanese—was re-formed\nby Subhas Chandra Bose, the Bengali revolu-\ntionary, soon after his arrival in the East from\nGermany in 1943. It is now organised in three\ndivisions, of which two are alleged to be fit\nto take the field. Its headquarters was at\nMaymyo, with a rear headquarters at Singa-\npore. A strength of 13,000, including No. 1\nDivision, has been moved up into Burma since\nlast November, while No. 2 Division (approxi-\nmately 7,000) is prepared to follow.\n\n1365\n\n_ 131, Elements of the LN.A. first appeared\nin a fighting réle in the Arakan operations in .\nFebruary, but the main body was concentrated\non the Chindwin front, and was generally em-\nployed on foraging and fatigue duties. They\ndid no fighting on either front beyond\noccasional company actions, in which their\nmorale was not high. Special parties, attached\nto Japanese units, have been used to try to\nsuborn our Indian troops, but all attempts have\nbeen met with fire. Reports show that the\nJapanese have been disillusioned regarding the\nvalue of these troops, the great majority of\nwhom are not really traitors; most of them\nonly accepted service under the Japanese to\nescape inhuman treatment and in the hope of\ngetting back to India.\n\n132. The activities of the J.1.Fs. and the\nILN.A. are directed by an organization com-\nposed of Japanese officers and men, under a\nijeutenant-general, which has its headquarters\nin Burma and is known as the Hikari Kikan\nising Sun Organization). Liaison between\nIN.A. (brigades and the Japanese Army is\ncarried out by Hikari personnel. This organiza-\ntion also controls Bose’s “ Provisional Govern-\nment ” and the “ Indian Independence League ”\ninto which Indians in the Far East have been\nenrolled.\n\nIn addition to the Hikari Kikan, there is the\nJapanese Nishi Kikan (Western Organization)\nwhich is trying to organize the peoples of\nNorthern and Western Burma into units some-\nwhat analogous to our own Chin and Kachis\nLevies. .\n\n133. It is difficult to estimate the strength\nand fighting value of the force of disaffected\nBurmans. It has done little fighting, and has,\nup to date, been employed chiefly on lines\nof communication duties. It contains some\ndefinitely anti-British elements who, when the\nJapanese are being evicted from Burma, may\nbe expected to try to interfere with our\npacification of the country. Other elements\nhave, however, probably been forced into the\norganization by “voluntary compulsion”\nmethods and will leave it as soon as they can.\n\n134. I wish to pay a tribute to the tribes-\nmen of the Naga, Chin and Kachin Hills, who\nhave remained staunchly loyal to us, in spite\nof all the enemy’s efforts to suborn them.\n\n135. Casualties. The following table shows\nthe battle casualties inflicted on the enemy be-\ntween November, 1943, and June, 1944, both\nmonths inclusive :—\n\nBy Fourteenth Army By CAL.\nKilled 26,203 13,232\nWounded 39,305 19,848\nPrisoners 288 ST\nTotal 98,933\n\nThis proportion of killed to wounded is\ncalculated from captured returns and may be\nassumed to be reasonably accurate. .\n\nThis estimate does not include the losses\nthe enemy has suffered from our sustained air\nattacks or from disease, the incidence of\nwhich captured documents have shown to be\nhigh. There is of course, always a tendency\nto over-estimate enemy casualties but I think\nit would be no exaggeration to assume that\nthe total Japanese Josses, on all counts, during\nthe eight months under review amounted to\nat least one hundred thousand.\n",

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\ndivisions, disposed as follows:—Arakan, 55\nDivision ; Kale and Kabaw Valleys and Lower\nChindwin, 33 Division ; Upper. Chindwin and\nHukawng Valley, 18 Division ; Salween River,\n56 Division. By November, 31 Division, a new\none raised from formations in Central China\nand elsewhere, and, also, 24 Independent\nMixed Brigade (four battalions) had arrived,\n34 Division from Java followed in February.\nReinforcements during February and early\nMarch amounted to two more divisions, the\n15th coming from Central China, and the 2nd,\noriginally destroyed in Guadalcanal, but re-\nformed in the Philippines in June 1943. In\nFebruary, also, a second Army Headquarters,\nthe 28th, was created to control the forces in\nSouth Burma.\n\n127. The strength of the Japanese army in\nBurma at the beginning of March was, there-\nfore, eight divisions and one independent mixed\nbrigade, giving a total of seventy-six infantry\nbattalions. These forces were under the con:\ntrol of two Army Headquarters: the Southern\n(Twenty-Eighth) Army containing thirty-two\nbattalions and the Northern (Fifteenth) Army\nforty-four.\n\n128. In May, a fresh division made its\nappearance : the 53rd, coming from Japan, via\nMalaya. It was located in the Mogaung area.\nThus the total Japanese strength in Burma had\ngtadually been augmented from four divisions\nto nine in the twelve months ending June 1944.\n\nJapanese Subversive Agencies.\n\n129. There are certain non-Japanese forces\nwhich the enemy raised to oppose us in Burma,\nthe most prominent being :— .\n\n(a) The Japanese-inspired Indian Fifth\n\nColumn.\n\n(6) The so-called Indian National Army\n\n(LN.A,).\n\n© Forces of disaffected Burmans.\n\nThe first-named. are known as J.I.Fs., a term\nwhich, strictly speaking, should only be applied\nto Indians working for the enemy, who are not\nmembers of the IN.A. These J.I-Fs. have\nbeen used in an intelligence offensive against\nIndia and the Indian Army since the outbreak\nof the Japanese war, mainly on propaganda\nand espionage tasks. Some have been landed\nin India by submarine or parachute, and con-\nsiderable numbers have infiltrated across the\nIndo-Burman border. This movement, which\nhas been in the main a matter for India Com-\nmand to counter, was largely defeated. Its\neffects on the troops under my command have\nbeen negligible.\n\n130. The I.N.A. is principally composed of\nIndian prisoners of war taken in Singapore,\nthough civilians are now also being recruited.\nThis army, which had a rather ill-starred\nbeginning in 1942—at the end of which year it\nwas disbanded by the Japanese—was re-formed\nby Subhas Chandra Bose, the Bengali revolu-\ntionary, soon after his arrival in the East from\nGermany in 1943. It is now organised in three\ndivisions, of which two are alleged to be fit\nto take the field. Its headquarters was at\nMaymyo, with a rear headquarters at Singa-\npore. A strength of 13,000, including No. 1\nDivision, has been moved up into Burma since\nlast November, while No. 2 Division (approxi-\nmately 7,000) is prepared to follow.\n\n1365\n\n_ 131, Elements of the LN.A. first appeared\nin a fighting réle in the Arakan operations in .\nFebruary, but the main body was concentrated\non the Chindwin front, and was generally em-\nployed on foraging and fatigue duties. They\ndid no fighting on either front beyond\noccasional company actions, in which their\nmorale was not high. Special parties, attached\nto Japanese units, have been used to try to\nsuborn our Indian troops, but all attempts have\nbeen met with fire. Reports show that the\nJapanese have been disillusioned regarding the\nvalue of these troops, the great majority of\nwhom are not really traitors; most of them\nonly accepted service under the Japanese to\nescape inhuman treatment and in the hope of\ngetting back to India.\n\n132. The activities of the J.1.Fs. and the\nILN.A. are directed by an organization com-\nposed of Japanese officers and men, under a\nijeutenant-general, which has its headquarters\nin Burma and is known as the Hikari Kikan\nising Sun Organization). Liaison between\nIN.A. (brigades and the Japanese Army is\ncarried out by Hikari personnel. This organiza-\ntion also controls Bose’s “ Provisional Govern-\nment ” and the “ Indian Independence League ”\ninto which Indians in the Far East have been\nenrolled.\n\nIn addition to the Hikari Kikan, there is the\nJapanese Nishi Kikan (Western Organization)\nwhich is trying to organize the peoples of\nNorthern and Western Burma into units some-\nwhat analogous to our own Chin and Kachis\nLevies. .\n\n133. It is difficult to estimate the strength\nand fighting value of the force of disaffected\nBurmans. It has done little fighting, and has,\nup to date, been employed chiefly on lines\nof communication duties. It contains some\ndefinitely anti-British elements who, when the\nJapanese are being evicted from Burma, may\nbe expected to try to interfere with our\npacification of the country. Other elements\nhave, however, probably been forced into the\norganization by “voluntary compulsion”\nmethods and will leave it as soon as they can.\n\n134. I wish to pay a tribute to the tribes-\nmen of the Naga, Chin and Kachin Hills, who\nhave remained staunchly loyal to us, in spite\nof all the enemy’s efforts to suborn them.\n\n135. Casualties. The following table shows\nthe battle casualties inflicted on the enemy be-\ntween November, 1943, and June, 1944, both\nmonths inclusive :—\n\nBy Fourteenth Army By CAL.\nKilled 26,203 13,232\nWounded 39,305 19,848\nPrisoners 288 ST\nTotal 98,933\n\nThis proportion of killed to wounded is\ncalculated from captured returns and may be\nassumed to be reasonably accurate. .\n\nThis estimate does not include the losses\nthe enemy has suffered from our sustained air\nattacks or from disease, the incidence of\nwhich captured documents have shown to be\nhigh. There is of course, always a tendency\nto over-estimate enemy casualties but I think\nit would be no exaggeration to assume that\nthe total Japanese Josses, on all counts, during\nthe eight months under review amounted to\nat least one hundred thousand.\n",

At a con-\nference held in Ceylon in January, at which\nthe G.O.C.-in-C., East African Command was\npresent, I decided to increase the artillery of\nthis formation up to the scale of that in an\nAnimal and Motor Transport (A. and M.T.)\nDivision on the Indian Establishment.\n\nI also decided to reduce the scale of both\nunit and 2nd line motor transport, and to pro-\nvide an element within the infantry battalions\nfor carrying fighting equipment under con-\nditions when M.T. could not operate.\n\n140. 81 and 82 (West African) Divisions. In\nMay, at a conference attended by the G.O.C.-\nin-C., West Africa, I considered the advis-\nability of amalgamating these two divisions ;\nfor 81 Division, which had given up one of\nits brigades to Special Force, consisted only\nof two brigades. Owing, however, to the short-\nage of formations with which to carry out\nreliefs, I decided to retain both divisions, but\nto effect certain changes in their organization.\nThese included :—\n\n(a) The divisional artillery to consist of\none light regiment (three batteries of\n3.7-inch howitzers and one battery of 3-inch\nmortars) and one anti-tank regiment (three\nbatteries, each of twelve six-pounder guns).\nField regiments could not be formed, but\nwould be attached when required.\n\n(6) A reconnaissance battalion to be in-\ncluded in each division.\n\n@) A proportion (25 per cent.) of the un-\narmed soldiers, who act as porters, to be\narmed.\n\nWest African resources did not, unfortun-\nately, admit of certain other desirable increases,\nsuch as the inclusion of a Divisional Head-\nquarters battalion.\n\nT also decided that 3 (West African) Brigade\nof 81 (West African) Division should continue\nto be employed with Special Force.\n\nI intended to bring these two West African\ndivisions and the East African division, into\nline with the standard divisional organization\n(vide paragraph 142) in due course.\n\n141. Corps Headquarters and Corps Troops.\nIn order to secure uniformity, a standardised\nWar Establishment for a Corps Headquarters\nand, also, a standard Order of Battle for Corps\nTroops, is to be adopted.\n\n142. Standard Organization for Infantry Divi-\nsions. I have already briefly referred to the\ndesirability of having one standard organiza-\ntion for all infantry divisions operating in this\ntheatre of war, and for some time past I had\nbeen examining the possibility of this. Ex-\nperience had shown that, with our limited\n",

The major re-organizations, which were\nfinished, or which were begun; during the\nperiod covered by this Despatch were: —\n\n11 (East African) Division.\n81 and 82 (West African) Divisions.\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\nStandard Organizations for :—\nA Corps Headquarters.\nAn Infantry Division.\nArmoured Formations (re-organization of\nTank Brigades).\nOrganization for the movement and main-\ntenance of Air Transported Formations.\nAssumption of full contol by 11 Army\nGroup of Fourteenth Army and Land Forces,\nCeylon.\nThe principal changes involved, together with\nmy reasons for‘effecting them, are summarized\nin the succeeding paragraphs :—\n\n139. 11 (East African) Division. At a con-\nference held in Ceylon in January, at which\nthe G.O.C.-in-C., East African Command was\npresent, I decided to increase the artillery of\nthis formation up to the scale of that in an\nAnimal and Motor Transport (A. and M.T.)\nDivision on the Indian Establishment.\n\nI also decided to reduce the scale of both\nunit and 2nd line motor transport, and to pro-\nvide an element within the infantry battalions\nfor carrying fighting equipment under con-\nditions when M.T. could not operate.\n\n140. 81 and 82 (West African) Divisions. In\nMay, at a conference attended by the G.O.C.-\nin-C., West Africa, I considered the advis-\nability of amalgamating these two divisions ;\nfor 81 Division, which had given up one of\nits brigades to Special Force, consisted only\nof two brigades. Owing, however, to the short-\nage of formations with which to carry out\nreliefs, I decided to retain both divisions, but\nto effect certain changes in their organization.\nThese included :—\n\n(a) The divisional artillery to consist of\none light regiment (three batteries of\n3.7-inch howitzers and one battery of 3-inch\nmortars) and one anti-tank regiment (three\nbatteries, each of twelve six-pounder guns).\nField regiments could not be formed, but\nwould be attached when required.\n\n(6) A reconnaissance battalion to be in-\ncluded in each division.\n\n@) A proportion (25 per cent.) of the un-\narmed soldiers, who act as porters, to be\narmed.\n\nWest African resources did not, unfortun-\nately, admit of certain other desirable increases,\nsuch as the inclusion of a Divisional Head-\nquarters battalion.\n\nT also decided that 3 (West African) Brigade\nof 81 (West African) Division should continue\nto be employed with Special Force.\n\nI intended to bring these two West African\ndivisions and the East African division, into\nline with the standard divisional organization\n(vide paragraph 142) in due course.\n\n141. Corps Headquarters and Corps Troops.\nIn order to secure uniformity, a standardised\nWar Establishment for a Corps Headquarters\nand, also, a standard Order of Battle for Corps\nTroops, is to be adopted.\n\n142. Standard Organization for Infantry Divi-\nsions. I have already briefly referred to the\ndesirability of having one standard organiza-\ntion for all infantry divisions operating in this\ntheatre of war, and for some time past I had\nbeen examining the possibility of this. Ex-\nperience had shown that, with our limited\n",

Divisions. Such a policy was not\nonly uneconomical, but circumstances inevi-\ntably forced their use sooner or later in réles\nfor which they had not been trained or\norganized.\n\nEarly in May, I recommended to the\nSupreme Allied Commander that the policy of\nhaving a Standard Division should be accepted,\nsuch a division to be capable of fulfilling all\nthe réles which it might be called upon to\nperform within South-East Asia Command,\nviZ.2—\n\n@ Normal jungle fighting.\n\n(6) Operations involving transportation\nby air.\n\n(©) Amphibious operations (though, for\nthis réle, special training and the attachment\nof certain special units such as beach groups,\nwould of course be necessary).\n\nThe Supreme Allied Commander gave his\napproval to my proposals and they have since\nbeen accepted by the War Office and General\nHeadquarters, India. In addition the forma-\ntion of an airborne division has been agreed\n0. ‘\n\nAction to put this new policy into force is\nbeing taken in order to bring the maximum\nnumber of divisions on to the standard organi-\nzation before the end of 1944. This organiza-\ntion will include three infantry battalions per\nbrigade (to be increased to four when practic-\nable, as is the case in the War Office Light-\nScale Division for Far Eastern Theatres), two\nartillery regiments of 25-pounders (in place of\nthe existing one 25-pounder and one jungle\nfield regiment in A. and M.T. divisions),\none 3.7-inch howitzer mountain regiment of\nthree batteries (instead of the present four-\nbattery regiment), and one anti-tank regi-\nment having an alternative armament of 3-inch\nmortars (instead of the existing anti-aircraft\ncum anti-tank regiment). The division will\nalso include a reconnaissance battalion\norganized on similar lines to the normal infan-\ntry battalion, but with extra signal equipment,\nand, as soon as the manpower situation per-\nmits, a medium machine gun battalion.\n\nA major feature of the new Standard\nDivision is the reduction in the number of\nlorries, both in unit Ist line transport and in\n2nd line M.T. companies, and the introduction\nof a large number of jeeps. Eventually it is\nhoped to have two types of vehicles only ; the\njeep and the 3-ton four-wheel-drive lorry\n(apart, of course, from a limited number of\nspecialist vehicles).\n\n143. Re-organization of Armoured Forma-\ntions. A review of the réle required of tank\nbrigades operating in this Theatre led me to\nthe conclusion that certain major changes in\ntheir organization were necessary. I considered\nthat the value of these brigades would be\ngreatly enhanced if (@) all regiments were re-\nequipped with medium tanks, (6) a troop of\nflame-thrower tanks was included in each\nsquadron, and (c) an infantry battalion was\nincluded in each brigade. By making certain\nreductions in the existing establishment, it\nwould, I decided, be possible to adopt this\nre-organization of the armoured units, while\n\nB2\n\n1367\n\nat the same time, effecting a saving in man-\npower.\n\nThis matter is still being discussed with the\nCommander-in-Chief, India, and will be re-\nferred to again in my next Despatch.*\n\n144. Organization for. the Movement and\nMaintenance of Air Transported Formations.\nRecent experience has shown that there is an\nurgent need for a permanent organization to\nhandle the movement and maintenance of\nforces by air, instead of the improvisation that\nhas hitherto existed.\n\nSuch an organization must, obviously, be de-\nsigned to ensure the closest co-operation be-\ntween the staffs at the headquarters of the air\nforce and the army concerned and, also, the\nstaffs at the airfields affected. To achieve this,\nfour elements are required :—\n\n@ An Amny Link with the R.A.F. Head-\nquarters dealing with air transport.\n\n(6) Joint Army and R.AF. Air Despatch\nand Delivery Units at airfields.\n\n(c) An Airfield Maintenance Organization\nto ensure that maintenance requirements at\nairfields are met.\n\n@ Air Supply and Maintenance Com-\npanies to deal with the packing, loading and\nejection of supplies.\n\nMy proposals for an organization, which\nwill produce the necessary continuity and flexi-\nbility, are under consideration by Head-\nquarters, Air Command, S.E.A.C., and General\nHeadquarters, India.\n\n145. Assumption of Full Control by 11\nArmy Group. As I have already stated in\nthe opening paragraphs of this Despatch, Four-\nteenth Army, together with Ceylon Army Com-\nmand and the Indian Ocean bases of Addu\nAtoll, Diego Garcia and Cocos, came under\nmy command from the 16th November 1943,\nbut certain administrative matters continued\nto be dealt with by General Headquarters,\nIndia, until more staff became available for\n11 Army Group. My Headquarters, however,\nassumed full control with effect from the\nIst May, 1944, with the exception of some\nadministrative matters which were more con-\nveniently handled by G-H.Q. India.\n\nPart [IV—ApDMINISTRATION.\n\n146. In order to view the administrative\nproblem which confronted us in this Theatre\nin its correct perspective, it is necessary to\nunderstand the background against which the\npresent organization developed. Eastern\nArmy, the forerunner of Fourteenth Army,\ncame into being at a time of reverses in Burma\nand unpreparedness in Eastern India. The\nwhole of that rear organization, on which the\nsuccess or failure of an army depends, had\ntherefore to be built up from nothing, under\nthe most difficult conditions. While the early\nstages of this build-up have already been\ndescribed in Despatches from the India Com-\nmand, a brief recapitulation of the facts may\nbe opportune here.\n\n147. Our strategy, in 1942, was defensive and\nour advanced bases were selected accordingly.\nThe area of operations was, and still is, divided\n\nadministratively into two fronts—Arakan and\n\n* Operations in Assam and Burma from 23rd June,\n1944 to 12th November, 1944. :\n",

Eastern\nArmy, the forerunner of Fourteenth Army,\ncame into being at a time of reverses in Burma\nand unpreparedness in Eastern India. The\nwhole of that rear organization, on which the\nsuccess or failure of an army depends, had\ntherefore to be built up from nothing, under\nthe most difficult conditions. While the early\nstages of this build-up have already been\ndescribed in Despatches from the India Com-\nmand, a brief recapitulation of the facts may\nbe opportune here.\n\n147. Our strategy, in 1942, was defensive and\nour advanced bases were selected accordingly.\nThe area of operations was, and still is, divided\n\nadministratively into two fronts—Arakan and\n\n* Operations in Assam and Burma from 23rd June,\n1944 to 12th November, 1944. :\n",

Not\nonly was there no all-weather road in Arakan,\nbut no road at all worthy of the name. We\nwere, therefore, compelled to rely largely on\ncoastal shipping and inland water transport\nand, for many months, there was a serious\nshortage of both types of vessels. The diffi-\nculty was eventually overcome to some extent\nby the construction of a road which had to be\nsurfaced with bricks, the coal for which had\nto be imported from India.

To these local topographical dis-\nadvantages must be added the further one of\nthe liability to interruption of the railway to\nAssam by the rivers and streams which pour\ndown from the huge catchment area of the\nHimalayas, the foothills of which the railway\nskirts. In.1942, the railway was cut by floods\nfrom the 24th June till the 30th November.\n\n150. The railway system, which is metre\ngauge, had never previously had to tackle more\nthan a moderately heavy seasonal load of\n-cereals and tea.

It entailed, not only the trans-\nportation of heavy tonnages of engineer stores,\nbut also of coal, since much surfacing had to\nbe done with burnt brick.\n\nThe move and maintenance of forces by air,\nas well as our probable future commitments,\nhave necessitated a large increase in airfield\nconstruction, but I shall deal with this subject\nin greater detail later on.\n\n153.

Manpower. The “ divisional slice” in\nthis Theatre has averaged 56,000, excluding\ncivil labour, and 70,000 including it, whereas,\nI believe, the “ divisional slice ” in Normandy\nis 40,000. The high figure in the Burma cam-\npaign is mainly due to the large administrative\n“tail”, comprising numerous engineer and\nlabour units, which are needed to overcome\nthe physical difficulties on our lines of com-\nmunication.\n\n155. Reinforcements. The demand for rein-\nforcements is heavy, owing to the high sick\nrate which is, however, much lower than anti-\ncipated, and to the time lag between demand\nand arrival, due to the distances which rein-\nforcements have to cover over a long and in-\ndifferent transportation system.\n\nReinforcement has been below wastage ; but,\napart from British infantry, in which the\nshortage is most acute, it has not been so\nserious as to impair fighting efficiency. Broadly\nspeaking, the numbers available have been in\nexcess of battle casualties, but they have not\nbeen sufficient to meet the total wastage and\nthus keep reinforcement camps full.\n\n. 156. British reinforcements for Fourtzenth\nArmy are provided by General Headquarters,\nIndia, from (a) the British Base Reinforcement\nCamp at Deolali, (b) personnel freed by the\ndisbandment of units, e.g. A.A.

Indian reinforcements,\nfrom Regimental Centres and Depots, pass\nthrough either 14 or 39 Indian Training\nDivisions to Fourteenth Army reinforcement\ncamps. There are twelve such camps in the\nArmy area, consisting each of two British and\neight Indian Sections. Each Section is 300\nstrong, and the total capacity of each camp\nis thus 3,000.

The Japanese thrust against Imphal\nhowever, necessitated their removal, and a\nsituation arose in which about twenty-five per\ncent. of our hospitals became temporarily non-\neffective. This would have been serious had it\nnot been for two saving factors: firstly, air\ntransport provided a link between our northern\nand southern lines of communication,\nenabling casualties to be rapidly cleared to\nhospitals serving the Arakan Front; and\nsecondly, the sick rate on both fronts fell far\nshort of the estimate for which provision had\nbeen made.\n\n(6) In the south, where extensive operations\nhad not been originally contemplated, and\nwhere the forces engaged were smaller, our\nhospitals had not been concentrated so far\nforward.\n\nConsiderable discussion took place early in\nthe year between 11 Army Group and Gencral\nHeadquarters, India, regarding the adequacy\nor otherwise of the hospitals.\n\nThe decisions then taken proved to be sound\non the whole, in spite of our forecasts being\nwrong and of radical alterations in the lines of\nevacuation.

At the beginning of the year, facilities\nfor evacuation were reviewed, and as a result\nof representations made by me to the Supreme\nAllied Commander, six hospital ships were\nallotted to Fourteenth Army.\n\nFurther, a co-ordinating committee, invested\nwith executive authority, which includes repre-\nsentatives of 11 Army Group and General\nHeadquarters, India, and of the many services\naffected, has been set up to deal in detail with\nthe complicated problem of medical evacua-\ntion. Its measures have so far proved effec-\ntive, notwithstanding the many problems which\nhave arisen.\n\n159. One interesting feature of the recent\nfighting is that the medical units have found\nthemselves on occasions called upon to under-\ntake part of the responsibility for their own\ndefence. That medical personnel had to fight\nproved to be a necessity—it was not a question\nas to whether they should defend themselves,\nbut how best they could do so.\n\n160. (@ The complicated problem of\nmedical evacuation from Arakan involved\nthe use of almost every conceivable form of\ntransport. Hand carriages, mules, jeeps, ambu-\nlances, D.U.K.Ws., sampans, flats, paddle\nsteamers, hospital ships, ambulance trains, and\nlight and heavy aircraft have all had to be\nemployed over one stage or another of the\njourney.\n\n(6) To and from 81 (West African) Division\noperating in the Kaladan Valley, medical\n\n1369\n\nsupply and evacuation has had to be entirely\nby air.

This method of moving the wounded\nhas a most beneficial effect on the morale of\nthe fighting soldier.\n\n161. The Medical Aspect—B. Sick Rate.\nThe most satisfactory feature on the medical\nside has been the surprisingly low sick rate\nduring the first six months of the year. The\nexpected rise to 5 or 6 per 1,000 per diem has\nnot happened and the rate in May was as low\nas 3.1 per 1,000 including battle casualties.\nThis is an almost incredibly low figure com-\npared with that for 1943, which was 6 per\n1,000 per diem ; and, in spite of the seasonal\ni ae of malaria, it has since dropped to\n2.9.\n\nSince November 1943, food supply greatly\nimproved, and more fresh meat, fruit and vege-\ntables became available. It is probable that\nthis improvement in rations has been a major\ncause in keeping down the sick rate.\n\n162. The most serious menace we have to\nface, where disease is concerned, is of course\nmalaria, and this can only be overcome by\nunremitting effort and vigilance. The malaria\nrate, up till the end of June, has remained con-\nsistently low compared with last year. This is\nremarkable, since operations have been\ncarried out on a greatly extended scale, and\nmany more troops have been exposed to the\ntisk of infection. If the same rate had obtained\nin Arakan and at Imphal from March to June\nas in the same months of 1943, the effect on\noperations would have been serious.\n\nI attribute this satisfactory state of affairs\nto four factors—firstly, better anti-malarial dis-\ncipline ; secondly, the improved anti-malarial\norganization which, under medical control and\naided by the engineers, has freed certain areas\nfrom the mosquito ; thirdly, the ample flow of\nanti-malarial supplies of all kinds; and last,\nbut not least, improved morale, since troops\nin good fettle look after themselves better in\nevery way than when they are depressed.\n\nThe efficacy of D.D.T. as an anti-mosquito\nspray is shortly being tested in the Kabaw\nValley.\n\n163.

The present standard of training of\nmedical personnel in this Theatre does not\ncompare altogether favourably’ with that in\nothers, but, taking into consideration the ex-\npansion which the Medical Services have under-\n\ngone, and the acute shortage of medical officers .\n\nin India, it is, J am sure, as good as can be\nexpected. Training is, I know, continuous and\nintensive in the India Command and the situa-\ntion is improving.\n\n167. The supply of medical stores, including\ndrugs, has been most satisfactory. The con-\nsumption of mepacrine in Fourteenth Army as\na malaria suppressive has reached twelve\nmillion tablets a month.\n\n168. The problem of providing adequate\nmedical supervision for the large amount of\ncivilian labour employed in the Fourteenth\nArmy area is being met at present, but it may\nbecome more difficult when civilian labour\nforces have to be moved into re-conquered\nterritory as our troops advance.\n\n169. The thirteen convalescent depots in 11\nArmy Group have proved their value as an\nessential link between hospital and reinforce-\nment camp. The “ patients” in the British\nDepot at Kohima played a notable part in the\ndefence of that place during the siege, though\nsuch strenuous work had hardly been recom-\nmended as part of their convalescence.\n\nMiscellaneous A.G. Points.\n\n170. Legal and Judicial. (a) As a result of\nthe Supreme Allied Commander’s Proclamation\nNo. 1 of 1944, under which he assumed control\nof re-occupied territory, British Military\nAdministration Courts have been set up in\nBurma.\n\n(b) Arrangements have been made with\nGeneral Headquarters, India, for assistance to\nbe given to Fourteenth Army in the prosecution\nof those suspected to be military traitors who\nfall into our hands. More detailed interroga-\ntion is now to be carried out at Forward\nInterrogation Centres and the majority of\nprisoners will be dealt with in forward areas.\n\n171. Leave. (a) All British personnel have\nhad to be restricted to fourteen days leave\nduring 1944, owing to the lack of accommoda-\ntion in suitable areas, and to transportation\ndifficulties which can only be solved by the\nprovision of more aircraft,\n\n(5) Representations were made that British\nService officers, both with British units and\nthose seconded to the Indian Army, who were\nwilling, should be granted home leave in lieu\nof repatriation. Many such officers have\nvaluable experience in jungle warfare and their\nretention is most desirable. :\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\n(©) Transportation difficulties originally pre-\ncluded the achievement of the target of twenty-\neight days leave per annum for Indian ranks,\nbut these have since been overcome.\n\n172. Morale and Welfare. The large\nnumber of troops who have taken part in\noperations have gained confidence from their\ncontact with the enemy. It is universally felt\nthat the Japanese soldier, although a good in-\nfantryman, is no match for our well-trained\nand well-equipped troops, supported by a\npowerful air force.\n\n173. The still inadequate but increased and,\nI may add, well deserved publicity now being\ngiven to this theatre of war, coupled with\nthe introduction of more amenities such as\nmobile canteens, cinemas, wireless sets, sports\nequipment, a daily newspa) (“ SEAC ”),\nand also visits from “Ensa”, have all con-\ntributed to the improvement in morale. Men\nare beginning to feel that they do not belong\nto “ The Forgotten Army ”. .\n\nIn all my efforts to improve the lot of the\nBritish rank and file, I am closely in touch\nwith the Commander-in-Chief, India, whose\ntroops share with mine in the severe handicaps\nof climate, homesickness, and the feeling that\nthe Burma Border is not, at ent, the de-\ncisive Theatre. In spite of the steps that\nhave been, and are being taken, the under-\ncurrent of feeling against service in the East\nstill persists, and many “ grouses” are still in\nevidence, though the spirit of the troops in\nforward units is magnificent.\n\nAmong British troops, the most burning\nquestion has been, and is, that of repatriation.\nIn particular, the disparity in the terms of\noverseas service between the Army and the\nR.AF. is a continual source of grievance, The\nmeasures recently taken to improve this will,\nit is hoped, allay some of the feeling that has\nundoubtedly existed.\n\n174. The chief anxiety of Indian troops, as\nalways, is the welfare during their absence of\ntheir families, but the leave situation is now\nsatisfactory. The effect of enemy paganda\non the Indian soldier has been negligible.\n\n175. The work of philanthropic bodies such\nas the Red Cross, the Y.M.C.A. and Toc H\nhas been most valuable and J am very grateful\nindeed to the large body of voluntary workers\nwho have contributed so much to the welfare\nof the troops, both British and Indian.\n\nThe Lines of Communication.\n\n176. I have already referred to the Northern\nand Southern Lines of Communication Areas,\nbut there are in fact three lines of communi-\ncation supplying Fourteenth Army :—\n\n(@) The Assam Line of Communication,\nwhich has three railheads: that at Manipur\nRoad, also called Dimapur, supplying the\nImphal Front; and those at Ledo and\nChabua which supply the Chinese-American\nforces operating in Northern Burma, and\nthe air ferry route to China.\n\n(6) The Eastern Bengal Line of Com-\nmunication, which serves our bases in\nEastern Bengal and the airfields in the Surma\nValley, which are extensively used for air\nsupply. .\n\nSome flexibility between the Eastern\nBengal and Assam lines of communication\n",

The Assam Line of Communication.\nThis line of communication has four main\nToutes :—\n\n@ The metre gauge rail route from\nMokameh Ghat* to Amingaon, across the\nBrahmaputra by wagon ferry, and onwards\nto Dimapur and the American bases in the\nLedo area. Stores arrive at Mokameh Ghat\nby broad gauge railway from depots in\nNorthern and Central India.\n\n(6) The broad gauge route from Calcutta\nto river ghats on the lower Brahmaputra and\nto transhipment stations of the metre gauge\nroute. The stores carried come from the\nCalcutta Base Area and from Southern and\nWestern India. .\n\n© The river route. This includes an all\nwater route up the Brahmaputra from\nCalcutta and, also, lifts between intermediate\nrail-served ghats on the Ganges and Brahma-\nputra.\n\n(d) A road, known as the Assam access\nroad, from Siliguri where it connects with\nthe broad gauge railway, to Bongaigaon on\nthe metre gauge route.\n\nThe control of the Assam line of communi-\ncation rests with General Headquarters, India.\n\n178. Communications in Assam are compli-\n\ncated and rendered unreliable, by both operat--\n\ning and physical difficulties. The operating\ndifficulties are due to the fact that a far greater\nload has been imposed on the railway ‘than\ncould be handled by the normal civil organiza-\ntion. The physical difficulties are due to the\nseasonal liability of both road and rail com-\nmunications to serious flooding, and also to\nthe vagaries of the Brahmaputra. At some\nplaces, sudden rises in the river will wash away\nghats, with all their connected installations,\ncompletely ; while at others, sand banks will\nform and render them unapproachable by river\ncraft.\n\nThe operating difficulties have been over-\ncome to a great extent by the employment of\nmilitary transportation units to assist the civil\nstaff. The control of a considerable section\nof the metre gauge main line has been taken\nover by the United States Transportation Corps\nwhich has resulted in a great increase in\ntraffic. The physical difficulties are being met\nby the provision, where possible, of alternative\nmeans of communication.\n\n179. Very extensive measures have been, and\nare being, taken to improve the capacity of this\nline of communication. They include the\ndoubling of certain sections on both the broad\nand metre gauge lines, the conversion of one\nsection from narrow gauge to metre gauge,\nthe construction of additional ghats and ferries,\nthe improvement of existing facilities, and the\nprovision of more river craft.\n\n* “Ghat” means a landing stage.\n\n1371\n\nA proposal to erect a railway bridge across\nthe Brahmaputra at Amingaon was rejected on\nthe grounds that it would take too long to build.\nThe alternative was to increase the capacity\nof the Amingaon—Pandu ferry, and this has\nbeen done.\n\n180. The Eastern Bengal Line of Communi\ncation. This line consists of three main\nToutes : —~\n\n(@) The sea route from Calcutta and Viza-\ngapatam to Chittagong.\n\n(6) From the Calcutta area to the Eastern\nBengal metre gauge railway system, either\nby rail (via the Tistamukh wagon ferry), or\nby inland water transport, or by a combina-\ntion of both. This railway system converges\non Akhaura, and from there divides into two\nbranches. The northern branch serves the\nSurma Valley airfields joining up with\nthe Assam line of communication across the\nhill section of the railway between Badarpur\nand Lumding, and the southern supplies the\nChittagong area. ;\n\n(c) The road running south from the\nAssam trunk road, through Shillong, Sylhet\nand Comilla, to Chittagong.\n\n181. The difficulties encountered on this line\nof communication are, as regards the rail-\nways:—\n\n(@) The Eastern Bengal system is unable\nadequately to cope with the increased lift to\nairfields used for air supply.\n\n(6) The capacity of the hill rail link be-\ntween Badarpur and Lumding, which is\nlimited to only nine trains a day each way,\nwith a nett load of 140 tons each.\n\n182. The principal developments of the\nrailways in Eastern Bengal have been made\nwith a view to providing a supplementary rail\nroute for the Assam line of communication.\nThese include :—\n\n@ The provision of additional crossing\nstations between the wagon ferry terminal\nat Bahadurabad and Badapur.\n\nG@) Re-laying the hill section between\n\n- Badarpur and Lumding to permit of the use\nof more powerful locomotives and longer\ntrains.\n\nIn June, an investigation was carried out\nby representatives of 11 Army Group ; General\nHeadquarters, India; Headquarters, Supreme\nAllied Commander, South-East Asia Com-\nmand; and the United States forces. Their\nrecommendations, which are already being\nadopted, will increase line and terminal capa-\ncity throughout the whole system.\n\n183. Chittagong Port. The limited capacity\nof this port originally restricted the use of the\ndirect sea route, but steady increase has been\nobtained by improving the railway serving the\nwharves, providing additional moorings and\njetties, building more storage accommodation,\nre-erecting equipment dismantled and removed\nunder the denial scheme and by the supply of\nmore lighters.\n\nThe working of the port has also improved\nas a result of its reorganization when Four-\nteenth Army assumed control on the Ist\nFebruary.\n\nThe stores imported have increased by 150\nper cent. since November 1943.\n",

The Assam Line of Communication.\nThis line of communication has four main\nToutes :—\n\n@ The metre gauge rail route from\nMokameh Ghat* to Amingaon, across the\nBrahmaputra by wagon ferry, and onwards\nto Dimapur and the American bases in the\nLedo area. Stores arrive at Mokameh Ghat\nby broad gauge railway from depots in\nNorthern and Central India.\n\n(6) The broad gauge route from Calcutta\nto river ghats on the lower Brahmaputra and\nto transhipment stations of the metre gauge\nroute. The stores carried come from the\nCalcutta Base Area and from Southern and\nWestern India. .\n\n© The river route. This includes an all\nwater route up the Brahmaputra from\nCalcutta and, also, lifts between intermediate\nrail-served ghats on the Ganges and Brahma-\nputra.\n\n(d) A road, known as the Assam access\nroad, from Siliguri where it connects with\nthe broad gauge railway, to Bongaigaon on\nthe metre gauge route.\n\nThe control of the Assam line of communi-\ncation rests with General Headquarters, India.\n\n178. Communications in Assam are compli-\n\ncated and rendered unreliable, by both operat--\n\ning and physical difficulties. The operating\ndifficulties are due to the fact that a far greater\nload has been imposed on the railway ‘than\ncould be handled by the normal civil organiza-\ntion. The physical difficulties are due to the\nseasonal liability of both road and rail com-\nmunications to serious flooding, and also to\nthe vagaries of the Brahmaputra. At some\nplaces, sudden rises in the river will wash away\nghats, with all their connected installations,\ncompletely ; while at others, sand banks will\nform and render them unapproachable by river\ncraft.\n\nThe operating difficulties have been over-\ncome to a great extent by the employment of\nmilitary transportation units to assist the civil\nstaff. The control of a considerable section\nof the metre gauge main line has been taken\nover by the United States Transportation Corps\nwhich has resulted in a great increase in\ntraffic. The physical difficulties are being met\nby the provision, where possible, of alternative\nmeans of communication.\n\n179. Very extensive measures have been, and\nare being, taken to improve the capacity of this\nline of communication. They include the\ndoubling of certain sections on both the broad\nand metre gauge lines, the conversion of one\nsection from narrow gauge to metre gauge,\nthe construction of additional ghats and ferries,\nthe improvement of existing facilities, and the\nprovision of more river craft.\n\n* “Ghat” means a landing stage.\n\n1371\n\nA proposal to erect a railway bridge across\nthe Brahmaputra at Amingaon was rejected on\nthe grounds that it would take too long to build.\nThe alternative was to increase the capacity\nof the Amingaon—Pandu ferry, and this has\nbeen done.\n\n180. The Eastern Bengal Line of Communi\ncation. This line consists of three main\nToutes : —~\n\n(@) The sea route from Calcutta and Viza-\ngapatam to Chittagong.\n\n(6) From the Calcutta area to the Eastern\nBengal metre gauge railway system, either\nby rail (via the Tistamukh wagon ferry), or\nby inland water transport, or by a combina-\ntion of both. This railway system converges\non Akhaura, and from there divides into two\nbranches. The northern branch serves the\nSurma Valley airfields joining up with\nthe Assam line of communication across the\nhill section of the railway between Badarpur\nand Lumding, and the southern supplies the\nChittagong area. ;\n\n(c) The road running south from the\nAssam trunk road, through Shillong, Sylhet\nand Comilla, to Chittagong.\n\n181. The difficulties encountered on this line\nof communication are, as regards the rail-\nways:—\n\n(@) The Eastern Bengal system is unable\nadequately to cope with the increased lift to\nairfields used for air supply.\n\n(6) The capacity of the hill rail link be-\ntween Badarpur and Lumding, which is\nlimited to only nine trains a day each way,\nwith a nett load of 140 tons each.\n\n182. The principal developments of the\nrailways in Eastern Bengal have been made\nwith a view to providing a supplementary rail\nroute for the Assam line of communication.\nThese include :—\n\n@ The provision of additional crossing\nstations between the wagon ferry terminal\nat Bahadurabad and Badapur.\n\nG@) Re-laying the hill section between\n\n- Badarpur and Lumding to permit of the use\nof more powerful locomotives and longer\ntrains.\n\nIn June, an investigation was carried out\nby representatives of 11 Army Group ; General\nHeadquarters, India; Headquarters, Supreme\nAllied Commander, South-East Asia Com-\nmand; and the United States forces.

The Arakan Line of Communication.\nThis line supplies the area to the south of\nChittagong, and the lack of all-weather roads\ncauses the burden to fall mainly on sea and\ntiver transport. There are two main routes: —\n\n(a) By road, from Chittagong, via Ramu,\nto Tumbru at the head of the Naf River,\nand thence on to Bawli Bazaar and Maung-\ndaw. The road is all-weather up to Tum-\nbru, with the exception of the section be-\ntween Chittagong and Dohazari.\n\n(6) By water, from Chittagong to Cox’s\nBazaar and Utakhali; from Chittagong to\nMaungdaw direct; and by the Naf River\nfrom Tumbru to Maungdaw.\n\nIn addition to the above, there were two\nsubsidiary sections of the line of communi-\ncation :—\n\n@) On the Sangu and Kaladan Rivers,\nto support 81 (West African) Division.\n\nGi) On the Mayu River, to support the left\nflank of 15 Indian Corps.\n\n185. The main difficulties met with on this\nline of communication are the physical diffi-\nculties of road contruction in an area which\nis either mountainous or liable to inundation in\nthe monsoons and where no stone exists ; the\nlimited capacity of Chittagong and the very\nrestricted capacities of Cox’s Bazaar, Utakhali\nand Maungdaw ; and the shortage of craft on\nrivers, the mouths of which are under enemy\ncontrol.\n\nThe diversity in the types of rivercraft em-\nployed is another factor which causes added\ndifficulties ; small coasters, ordinary tugs, “‘D”\ntype diesel driven tugs of wooden construction,\ncargo flats, ramped cargo lighters, Eureka tow\nboats, Higgins barges, a variety of country craft\nfitted with outboard motors (with a horse-power\nranging from 9.8 to 22), and last, but not least,\nthe sampan.\n\n186. As on the other lines of communica-\ntion, very considerable development has taken\nlace in Arakan. The road southwards from\nohazari has been converted to a fair weather\ntwo-way road as far as Maungdaw and an all-\nweather one-way one as far as Tumbru. The\ndevelopment of the road to Tumbru to two-\nway all-weather standard is in progress.\n\nOur water communications have been im-\nproved by increasing the capacity of the ports\nin the Cox’s Bazaar area from 400 to 1,000\ntons a day. Tumbru Ghat is also now cap-\nable of handling 1,000 tons daily ; and as soon\nas Maungdaw was captured, Transportation\nConstruction Units raised its daily capacity to\n600 tons. '\n\nPerhaps the most creditable feat, however,\nwas the way in which much needed reinforce-\nments of rivercraft were sailed into the Naf\nRiver. In spite of the fact that the mouth of\nthe river was held by the enemy, Inland Water\nTransportation ‘units, during the early stages of\nthe winter operations, ran craft down the coast\nand up into the river—air cover being pro-\nvide1—to supplement the water transport which\nhad been used the previous season. The river\nfleet in the Naf was thus increased until it\nwas capable of handling 1,000 tons a day\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THe LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\nbetween Tumbru and the numerous jetties\nwhich have been constructed between this ghat\nand Maungdaw\n\n187. Oil Pipelines. Oil pipelines are under\nconstruction which will, of course, relieve the\nload on other forms of transport. An American\n6-inch pipeline has been completed from\nCalcutta to North Assam and work on a simi-\nlar line from Chittagong to the same area has\nbeen started. We are laying 4-inch pipeline\nfrom Chittagong to Imphal, via Manipur Road,\nwhich is nearly finished. The American line\nfrom Ledo to the Myitkyina area is being\nextended, and a British line from Imphal to\nKalewa will probably be built. ,\n\n188. Summary of Developments on our Lines\nof Communication. The main features have\nbeen:—\n\n(@) The increase in the capacity of the\nAssam line of communication.\n\n(6) The increase in the capacity of\nChittagong.\n\n(c) The development of the capacity of.\nthe sea and river line of communication\nsouthwards from Chittagong, from 400 tons\nto 1,000 tons a day.\n\n(d@) The increase in air supply due to the\ndevelopment of the airfields in the Surma\nValley and the lines of communication\nleading to them.\n\n(e) The construction of oil pipelines.\n\nSupply and Maintenance.\n\n189. The base for our operations in Burma\nis, of course, India, and all imported or indi-\ngenous stores pass through the Indian Reserve\nBase Depots.\n\nThe stocks of stores which we intended to\nhold on both the northern and southern\nlines were sixty days’ working stock plus\nthirty days’ reserve.\n\nStores from the Indian Reserve Bases are\ndelivered to Advanced Bases in the Four-\nteenth Army area, which, for Arakan, are\nlocated about Chittagong and Mymensingh,\nand, for the northern line, at Gauhati and\nManipur Road.\n\n190. Arakan Front: During the last six\nmonths,an average of some 64,000 tons monthly\nhas been moved through the port of Chitta-\ngong. A further 4,600 tons is shipped direct\nfrom Calcutta to the small ports south of\nChittagong. The railway “lift” in this area,\nex India, has averaged, over the same period,\n19,000 tons monthly.\n\nThe northern part of East Bengal is served\nby Mymensingh from which the requirements\nof the air force, reserve formations in the\ndistrict, and the air supply base airfields are\nmet.\n\nThe Chittagong depots supply the Arakan,\nusing road, sea and inland water transport.\n\n191. Assam Front: For the first three months\nof the year, the line of communication on\nthis front was unable to meet in full the\nheavy demands of both the British and United\nStates forces. From the beginning of April\n1944, however, its capacity has been notably\nimproved and it can now lift the full require-\nments of the Allies ; the tonnage having risen,\nin the last six months, from some 3,800 tons\nper diem to 5,200.\n",

The Arakan Line of Communication.\nThis line supplies the area to the south of\nChittagong, and the lack of all-weather roads\ncauses the burden to fall mainly on sea and\ntiver transport. There are two main routes: —\n\n(a) By road, from Chittagong, via Ramu,\nto Tumbru at the head of the Naf River,\nand thence on to Bawli Bazaar and Maung-\ndaw. The road is all-weather up to Tum-\nbru, with the exception of the section be-\ntween Chittagong and Dohazari.\n\n(6) By water, from Chittagong to Cox’s\nBazaar and Utakhali; from Chittagong to\nMaungdaw direct; and by the Naf River\nfrom Tumbru to Maungdaw.\n\nIn addition to the above, there were two\nsubsidiary sections of the line of communi-\ncation :—\n\n@) On the Sangu and Kaladan Rivers,\nto support 81 (West African) Division.\n\nGi) On the Mayu River, to support the left\nflank of 15 Indian Corps.\n\n185. The main difficulties met with on this\nline of communication are the physical diffi-\nculties of road contruction in an area which\nis either mountainous or liable to inundation in\nthe monsoons and where no stone exists ; the\nlimited capacity of Chittagong and the very\nrestricted capacities of Cox’s Bazaar, Utakhali\nand Maungdaw ; and the shortage of craft on\nrivers, the mouths of which are under enemy\ncontrol.\n\nThe diversity in the types of rivercraft em-\nployed is another factor which causes added\ndifficulties ; small coasters, ordinary tugs, “‘D”\ntype diesel driven tugs of wooden construction,\ncargo flats, ramped cargo lighters, Eureka tow\nboats, Higgins barges, a variety of country craft\nfitted with outboard motors (with a horse-power\nranging from 9.8 to 22), and last, but not least,\nthe sampan.\n\n186. As on the other lines of communica-\ntion, very considerable development has taken\nlace in Arakan. The road southwards from\nohazari has been converted to a fair weather\ntwo-way road as far as Maungdaw and an all-\nweather one-way one as far as Tumbru. The\ndevelopment of the road to Tumbru to two-\nway all-weather standard is in progress.\n\nOur water communications have been im-\nproved by increasing the capacity of the ports\nin the Cox’s Bazaar area from 400 to 1,000\ntons a day. Tumbru Ghat is also now cap-\nable of handling 1,000 tons daily ; and as soon\nas Maungdaw was captured, Transportation\nConstruction Units raised its daily capacity to\n600 tons. '\n\nPerhaps the most creditable feat, however,\nwas the way in which much needed reinforce-\nments of rivercraft were sailed into the Naf\nRiver. In spite of the fact that the mouth of\nthe river was held by the enemy, Inland Water\nTransportation ‘units, during the early stages of\nthe winter operations, ran craft down the coast\nand up into the river—air cover being pro-\nvide1—to supplement the water transport which\nhad been used the previous season. The river\nfleet in the Naf was thus increased until it\nwas capable of handling 1,000 tons a day\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THe LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\nbetween Tumbru and the numerous jetties\nwhich have been constructed between this ghat\nand Maungdaw\n\n187. Oil Pipelines. Oil pipelines are under\nconstruction which will, of course, relieve the\nload on other forms of transport. An American\n6-inch pipeline has been completed from\nCalcutta to North Assam and work on a simi-\nlar line from Chittagong to the same area has\nbeen started. We are laying 4-inch pipeline\nfrom Chittagong to Imphal, via Manipur Road,\nwhich is nearly finished. The American line\nfrom Ledo to the Myitkyina area is being\nextended, and a British line from Imphal to\nKalewa will probably be built. ,\n\n188. Summary of Developments on our Lines\nof Communication. The main features have\nbeen:—\n\n(@) The increase in the capacity of the\nAssam line of communication.\n\n(6) The increase in the capacity of\nChittagong.\n\n(c) The development of the capacity of.\nthe sea and river line of communication\nsouthwards from Chittagong, from 400 tons\nto 1,000 tons a day.\n\n(d@) The increase in air supply due to the\ndevelopment of the airfields in the Surma\nValley and the lines of communication\nleading to them.\n\n(e) The construction of oil pipelines.\n\nSupply and Maintenance.\n\n189. The base for our operations in Burma\nis, of course, India, and all imported or indi-\ngenous stores pass through the Indian Reserve\nBase Depots.\n\nThe stocks of stores which we intended to\nhold on both the northern and southern\nlines were sixty days’ working stock plus\nthirty days’ reserve.\n\nStores from the Indian Reserve Bases are\ndelivered to Advanced Bases in the Four-\nteenth Army area, which, for Arakan, are\nlocated about Chittagong and Mymensingh,\nand, for the northern line, at Gauhati and\nManipur Road.\n\n190. Arakan Front: During the last six\nmonths,an average of some 64,000 tons monthly\nhas been moved through the port of Chitta-\ngong. A further 4,600 tons is shipped direct\nfrom Calcutta to the small ports south of\nChittagong. The railway “lift” in this area,\nex India, has averaged, over the same period,\n19,000 tons monthly.\n\nThe northern part of East Bengal is served\nby Mymensingh from which the requirements\nof the air force, reserve formations in the\ndistrict, and the air supply base airfields are\nmet.\n\nThe Chittagong depots supply the Arakan,\nusing road, sea and inland water transport.\n\n191. Assam Front: For the first three months\nof the year, the line of communication on\nthis front was unable to meet in full the\nheavy demands of both the British and United\nStates forces. From the beginning of April\n1944, however, its capacity has been notably\nimproved and it can now lift the full require-\nments of the Allies ; the tonnage having risen,\nin the last six months, from some 3,800 tons\nper diem to 5,200.\n",

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT To tas LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\nFrom our railhead at Dimapur, a long road\nline of communication leads up to, and\nbeyond, Imphal. Before the Japanese\nadvance in March, a division was fighting be-\nyond Tamu, which is 195 miles from rail-\nhead, and another was engaged south of Tid-\ndim, 300 miles from railhead. Imphal is 135\nmiles from Dimapur.\n\n192. The maintenance of Special Force was\nentirely by air. For this purpose, bases at\nairfields in East Bengal were originally\norganized and stocked, but at a later stage\nin the planning, the base was transferred to the\nSurma Valley, and from the airfields there\nmaintenance by supply-dropping and -landing\nhas been carried out throughout the operations.\n\n193. The building up of stocks on both\nthe northern and southern lines was a matter\nof some anxiety during the earlier part of the\nperiod. On the southern line, the capacity\nof the port of Chittagong, in spite of progres-\nsive expansion, barely kept pace with the\nneeds of the forces, while on the northern\nline of communication, the total capacity\navailable until April was only just sufficient\nfor maintenance. Reserve stocks of many\ncommodities, especially petrol, fell to dan-\ngerously low levels.\n\n194. A supply difficulty which exists in both\nAssam and Arakan is that, with the excep-\ntion of the rice crop which barely meets the\nneeds of the civil population, no foodstuffs\nare obtainable in either area. In Bengal last\nyear, this caused famine; and in parts of\nAssam the local inhabitants can barely sup-\nport themselves. This imposed on the Army\nthe need for importing fresh meat, vegetables,\nfruit, etc., from distant areas over difficult\nlines of communication; and of having to\nsupply large quantities of tinned and de-\nhydrated substitutes to rectify deficiencies in\nthe fresh ration.\n\n195. I have already mentioned the extent\nto which air supply has developed, but the\nsubject is of such outstanding importance that\nthe following figures are of interest. From\nthe 8th to the 21st February, when the\nJapanese attack severed the communications of\n7 Indian Division, a total of 923 tons of sup-\nplies of all types was dropped on the sur-\nrounded elements of that division. The\nmonth’s total for February of air-dropped sup-\nplies in Arakan was 2,710 tons. In April,\nthe total tonnage dropped was: —\n\nArakan, 1,316 (for 81 (West African) Divi-\nsion in the Kaladan Valley).\n\nSpecial Force, 1,073.\n\n’ From the 16th April to the 22nd June (the\ndate of the re-opening of the Kohima—\nImphal road), the amount flown into Imphal\nfor 4 Corps was 13,155 tons. Nearly 10,000\ncasualties were evacuated by air from Imphal\nbetween these dates.\n\n196. The operation of road transport be-\ntween railhead (Dimapur) and Imphal, and\nforward thereof, is also of interest. A “round\nthe clock” or L.G.O.C.* system has been\n\n* L.G.O.C.=London Generali Omnibus Company\n\n(which was absorbed into the London Passenger\nTransport Board).\n\n1373\n\nadopted which works throughout the twenty-\nfour hours. Vehicles run independently,\ndrivers being changed at intervals which give\nthem adequate rest. The following figures\ncover the month of January :—\n\nNumber of task vehicles we 1,321\n\nTonnage delivered «. 47,304\nTotal mileage run... «++ 4,463,454\nAverage daily mileage per\n\nvehicle wee we wee 110\nCasualties:\n\n(@) Miles per accident 19,239\n\n(b) Vehicles evacuated 103\n\nAt this time, as already mentioned, divi-\nsions had to be supplied up to 300 miles from\ntrailhead. Much of this is narrow and dangerous\nmountain road and J think the above figures\ndemonstrate the efficiency of Indian lorry\n\nvers.\n\n197. The importance of labour in an un-\ndeveloped Eastern Theatre cannot be over-\nstated. The construction of hundreds of miles\nof railways, roads, and pipelines ; the prepara-\ntion of new airfields and the expansion of\nexisting ones; transportation works on the\nlines of communication, including port de-\nvelopment; the expansion of hospitals,\ndepots and camps in rear areas, etc., all mean\nan unending demand for more and more\nlabour.\n\nOn the Ist May, the figure of organized\nlabour employed by Fourteenth Army was\nover 178,000, while demands for a further\n18,600 were under examination. In addition\nto this, some 200,000 civilian (contractor)\nlabour was employed on Army projects. These\nfigures include labour supplied to the United\nStates forces. In spite of this total of nearly\n400,000, the deficit on this date was 31,400.\n\n198. As regards supplies, the two most\npressing problems have been the provision of\nfresh foodstuffs, and of petrol.\n\nI have already mentioned that dehydrated\nmeat and vegetables were being supplied to\nmeet the inadequacy of fresh supplies. I may\nadd that every encouragement and assistance\nis given to units to grow their own vegetables\nwhere this is practicable. :\n\nA Local Resources branch of the staff,\nassisted by an agricultural expert borrowed\nfrom the Government of Assam, which is\nbringing some 18,000 acres under vegetable\ncultivation, was established. Pig breeding,\ngoat rearing, and chicken farming have also\nbeen planned on an extensive scale.\n\n199. The supply of petro] and lubricants,\nincluding those for aviation, has caused some\nanxiety. The monthly quantities, to be supplied\nthrough Army channels, were estimated last\nMay to exceed eleven and a quarter million\ngallons, of which nearly half was high grade\naviation spirit.\n\nIn spite of the progressive improvement in\nthe capacity of our lines of communication,\nwhich has been more than doubled since\nDecember 1943, it has not been found possible\nas yet to do more than provide the quantities\nfor maintenance. The ever increasing demands\nof our Allies in Upper Assam have continued\nto tax our oil resources. I do not foresee\nmuch improvement in the situation until more\npipelines have been finished.\n",

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT To tas LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\nFrom our railhead at Dimapur, a long road\nline of communication leads up to, and\nbeyond, Imphal. Before the Japanese\nadvance in March, a division was fighting be-\nyond Tamu, which is 195 miles from rail-\nhead, and another was engaged south of Tid-\ndim, 300 miles from railhead. Imphal is 135\nmiles from Dimapur.\n\n192. The maintenance of Special Force was\nentirely by air. For this purpose, bases at\nairfields in East Bengal were originally\norganized and stocked, but at a later stage\nin the planning, the base was transferred to the\nSurma Valley, and from the airfields there\nmaintenance by supply-dropping and -landing\nhas been carried out throughout the operations.\n\n193. The building up of stocks on both\nthe northern and southern lines was a matter\nof some anxiety during the earlier part of the\nperiod. On the southern line, the capacity\nof the port of Chittagong, in spite of progres-\nsive expansion, barely kept pace with the\nneeds of the forces, while on the northern\nline of communication, the total capacity\navailable until April was only just sufficient\nfor maintenance. Reserve stocks of many\ncommodities, especially petrol, fell to dan-\ngerously low levels.\n\n194. A supply difficulty which exists in both\nAssam and Arakan is that, with the excep-\ntion of the rice crop which barely meets the\nneeds of the civil population, no foodstuffs\nare obtainable in either area. In Bengal last\nyear, this caused famine; and in parts of\nAssam the local inhabitants can barely sup-\nport themselves. This imposed on the Army\nthe need for importing fresh meat, vegetables,\nfruit, etc., from distant areas over difficult\nlines of communication; and of having to\nsupply large quantities of tinned and de-\nhydrated substitutes to rectify deficiencies in\nthe fresh ration.\n\n195. I have already mentioned the extent\nto which air supply has developed, but the\nsubject is of such outstanding importance that\nthe following figures are of interest. From\nthe 8th to the 21st February, when the\nJapanese attack severed the communications of\n7 Indian Division, a total of 923 tons of sup-\nplies of all types was dropped on the sur-\nrounded elements of that division. The\nmonth’s total for February of air-dropped sup-\nplies in Arakan was 2,710 tons. In April,\nthe total tonnage dropped was: —\n\nArakan, 1,316 (for 81 (West African) Divi-\nsion in the Kaladan Valley).\n\nSpecial Force, 1,073.\n\n’ From the 16th April to the 22nd June (the\ndate of the re-opening of the Kohima—\nImphal road), the amount flown into Imphal\nfor 4 Corps was 13,155 tons. Nearly 10,000\ncasualties were evacuated by air from Imphal\nbetween these dates.\n\n196. The operation of road transport be-\ntween railhead (Dimapur) and Imphal, and\nforward thereof, is also of interest. A “round\nthe clock” or L.G.O.C.* system has been\n\n* L.G.O.C.=London Generali Omnibus Company\n\n(which was absorbed into the London Passenger\nTransport Board).\n\n1373\n\nadopted which works throughout the twenty-\nfour hours. Vehicles run independently,\ndrivers being changed at intervals which give\nthem adequate rest. The following figures\ncover the month of January :—\n\nNumber of task vehicles we 1,321\n\nTonnage delivered «. 47,304\nTotal mileage run... «++ 4,463,454\nAverage daily mileage per\n\nvehicle wee we wee 110\nCasualties:\n\n(@) Miles per accident 19,239\n\n(b) Vehicles evacuated 103\n\nAt this time, as already mentioned, divi-\nsions had to be supplied up to 300 miles from\ntrailhead. Much of this is narrow and dangerous\nmountain road and J think the above figures\ndemonstrate the efficiency of Indian lorry\n\nvers.\n\n197. The importance of labour in an un-\ndeveloped Eastern Theatre cannot be over-\nstated. The construction of hundreds of miles\nof railways, roads, and pipelines ; the prepara-\ntion of new airfields and the expansion of\nexisting ones; transportation works on the\nlines of communication, including port de-\nvelopment; the expansion of hospitals,\ndepots and camps in rear areas, etc., all mean\nan unending demand for more and more\nlabour.\n\nOn the Ist May, the figure of organized\nlabour employed by Fourteenth Army was\nover 178,000, while demands for a further\n18,600 were under examination. In addition\nto this, some 200,000 civilian (contractor)\nlabour was employed on Army projects. These\nfigures include labour supplied to the United\nStates forces. In spite of this total of nearly\n400,000, the deficit on this date was 31,400.\n\n198. As regards supplies, the two most\npressing problems have been the provision of\nfresh foodstuffs, and of petrol.\n\nI have already mentioned that dehydrated\nmeat and vegetables were being supplied to\nmeet the inadequacy of fresh supplies. I may\nadd that every encouragement and assistance\nis given to units to grow their own vegetables\nwhere this is practicable. :\n\nA Local Resources branch of the staff,\nassisted by an agricultural expert borrowed\nfrom the Government of Assam, which is\nbringing some 18,000 acres under vegetable\ncultivation, was established. Pig breeding,\ngoat rearing, and chicken farming have also\nbeen planned on an extensive scale.\n\n199. The supply of petro] and lubricants,\nincluding those for aviation, has caused some\nanxiety. The monthly quantities, to be supplied\nthrough Army channels, were estimated last\nMay to exceed eleven and a quarter million\ngallons, of which nearly half was high grade\naviation spirit.\n\nIn spite of the progressive improvement in\nthe capacity of our lines of communication,\nwhich has been more than doubled since\nDecember 1943, it has not been found possible\nas yet to do more than provide the quantities\nfor maintenance. The ever increasing demands\nof our Allies in Upper Assam have continued\nto tax our oil resources. I do not foresee\nmuch improvement in the situation until more\npipelines have been finished.\n",

Before leaving the subject of supply and\nmaintenance, there are two matters which\ndeserve notice.\n\nThe first is the projected reorganization of\nmechanical transport in the Royal Indian\nArmy Service Corps. At present, there are no\nless than eight types of M.T. units—an organi-\nzation which is both wasteful in manpower,\nand insufficiently flexible, as well as possessing\nother disadvantages. My recommendation to\nGeneral Headquarters, India, that the existing\neight types should be reduced to three, has\nbeen accepted, and the new reorganization is\nbeing adopted.\n\nThe second point of interest affects the Veteri-\nnary Service. In order that animals with Special\nForce should not betray the position of our\ntroops in operations behind the enemy’s lines,\na muting operation was performed. This has\nachieved its object and there has been no loss\nof efficiency.\n\nThe Engineering Effort.\n\n201. I have already described (with one ex-\nception—the Ledo Road) development of the\nrailways, roads and pipelines and I have also\nmentioned airfield construction. The latter,\nhowever, merits more detailed description. I\npropose, too, to touch on bridging, which is so\nimportant in this Theatre, and, also, to discuss\nbriefly the general problem of rapid road con-\nstruction across mountain barriers or through\nthick jungle tracts, for on its solution the\nsuccess of future operations will largely depend.\n\n202. The Ledo Road. This road, which, in\nconjunction with air supply, is the line of com-\nmunication of General Stilwell’s Chinese-\nAmerican forces operating in Northern Burma,\nhas not been described because it does not\nform part of Fourteenth Army’s northern line\nof communication. It is, of course, entirely\nunder American control and, begun by British,\nis being built by American engineers.\n\nIt is now “all-weather two-way” to just\nnorth of Shaduzup and the intention is to com-\nplete it through to Myitkyina in another three\nmonths. Roadhead and railhead are to be at\nNamti, six miles north-east of Mogaung.\n\n203. Airfields. Airfield construction in the\narea under my control can be divided into\nthree categories: construction in the Four-\nteenth Army area ; construction in North-East\nAssam for the United States Army Air Force,\nwhich is primarily in connection with the air-\nlift to China ; and construction in Ceylon.\n\nThere were eighteen main airfields in the\nFourteenth Army area last November. Since\nthat date, three more large fields have been\nbegun and the others have been made up to an\nall-weather standard.\n\nFor future operations, as outlined by the\nChiefs of Staff at the end of March, it became\nnecessary to build airfields adequate to allow\nadditional transport to operate during the mon-\nsoon. In consultation with Air Command,\nSouth-East Asia, it was decided to increase\nthe capacity of fifteen of the existing twenty-\none airfields and to raise the standard to\nadmit of their use by Dakotas and certain types\nof bombers.\n\n204. On the Ist April 1944, the respon-\n\nsibility for the completion and upkeep of the\nAmerican airfields in North-East Assam was\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\ntransferred from General Headquarters, India,\nto 11 Army Group. There are eleven main\nairfields in this area, all of which have now\nbeen completed to all-weather standard, with\nthe exception of two which have been allotted\na low priority by the Commanding General,\nUnited States Air Forces, China-Burma-India\neatre.\n\n205. Airfields in Ceylon are built by the\nAir Ministry Works Department, but they\nremain the responsibility of the Chief Engineer,\nCeylon Army Command. There are nine main\nairfields on the island, work on the improve-\nment and extension of which continues.\n\n206. It would have been quite impossible to\nattain the target dates fixed for the completion\nof this large-scale expansion by using normal\nmaterials such as concrete. Use has, there-\nfore, been made of the new (and hitherto un-\ntried) bitumenized hessian (“ Bithess ”) process\nfor the provision of all-weather standings and\nrunways. This material prevents water pene-\ntrating the ground which accordingly retains\nits full bearing capacity in wet weather. The\nexperiment has already proved a success and\nmay be of great value in future operations\nin a Theatre where monsoon rainfall is so\nheavy.\n\nThe magnitude of the engineering effort in-\nvolved in airfield construction may be judged\nfrom the fact that, for the American airfields:\nin North-East Assam alone, some 16,000\nBritish military officers and men and 45,000\ncivil labour under British military supervision,\nare employed.\n\n207. River Crossings. (a) The problem in\nthis Theatre is complicated by the width of\nobstacles (the Chindwin and Myittha Rivers\nat Kalewa are some 330 yards and 200 yards\nacross respectively in the ‘dry season); the\nspeed of current; the great seasonal variation\nin water levels; and the presence of floating\ndebris. Wide rivers can, of course, only be\nbridged quickly by using floating equipment, as\nthe construction of piers is a major engineering\ntask, but the factors mentioned above.\nespecially fast currents, render the anchoring\nof floating bridges precarious.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, a bridge\n(known as the Falls bridge) has recently been\ndesigned and satisfactorily tested. It is com-\nposed of steel pontoons—widely spaced to\nadmit of the passage of debris—with a Bailey\nsuperstructure, and with a large gantry at each\nend to control the landing bay during the\nmarked variations which occur in water level.\n\nOther measures, which are under investiga-\ntion, include a proposal that only assault equip-\nment should be carried in divisions, bridging\ncompanies to be Army or Corps Troops. Ex-\nperiments are also being undertaken to pro-\nduce a standard type of vehicle capable of\ncarrying all bridging loads.\n\n(b) The alternative method of crossing rivers\nby ferry assumes a special significance in this\nTheatre owing, not only to the width of gaps,\nbut to the fact that the water level is liable to\nsuch sudden changes.\n\nFerrying is largely resorted to on, the lines\nof communication, especially on the\nBrahmaputra.\n",

I\npropose, too, to touch on bridging, which is so\nimportant in this Theatre, and, also, to discuss\nbriefly the general problem of rapid road con-\nstruction across mountain barriers or through\nthick jungle tracts, for on its solution the\nsuccess of future operations will largely depend.\n\n202. The Ledo Road. This road, which, in\nconjunction with air supply, is the line of com-\nmunication of General Stilwell’s Chinese-\nAmerican forces operating in Northern Burma,\nhas not been described because it does not\nform part of Fourteenth Army’s northern line\nof communication. It is, of course, entirely\nunder American control and, begun by British,\nis being built by American engineers.\n\nIt is now “all-weather two-way” to just\nnorth of Shaduzup and the intention is to com-\nplete it through to Myitkyina in another three\nmonths. Roadhead and railhead are to be at\nNamti, six miles north-east of Mogaung.\n\n203. Airfields. Airfield construction in the\narea under my control can be divided into\nthree categories: construction in the Four-\nteenth Army area ; construction in North-East\nAssam for the United States Army Air Force,\nwhich is primarily in connection with the air-\nlift to China ; and construction in Ceylon.\n\nThere were eighteen main airfields in the\nFourteenth Army area last November. Since\nthat date, three more large fields have been\nbegun and the others have been made up to an\nall-weather standard.\n\nFor future operations, as outlined by the\nChiefs of Staff at the end of March, it became\nnecessary to build airfields adequate to allow\nadditional transport to operate during the mon-\nsoon. In consultation with Air Command,\nSouth-East Asia, it was decided to increase\nthe capacity of fifteen of the existing twenty-\none airfields and to raise the standard to\nadmit of their use by Dakotas and certain types\nof bombers.\n\n204. On the Ist April 1944, the respon-\n\nsibility for the completion and upkeep of the\nAmerican airfields in North-East Assam was\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\ntransferred from General Headquarters, India,\nto 11 Army Group. There are eleven main\nairfields in this area, all of which have now\nbeen completed to all-weather standard, with\nthe exception of two which have been allotted\na low priority by the Commanding General,\nUnited States Air Forces, China-Burma-India\neatre.\n\n205. Airfields in Ceylon are built by the\nAir Ministry Works Department, but they\nremain the responsibility of the Chief Engineer,\nCeylon Army Command. There are nine main\nairfields on the island, work on the improve-\nment and extension of which continues.\n\n206. It would have been quite impossible to\nattain the target dates fixed for the completion\nof this large-scale expansion by using normal\nmaterials such as concrete. Use has, there-\nfore, been made of the new (and hitherto un-\ntried) bitumenized hessian (“ Bithess ”) process\nfor the provision of all-weather standings and\nrunways. This material prevents water pene-\ntrating the ground which accordingly retains\nits full bearing capacity in wet weather. The\nexperiment has already proved a success and\nmay be of great value in future operations\nin a Theatre where monsoon rainfall is so\nheavy.\n\nThe magnitude of the engineering effort in-\nvolved in airfield construction may be judged\nfrom the fact that, for the American airfields:\nin North-East Assam alone, some 16,000\nBritish military officers and men and 45,000\ncivil labour under British military supervision,\nare employed.\n\n207. River Crossings. (a) The problem in\nthis Theatre is complicated by the width of\nobstacles (the Chindwin and Myittha Rivers\nat Kalewa are some 330 yards and 200 yards\nacross respectively in the ‘dry season); the\nspeed of current; the great seasonal variation\nin water levels; and the presence of floating\ndebris. Wide rivers can, of course, only be\nbridged quickly by using floating equipment, as\nthe construction of piers is a major engineering\ntask, but the factors mentioned above.\nespecially fast currents, render the anchoring\nof floating bridges precarious.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, a bridge\n(known as the Falls bridge) has recently been\ndesigned and satisfactorily tested. It is com-\nposed of steel pontoons—widely spaced to\nadmit of the passage of debris—with a Bailey\nsuperstructure, and with a large gantry at each\nend to control the landing bay during the\nmarked variations which occur in water level.\n\nOther measures, which are under investiga-\ntion, include a proposal that only assault equip-\nment should be carried in divisions, bridging\ncompanies to be Army or Corps Troops. Ex-\nperiments are also being undertaken to pro-\nduce a standard type of vehicle capable of\ncarrying all bridging loads.\n\n(b) The alternative method of crossing rivers\nby ferry assumes a special significance in this\nTheatre owing, not only to the width of gaps,\nbut to the fact that the water level is liable to\nsuch sudden changes.\n\nFerrying is largely resorted to on, the lines\nof communication, especially on the\nBrahmaputra.\n",

The Intelligence Bureau,\nestablished for the collection of information\nconcerning civilians on conditions in enemy-\noccupied territory, was absorbed into the\nCAS.B., but the Burma Police Depot (in\nIndia) remains for the time being under the\nGovernment of Burma.\n\n215. Public Health. A controller of Medical\nServices was appointed to the C.AS.B. in\nFebruary, from the Government of Burma.\n\nThe frontier fringes are served by small\nhospitals and dispensaries.\n\n216. Welfare. The CAS.B. Welfare\nOrganization, under a Staff Officer, Civil\nAffairs, began work in January, when the\n\n“recruitment of field staff began.\n\nPlans for this organization to work in the\nHukawng Valley, and in 4 Corps’ area (Naga\nHills, Upper Chindwin and Chin Hills), were\nnot put into effect. The Commanding General\nof the Sino-American forces operating in the\nHukawng Valley decided that he did not re-\nquire its services, and the Japanese offensive\nnullified plans for 4 Corps’ area. These plans\nhave not been prepared in vain.\n",

I can never adequately\nexpress my gratitude for all he has done.\n\nI should also like to include in my thanks\nto him my gratitude to his staff for their un-\nselfish help during many months.\n\nI wish also to thank Air Chief Marshal Sir\nRichard Peirse, and the R.A.F. and the\nUS.A.AF. for their magnificent support dur-\ning the fighting in Arakan, Assam and in\nCentral and Northern Burma.\n\nAdmiral Sir James Somerville gave every\nassistance possible to the Army, though re-\nsources did not permit of a major combined\noperation.\n\nUpon Lieut.-General Slim, Commander,\nFourteenth Army, fell the brunt of operations\nand well and truly did he stand up to the\nstrain of the continuous and heavy fighting\nwhich began in February and ended in August.\nHe remained unshaken during the Japanese\noffensive and was quick to take advantage of\nopportunities to counter-attack. To him is due\nthe resounding victory achieved by Fourteenth\nArmy this year.\n\nLieut.-General Scoones greatly distinguished\nhimself in command of 4 Corps upon which\nthe principal strain of the fighting fell during\nthe operations round Imphal between February\nand June. Lieut.-General Christison in com-\nmand of 15 Indian Corps in Arakan first de-\nfeated the Japanese in Burma, He has shown\nfine qualities of leadership.\n\nLieut.-General Stopford, Commander, 33\n\nCorps, showed great staying power, professional\nknowledge and dash in the operations which\nresulted finally in opening the Kohima—Imphal\nroad.\n\nTo my own staff ; officers, N.C.Os. and men ;\nI owe the greatest debt of gratitude for their\nsplendid support and their fine team work.\nAlways shorthanded, split into two with one\ndetachment 1,500 miles from the other, they\nhave never failed to do the work which has\ncontinued steadily to increase.\n\nIt is difficult to single out from so many first-\nrate officers and men, many individuals for\nspecial praise, but I must mention particularly\nmy two principal Staff Officers upon whom fell\nspecial responsibility.\n\nMajor-General I.

I relied entirely\nupon his unfailing judgment, strength of\ncharacter and tact and he never failed me.\n\nMajor-General E. N.

In\nthe rains of the South-West monsoon they are\nswollen by flood water which makes them\ngreater obstacles. The banks are usually muddy\nand crumbling. Bridging presents considerable\ndifficulties and special arrangements have to be\nmade at each for the passage of tanks and\nmechanical transport.\n\n7. There are other difficulties also for our\nforces operating southwards in Arakan. The\ntwo main rivers, the Mayu and the Kaladan,\nwith their tributaries, converge on the main\nJapanese base at Akyab. By his command of\nthe entrance to these two waterways, the\nenemy was able to make use of excellent water\ncommunications which were denied to us.\n\nClimatic Conditions.\n\n8. The climate of Burma is affected by the\ntwo monsoons, the North-East in the winter\nand the South-West in the summer. The in-\nfluence of the former produces fine dry weather\nwith little cloud and conditions are good for\noperations both on Jand and in the air. The\nSouth-West monsoon on the other hand, blow-\ning as it does across the Bay of Bengal, is\nheavily charged with moisture which it dis-\ncharges over Burma and Eastern Bengal during\nthe months of May to October. Precipitation\nof rain, especially on the Arakan coast, is\nextremely thigh, reaching in places as much as\n200 inches. The climate varies too, according\nto the altitude, the temperatures above 3,000\nfeet being reasonably low and above 5,000 feet\ncool and invigorating. In the lowlands along\nthe coast, the temperatures are high, with a\nhigh humidity which makes campaigning in\nthose areas exhausting.\n\n9. Malaria is endemic throughout the\ncountry below 3,000 feet but it is worse in some\nareas than others; for instance, the Kabaw\nValley is reputed to be one of the worst\nmalarial valleys in the world. There are two\nseasonal increases in the rate of infection, one\nat the beginning of the monsoon in May, and\nthe other at the end of the monsoon in October\nand November. Much has been done to re-\nduce the casualtiés from malaria during the\npast two years and the ineffective rate amongst\nall troops has fallen very considerably. This\nis due to much improved personal discipline,\nefficient draining of bad areas on the lines of\ncommunication, training and various medical\nprophylactic measures which have been intro-\nduced. -In such a climate there are other\n\nA2\n\n1351\n\ndiseases which are products of the conditions ;\ndysentry, the worst effects of which have been\nreduced by discipline and good hygiene\nmeasures, skin diseases of various types,\nespecially during the rainy season, and scrub\ntyphus which is endemic in various areas.\n\n10. While the South-West monsoon has a\nbad effect upon the health of troops and\ncauses them also acute discomfort from wet, its\nreally worst effect is upon the communications\nin the country. The heavy rain turns Arakan,\na rice growing area, into a muddy swamp quite\nimpassable to wheeled vehicles unless the roads\nhave proper foundations and surfaces capable\nof withstanding heavy rain. In Assam and\nBurma there is very little stone, most of the\nhills, which are clothed in forest or bamboo,\nbeing composed of a soft shale quite useless\nfor road making. The making of roads is,\ntherefore, very difficult ay they have to be\nbuilt to a high standard in order to stand up\nto the torrential rains which fall between May\nand October. The heavy rains also make the\nordinary native tracks very nearly impassable\nas they get so slippery on the steep hillsides\nthat neither man nor beast can stand up on\nthem. Finally, as can be imagined, these heavy\nrains make the rivers and streams into very\nformidable obstacles, all of which have to be\nbridged to allow the passage of troops and\ntransport.\n\nIndeed, campaigning in the monsoon in\nBurma may be said to be one of the most\narduous operations anywhere in the world\n\nlay.\n\nThe Japanese Soldier.\n\n11. The Japanese soldier is fanatically brave\nwhen ordered to succeed or die, yet he is liable\nto panic when surprised or in doubt. His plan-\nning is bold yet he is at a loss if plans go\nwrong. Although most secretive and careful,\nhe will go into action carrying diaries and mili-\ntary papers. He takes infinite pains to conceal\nhis positions and then nullifies the result by\ntalking in them at night. An expert in the\nuse of ground and in silent movement, yet\nhis patrol work is frequently bad. Although\nbold at infiltrating into, and then rushing 2\nposition from an unexpected direction, he be-\ncomes easily nonplussed by determined resist-\nance. He is good at laying fixed lines of fire\nand skilful in the use of snipers, yet he is a\nbad shot.\n\n12. Our successes in the fighting have, in\nno small measure, been due to the fact that we\nhave taken full advantage of the enemy’s weak\npoints. The results have been gratifying, not\nonly tactically, but also psychologically: signs\nare not lacking that the blind obedience, fana-\ntical courage and determination to die rather\nthan surrender, which the Japanese soldier has\nhitherto displayed, may not withstand the con-\ntinuous reverses which he is now suffering\nand will suffer in the future. That this fact\nhas been recognised by the Japanese High\nCommand, and is causing some misgiving, has\nbeen seen in captured orders.\n\nThis must not be taken to mean, however,\nthat the Japanese soldier now surrenders easily.\nHis whole up-bringing and outlook make him\nregard capture as the worst disgrace.

In Japanese hands it is a base for\noperations against the eastern frontier of\n\ndia,\n\n15. As a result of decisions reached at the\nQuebec Conference, the Chiefs of Staff directed\nthe Supreme Allied Commander to undertake\noperations in Burma with two objects :—\n\n@) The security and improvement of the\nair ferry route to China and the establish-\nment of land communications with China.\n\n(6) The close and continuous engagement\nof Japanese land and air forces, so as to\ncause attrition and diversion from the Pacific\nTheatre.\n\nTo execute these orders meant, of course,\noffensive operations whenever and wherever\npossible; but it was obvious that the main\noperations to secure Northern Burma, without\nwhich complete security of the China air route\ncould not be ensured, would have to be\nlaunched from Imphal, Yunnan and Ledo.\n\n16. As our resources were limited, it was\nessential to decide on the southern limits of\nsuch an offensive. Examination showed that\nonly the capture of the Shwebo—Mandalay\narea would fulfil the instructions of the Chiefs\nof Staff but this was beyond our resources,\neither in troops or transport aircraft, Plans of\na less ambitious nature which would obey the\nspirit of the instructions to the Supreme Allied\n‘Commander had, therefore, to be considered.\n\n17. The plan generally approved at Quebec\n‘was: —\n\n_(@) The capture by Long-Range Penetra-\ntion Forces of the Katha—Indaw area which\nwould be then held by a division, flown in\nor moved overland across the Chindwin with\nlight equipment.\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\n(b) The capture of Mogaung—Myitkyina\nby Chinese-American forces from Ledo with\npossible exploitation southwards.\n\n(©) An advance on Bhamo—Lashio by\nChinese forces from Yunnan.\n\nThe plan which I had thought gave the best\nchance of success was made in September 1943,\nwhen the Commander-in-Chief, India, was still\nin command of the operations and I was\nG.O.C.-in-C., Eastern Army. This plan aimed\nat forcing a crossing of the Chindwin on the\nImphal Front, and the introduction with the _\naid of airborne troops of a force of all arms,\nincluding tanks and medium artillery, into the\nCentral Burma plain in the Ye-U area. A de-\ntailed examination of the many problems which\nsuch a plan created, among them the capacity\nof the Assam lines of communication, and the\ndelays in the concentration programme caused\nby the breaching of the main railway line to\nCalcutta from the west by the Damodar River,\nshowed that the launching of such an offensive\nbefore early March was not possible.\n\nThis plan was submitted to the British Chiefs\nof Staff, who preferred an airborne operation\nagainst Katha—Indaw because there would be\ncloser support and co-operation with Chinese\nforces advancing south from Ledo and across\nthe Salween. This plan, approved at the Cairo\nconference in November 1943, had eventually\nto be abandoned as the necessary transport air-\ncraft were not forthcoming. It became\nnecessary, therefore, to make a less ambitious\nplan.\n\n18. It was not easy, within the means at our\ndisposal, even partially to achieve the objects\ngiven by the Chiefs of Staff. After several\nalternatives had been examined and rejected,\nI submitted to the Supreme Allied Commander,\nin December, the following plan.\n\n(@ An advance down the Kabaw Valley\ntowards Kalewa—Kalemyo; the construc-\ntion of an all-weather road, via Tamu, as far\nas Possible towards Yuwa and Kalewa on the\n\nwin.\n\n(b) The use (initially) of three Long-Range\nPenetration Brigades in the Katha—Indaw\narea.\n\nThe objects I had in mind were: —\n\n@ To achieve a greater, though not com-\nplete measure of security for the China air\nroute, by forcing the enemy further south.\n\nGi) To obtain greater freedom of action\nfor offensive operations in 1944-45, when\nmore resources might be expected.\n\nGii) To destroy the maximum possible\nnumber of Japanese land and air forces.\n\n(iv) To gain some control of Upper Burma\nby the employment, in conjunction with our\nmain forces and those of the Chinese Army\nin India (C.A.L), of Long-Range Penetra-\ntion Troops to confuse the enemy and inflict\ncasualties.\n\n19. This plan was approved by the Supreme\nAllied Commander and was referred by him to\nthe Chiefs of Staff early in December. It\ndepended for success not only on overcoming\nstrong enemy defences in the Tiddim area, but\nalso on progress in road construction. At the\nend of January, the Chiefs of Staff were told\nthat we did not anticipate reaching the Kalewa\n—Kalemyo area before the monsoon. Actually\nthe all-weather road of a two-way standard\n",

The plan generally approved at Quebec\n‘was: —\n\n_(@) The capture by Long-Range Penetra-\ntion Forces of the Katha—Indaw area which\nwould be then held by a division, flown in\nor moved overland across the Chindwin with\nlight equipment.\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\n(b) The capture of Mogaung—Myitkyina\nby Chinese-American forces from Ledo with\npossible exploitation southwards.\n\n(©) An advance on Bhamo—Lashio by\nChinese forces from Yunnan.\n\nThe plan which I had thought gave the best\nchance of success was made in September 1943,\nwhen the Commander-in-Chief, India, was still\nin command of the operations and I was\nG.O.C.-in-C., Eastern Army. This plan aimed\nat forcing a crossing of the Chindwin on the\nImphal Front, and the introduction with the _\naid of airborne troops of a force of all arms,\nincluding tanks and medium artillery, into the\nCentral Burma plain in the Ye-U area. A de-\ntailed examination of the many problems which\nsuch a plan created, among them the capacity\nof the Assam lines of communication, and the\ndelays in the concentration programme caused\nby the breaching of the main railway line to\nCalcutta from the west by the Damodar River,\nshowed that the launching of such an offensive\nbefore early March was not possible.\n\nThis plan was submitted to the British Chiefs\nof Staff, who preferred an airborne operation\nagainst Katha—Indaw because there would be\ncloser support and co-operation with Chinese\nforces advancing south from Ledo and across\nthe Salween. This plan, approved at the Cairo\nconference in November 1943, had eventually\nto be abandoned as the necessary transport air-\ncraft were not forthcoming. It became\nnecessary, therefore, to make a less ambitious\nplan.\n\n18. It was not easy, within the means at our\ndisposal, even partially to achieve the objects\ngiven by the Chiefs of Staff. After several\nalternatives had been examined and rejected,\nI submitted to the Supreme Allied Commander,\nin December, the following plan.\n\n(@ An advance down the Kabaw Valley\ntowards Kalewa—Kalemyo; the construc-\ntion of an all-weather road, via Tamu, as far\nas Possible towards Yuwa and Kalewa on the\n\nwin.\n\n(b) The use (initially) of three Long-Range\nPenetration Brigades in the Katha—Indaw\narea.\n\nThe objects I had in mind were: —\n\n@ To achieve a greater, though not com-\nplete measure of security for the China air\nroute, by forcing the enemy further south.\n\nGi) To obtain greater freedom of action\nfor offensive operations in 1944-45, when\nmore resources might be expected.\n\nGii) To destroy the maximum possible\nnumber of Japanese land and air forces.\n\n(iv) To gain some control of Upper Burma\nby the employment, in conjunction with our\nmain forces and those of the Chinese Army\nin India (C.A.L), of Long-Range Penetra-\ntion Troops to confuse the enemy and inflict\ncasualties.\n\n19. This plan was approved by the Supreme\nAllied Commander and was referred by him to\nthe Chiefs of Staff early in December. It\ndepended for success not only on overcoming\nstrong enemy defences in the Tiddim area, but\nalso on progress in road construction. At the\nend of January, the Chiefs of Staff were told\nthat we did not anticipate reaching the Kalewa\n—Kalemyo area before the monsoon. Actually\nthe all-weather road of a two-way standard\n",

Concurrently with planning for opera-\ntions on the Imphal Front, planning for opera-\ntions in Arakan was, of course, in progress.\nSeveral plans, which included amphibious\noperations against Akyab in conjunction with\nan advance down the Mayu Peninsula, were\nexamined, but all were eventually abandoned\neither for lack of resources or for other reasons,\nand I was thrown back on a plan for an ad-\nvance with the limited objective of the Maung-\ndaw—Buthidaung road, and the mouth of the\nNaf River. Once the latter was captured,\nsupplies could be brought in by sea, not only\nto Maungdaw but also to Teknaf.\n\n21. Other plans for amphibious operations,\namong them one for the capture of the\nAndamans, were also examined, but all were\nin the end rejected as the resources for them\nwere needed for more important operations\nin other theatres of war. .\n\nI was finally compelled, therefore, to limit\nthe operations of the Army to a short advance\nin Arakan and advances down the Tiddim road\nand Kabaw Valley with the object of captur-\ning the Kalewa—Kalemyo area.\n\nPart II—OPERATIONS.\nOperations by 15 Indian Corps in Arakan.\n\n22. In November, 1943, we were in contact\nwith the Japanese in Arakan, the Imphal Front\nand in North Burma (N.C.A.C.).\n\nThe situation in Arakan at the end of the\nmonsoon of 1943, was that we held positions\ncovering Cox’s Bazaar with 26 Indian Division\non the general line Teknaf—Taung Bazaar,\nwhile the enemy held the Maungdaw—\nButhidaung road. The advance to close con-\ntact started in the middle of October.\n\n23. Between Ocfober and the end of\nDecember other changes were made in our dis-\npositions :—\n\n(a) 26 Indian Division was relieved by 7\nand 5 Indian Divisions.\n\n(6) 7 Indian Division moved across the\nMayu Range, complete with all its guns and\nlorries. A fair-weather road was built over\nthe Ngakyedauk Pass, which lies north-west\nof the village of that name, to provide the\nNecessary communications.\n\n(© 5 Indian Division took over the\nwestern sector of the front.\n\n(@ Our rear areas were re-adjusted.\n\n(©) Finally we drove in the enemy’s out-\npost line.\n\nAt the end of December, 5 Indian Division\nheld from the sea to the crest of the Mayu\nRange, while 7 Indian Division had moved\nover complete into the Kalapanzin Valley. The\nstage was set for an attack on the main enemy\nposition. ;\n\n24, Early in January, I issued an Opera-\ntional Instruction to the Commander,\nFourteenth Army, Lieut.-General W. J. Slim,\ndirecting him to secure the mouth of the Naf\nRiver; Maungdaw—Buthidaung ; and exploit\nsuccess to the maximum. These instructions\nwere based on an Operational Directive issued\n\n1353\n\nby the Supreme Allied Commander. My\nobjects were, first, to improve our general\nsituation in Arakan, and, second, to contain\nand destroy Japanese forces.\n\n25. A period during which certain sub-\nsidiary operations were undertaken to secure\nthe necessary jumping-off places for our offen-\nsive then followed. The enemy defended these\npositions stubboraly.\n\nOn the 15th January, the dispositions of\nthe forward elements of 15 Indian Corps\n(Lieut.-General A. F. P. Christison), were as\nfollows :— .\n\n5 Indian Division: Maungdaw—Magyi\nChaung—Rehkat Chaung—Point 1619, with\na brigade in reserve west of the Mayu\nRange.\n\n7 Indian Division: One brigade in the\nhills north and north-east of Htindaw. One\nbrigade Tatmakhali to Sinohbyin, with for-\nward troops on the Letwedet Chaung. One\nbrigade Kyaukit massif—Pyinshe—Windwin,\nwith a detachment on the Saingdin Chaung.\n\n81 (West African) Division: Daletme—\nSatpaung area, in the Kaladan Valley.\n\nTanks: One regiment, in support of 5\nIndian Division.\n\nMedium Artillery: One battery in sup-\nport of each division.\n\n26. The enemy had turned the area about\nthe Tunnels, through which the road runs in\nits passage through the highest portion of the\nMayu Range between Maungdaw and\nButhidaung, into a fortress with two strong\nbuttresses—Razabil on the west and Letwedet\non the east.\n\nThe general plan of attack was framed to\ncapture these two buttresses in turn and sur-\nround the garrison of the Tunnels fortress.\n5 Indian Division was to take Razabil and\n7 Indian Division Buthidaung, thus cutting in\nbehind the Letwedet buttress. 81 (West\nAfrican) Division was to advance down the\nKaladan River to capture Kyauktaw, with\nthe ultimate object of cutting the Kanzauk—-\nHtizwe road, which was the enemy’s main\nlateral line of communication between the\nKaladan and Kalapanzin Valleys.\n\n27. The main offensive was launched on the\n19th January, and, despite strong opposition,\nour preliminary operations against the enemy’s\noutposts were very successful. The original\nplan had included a sea landing by 2 British\nDivision further south down the Mayu Penin-\nsula. As we did not wish to drive the Japanese\ninto the toe of the Peninsula until 2 British\nDivision had effected a firm lodgement, our\nattack on the main enemy positions was de-\nferred to synchronize with the sea landing, the\ndate of which could not be put forward as it\nwas governed by the state of the tide and\nmoon. Unfortunately, the craft required for\nthe amphibious operation were taken away\nand, therefore, this “right hook” had to be\ncancelled. Thus our Jang offensive had been\nheld up to no jose. By the ebruary,\nhowever, the attack on Razabil had achieved\na measure of success, but the main position\nstili held out. Progress elsewhere had been\nsteady, but slow.\n\n28. It was at this moment that the enemy\nlaunched his counter-attack and our offensive\n",

By the ebruary,\nhowever, the attack on Razabil had achieved\na measure of success, but the main position\nstili held out. Progress elsewhere had been\nsteady, but slow.\n\n28. It was at this moment that the enemy\nlaunched his counter-attack and our offensive\n",

Almost simultaneously, strong fron-\ntal attacks were made by two regiments in the\narea north and north-west of Buthidaung. A\nbrigade of 7 Indian Division, which had been\nrelieved by 5 Indian Division, but had not yet\nbeen committed to their new task, was sent\nnorth to check the enemy advance south-\nwards from Taung Bazaar. In this it partially\nsucceeded, but, owing to the closeness of the\ncountry and the enemy’s numerical superiority,\nwas outflanked by a party of the enemy which\noverran the Headquarters of 7 Indian Division\nin the early morning. The Divisional Com- |\nmander, however, regained control of the\noperations that evening. Brigades and divi-\nsional troops had been ordered to prepare\npositions capable of all round defence as soon\nas the enemy’s presence in Taung Bazaar had\nbeen discovered. 9, 33 and 114 Brigades,\ntherefore, dug in on their positions, while\nanother defended area which contained Divi-\nsional H.Q., part of 89 Brigade and Divisional\nTroops was hastily .prepared in the area of\nAwlanbyin and Sinzweya. These areas were\ncalled “ boxes ” during the battle.\n\n34. The enemy cut the Ngakyedauk Pass\nand closely invested these boxes. One\nJapanese battalion also crossed by the\nMaunghnama Pass further north and began\nto harass 15 Indian Corps Headquarters and\nthe rear of 5 Indian, Division from a position\nin the hills on the east of the road. But they\nmade no further headway, although on the 9th\nFebruary the situation in 7 Indian Division’s\ndefended area (Sinzweya) was difficult and con-\ntinued so for several days. 26 Indian Division,\nwhich had been moved up to Bawli Bazaar\nby 15 Indian Corps, now began to make its\npresence felt, but it was evident that its opera-\ntions, in conjunction with those of 5 Indian\nDivision from the west to clear the Ngakye-\ndauk Pass, would take time.\n\n35. Supply dropping to the various boxes\nbegan on the 9th February, and an airstrip for\nthe evacuation of casualties was ready by the\n12th at Taung Bazaar, which had by then\nbeen cleared of the enemy.\n\n36. In spite of continuous attacks, supported\nby the fire of 150-mm guns and by fighter\nbombers, the enemy were unable to reduce any\nof our strongholds. On the 12th the Com-\nmander, 7 Indian Division issued orders to take\nthe offensive to prevent any further hostile\ninfiltration and the escape of any enemy\nalready in his rear. The enemy was now “in\nthe bag” and it was the task of 7 Indian\nDivision to keep him there until destroyed.\n\n37. Severe fighting continued with the\nJapanese trying to stem the advance of 26 and\n5 Indian Divisions and overcome what their\norders described as “the hysterical defence ”\nof the areas of 7 Indian Division. Hysterical\nor not, it may one day be called historical as\nit was the first successful réply to Japanese\nlarge-scale infiltration tactics in jungle country.\nThe bitterness of the fighting is illustrated by\nthe remark made by a veteran of Dunkirk.\nwho spent two days on the beaches ; he stated\nhe would willingly have spent a fortnight at\nDunkirk if he could have been let off with\ntwo days in 7 Indian Divisional defended area.\n",

On the 16th February, 36 British Divi-\nsion began to relieve 26 Indian Division to\nenable it to concentrate east of the Mayu\n\nange.\n\n39. By the 20th February, the shortage of\nfood and ammunition, severe casualties and\nlack of any tactical success began to have their\neffect upon the Japanese forces, and they\nbegan to try to escape, at first in driblets\nand then in larger parties. Many of them\nfailed to run the gauntlet and were wiped out.\nBy the 24th February the Ngakyedauk Pass\nhad been re-opened and the Japanese offen-\nsive, heralded as the beginning of the march\non Delhi, had been defeated.\n\n40.

Their\nattacks have usually taken the form of an\nenveloping movement combined with infiltra-\ntion and frontal attacks.\n\nThese tactics achieved success in 1943, partly\nowing to the lack of training of our forces and\npartly owing to the fact that it was not pos-\nsible, for lack of supplies, for forward troops\nto hold out when their lines of communica-\ntion were cut.\n\n41. The Japanese plan was bold, typical of\ntheir readiness to take risks, and its execution\nwent smoothly for the first thirty-six hours.\nIt then began to fail, at first slowly but with\nincreasing momentum until disaster overtook\nit. The main reasons for this failure were: —\n\n(@ The Japanese conviction that we\nshould retire if our rear was threatened, as\nwe had done in 1943. His whole plan was\nbased on this assumption. A captured direc-\ntive, by the Commander of 55 Divisional\nInfantry Group, ended with this significant\nphrase: —“ As they have previously suffered\ndefeat, should a portion of the enemy waver\nthe whole of them will at once get confused\nand victory is thus certain”.\n\n(6) The fine fighting spirit of all ranks\nwho, in this the first large encounter with\nthe Japanese this year, showed their\nsuperiority in jungle-fighting when well\ntrained and adequately equipped.\n\nb (c) The ability to supply forward troops\n\nyy air.\n\nContributory factors to its failure were our\nsuccessful use of tanks over ground much of\nwhich was regarded as “ untankable”, the use\nof medium artillery, and our continual harass-\ning from the air of the enemy’s water-borne\nand road communications. The Japanese\nunder-estimation of their enemy and their con-\nviction that they would capture large quantities\nof supplies in the first few days, led them to\nneglect their arrangements for the supply of\nfood and ammunition and their troops carried\nonly five days’ food. We defeated all their\nattempts to bring food or ammunition forward.\nIn consequence, their troops soon began to\nsuffer from hunger and starvation and short-\nage of ammunition. Their casualties amounted\nto 4,500 killed and wounded out of a total of\n7,000 men.\n\n1355\n\nThe basic reason for our victory was, how-\never, the refusal of our troops, or any portion\nof them, to waver, and their unflinching\ncourage in exceptionally trying circumstances.\n\n42. Mopping up in the thick mountainous\njungle was a difficult and necessarily slow\noperation, and it was not until the 5th March\nthat we were able to resume the interrupted\ncourse of our offensive. Razabil was captured\nby 5 Indian Division on the 12th March. It\nwas found to be a position of great strength,\ncomplete with underground rooms, etc. The\nTunnels position was surrounded by the 19th\nMarch, and was finally captured by 36 British\nDivision some days later. Meanwhile, 7\nIndian Division had taken Buthidaung and\nhad also captured the outer ring of the Kyaukit\ndefences. These defences were evacuated by\nthe enemy on the 23rd March and considerable\nequipment fell into our hands. On the 25th,\nabout 500 enemy again infiltrated to the\nNegakyedauk area, but were dealt with expedi-\ntiously.\n\n43. At the end of March, 25 Indian Division\nbegan to take over from 5 Indian Division and\nthe latter was transferred by ‘air to 4 Corps’\nfront.\n\n44. Fighting to improve our positions con-\ntinued throughout April against strong opposi-\ntion. As a result of successful actions by 26\nIndian Division in the Buthidaung area in the\nfirst week in May, we withdrew from Buthi-\ndaung, as planned, to positions more suitable\nfor the monsoon; forward brigades of 15\nIndian Corps taking up positions on the\ngeneral line Godusara—Tunnels Area—Taung\nBazaar.\n\n45. 36 British Division was withdrawn to\nShillong in Assam to rest and refit, with a view\nto its being transferred to General Stilwell’s\ncommand in North Burma at a later date. 7\nIndian Division, two brigades moving by air,\nalso left Arakan in April for 4 Corps’ front.\n\nBy the end of May, therefore, we were\nholding Arakan with 15 Indian Corps, com-\nprising three divisions. Our monsoon disposi-\ntions being: —\n\n25 Indian Division: In the Tunnels Area,\ncovering the Maungdaw—Buthidaung road,\nup to and including, the East Tunnel.\n\n26 Indian Division: One brigade in the\n\nwli—Goppe—Taung Bazaars area.\n\nParade at Faungbro End the third at Cox’s\n\nBazaar.\n\n81 (West African) Division: Concentrating\nat Chiringa.\n\nWe also had detachments on the Sangu ~\nRiver as flank protection against a small\nJapanese force which had infiltrated into that\narea.\n\n46. The term “ monsoon dispositions ” does\nnot imply static defence. We occupied positions\nof our own choice, selected for their strength\nand to preserve the health of our troops by\navoiding the worst malarial areas. The\nnecessity, during the monsoon in Arakan, to\nevacuate certain flooded districts and take up\npositions which -are defensively strong and\naccessible for supplies, did not mean that every\nopportunity for local offensive action was not\ntaken.\n",

On the 17th January, we attacked enemy\npositions at Kyaukchaw, eighteeen miles south-\neast of Tamu in the Atwin Yomas, and there\nwere other small operations in the same area\nduring the month.\n\n59. Throughout January and February, 17\nIndian Light Division was continually engaged\nwith the enemy in the Tiddim area; attack\nand counter-attack following each other in\nquick succession.\n\nThe Japanese Offensive against Imphal and\nKohima.\n\n60. During February, it became steadily more\nevident that the Japanese were preparing for\nan offensive across the Chindwin and from the\narea about Fort White against 17 Indian Light\nDivision. The general situation remained un-\nchanged until the 8th March, when the antici-\npated Japanese offensive was launched. This\nbegan with two main advances, one up the\nwest bank of the Manipur River, the other\nnorthwards up the Kabaw Valley, from which\nJapanese columns moved westwards to cut the\nImphal—Tiddim road. It was also apparent,\nfrom the enemy’s dispositions, that he would\nprobably launch an offensive farther north\nfrom the Thaungdut—Homalin area against\nTamu, Ukhrul and Kohima.\n\n61. Our dispositions at the beginning of\n. March were :—\n\n50 Indian Parachute Brigade: Kohima.\nThis Brigade (less one battalion) had been\nflown in from India as a reinforcement to\n4 Corps early in March.\n\n23 Indian Division: One brigade in the\nUkhrul area ; the remainder south and south-\neast of Imphal.\n\n20 Indian Division: On the Tamu road\nand in the Kabaw Valley.\n\n17 Indian Light Division (two brigades\nonly): Tiddim area.\n\n62, On the 7th March, I had sent an instruc-\ntion to the Commander, Fourteenth Army, of\nwhich the following were the main points :—\n\n(@) A warning that the impending\nJapanese offensive against 4 Corps’ area\nwould probably be on a considerably Jarger\nscale than anything the enemy had yet\nattempted in Burma.\n\n(b) An indication of the tactical difficulties\nof the situation, due to the fundamental\nweakness of our line of communication\nbeing parallel to the enemy’s front along\nthe Chindwin River. .\n\n(c) The strategical importance of the\nImphal Plain: (i) as a base for the main-\ntenance and operation of our air and land\n\n1357\n\nforces, and (ii) its value to the Japanese as\na base for attacks against the Surma Valley\nin Eastern Bengal and our Assam lines of\ncommunication. Attacks against Bengal\nwould have an adverse and widespread moral\neffect ; while interruption of the Assam lines\nof communication would seriously jeopard-\nise both the Sino-American operations based\non Ledo and the air ferry route to China.\nI pointed out that the enemy’s effort with-\nout control of the Imphal Plain, would prob-\nably have to be confined to raids, owing\nto the indifferent communications and the\npaucity of food supplies in the hill tracts,\n\n(d) The security of the Imphal Plain was\nhis primary task.\n\n(2) A confirmation of the authority I had\nrecently given General Slim verbally that\nhe might, if necessary, give ground in the\nChin Hills and the Kabaw Valley. In this\nevent, I stated he would be justified in using\nLong-Range Penetration forces to operate\nboldly against the enemy’s flanks and com:\nmunications.\n\n(f) I stated that, apart from 25 Indian\nDivision, Long-Range Penetration Brigades,\nand 50 Indian Parachute Brigade, immediate\nreinforcements for 4 Corps must come from\nFourteenth Army sources, and that, there-\nfore, preparations should be made for the\nquickest possible moves of troops to rein-\nforce 4 Corps, although this might (i) limit\nthe depth of our advance in » (Gi\ncause troops to be retained in Arakan longer\nthan desirable and (iii) interfere with in-\ntended reliefs. 77 and 111 Long-Range\nPenetration Brigades were already in the\nFourteenth Army area; 16 Long-Range\nPenetration Brigade was marching into North\nBurma, 14 and 23 Long-Range Penetrationg’\nBrigades, and 3 (West African) Long-Range\nPenetration Brigade, were about to move\ninto Fourteenth Army’s area from India.\nI promised to investigate whether the pro-\njected moves of 14 and 23 Long-Range\nPenetration Brigades could be accelerated.\n\n63. The relative dispositions of our own\ntroops and those of the enemy and the topo:\ngraphy of the country all combined to facilitate\ninfiltration, which is the basis of Japanese\ntactics in fighting in close country. General\nSlim, therefore, decided very rightly, that to\nleave 17 Indian Light Division at Tiddim, and\n20 Indian Division east and south of Tamu\nwould not only give the Japanese excellent\nopportunities of cutting off these two Divisions,\nbut would imperil the defence of the Imphal\nPlain which was his primary task.\n\nHe also appreciated that, if he could engage\nthe Japanese forces in the neighbourhood of\nthe Imphal Plain, he would impose upon them\nall the difficulties and disadvantages of a long\nline of communication over difficult country\nand preserve to himself the advantages of a\nshort line of communication.\n\n64. The G.O.C.-in-C. 4 Corps gave instruc-\ntions to Commander, 17 Indian Light Division,\nthat he was to withdraw if his line of com-\nmunication was seriously threatened. The\nCommander, 17 Indian Light Division, not find-\ning himself unduly pressed frontally, and not\nrealising the extent to which the enemy were\ninfiltrating behind him, postponed his retire-\nment somewhat too long. 17 Indian Light\n",
