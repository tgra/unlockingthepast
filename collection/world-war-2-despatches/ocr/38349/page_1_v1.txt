Immediately after the Walrus took off the enemy made a complete circle to starboard and thereafter made a great many alterations of course and speed Her general tendency was to the south east and she was careful to prevent me getting a clear view of her stern. The signal   NNJ   was made by light but no reply was received  She hoisted   L  flag in international code meaning   Stop I have something to communicate  and later  MT  meaning   My engines are stopped.  Apart from this she refused to answer any signals.
