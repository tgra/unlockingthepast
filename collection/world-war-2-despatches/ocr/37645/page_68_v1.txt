were printed in Addis Abeba. There is no doulst that these leaflets undermined the morale of the Italians, and resulted in wholesale disintegration of the enemy troops.

107. From the fall of Addis Abeba to the final surrender of Gazzera the total prisoners accounted for by E.A. Force amounted to approximately 30,000 Italians and 30,000 Africans. Owing to the number of enemy who were killed and the number who deserted, this figure however, does not give a complete picture of the destruction wrought. It is estimated that during that period 105,000 enemy of all types were rendered ineffective.*

No estimate can yet be given of the war material in our hands, but except in a few commodities, the Italians were well found, and there is every reason to believe that the captures of war stores are very considerable.

A remarkable feature was the great quantity of valuable and up-to-date machinery, much of it new, of all types with which the country was stocked.

108. I must once more emphasise the success with which the Staff and adminstrative services continued to overcome the many great difficulties of supply and transport, and the manner in which the transport companies maintained their reputation in face of the wretched conditions of rain and mud.

Particular mention must also be made of the staff and persorinel of both naval and military at Berbera. Owing to lack of facilities, torrid temperatures, and a high rate of sickness, supply through this port was always precarious. The kharif, a hot wind which commenced blowing in June, increased their  difficulties. In spite of these grave conditions the personnel continued to perform their duties with cheerfulness and determination and are still doing so.

Iog. I can again with great pleasure draw attention to the skill shown by the two Divisional Commanders, Major General Godwin Austen and Major General Wetherall. The

atest credit is due to Major General Godwin Kasten for the dogged persistence with which rath (A) Division undertook and completed their attack northwards under the worst possible conditions of weather and roads against defensive positions which the enemy had deemed impregnable. To Major General Wetherall and rth (A) Division fell the lot of undertaking the attacks on Dessie, Sciasciamanna, Soddu and the crossings of the Omo, all of which formidable operations were attended with success and brought about the

final collapse. (sd.) A. G. CUNNINGHAM, Lieut.-Gen. 2and July, 1941.
