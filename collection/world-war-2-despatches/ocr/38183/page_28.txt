subject of bombardment, both from the air and
by artillery, the main target being the naval
dockyard.

123. During the night the r2th-13th Decem-
ber, troops were withdrawn from Devil’s Peak,
our Jast post on the mainland. Coast defence
guns were now used landwards for counter-
battery work against the Japanese. It was noted
that the evacuation of Kowloon had consider-
ably disturbed the morale of the Hong Kong
civil population, and defeatist elements came to
the fore. It became necessary to organise rice
distribution. The Japanese Commander-in-
Chief demanded the surrender of Hong Kong,
which was refused. .

During the 14th December the Japanese shell-
ing of the island increased in severity, and
several of our gunposts were hit, as a result of
which some Chinese gunners deserted. The
enemy was now enjoying the use of Devil’s
Peak as an observation post. On the same day
Aberdeen was bombed from high-level, and the
generating station was hit, though not put out of
action. Considerable trouble was still being ex-
perienced with the civil population, the police
were unable to prevent robbery by armed gangs
in the A.R.P. tunnels, and rice distribution was
a difficulty. Propaganda was accordingly cir-
culated about the Beg of a Chinese ad-
vance to relieve Hong Kong; the Chungking
Government’s representative was most helpful
in maintaining order.

During the night of the 14th-15th December,
the Japanese continued their systematic shell-
ing, and gathered together a collection of small
craft in Kowloon Bay. The Thracian entered
the Bay and sank two river steamers, while
a special agent succeeded in blowing up a third
ship. The Thracian, however, in view of
damage, had to be beached and dismantled. the
following day.

On the 16th December, Aberdeen was heavily
bombed, eight times in all, with resulting loss of
one Motor Torpedo Boat and damage to the
dock. Most of our Auxiliary Patrolling Vessels
were now useless in view of desertion by Chinese
crews, The enemy Janded parties on
Island, and started concentrations of troops on
the mainland at Customs Pass and Waterloo
Road, but these were dispersed by our artillery.
During the night of the r6th-r7th mortar fire
damaged some of our machine guns along the
water-front.

On the 17th December, Hong Kong Island
was twice raided by fourteen Army light
bombers, coinciding with heavy bombardment
by artillery. After this raid the Japanese again
came across with proposals of surrender, which
were rejected.

124. The night of the 17th-z8th was very
quiet, but on the 18th decisive events took place.
The North face of the Island was subjected to
continuous artillery, mortar and dive-bombing
attack, some of our infantry defence posts being
struck three or four times. Hospitals were badly
hit and much damage was done to water mains,
toads, cables and signal communications, also
rice stores. Stanley and Murray Barracks were
bombed in two raids by nine and six bombers,
roughly 100 bombs being dropped-—the largest
number to that date. Much of the transport of
the 2nd Battalion Royal Scots was destroyed,
and C Battery Plotting Room O was demolished
by a direct hit. The civil Government centre

was also dive-bombed. It was following this in-
tense activity that, after dusk, the Japanese
effected landings at Quarry Bay and at Lyemun
in the north-eastern corner of the island.

The following day the Japanese infiltrated
over the hill to the Wong Nei Cheong and
Tytam Gaps with pack artillery and mortars.
Our artillery from the Collinson and D’A,
areas (east and south-east of the Island) were
successfully withdrawn to Stanley (south of the
Island), but were compelled to destroy their
heavy guns and equipment. Our line ran now
from Stanley Mound northwards, Stanley Mound
itself being held by one battalion of Canadians,
two companies of Indian infantry and some mis-
cellaneous artillery and machine guns.

During the afternoon of the 19th a counter-
attack was attempted, with the help of motor
torpedo boats, to regain possession of Mount
Parker and Mount Butler, but broke down
through heavy enemy shelling, failure of inter-
communications and the exhaustion of our
troops. Our motor torpedo boats were success~
ful in destroying landing craft in Kowloon Bay,
but two were lost in the operations.

125. On the 2oth our line was still roughly
North from Stanley Mound. A communiqué
was again issued to inspire civilian morale with
belief in near relief by Chinese forces. By the
2ist the enemy was attacking strongly across
Mount Nicholson through Middle Gap, and our
troops were suffering greatly from exhaustion,
the wet and cold of the night-time, and isola-
tion from food and ammunition stores. Counter-
attacks on the enemy rear by the Royal
Rifles of Canada came to nought, and Winnipeg
Grenadiers were also unsuccessful in an effort
to retake Wong Nei Cheong Gap. The enemy
still paid attention from the air to the Dockyard
area, and practically all Naval personnel were
now ashore and took their place in the land
fighting. Japanese naval forces blockading the
Island consisted of two cruisers, two destroyers
and two torpedo boats.

It was during the 21st that the ‘* Resist to the
end ’’ message from the Prime Minister was re-
ceived, followed by instructions from the Ad-
miralty to wreck all oil installations and
storages.

The 22nd December witnessed a fresh enemy
landing on the north-east coast of the Island.
Part of our force was now cut off in Stanley,
while various remnants were still holding out
in isolated positions. The Japanese were now
virtually surrounding Victoria, where a great
deal of damage had been inflicted by bombing
and shelling. Oil installations were destroyed,
but it was found impossible to do so at Lai Chi
Kok, since a large hospital would have been
endangered. A telegram was received from the
Admiralty giving the full text of Mr. Churchill’s
message, but also leaving to the Governor the
discretion of surrender when resistance could
no longer be usefully continued.

126. By the 23rd December the principal re-
servoirs were in the hands of the enemy, and
the connections of those that remained under
our control were damaged through shell-fire.
Great efforts were made to effect repairs, but,
in the absence of any substantial success in this
direction, only one day’s supply of water re-
mained to the beleaguered city. Food stores,
too, were greatly depleted. Our troops had be-
come more or less exhausted, though Royal
Marines managed to recapture ground on Mount
