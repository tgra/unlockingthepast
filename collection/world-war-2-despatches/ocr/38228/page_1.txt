OPERATIONS IN BURMA FROM 15TH DECEMBER, 1941,
TO zoTH MAY, 1942.

The following Despatch was submitted to the
Secretary of State for War on the 14th July,
1942, by GENERAL SUR ARCHIBALD P.
WAVELL, G.C B., C.M.G., M.C., A.DC.,
Commander-in-Cluef, India.

(To cover Reports by Lieut.-General T. J.
Hutton and General The Honourable Sir Harold
R L G. Alexander. )

1 This despatch covers reports by Lieut.-
General T. J. Hutton and by General The
Honourable Sir Harold R. L. G. Alexander
describing the operations in Burma between
15th December, 1941, when the defence of
Burma became the responsibility of the Com-
mander-in-Chief in India, and 20th May,’ 1942,
when the last troops of the Burma Army were
withdtawn across the frontier into India. The
despatch is intended to explain how the general
strategical situation affected operations in
Burma and to record the actions I took as the
Commander chiefly responsible for them.
Although the defence of Burma was three times
transferred from one Command to another dur-
ing the period, I remained personally respon-
sible except for a period of about one week at
the end of February, 1942.

2. The vital importance of Burma, in a war
against Japan, to the Allied cause in general
and to the defence of India is obvious. Through
Burma lay the only route by which the Chinese
armies could be kept supplied, and bases
stocked for Allied air attack on Japan itself.
From India’s point of view, so long as Burma
was in our possession, Calcutta and the great
industrial centres of North-East India were
practically immune from air attack, and her
eastern land frontiers were secure from the
threat of invasion. . .

BURMA BEFORE WAR WITH JAPAN.

3. Burma had been included, for operational
purposes, in the Far East Command when this
was established in November, 1940, with head-
quarters in Singapore. Administration remained
directly under the‘War Office. So much, how-
ever, was the security of Burma of concern to
those charged with the defence of India that
several attempts were made by successive Com-
manders-in-Chief in India to have this arrange-
ment altered and responsibility for the defence
of Burma transferred to India. The recom-
mendation to this effect made by my pre-
decessor, (General Auchinleck, was’not accepted.
Shortly after my appointment as Commander-
in-Chief, India I paid a visit to the United
Kingdom and personally pressed this change on
the Chiefs of Staff, who again refused to alter
the existing arrangement, on the grounds that
the question had been fully considered when the
Far East Command was established. The
Japanese had by this time invaded Indo-China
and thus brought danger to Burma much closer,
but this fact was not held to justify the change,

On returning to India I paid a visit to Burma
and Malaya and discussed the question with the
Commander-in-Chief Far East, Air Marshal
Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, and with the
Governor of Burma, Sir Reginald Dorman-
Smith, and with the G.O.C. Burma, Lieut.-
General D. K. Macleod. As a result I cabled to
the C.1.G.S. on rth November, 1941, again
recommending the transfer of Burma to the
Indian Command. I understand that my re-
commendation was supported by the Governor
of Burma.

I was very greatly concerned by the extent
‘of unpreparedness in Burma’s defences of which
I became aware during my visit. I realised
that the number and training of the troops, their
