SUPPLEMENT To tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948

12. State of Warning of Aw Atiacks.—It was
hoped, however, to develop our telephone
. system in the Karenni Hills and the Valley of
the Salween, and with R.D.F. to bring warn-
ing to a state where it would be practicable to
base bombers and fighters at all these airfields.
We asked India for the. necessary equipment
and personnel, including a W/T screen of 35
posts. °

13. Airfield Accommodation.—Consequently,
from the point of view of airfields, there was
nothing to prevent the reception of consider-
able reinforcements as long as we held
Rangoon.

14. As regards commumcations, a good tele-
phone system connected all our airfields, while
point-to-point wireless was in course of being
put in to parent Stations.

15. Burma Observer Corps.—I found the
Burma Observer Corps under the command of
Major Taylor to be, over the area covered,
an efficient warning system. As long as main
centres of communications and telephone lines
were not closely threatened by Jand attack the
‘system functioned devotedly and satisfac-
torily. .

16. In respect of aerodrome defence I found
that outlying Station airfields such as Tavoy
and Mergui had garrisons while detachments
of troops for land defence and anti-sabotage
precautions had been provided at occupied
airfields.

17, 4.A. Defence.—A.A. defence was weak,
with an initial strength of but one batiery of
locally raised troops, whose equipment had
only arnved at the end of December, rgq1.
The later arrival of British and Indian lght
and heavy batteries rendered it possible to
organise a weak scale of defence for the im-
portant vital points. Although the A.A.
defence did yeoman service they were never in
sufficient strength to provide adequate defence
for all the vital points and areas—let alone
our airfields. Except for a weak airfield
detachment the A.A.;Artillery was deployed in
defence of vital points in Rangoon and of our
troops so that some-cover against enemy bomb
attacks in forward areas could be provided
Later during the withdrawal they provided
such close protection as was practicable for our
columns, General Alexander “has remarked
upon this phase of the operations in his
‘Despatch,

18. L.A.A. Defence.—For light automatic
defence against low-flying aircraft, detachments
of the B.A.F., each equipped with 10 to 12
-5 Browning machine guns on A.A. mountings,
were stationed at Mingaladon and Zayatkwin
and later at Magwe. They were manned
entirely by Burmese personnel mainly of the
rath Burma Rifles. Their training was of
necessity hurried and their numbers were
generally much under strength. Elements of
the R A.F. regiment arrived too Jate to be of
much service although they were in action at
Akyab. .

19. Headquarters’ Staff—The position as
regards Headquarters and Station Staffs was
not good. Only a nucleus H.Q. staff existed
and Mingaladon was the only airfield having a
Station H.Q. All other airfields had care and
maintenance parties.

Az

20. A store holding unit and an explosives
depot existed but there was no repair organisa-
tion.

Air Appreciation—Strength of the Air Force
im Burma.

21. On the 14th January I completed my
appreciation of the situation. Copies of this
paper were forwarded to Headquarters, ABDA
Command, India and the Air Ministry. The
object of this paper was to appreciate the
likelihood of a determined attack being

. made by Japan on Burma and from this to

deduce the form and scale of air attack; and
thus the fighter force necessary to secure our
interests against this attack and the bomber
counter-offensive force that would also be
necessary. From this it will be noted that I
considered that the Japanese Air Force would
attempt a ‘‘ knock-out ’’ blow agamst Rangoon
im the event of the fall of Singapore and that
the scale of attack might reach as much as
600 aircraft a day at maximum intensity.

22. Aiy Defence The air defence system
necessary to secure our interests in Burma
against an attack of this kind required that
the fighter force should be on a 14 Squadron
basis—g beyond the 5 Squadrons already on
programme. (These 5 Squadrons were 67
Squadron and the 4 Squadrons of 267 Wing,
which had been allocated in the first place to
India for Burma—Trooper’s telegram 57543
of 12.12.41.) One of these Squadrons—232
Fighter Squadron—was later diverted from
Burma. The fact that the Hurricane force
comprised only 3 (which only reached a
strength of 2 Squadrons) instead of 4 Squadrons
durmg the initial phase of the campaign, had
a serious effect on the operations.

23. Further heavy and light A.A. Artillery
was necessary together with a Bailoon defence
for the City and Port of Rangoon. More
R.D-F., G.C.I. and Observer Corps and W/T.
posts were required for strengthening the warn-
ing system.

24. Bomber Counter-offensive.—As regards
the Bomber offensive, I considered that the 7
Squadrons on programme would be sufficient
(i.e. 60 Squadron already in Burma plus 6

.teinforcing Blenhemm Squadrons promised from

the Middle East—Trooper’s telegram 58315 of
16.12.41) until vigorous attacks against Japan
from bases in China became necessary.

25. Security of Sea Communications.—The
rt Hudson Squadron on programme, provided
we had a force of 2, Torpedo Bomber Squadrons
to call or at seven days’ notice would, I con-
sidered—together with the Bomber force—go
a long way to secure our line of sea communica-
tions from attack by Japanese war vessels in
the Northern portion of the Bay of Bengal
and the Gulf of Martaban. Apart from one or
two patrol craft there were none of H.M. ships
present in these waters. Thus the burden
of anti-submarine protection, anti-bomber
security and the attack of enemy surface vessels
in the Bay and the Gulf would rest for some
time on the Bomber, G.R. and Fighter aircraft
of my command.

26. Reinforcement requested.—After agree-
ment in the Joint Commanders’ Sub-Committee
I accordingly telegraphed ABDA-Command
and the Air Ministry requesting reinforcements
to the scale (A.418 of 18/1) recommended in
