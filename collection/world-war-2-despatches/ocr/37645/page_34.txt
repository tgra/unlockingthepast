ades, as the finding of a limited supply of water
by boring on both possible routes forward had
reduced to a certain extent the amount of water
transport required. In view of the short time
before the rains, and the necessity for a full
moon, so that the initial moves could be carried
out at night, I decided to commence the opera-
tion on r1th February, i.e., 10 days time. No
written orders were issued, and only a mini-
mum number of individuals were informed.

The original orders covered the capture of
-Chisimaio and.a bridgehead at Giumbo only,
but I informed my Commanders that if the
enemy resistance on the Giuba broke, the line
I would aim for would be Mogadiscio-Iscia
Baidoa-Lugh Ferrandi.

14. Meanwhile on the northern front the rst
S.A. Division, which then consisted of and and
5th S.A. Brigades and the 25th E.A. Brigade,
had been ordered to make good the triangle
El Yibo, Gorai and Hobok, and to capture
Kalam.

The object of these operations was to open
up the patriot country in the Galla Sidamo and
gain touch with the patriot chiefs. At the Cairo
Conference I had been specially instructed to
employ South African troops for this purpose,
as General Wavell considered their organisation
and training rendered them more suitable for
it. At the time 1st S.A. Division was sent up
to this front, I was of the opinion that opera-
tions on the other fronts before the rains would
have to be limited and hence hoped I had cast
the South African Division for the more active
role. I always had in mind the possibility of
turning from the west the strong enemy position
on the Moyale-Mega escarpment. ;

15. When I assumed command the struggle
for air supremacy was in its early stages, and
the enemy’s preponderance in bombers and
fighters was very pronounced.

Our Air Forces then comprised one A.C.
Squadron of the S.R.A.F. (which was trans-
ferred to Sudan in the first week in November)
and one A.C. Squadron of the S.A.A.F., the
latter in embryo. A further A.C. Squadron of
the S.A.A.F. was formed and took the field in
the middle of December. In addition there
were two bomber squadrons and two fighter
squadrons of the S.A.A.F. Of the latter, one
was equipped with Hurricanes and the other
with ancient Furies.

Owing to the direct threat to Mombasa, the
gateway of Kenya and of our L. of C., the
Hurricanes had to be concentrated there and in
Nairobi for purely defensive purposes, leaving
the defence of the whole of our troops, aero-
dromes and such important places as Nanyuki,
to the Furies.

For some inexplicable reason the Italians
utterly failed to make use of the golden oppor-
tunity at this time to take the offensive in the
air, though our troops behind the River Tana
and our outlying communications were open
to heavy bombing attacks by them.

As soon as the Italians’ lack of enterprise was
tealised, some of the Hurricanes were dispersed
over the front with the result that the course
of the air operations changed rapidly, and by
the beginning of February our Air Forces‘had
established air superiority. _

Part II—OPERATIONS.
A. Operations of 1st S.A. Division.
(ast January to 5th April, 1941).

16. As already explained, I had allotted the
ast S.A. Division, consisting of the and and
5th S.A. Brigades and 25th E.A. Brigade, to
the northern front, with the object of penetrat-
ing the Galla Sidamo country to stir up the
chiefs there to rebellion and if possible to turn
the enemy out of his strong position on the
Moyale-Mega escarpment.

Facing me on this front the enemy had
approximately three Italian divisions (21, 22
and 24) in considerable depth, of which two
(21 and 24) were east of Lake Rudalf with some
artillery in the Moyale-Mega-Iavello area, while
the Hobok-Gorai-E1 Yibo triangle was held by
approximately 1,600 Banda under European
officers and N.C.0.’s.

17. By the end of December the S.A. Divi-
sion had taken over this sector, with the 2nd
and 5th S.A. ‘Brigades, which had arrived in
Kenya in October and November respectively,-
at Marsabit, and the 25th E.A. Brigade at
Lokitaung. ,

The Order of Battle of 1st S.A. Division on
ist January 1941 is given in Appendix “‘ A.”

18. Operations on this part of the front are
really divided into two parts, those to the west
of Lake Rudolf being entirely separated from
those on the east, the only road communication
being round the south of the lake.

Ig. The and and 5th S.A. Brigades were
employed on the east of Lake Rudolf. Marsabit,
where the brigades started from, is separated
from Southern Abyssinia by a waterless stretch
of country about 120 miles wide, across which
there were at the time only two possible ways
into enemy territory. The first was the road
from Marsabit to Moyale, which wound up the
steep escarpment through country favourable to
the defender. The enemy position on the
escarpment was known to be strong, and a
direct advance against it over this road offered
little chance of success. The road was not only
in a very bad condition but also likely to be-
come impassable during the wet weather. The
second was the road across the Chalbi desert,
via North Horr, to Dukana. This road was
also in very bad condition and, moreover, it
was said that during the rains even animals
were unable to move across the Chalbi desert.
But in spite of these disadvantages the road did
present a route into Abyssinia around the
Moyale-Mega escarpment.

20. With the object of stirring up rebel
activity Intelligence officers had been operating
in this area for some time, supplying arms
and ammunition to patriots who went back to
operate behind the enemy lines. There were
considerable hopes, which unfortunately were
not realised, that a Shifta rebellion thus en-
couraged would break out in the Galla Sidamo
area.

az. At this time the rebels in the Tertale
area were beginning to harass the enemy and
my information was that active support of this
uprising might possibly spread the rebellion
throughout Southern Abyssinia.
