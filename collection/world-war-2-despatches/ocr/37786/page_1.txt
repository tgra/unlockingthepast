OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST From 16Ta FEBRUARY, 1943,
to 8trH JANUARY, 1944.

The following Despatch was submitted to the
Secretary of State for War on 31st August,
1944, by GENERAL SIR H. MAITLAND
WILSON, G.C.B., G.B.E., D.S.0., A.D.C.,
Commander-insChief, The Middle East
Forces. .

I, INTRODUCTORY.

xz. When I was appointed to Middle East
Command, on 16th February, 1943, the Com-
mand included Egypt, Libya, Malta, Palestine
and Transjordan, Cyprus, Sudan, Eritrea, most
of Syria and a small part of Iraq.

2. The situation within the Command, and
in the Middle East generally, was then more
satisfactory than at any time since the outbreak
of the war. The Axis armies had’ been driven
back from the outskirts of the Delta to -the
borders of Tunisia, the possibility of a German
attack through Turkey had been diminished,
the Balkans were proving a serious burden to
Germany, Italian morale was obviously crack-
ing, and British equipment was better and
British morale higher than at any previous
time.

3. My main tasks, in order of priority, were
to maintain Eighth “Army and support its
present operations to the utmost, to plan for
future operations in conformity with the re-
‘quirements of General Eisenhower, to prepare
to support Turkey, and to conduct amphibious
operations. In addition I was to make plans,
‘when required, for land operatidns in the
Balkan States, Crete, and the islands in the
Bgean; I was to plan possible operations in
Arabia and to be ready to assume command of
‘the land forces in Aden should major land
operations develop in or beyond the borders of
that Protectorate.

4. Under my command, to carry out this
Tole, were about 31,000 officers and 494,000
men, divided between the major commands of
Ninth Army, British Troops in Egypt, Sudan,
Palestine, Cyrenaica District, Aden and Malta.
The Order of Battle of these troops is given in
Appendix I.

5. This total did not include the 8,500 officers
and 180,000 men of Eighth Army, which had
reached the borders of Tunisia by February,
and which passed under command of 18 Army
Group on 20th February. Maintenance of
Eighth Army during the remainder of the
Tunisian Campaign, until 12th May, 1943,’ when
the campaign ended with the capture of Tunis
and Bizerta, remained my responsibility and
proved a heavy one. All other claims were
subordinated to this task. Expenditure in
materials, vehicles, and, at times, in personnel
was high, but the Army was always well-found
and this, together with the absence of food
deficiency diseases in a campaign fought over
a thousand miles from the Middle East base,
speaks better than anything else for the
adequacy of the maintenance system.

6. During the later stages of the Tunisian
campaign the second of my tasks, planning for
future operations, began to assume increasing
importance. Plans for the invasion of Sicily
had been laid at the Casablanca Conference,
and detailed planning of these operations was
continued throughout the campaign in Tunisia.
So, even before the Tunisian campaign was
over, Middle East had already begun to train
and equip units for Sicily.

7. The invasion of Sicily was to be conducted
by two forces, of which the bulk of the Eastern
Task Force was to be trained, equipped,
mounted, and maintained in the early stages,
from Middle East Command. This meant that
Eighth Army had to be withdrawn from
