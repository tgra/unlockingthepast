SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 28 APRIL, 1948

8th July—Flying boats on passage Malta-
Zante-Malta.

rath July—Flying boats on passage Malta-
Zante-Alexandria.

13th July—To a depth of 60 miles to the
Westward of convoy M.S.One.

8. At 2339/7th July when in position
32° 35’ N, 28° 30’ E., HASTY sighted an
Italian U-boat on passage on the surface at
1,000 yards range. A full pattern depth charge
attack was made and the U-boat was probably
sunk. At ozoo/8 when rejoining Rear-Admiral,
1st Battle Squadron, another attack was carried
out on a confirmed contact. ‘It is considered
that this attack damaged a second U-boat.

g. The night passed without incident, the
Commander-in-Chief with Force B setting a
mean line of advance of 305 degrees at 20
knots.
turning to harbour with a burst feed tank.

ro. At o807 a report was received from
PHOENIX of two enemy battleships and four
destroyers in position 35° 36’ N, 18° 28 E.,
steering 180 degrees at 0515. She attacked at
extreme range but the attack was apparently
unsuccessful.

As it was suspected from this report that this
force might be covering an important convoy,

Vice-Admiral, Malta, was ordered to arrange*

for a flying boat to locate and shadow this
force. The course of the Fleet was maintained
pending further information.

Two submarines were sighted by EAGLE’s
A/S patrols, one of which was attacked with
bombs.

rr In the meantime all forces were sub-
jected to heavy bombing attacks by aircraft
which appeared to come from the Dodecanese.
Seven attacks were delivered on WARSPITE
between 1205 and 1812, about 50 bombs being
dropped. There were no hits.

12. Between 0951 and 1749 six attacks were
made on Force C, about 80 bombs being
dropped. There were no hits.

13. Most ships experienced some very near
misses but the only hit was on Force A, GLOU-
CESTER being hit by one bomb on the com-
pass platform causing the following
casualties *—

Officers, killed 7 (including Captam F. R

Garside, C.B.E ), 3 wounded.

Ratings, 11 killed and 6 wounded.

The damage caused to the bridge structure,
and D C.T.* necessitated gun control and steer-
ing from aft.

14. At 1510 flying boat L.5803 reported two
battleships, 6 cruisers and 7 destroyers in posi-
‘tion 33° 35’ N, 19° 40’ E., steering 340 degrees,
and at r6ro that this force had altered to 070
degrees. This flying boat had to return to
Malta at 1715 and no relief was available to
continue shadowing. However, the enemy
Fleet was resighted by another Sunderland
from Malta early the following morning.

15. At the time, 1t was suspected that these
‘two battleships were in fact 8” cruisers. The
intensive bombing which had been experienced
‘had already. given the impression that the
Italians had some special reason for wishing
to keep us out of the Central Mediterranean.

At 0800/8 IMPERIAL was sighted re- ~

2645

This, in conjunction with these enemy re-
ports, made it appear that the Italians might
be covering the movement of some important
convoy, probably to Benghazi, and it was
decided temporarily to abandon the operations
in hand and to move the fleet at best speed
towards Taranto to get between the enemy and
his base.

Force B maintained a mean line of advance
of 310 degrees at 20 knots during the night.

16. There were no incidents during the night
and at 0440 EAGLE flew off three aircraft to
search to a depth of 60 miles between 180 and
300 degrees.

Approach Perwd

(0600-1430).

17. At o600 the fleet was concentrated in
position 36° 55’ N, 20° 30’ E., and cruising dis-
position No. xz was ordered. The 7th
Cruiser Squadron and STUART were in the
van 8 miles ahead of Commander-in-Chief in
WARSPITE, who was screened by NUBIAN,
MOHAWK, — HERO, HEREWARD — and
DECOY. The Reac-Admiral, ist Battle
Squadron, in ROYAL SOVEREIGN, with
MALAYA and EAGLE, _ screened by
HYPERION, -HOSTILE, HASTY, ILEX,
DAINTY, DEFENDER, JUNO, JANUS,
VAMPIRE and VOYAGER, was 8 miles to the
rear of WARSPITE. The mean line of advance
was 260 degrees, speed 15 knots.

gth July, 1940

18. At 0732 flying boat L.5807 reported the
main enemy fleet consisting of 2 battleships, 4
cruisers and 10 destroyers in position 37° 14’
N, 16° 51’ E., steering 330 degrees at 15 knots,
and at 0739 that 6 cruisers and 8 destroyers
were stationed o80 degrees 20 miles from the
main fleet, steermmg 360 degrees, and that at
0805 the main fleet had altered to 360 degrees.

At this time the main enemy fleet were about

* 145 miles 280 degrees from our own fleet.

At 0810, as a result of these reports, the mean
line of advance of the fleet was altered to 305
degrees at 18 knots in order to work to the
Northward of the enemy fleet and if possible
get between him and his base.

At 0858 three aircraft from EAGLE were
flown off to search a sector between 260 and
300 degrees to maximum depth.

Between 1026 and 1135 reports were received
from flying boats 5807 and 9020 and EAGLE’S
Duty B and Duty C, which, though they
differed considerably, yet gave an indication of
the movements of the enemy.

1g. At 1105, EAGLE’s Duty D reported 2
battleships and one cruiser 1n position 38° 07’ N,
16° 57’ E., with 4 other cruisers near. At 1115 ,
flying boat L.5807 reported the enemy battle-,
fleet in position 38° 06’ N, 17° 48’ E., steering

60°.

= It 1s probable that if in this latter report these
ships were correctly identified, the real position
should have heen considerably further to the
Westward. Reports up to this time indicated
that the enemy forces consisted of at least 2
battleships, 12 cruisers and 20 destroyers, and
that during the forenoon they were dispersed
over a wide area It seems probable that the
cruisers and destroyers reported at 0739 took a
wide sweep shortly afterwards to the North-
eastward and that they were joined by other
cruisers and destroyers, possibly those which
had been with the main fleet,
