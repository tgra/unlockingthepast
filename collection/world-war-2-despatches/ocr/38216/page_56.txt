1402,

592. Whilst he was so engaged, A.H.K. again
rang him up at the Resident’s House. The Staff
Officer doing so specifically enquired whether
the British were going to fight, whether General
Sitwell had full control of ‘‘ Blackforce ”’, and
whether the last could be persuaded to stop
fighting. To these questions he was given non-
commital answers except an assurance that
** Blackforce ’’ would definitely obey any orders
General Sitwell might issue. The A.O.C. was
given a further urgent message from the Duich
C.-in-C., which it is understood was telephoned
through from Kalidjati, where at that time the
Dutch C.-in-C. was negotiating terms with the
Japanese C.-in-C. The message pressed for
action to be taken to stop ‘‘ Blackforce ’’ blow-
ing up any more bridges to cover their with-
drawal to the hills, as this action was hardi-
capping the negotiations. It is not known how
the information about blowing the bridges
south-east of Bandoeng reached the Japanese at
Kalidjat. many miles to the north. This infor--
mation made 1t clear that the Japanese already
knew our intention and whither we were with-
drawing into the hills. .

593. The A.O.C. then returned to Tjikadjang
where he met the G.O.C. and Brigadier Black-
burn at 1330 hours, when the situation was as
follows : —

(a) Troops were arriving in the concentra-
tion area, the last being due during the night.
They possessed small arms and ammunition
and a few Bofors guns, but as had been ex-
pected, no mortars, aircraft or artillery.
Although personnel were tired and many were
poorly clad and kitted, particularly R.A.F.
personnel evacuated from Singapore, morale

* appeared on the whole good.

(®) Administrative arrangements were, how-
ever, gtave. Only 33 days’ rations had so far
accompanied the force. Army convoys had
experienced considerable obstruction when
collecting stores, and the dump in Bandoeng
was reputed to be destroyed (news later to
prove false). There might be time to collect
some more, but this was not certain. Petrol
was limited to what vehicles had in their
tanks. The combined British/ Australian
Field Hospital in Bandoeng could not be
moved to the hills because it was already
overloaded with patients. Hospitalisation
was therefore totally impracticable, and
medical supplies limited to those carried by
units, which were few and of a first aid
nature only. Water was everywhere polluted
by reason of native habits, water carts were
few and effective sterilization was impractic-
able. Stomach troubles were already in
evidence.

5094. Given local co-operation and time these
handicaps could have been overcome, but there
appeared to be prospect of neither. The Dutch
had ceased fighting everywhere and, to say the
least, were not being helpful. The natives might,
or might not, turn against the whites: warning
about them had been received, and in any
case they were unlikely to assist. And ‘time
had suddenly become unexpectedly short now
that the Japanese knew about the movement.
Much had still to be done in reorganising, in
preparing positions for defence and in solving
administrative difficulties. Time was now par-
ticularly short for training the R.A.F. contin-
gent, which comprised about one-third of the

force, in its new and future role, namely in
infantry fighting about which it knew nothing,
particularly of jungle fighting. Indeed, many
A.A. gunners recently rearmed as infantry were
in little better case.

505. Yet something might have been done
but for the quandary in which the British
had now been placed by reason of the Dutch
C.-in-C’s. broadcast (para. 588). This had
been promulgated on behalf of the British
forces, as well as on that of the Dutch, but
without consultation with the A.O.C. or
G.O.C. and although -the British intention to
continue resistance was well known-to the Dutch
C.-in-C. The broadcast contained the phrase
‘* All organised resistance having now ceased.’”
This phrase had an important bearing. It was
believed to have the effect in international law
of- placing those who continued to resist out-
side the protection of belligerent rights and
subject. to summary execution if captured. The

apanese were hkely to exercise their rights in
the matter. The problem which now faced the
A.O.C. and G.O.C. was how to sort out the
force, now in a state of movement over a wide
area, into those who were willing to face such
consequences and those who were not. The
latter could not be given legal orders to continue
fighting under such conditions as bandits
against their will. The next problem was to
reorganise the former into a fighting force well
clear of the latter and of the 2,900 unarmed

‘R.A.F. contingent which had by now moved

unpleasantly close, although still in the plains.
(para. 585). One alternative was to send the
““bouches inutiles’’ down to the plains to
surrender and for the former to fight where
they were. But Japanese revenge on those
who submitted themselves under such circum-
stances was already too well known to permit
adoption of such a course. The other alter-
native was for the volunteer contingent to
move to, and reorganise in, a new defence area.
But this was impracticable. The Japanese
already occupied Bandoeng, through which led
all roads to the hill country m the S.W.
extremity of Java, where lay the only other
remote spots which might be suitable for
guerilla resistance: the country elsewhere was
too highly developed and too well served by
numerous roads. The Japanese quite clearly
knew where the British had withdrawn and
their intention, and were free to follow up
quickly, as was their habit. It was thus im-
practicable by now to reorganise anything
effective.

596. In these circumstances the A.O.C. and

G.O.C., regretfully decided that .they must

comply with the order to surrender. The order
as received from A.H.K. was accordingly issued.
to units about 1430 hours.

Orders were also issued : —

(a) To destroy arms and warlike stores.
likely to be of value to the enemy, except
a limited amount of transport.

(0) For all ranks to observe absolute reti-
cence if questioned for military information
by the enemy.

A signal was sent to the R.A.F. H.Q. Signal
Section for transmission to the Air Ministry to
the effect that the orders to surrender were
being complied with. The reasons why this
signal did not get through are contained in
paras, 610-613. . .
