the choice was narrowed down to two sectors,
the centre and the extreme right, and there was
little to choose between them. On the axis of
Route 65 the mountains are higher but Bologna,
the most important objective south of the Po, is
nearer, On the east coast the ground is much
lower but the ridges are at right angles to the
direction of the advance and there are a number
of serious water obstacles. It was, however,

largely on considerations of timing that I re--

jected the idea of an attack up the east coast.
It was vital not to allow the enemy a day more
than was unavoidable to strengthen his de-
fences and reorganise his formations. The bulk
of my forces was advancing up the centre of
the peninsula and the west coast by routes
which would bring them to the Arno in the area
of Florence and Pisa so that it would be both
easier and quicker to concentrate for the attack
round Florence than anywhere else. In the
days when I still had my full forces I expected
to be able to rush the Apennines almost without
stopping; in my present situation some slight
pause would be necessary but I was determined
to reduce it to the minimum.

_ _ The plan involved a simultaneous attack by
Fifth and Eighth Armies on parallel axes, each
with their main strength on their contiguous
wings. Eighth Army would be able to bring
forward for the attack two fresh Corps, 5 and r

Canadian, with five divisions between them, to -

be reinforced by 1 British Armoured Division
which was arriving in the country. For the
moment, until arrangements for forward main-
tenance could be perfected, these forces were to
concentrate in the general area of Assisi with
some elements to the west near Siena. On
17th July Eighth Army Headquarters produced
a detailed appreciation. The conclusions were
that the attack should be made by two Corps,
each with two divisions forward, operating up
the axes Florence-Firenzuola and Florence-
Bologna, The Poles were to hold on the
Adriatic coast and would be connected with the
central front by a Corps with a defensive réle.
A cover-plan had already been put into force
by my headquarters on 3rd July to suggest to
the enemy that the main attack would come on
the Adriatic coast.

It was more difficult to decide on the réle
and capabilities of Fifth Army which had now
been reduced to one armoured and four infan-
try divisions, all of which had seen heavy and
continuous fighting recently. On roth July, in
a letter to General Clark, I outlined the posi-
tion as I saw it and my proposals for his actions
Preliminary to the main attack on the line. I
suggested that it would almost certainly prove
too costly to attempt to force a crossing of the
Arno west of Pontedera, where the great Monte
Pisano feature gave the enemy commanding
observation, and proposed that he should hold
the line from Pontedera to the sea with light
forces and cross between there and Empoli,
exploiting to capture Lucca and Pistoia. This
would give us the desired start line for an
attack from Pistoia arid the front from Pistoia
to the sea could be held as a defensive flank
with reduced forces. General Clark fully con-

» curred with these plans and issued orders to
that effect on 21st July; he estimated that
D-day for the operation would be between 5th
and roth August and ordered measures to -be
taken in the meantime to ensure a thorough
test for all troops. At the same time Fifth
Army took energetic steps to increase their

potentiality by creating new defensive forma-
tions from the exiguous forces left by ANVIL.
The most striking was the creation of ‘‘ Task
Force 45°’. This force, of roughly divisional
strength, was made up from five American
Light Anti-Aircraft battalions, a British Light
Anti-Aircraft regiment, an American Tank
battalion, part of two Tank Destroyer
battalions, part of a divisional reconnaissance
battalion and some miscellaneous service units;
it was divided into three regiment-sized groups.
Up to 24th July these units were still. being
employed in their original réles, and had only
a very short period of intensive training before
taking over part of the line on the Arno from
34 Division. ‘The success of this remarkable
effort at. conversion was very encouraging
and ‘‘ Task Force 45’’ remained for many
months a valuable part of Fifth Army’s order of
battle, used for holding defensive fronts.

On 26th July I sent an appreciation on future
operations to both Army Commanders. My
genera] plan was divided into four phases and
described as follows : “‘ To penetrate the centre
of the ‘Gothic’ line roughly between Dico-
mano and Pistoia; to thrust forward over the
Apennines to secure the general line Imola-
Bologna-Modena; to complete the destruction
of the enemy forces south of the Po by rapid
exploitation across the Po valley; to secure a
bridgehead over the Po north of Ferrara, and
if possible at Ostiglia as well’’. Plans for
Eighth Army’s attack were unchanged and the
main subject for decision was the task of Fifth
Army, for the weakening of that Army was the
chief new factor which had been introduced.
General Clark would be unable to produce more
than a Corps of two divisions plus for the
attack. If Eighth Army was to attack up the
main routes north from Florence on Bologna
Fifth Army must clearly attack towards
Modena, from either Lucca or Pistoia. On full
consideration of topographical factors, which I
need not detail here, the latter axis was clearly
preferable. I calculated that Fifth Army would
probably be strong enough to seize and secure
Modena but that it could not be called on for
any more than to exploit to a radius of some .
ten or fifteen miles from that objective. Eighth
Army would therefore have to be responsible
for the advance up to and across the Po. After
bearing the brunt of the attack in the mountains
it would probably only be able to exploit to the
Po on one axis, to Ferrara, though it would be
most desirable, if at all practicable, for it to
seize a bridgehead also in the Ostiglia area.

From this appreciation it seemed clear that,
after fighting our way through the mountains
we should arrive in the plains too weak to
exploit rapidly northwards. This conclusion I
had reached some time before and .I therefore
decided to implement the plan which the Air
Forces had already made for the destruction of
the bridges over the Po. This operation, given
ithe codename MALLORY MAJOR, was first
studied after the fall of Rome and an opera-~
tional directive for it was issued om 17th June.
The object given was ‘‘ to disrupt the enemy’s
flow of supplies into northern Italy by the
destruction of six rail bridges over the Po river
and one across the Trebbia river, supplemented
by the destruction of the Recco or Zoagli via-
duct ’’ (this was a long and vulnerable viaduct
on the coastal line east of Genoa). The date
of the operation was to be decided by me, to
fit in with the situation on the ground. . As
