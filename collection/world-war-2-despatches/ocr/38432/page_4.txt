13. Conclusions.— ‘

(i) Due to the fact that the convoy
appeared much sooner than we expected, and
that we found ourselves right in their track,
there were two courses open to us.

(ii) The first was to haul out and return
to carry out a silent attack in the hope that
the escort would not see us. This course was
not adopted as it was considered that we
were already too close, and were bound to
be observed any moment.

(iii) The alternative was to deliver an attack
at once, down the middle of the convoy, as
it would not have been possible to get out-
side the screen without using all engines and
making a great deal of noise.

(iv) We adopted the second method, which
was made much easier by the very indifferent
look-out that the convoy was keeping.

(v) They could not have been using
R.D.F. or keeping a listening watch.

(vi) In future, more use could be made
of a gunboat diversion astern of the convoy
to leave the M.T.B.s a clear run from ahead.

(vii) For this method of attack more *
boats are needed. su

(viii) Both torpedoes should be fired at the
same target to make certain of sinking it.

SINKING oF Enemy SUPPLY SHIP IN A STRONGLY

ESCORTED Convoy Eastsounp FRoM LE

Havre—NIcut 26TH /27TH SEPTEMBER, 1943.

Be pleased to lay before Their Lordships the
attached reports of an action between three
M.T.B.s, supported by three M.G.B.s, and a
strongly escorted enemy convoy on passage
from Le Havre to Boulogne during the night
26th /27th September, 1943.

2. Aerial reconnaissance had reported the
presence in Le Havre of two enemy merchant
vessels which were expected to attempt the
passage of the Dover Strait.

3. Accordingly, M.T.B.s 202 (Lieutenant
Jj. L. Bommezyn, R.Neth.N.); Lieutenant
E. H. Larive, D.S.C., R.Neth.N., Senior
Officer embarked, 204 (Lieutenant H. C.
Jorissen, R.Neth.N.), 231 (Lieutenant C. H.
Vaneeghen, R.Neth.N.) with M.G.B.s 108
(Lieutenant L. E. Thompson, R.N.V.R.), 118
(Lieutenant M. O. Forsyth Grant, R.N.V.R.),
117 (Sub-Lieutenant D. W. B. Woolven,
R.N.V.R.), were, ordered to patrol the vicinity
of Berck Buoy in accordance with my signal
timed 1545 on 25th September, copy of which is
attached.

Albacore patrol between Boulogne and
Dieppe had to be withdrawn earlier owing to
weather.

4. Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of the remarks
of the Senior Officer, M.T.B.s are concurred

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 18 OCTOBER, 1948

This well planned and skilfully executed
attack reflects the greatest credit on Lieutenant
E. H. Larive and the officers and men under
his command.

It is probable that the enemy’s misplaced
faith in his recently laid minefields, through
which a channel had been swept only two days

wior to the engagement, together with the
improbability of our Coastal Forces operating
in the prevailing weather conditions, con-
tributed to an unusual element of surprise.

The likelihood of this event in no way be-
littles the success of the M.G.B.s’ diversion to
seaward which, added to the advantage of the
light, no doubt accounted for the unprepared-
ness of the enemy for a torpedo attack from
inshore.

5. This action was fought outside the range of.
shore-based radar and in consequence consider-
able risk from enemy minefields to returning
craft doubtful of their position had io be
accepted, but had all craft been fitted with
Rotet,* valuable assistance could have been
given in the later stages of their return.

ENCLOSURE I To F.O.C. DoveEr’s LETTER.
FrRoM Senior Officer, H.M.M.T.B.s,
Dover.
DATE 6th October, 1943.
To Flag Officer Commanding, Dover.

I have the honour to submit the following
report of proceedings of the night 26th/27th
September, 1943, from the Senior Officer, gth
M.T.B. Flotilla.

2. The action was well planned and executed
and led to the sinking of the main torpedo
target.

3. The handling of the force by the Senior
Officer, gth M.T.B. Flotilla up to the moment
of firing torpedoes was excellent and put the
M.T.B.s into a perfect firing position. I feel,
however, that he would have been better ad-
vised to have had the M.T.B.s in Starboard
Quarter line instead of Port Quarter line and
thus avoided M.T.B.204 crossing the bows of
M.T.B.231 just before M.T.B.231 fired. Star-
board Quarter line in this instance would have
been the usual formation.

4. I consider M.T.B.231 was incorrect in
shifting his point of aim to a coaster from the
main torpedo target. All Commanding Officers
should realise that while the main torpedo
target remains afloat that target only should be
attacked. Even if the main target has been
hit but has not yet sunk, any torpedoes remain-
ing in the force should be used against that
target. :

5. It has long been the intention to attack
from inshore in this area and it is most satis-
factory that on this first occasion the attack
was successful. This is only possible between
the Berck Buoy and the southern limit of the
Command. The suggestion in para. 17 of the
Senior Officer, 9th M.T.B. Flotilla’s report is
agreed with and it is hoped to try it out at an
early opportunity.

Lieutenant, R.N.
