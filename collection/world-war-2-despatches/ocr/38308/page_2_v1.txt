many of the events and remarks made in the enclosures  but is designed to present an overall and brief picture.

2. The successful capture  of Okinawa, as a stepping stone on the way to the overthrow of the Japanese Empire, was  appreciated as of paramount importance, and it was in. consequence a matter of great satisfaction: to .all in the two Forces, 57 and x12, that the former was able, in however small a degree, to draw a little of the enemy fire from those American Forces destined to bear the brunt of the attack in these initial stages.of the operation. It is hoped that, by their efforts in this area, any major staging of Japanese aircraft to the critical scene of operations was impeded. The resources of the Rear-Admiral, Fleet Train Task  Force 1x2 on which we depend for logistic support are

in some matters still somewhat embryonic: I:

have reason to believe that he.stretched them considerably to keep my Force: operating.

3. Although the. period under review was quiet and the enemy hard to find, those attacks which did develop gave us valuable  experience and revealed several flaws in our organisation which diligence, time and additional resources will remedy. Accurate assessments of the damage inflicted by our strikes was often difficult to determine: this was in part due to the enemy's skilful use of dummy. aircraft, camouflage and dispersal.

4. The difficulty of aircraft recognition when friendly and enemy planes are- in the  vicinity of the Fleet is an ever present problem: several proposals to obviate this confusion have been discussed, and, as remarked in the narrative,

a, solution to this appears of first  importance. *

I trust we shall find one.

5. The attack by suicide aircraft on the Fleet demonstrates once again the. importance of fighter interception "being carried  out at the maximum possible range. .

6. It has been unusual, during my generation, for a British Fleet of. this size to remain: at sea for the length of time covered by this report and I had beforehand found myself wondering at times what shoricomings.in personnel and material it would discover. _ Over the  latter the necessary steps are in hand; as regards the former, whilst certain adjustments and additions to complement will be asked for, I am satisfied with the way in which the Fleet adapted itself to the new conditions.

7. This report, dealing as it does with an

unfinished operation, is of an interim nature only. It will not, however, be out of place to  remark on the helpfulness . of the American authorities both at Manus and Ulithi; I trust we did not ask for their assistance until we were faced with problems which frankly seemed beyond us, but whenever we did so appeal it was responded to with the utmost vigour. I

would further add that the Communication
