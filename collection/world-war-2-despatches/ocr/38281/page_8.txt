759. As RENOWN ‘was no longer engaged, and
with: the information then available’ it appeared
that action with the battleships might be
imminent, +£ decided to concentrate on
RAMILLIES. Shortly’ after starting to turn

however, the Eastern group of cruisers was .

seen to present a possible target and as thé
Plot indicated that the enemy battleships were
heading North: East, course was steadied on
070° to engage these new targets.

60. At 1300, after a swing to Starboard to
avoid a reported submarine, course was altered
to 045° to close the position of two battleships
which had just been reported on that bearing
by -Vice Admiral Commanding, 18th Cruiser
Squadron,

61. At 1311 RENOWN fired two ranging
salvos at the.left hand of the two ships .be-
lieved at the time to be battleships. It is now
considered’ that they were more probably two
of the Eastern group of cruisers, Both salvos
fell -well short and the range was opening
Ttapldly.

62. When sighted by Vice Admiral Com-
manding, 18th Cruiser Squadron at 1300 the
two enemy battleships were steering to the
South West and closing the range rapidly. At
1305 the 18th Cruiser Squadron therefore
turned to work round the flank of the enemy
battleships and to close the gap on RENOWN,
but, at-the same time the battleships altered
course to the North Eastward and appeared to
be retiring at high speed, whereupon the 18th
aust Squadron was turned back to a course

050°.

63. During this short phase of the action ,

large splashes, confirming the presence of
capital ships, fell in the vicinity of BERWICK
and MANCHESTER.

64. The relative position of my forces and
those of ‘the enemy -as given by the Plot at
1315 is shown in Diagram 3- The situation was
as follows: —

* (i) Firing ‘had practically ceased owing to
“the enemy drawing out of range.
(ii) The heavy-smoke made by the enemy

“had prevented accurate fire during the chase

and so -far as could be'ascertained, no damage

had been inflicted.

(iii) In reply to a signal from me to’

C.S.18 at 1308 ‘‘ Is there any hope of catch
ing cruisers? ’’ I was informed ‘‘No’’. (A
later message from C. S. 18 estimated the
enemy had three knots excess speed.) -

+ {iv) It was known that the Striking Force
had attacked. No report of results had been
‘received, but it was evident that the speed
of the enemy. had not been materially re-
duced and was: certainly not as low as
20 knots. It was presumed, that the attack
had been ‘unsuccessful and this’ was not un-

s expected. :

- 65. Iii view’ of otr rapid approach to the
enemy coast I had ‘to decide whether a con-
titiuance of the chase was justified and likely
to. “be profitable. The arguments’ for and
against continuing’ the chase appeared to be: —

For -Continuing the Chase.

. (i) The possibility that the speed of the
enemy might be reduced by some unfore-
seen eventuality.

(ii) He. might appreciate that his force
‘was a aed to mine and decide to turn
and fight.

Against Continuing the Chase.

. (i} There was no sign that ‘any of the
enemy ships and especially his battleships
had suffered damage, nor was there
reasonable prospect of inflicting damage by
gunfire in view of their superior speed.
Unless the speed of the enemy battleships
was reduced very materially he could enter

Cagliari before I could bring him to action .

with RENOWN and RAMILLIES.

(ii) I was being led towards the enemy
air and submarine base at. Cagliari and
this might, well prove a trap. His
appearance in this area appeared to be pre-
meditated since it was unlikely that this
was occasioned solely by the information
he had received the previous night of
Force ‘‘ D’s”’ presence in the Narrows.

(iii) The extrication of one of my ships

damaged by air or submarine attack from

- my present position would certainly require

‘the whole of my force and must, involve

leaving’ the convoy uncovered and insuffi-

ciently escorted during the passage of the
Narrows.

(iv) The enemy main units had been
driven off sufficiently far to ensure they
could no longer interfere with the passage
of the convoy.

(v) A second T/B attack could not take
place until 1530 to 1600 by which time the
convoy would be entirely uncovered and
the enemy fleet could be under the cover of
the A/A batteries and fighters at Cagliari.
I entertained little hope that the attack
would prove effective as I knew that the
second flight was even less experienced
than the first.

(vi) I had no assurance that the cruisers’
reported to the North West might not be
working round towards the convoy and
ARK ROYAL ;

(vii) It was necessary for contact to be
inade. with the convoy before dark to ensure
the cruisers and destroyers required for
escort through the Narrows should be
‘properly formed up. It was also necessary
to provide the fullest possible scale defence
against T/B and light surface force attack
at dusk. To effect this a retirement be-
tween 1300 and 1400 was necessary.

Decision to Break Off the’ Chase.

66. After reviewing these pros and cons I
had no doubt in my mind whatsoever that the
correct course was to break off the chase and re-
join the convoy as soon as possible. I conse-
quently ordered a course of 130° to be steered.

67. At approximately 1335 I received a re-
port of an enemy damaged cruiser in position

about 30 miles from me and ten miles from’

the enemy coast. I considered the desirability
of detaching two cruisers to search for and
attack this cruiser.
able to use MANCHESTER or SOUTHAMP-
TON. SHEFFIELD’s R.D/F was required to
deal with the bombing attacks which would
inevitably develop and this left BERWICK. and
