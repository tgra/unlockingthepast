In the general area of Rome there were 2
Parachute Division on the coast near Ostia
and 3 (Panzer Grenadier Division around
Viterbo. These were Kesselring’s eight divi-
sions already mentioned; they were organised,
under Headquarters Tenth Army (Colonel-
General von Vietinghoff), into two corps:
XIV Panzer Corps north and LXXVI Panzer
Corps south. Directly under Kesselring was
XI Flieger Corps (Air Corps); this had been
moved from Avignon when the two parachute
divisions, Ist and 2nd, came to Italy. It was
responsible for the training and administration
of all parachute units (and directly com-
manded 2 Parachute Division) and for the
defence of the Rome area and the west coast
‘between a point north of the Gulf of Gaeta and
Kesselring’s northem boundary.

In North Italy was Army Group ‘ B ’, Field-
Marshal Rommel, with headquarters on Lake
Garda, commanding all forces in Italy and
Italian-occupied Slovenia north of a line from
Grosseto to Rimini. By the beginning of Sep-
tember it totalled an equivalent of ten divisions
(including one and a half divisions in Sardinia
and Corsica which were technically under the
local Italian commanders) of which two were
armoured divisions. Reinforcement had been
proceeding throughout August and at the same
time an extensive development of lines of com-
munication and administrative facilities had
been rapidly pushed ahead, in particular the
creation of a very large staging and mainten-
ance area around Verona. There were four
Corps Headquarters under the Army Group,
the most important being LXXXVII Corps
‘which, with four divisions, was responsible
for the protection of Liguria and Tuscany.

The effect of these dispositions was, first of
all, to ensure German control of Northern
Italy. For the rest forces were disposed to
meet an Allied invasion at the points con-
sidered most threatened: Calabria, Gaeta-
Naples-Salerno, the Rome area and Genoa-
Spezia. All these points were considered as
possible Allied objectives with the degree of
probability increasing towards the north. Any
landing we made, except in Calabria, would
be strongly opposed. .The chief lesson the
Germans claimed to have learned from Sicily
was that it was vital to destroy the assaulting
forces actually on the beaches and not to hold
back defending forces for a deliberate counter-
attack. But an intention to resist a landing
in the hope of a spectacular victory is quite
consistent with a decision on general prin-
ciples not to hold Southern and Central Italy
if an invasion were successful. It was a de-
cision rather at variance with ordinary German,
and-in particular Hitlerian, psychology and
appears to have been based on two misappre-
ciations; the usual over-estimate of Allied
strength and too gloomy a judgment of the
dangers which Italian treachery would involve.
Although the Germans had no higher an opinion
of their Axis partners than had the Allies they
realised that Italian defection would at least
leave many doors open for the invader and,
in the worst case, Italian arms turned against
them might lead to more serious disaster; they
also expected, as we did to a certain extent,
that the allegedly turbulent population of
Northern Italy would present them with a grave
security problem which would engage the atten-
tion: of all the troops allotted to that area.

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

There was also the danger of a complete break-
down of all facilities, such as transport and
power, with an additional strain on German
resources in consequence which might be more
than they could stand unless control was limited
to the Northern Italian area. This was a factor
on which we also placed some hopes; it seemed
reasonable to expect that the workers in these
industries would, even if they took no other
action, at least achieve a high degree of
‘absenteeism ’’. It was natural, therefore, in
the midst of such dangers and uncertainties,
that the German High Command should decide
to restrict its ambitions to what seemed within
its powers and not wish to risk disaster by
attempting too much.

I must touch, in closing, on a question which
was hotly debated both at the time and sub-
sequently; whether the Germans expected us
to land in the Naples area and, more par-
ticularly, at Salerno. It is essential to be
clear what is meant by the question.* Cer-
tainly the Germans expected us to land some-
where in Italy and almost certainly on the
west coast. It is standard form for all armies
to prepare appreciations to meet all possible
cases and there was undoubtedly somewhere
in Kesselring’s headquarters an appreciation
based on the assumption that we should launch
an assault on Naples and one of the sub-head-
ings undoubtedly considered a landing in the
Gulf of Salerno. ‘What we have to consider in
order to-arrive at a just conclusion is not all
the possibilities that passed through the mind
of ‘the Commander-in-Chief but what actual
physical steps he took; his dispositions will ©
give the answer. As I have already pointed
out, he had made dispositions to meet attacks
in the Naples area, the (Rome-Civitavecchia
area and the Genoa-Spezia area. Turning to
the first mentioned, the reasons, which I need
not detail again, that urged Naples as an objec-
tive so strongly on us must have been obvious
to the Germans as well. In the circumstances
I consider it surprising that they should have
allotted only three. divisions, two of which had
scarcely recovered from their severe losses in
Sicily, to cover the whole stretch of a hundred
and fifty miles of coast from Gaeta to Agropoli.
That they knew of our intention to land
actually in the Gulf of Salerno I do not believe,
nor do I believe that they even considered
it the most likely hypothesis. They had dis-
posed two divisions to cover Naples and the
beaches to the north, either side of the Volturno,
and had only brought over the third, 16 Panzer
Division, from Apulia to Salerno at the end of
August.- Actions” speak louder even than
wisdom after the event. I have already described
the éxcellence of the Salerno beaches. Four
battalions of infantry and a battalion of tanks,
even adding -in the divisional reconnaissance
and engineer battalions, are a very slenter
force to defend over thirty miles of coast;
although there were. Italian troops also in the
line Sicily had clearly demonstrated their use
lessness and the Germans’ should” have . stis-
pected, though the evidence is clear,that they
did not know, that‘Marshal Badoglio was about
oy follow the example of General‘ Yorck. i

*The fact that we gained strategic surprise is
sometimes obscured by the fact that.we did not gain,
nor had hoped for, tactical surprise. To sail. so large
a fleet into the Gulf of Salerno without attracting the
attention of somebody on shore would have been ‘too
niuch to expect: - : ’ weet
