            "description": "I returned to my General Headquarters on the 1st February disquieted by the failure of the Eighth Army to check the enemy advance. The weakness of our armour was particularly disturbing, and I doubted whether we might not have to withdraw to the frontier positions. When I got back to Cairo, however, I found that the prospects of rebuilding our armoured force reasonably quickly were better than I had supposed, and I decided to try to hold Tobruk, since to possess it would undoubtedly make it very much easier to resume the offensive. I therefore sent General Ritchie preliminary instructions to hold the enemy as far west as possible without risking the destruction or isolation of the Eighth Army west of the Egyptian frontier."

To their north the French, supported by an American Regimental Combat Team, captured Colle Belvedere and pushed further into the mountains towards Terelle. II Corps was now in a position to swing the direction of its attack from west to south. 36 Division, still weak from its losses in the Rapido crossing, was brought in to guard the western flank by holding Monte Castelione, captured by 34 Division on 1st February, and the 34th began attacking on the 2nd along the ridge from Colle Majola on to the rear of Monastery Hill. Hopes were high and General Clark signalled me on that day:   Present indications are that the Cassino heights will be captured very soon .
