SUPPLEMENT To tur LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951

From our railhead at Dimapur, a long road
line of communication leads up to, and
beyond, Imphal. Before the Japanese
advance in March, a division was fighting be-
yond Tamu, which is 195 miles from rail-
head, and another was engaged south of Tid-
dim, 300 miles from railhead. Imphal is 135
miles from Dimapur.

192. The maintenance of Special Force was
entirely by air. For this purpose, bases at
airfields in East Bengal were originally
organized and stocked, but at a later stage
in the planning, the base was transferred to the
Surma Valley, and from the airfields there
maintenance by supply-dropping and -landing
has been carried out throughout the operations.

193. The building up of stocks on both
the northern and southern lines was a matter
of some anxiety during the earlier part of the
period. On the southern line, the capacity
of the port of Chittagong, in spite of progres-
sive expansion, barely kept pace with the
needs of the forces, while on the northern
line of communication, the total capacity
available until April was only just sufficient
for maintenance. Reserve stocks of many
commodities, especially petrol, fell to dan-
gerously low levels.

194. A supply difficulty which exists in both
Assam and Arakan is that, with the excep-
tion of the rice crop which barely meets the
needs of the civil population, no foodstuffs
are obtainable in either area. In Bengal last
year, this caused famine; and in parts of
Assam the local inhabitants can barely sup-
port themselves. This imposed on the Army
the need for importing fresh meat, vegetables,
fruit, etc., from distant areas over difficult
lines of communication; and of having to
supply large quantities of tinned and de-
hydrated substitutes to rectify deficiencies in
the fresh ration.

195. I have already mentioned the extent
to which air supply has developed, but the
subject is of such outstanding importance that
the following figures are of interest. From
the 8th to the 21st February, when the
Japanese attack severed the communications of
7 Indian Division, a total of 923 tons of sup-
plies of all types was dropped on the sur-
rounded elements of that division. The
month’s total for February of air-dropped sup-
plies in Arakan was 2,710 tons. In April,
the total tonnage dropped was: —

Arakan, 1,316 (for 81 (West African) Divi-
sion in the Kaladan Valley).

Special Force, 1,073.

’ From the 16th April to the 22nd June (the
date of the re-opening of the Kohima—
Imphal road), the amount flown into Imphal
for 4 Corps was 13,155 tons. Nearly 10,000
casualties were evacuated by air from Imphal
between these dates.

196. The operation of road transport be-
tween railhead (Dimapur) and Imphal, and
forward thereof, is also of interest. A “round
the clock” or L.G.O.C.* system has been

Transport Board).

adopted which works throughout the ten
four hours. Vehicles run independently,
drivers being changed at intervals which give
them adequate rest. The following figures
cover the month of January :—

Number of task vehicles Ben 1,321

Tonnage delivered «. 47,3804
Total mileage run... s+» 4,463,454
Average daily mileage per

vehicle eee ase eae 110
Casualties :

(@) Miles per accident 19,239

(b) Vehicles evacuated 103

At this time, as already mentioned, divi-
sions had to be supplied up to 300 miles from
trailhead. Much of this is narrow and dangerous
mountain road and J think the above figures
eats the efficiency of Indian lorry

vers.

197. The importance of labour in an un-
developed Eastern Theatre cannot be over-
stated. The construction of hundreds of miles
of railways, roads, and pipelines ; the prepara-
tion of new airfields and the expansion of
existing ones; transportation works on the
lines of communication, including port de-
velopment; the expansion of hospitals,
depots and camps in rear areas, etc., all mean
in Kenning demand for more and more
labour.

On the Ist May, the figure of organized
labour employed by Fourteenth Army was
over 178,000, while demands for a further
18,600 were under examination. In addition
to this, some 200,000 civilian (contractor)
labour was employed on Army projects. These
figures include labour supplied to the United
States forces. In spite of this total of nearly
400,000, the deficit on this date was 31,400.

198. As regards supplies, the two most
pressing problems have been the provision of
fresh foodstuffs, and of petrol.

I have already mentioned that dehydrated
meat and vegetables were being supplied to
meet the inadequacy of fresh supplies. I may
add that every encouragement and assistance
is given to units to grow their own vegetables
where this is practicable. :

A Local Resources branch of the staff.
assisted by an agricultural expert borrowed
from the Government of Assam, which is
bringing some 18,000 acres under vegetable
cultivation, was established. Pig breeding,
goat rearing, and chicken farming have also
been planned on an extensive scale.

199. The supply of petro] and lubricants,
including those for aviation, has caused some
anxiety. The monthly quantities, to be supplied
through Army channels, were estimated last
May to exceed eleven and a quarter million
gallons, of which nearly half was high grade
aviation spirit.

In spite of the progressive improvement in
the capacity of our lines of communication,
which has been more than doubled since
December 1943, it has not been found possible
as yet to do more than provide the quantities
for maintenance. The ever increasing demands
of our Allies in Upper Assam have continued
to tax our oil resources. I do not foresee
much improvement in the situation until more
pipelines have been finished.
