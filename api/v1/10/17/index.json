            "description": "196. Whatever the merits of this decision, as far as I was concerned the situation to which it led had one grave disadvantage: Air Marshal Coningham, with his many commitments in the battle area, could spate few aircraft for subsidiary tasks. Instead of making sorties over the Hague expressly for the purpose of observing and harassing the firing troops, as my forces had been able to do, the Second Tactical Air Force was obliged to rely on its general programme of armed reconnaissance over the enemy’s lines of communication. This method of tackling the problem was probably right in the circumstances; but from my point of view it had several shortcomings. It left us without any means of judging the effect of so indirect a counter-measure; nor did it throw any light on what the enemy was doing at the Hague or meet our demand for visual reconnaissance of suspected areas. Indeed, from the date when the Second Tactical Air Force assumed responsibility for armed reconnaissance up to the 17th October—when this issue came to a head —we were without any report to say that pilots of that Command, while engaged on these duties, had seen or attacked anything on the ground which could be associated with longTange rockets.",

            "description": "On 17th October 2 Polish Corps, which had taken over the sector on the left of 5 Corps Previously under ro Corps (and commanded in the interim by the Headquarters of the disbanded x Armoured Division) opened an attack to improve our communications in the mountains. the minor road which leaves Route 7z at San Piero in Bagno and joins Route 67 at Rocca San Casciano, crossing the valleys of the Bidente and Rabbi. Possession of Route 67 would be of the greatest importance for improving communications between the two Armies. The Poles made good progress in the mountains. Galeata, commanding the upper Bidente valley, fell on 19th October and Strada, in the valley of the Rabbi, on the 2zst; here the enemy showed signs of an intention to resist more strongly. Meanwhile in the plains Cesena had been entered on 19th October and on the 2oth 4 Division seized a precarious but tenaciously defended bridgehead over the Savio in the neighbourhood of Route 9. Further to the south x0 Indian Division established two more bridgeheads and in the southernmost built up rapidly for an assault on Monte Cavallo, on the watershed between the Savio and the Ronco. By the 2ist there were no enemy forward of the Savio except in the coastal sector, where they still held Cervia. .",
