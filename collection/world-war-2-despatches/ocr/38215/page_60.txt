(f) Au Outer and Inner Bridgehead to be
organized for the ground defence of the
Causeway. Three battalions with supporting
arms under Brigadier Taylor were allotted
for the defence of the Outer Bridgehead and
one battalion (2 Argyll and Sutherland High-
landers) under Lt.-Col. Stewart for the
defence of the Inner Bridgehead.

393. Eastforce.—The withdrawal of East-
force was carried out according to plan with-
out enemy interference. The final withdrawal
took place in M.T. from Kota Tinggi.

394. 11 Indian Divson.—Of the Batu Pahat
Force, one contingent moved east of the road
and reached Benut on the night 27th-28th
January. The remainder, comprising about
2,000 officers and men, reached the sea ai the
mouth of the River Ponggor, From here they
were evacuated during four successive nights
by the Royal Navy and taken to Singapore.
The operation was a most difficult one and re-
flected the greatest credit on all ranks of the
Royal Navy engaged in it.

Benut was occupied by the enemy on the
morning of the 28th January but our success-
ful demolitions on this road ‘slowed up his
advance. In the evening there was contact
north of Pontian Besar. On the 2oth there
were patrol encounters in the Gunong Pulai
Reservoir area where a strong position had been
prepared. By midnight 30th-31st January the
head of the main rz Indian Division column
was following Eastforce across the Causeway,
leaving only Westforce to be withdrawn through
the bridgehead.

305. Westforce.—On the main road and rail-
way front the enemy followed up our with-
drawal energetically and much fighting took
place. The withdrawal of the two columns
required most careful co-ordination. There was
little rest for the troops who were constantly
fighting by day and moving back by night. The
enemy aircraft were particularly active on this
front reconnoitring, bombing and machine-gun-
ning. Our own troops received very little
assistance from the air.

Astride the main road a number of local
engagements were fought by the 27 Australian
Brigade Group with 2 Gordons urideér ‘com-
mand and many casualties were inflicted on
the enemy by local counter-attacks.

On the railway front disaster overtook the
9 Indian Division on the 28th January. A
wide gap developed in the Layang Layang
area between the 22 Indian Infantry Brigade,
which was forward, and the 8 Indian Infantry
Brigade which was supporting it. Into this
gap enemy troops penetrated having moved
round the eastern flank by estate roads. The
Divisional Commander (Major-General
Barstow), while moving up the railway to visit
the forward brigade, was ambushed by the
enemy and there is little doubt that he was
killed. He was a gallant and gifted officer and
his loss was a severe blow. The 22 Brigade,
in an endeavour to rejoin the division, moved
#hrough’ the jungle west of the railway. Some
parties of the enemy were met and dispersed,
the 5/11 Sikhs again distinguishing themselves,
but the dense jungle proved too much jor the
troops who were hampered by having to carry
a number of wounded. In spite of a continuous
march of thred days and nights they were un-
able to catch up and efforts to locate them by

ground and aur patrols failed. The final with-
drawal was postponed as long as possible in an
effort to recover this brigade but without
success, and arrangements were made to ferry
them across the Straits from a point east of
Johore Bahru. Eventually only about 100
were saved in this way. The remainder were
captured in the neighbourhood of Johore Bahru
on the 1st February.

The final withdrawal on the night 30th:31st
January was carried out without incident and
with little interference from the enemy’s Air
Force. At 0815 hrs. 31st January all troops
had been withdrawn and a gap of 70 feet was
blown in the Causeway.

306. The operation of withdrawing the whole
force through the bottle-neck of Johore Bahru
and over the Causeway with the enemy hold-
ing complete control in the air had been an
anxious one. In spite of the severe losses which *
we had suffered on the main-land, the success-
ful accomplishment of this operation was a
matter for much satisfaction.

SECTION XL.—AIR OPERATIONS,
JANUARY, 1942

397. During this period the Japanese Air
Striking Force concentrated their attacks
chiefly on the aerodromes on Singapore Island.
Some attacks also were made on the Naval
Base and the Docks area and some bombs fell
in the Town area. On several days the civilian
casualties ran into several hundreds., The
attacks were usually carried out in daylight by
formations of 27 Bomber aircraft escorted by
fighters. The maximum number of aircraft
which attacked the Singapore area in any one
day was 127. Our Anti-Aircraft Defence
system had naturally been weakened by the loss
of the outer part of the area covered by the
warning system. Nevertheless, with the aid of
the radar sets, it was still found possible in
most cases to obtain some warning of attack
though rarely enough for our fighters to carry
out effective interception. There was much
air fighting, especially on the 22nd January
when the losses on each side were estimated to
be about a dozen.

398. There was unfortunately no improve-
ment as regards the labour conditions on the
aerodromes. The civilian workers continued
to disappear whenever an air attack took place
and usually remained absent for some days.
In consequence, one or more of the aerodromes
on Singapore Island were almost invariably out
of use.

399. In the forward areas, the enemy air-
craft co-operated effectively with their ground
forces by reconnaissances, by attacks on our
troops and transport, and by dropping supplies
on isolated parties. On our side, as before, we
were able to give our forward troops very little
air support, but we were now able to provide
increased protection against low-flying attacks
with our ground anti-aircraft defences.

400. During this period the Singapore Air
Defence Organization was severely tested. On
the whole the organization for the control of
the Active Air Defence, which had been worked
out in the latter part of x94, worked vei
satisfactorily. The fire control of the Antt-
Aircraft Heavy Artillery also worked smoothly,
but the height of not less than 20,000 feet at
which the enemy air formations invariably flew
