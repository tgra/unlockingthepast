59. So ended a campaign of 22 days which
has proved that the offensive has once more
gained ascendency in modern war when under-
taken with an army equipped with greatly
superior material power in the shape of air
forces and armoured fighting vehicles.

The British Expeditionary Force had advanced

sixty-five miles from the frontier to the Dyle: -

then the same distance back from the Dyle to
the frontier : finally a further fifty miles to the
sea at Dunkirk. - A frontal advance had become
a flank defence ; a flank defence the defence of
a perimeter which at times exceeded one hundred
miles, with my force of nine* divisions and parts
of three semi-trained and partially equipped
divisions sent to France for labour duties.
Finally had come the witRdrawal to the sea
and the shrinkage of this wide front to the
twenty-four miles of the Dunkirk bridgehead.

The series of situations which the B.E.F. had
to face was not brought about by failure on their
part to withstand enemy attacks when holding

. a position of their own choosing :
by the enemy breaking through completely on
a front many miles away from that held by the
B.E.F. Nevertheless this break through, once
it began, was destined to involve in its ill-fated
consequences both the French 1st Army and
the B.E.F. In the withdrawal which ensued
both these armies lost the whole of their artillery
and transport.

It would not be appropriate in this Despatch

to discuss questions affecting the higher com- -

mand of the Allied forces: on these matters I
received orders from H.M. Government and
through the French commanders under whom
I was placed.

Nor is.this Despatch the place to deal at
_ length with the military lessons of the Cam-
paign; I have already conveyed my detailed
views to the proper quarter.

There are, however, certain matters which it
may be convenient to mention, in broad outline,
in this Despatch since they may serve in some
respects to amplify and to explain the narrative
ofevents. They are dealt with in the paragraphs
which follow.

The paramount importance of equipment.

‘60. It was clear from the outset that the ascen-
dency in equipment which the enemy possessed
played a great part in the operations. He was
able to place in the field and to concentrate no
less than ten armoured divisions in the area
which he selected and later, to employ at least
five of these against the British rearward de-
fences. On the other hand, the British armoured
forces in the theatre of war amounted to seven
divisional cavalry regiments equipped with
light tanks, one regiment of armoured cars of
an obsolete: pattern, and two battalions of
infantry tanks, the latter, except for twenty-
three Mark II tanks, being armed each with one
machine- “gun only.

it was caused.

Our anti-tank armament was more ample than
that of the French, but did not extend further
back than the division. No guns were available
for the defence of Corps or rearward areas or for
the three ‘‘ Pioneer ’’ divisions, except by with-
drawing weapons from the formations to which
they had been allotted in War Establishments.

These instances amongst many others which
might be quoted serve-to indicate the vital
necessity for an expeditionary force, if it is to
be used in a first-class war, being equipped on a
scale commensurate with the task it is to be
called upon to fulfil.

The days are past when armies can be ‘inenfediy
raised, equipped and placed in the field, for
modern war demands the ever increasing use of
complicated material. Indeed the scientific side
of warfare has been evolving at a very rapid rate
even since the end of the war of 1914-28 and is
continuing to do so. Modern equipment requires
time to design and produce, and once it is pro-
duced, further time is required: to train troops
in its technical and tactical uses. Improvised

ements, made at short notice, can only
lead to the shortage of essential equipment, the
production of inferior articles, and the unskilful
panding of weapons and vehicles on the battle-
field.

The Time Factor.

61. The speed with which the enemy exploited
his penetration of the French front, his willing-
ness to accept risks to further his aim, and his
exploitation of every success to the uttermost
limits emphasised, even more fully than in the
campaigns of the past, the advantage which
accrues to the commander who knows how best
to use time to make time his servant and not
his master.

Again, the pace of operations has been so
accelerated by the partnership between offensive
aircraft. and modern mechanised forces that the
reserves available for the defence are of little
use unless they are fully mobile or already in
occupation of some reserve position, For
instance, had it not been that eight Troop
Carrying Companies, R.A.S.C., were available,
the attack south of Arras could never have been
mounted, nor indeed could the flank defences on
the canal have been organised in time to forestall
the enemy.

We had already foreseen, and taught at the
Staff College, that the methods of staff duties
in the past war would prove too slow for modern
requirements. Headquarters of formations
were so frequently on the move that confer-
ences, supplemented by Operation Instructions
or messages, usually replaced the formal orders
which had been the accepted procedure in past
campaigns.

Full use was also made-of liaison officets of all
grades, who had been provided by the War
Office on a generous scale. In the period before
active operations began, they were of real value
in settling matters of detail and in reconciling
points of view which did not always at first

coincide; during the fighting they were more

often than not the actual bearers of Operation
Instructions, and performed most valuable
service to their commanders in ascertaining the
exact state of affairs in forward or flank units.
The junior ,liaison officers, known as Motor
Contact Officers, likewise showed determination
and resource in carrying out their duties.
