were scattered about on the main communica-
tions. There was a trench system at Loyada on
the frontier on the Zeilah-Jibuti road.

At this period my administrative resources
were fully stretched in the maintenance of the
two brigades of 11th (A) Division which were
engaging the Italians in the Galla Sidamo.
Administratively I could engage in no more
commitments without ceasing operations against
the Italians. Furthermore E.A. Force was not
equipped for the reduction of strong concrete
defences, neither was the Air Force sufficiently
strong in bombers, Admittedly there was a
doubt whether the six Senegalese battalions
which formed the garrison would fight. There
was therefore at least uncertainty whether an
attack om French Somaliland could be carried
out with success. There appeared no doubt
that the blockade must eventually be successful
in forcing the Governor to give in, furthermore,
by trusting to the blockade, there would bé no
need for cessation of the operations in the Galla
Sidamo. I therefore recommended that offen-
sive operations should not be undertaken
against the Vichy French, at any rate for the
present.

ror. About this time a telegram was received
from the War Office, presumably in reply to
the representations made by the Governor of
Jibuti on the subject of infant mortality, sug-
gesting that the blockade might be lifted suf-
ficiently 10 allow in milk etc. for the children.
I felt that strict supervision of any relaxation
of the blockade would be most difficult to en-
sure without contact and negotiations which I
felt were most undesirable at that time. More
over I was sure that any relaxation of the
blockade occurring immediately after the receipt
of the Governor’s reply to General Wavell’s
letter would thave an unfortunate effect in
strengthening the former’s position. He ob-
viously would take steps to gain full propaganda
value on these lines. I therefore telegraphed
to General ‘Wavell an alternative proposal to
make an offer of evacuation of all white women
and children to Madagascar or other Vichy
French place. In due course I was authorised
to make this offer.

102. Meanwhile the Governor of Jibuti had
addressed letters both to General Wavell and
myself to the effect that he had received instruc-
tions that should French Somaliland be reduced
by either blockade or direct invasion he was
to destroy all facilities which might be of value
to the invader. General Wavell replied to this
letter to the effect that from the purely military
point of view Jibuti was of no consequence to
him. If the Governor destroyed the port and
railway he would merely make it impossible to
feed his own nationals and prevent, or at any
rate delay, the evacuation of Italian women and
children from Abyssinia. ;

In due course a reply was received from
Jibuti in which the Governor indicated that he
took General Wavell’s letter as an invitation
to open negotiations on a wide scale for the
evacuation of the Italian women and children
and the relief of Jibuti. I was authorised to
reply that General Wavell had given no such
invitation and that his intentions remained as
notified in the letter summarised in para. 97.

Addis Abeba E.A. Force, besides capturing

Dessie and assisting in the fall of Amba Alagi,
has now completed its task of securing the
capitulation of all enemy forces in the whole
area lying south and inclusive of Assab-Dessie-
Bethor.

The area over which these final operations
took place was 125,000 square miles, and
although, due to the weather conditions, the
tempo of the early part of the campaign could
not be maintained, the time taken to complete
the task cannot be regarded as unsatisfactory.
The latter part of the operations was carried
out entirely by East and West African infantry,
though South Africa supplied most of the sup-
porting arms. In spite of the continuous wet
and cold weather the morale and dash of all
troops remained unabated, though the physical
difficulties caused by mud and demolitions
demanded great endurance. It may again be
stated that according to popular belief the
campaigning season im Northern Abyssinia
should have terminated at the end of May, and
in Southern Abyssinia by the end of March.
The fighting was the toughest yet experienced,
due to the naturally strong defensive posi-
tions which abounded in the area, to the
greater number of supporting arms, fields guns,
medium guns and tanks which were available
to the enemy, and also the tougher fibre of
some of the Italian commanders. These had
at last learnt that the true form of defence
against the type of attack which we made,
lay in the counter-attack with mobile troops
rather than in their previous methods of with-
drawal into wired perimeters. Though the
East and West African troops met the enemy
medium tank, the Mark II, for the first time,
after the first uncertainty they were not dis-
mayed and showed confidence in their defence
against these vehicles.

104. Mention must be made of the artillery
of which all but the light batteries were South
African units. The extreme shortage in this arm
(only 24 field guns) entailed frequent moves
over long distances so as to give the greatest
concentration of fire at the decisive points, yet
the guns always arrived on time. Their action
in silencing the enemy guns, often from most
exposed positions was without doubt instru-
mental in most cases in enabling the infantry
to get forward, and in some of the battles
artillery action alone caused the enemy to
vacate their positions.

105. The nature of the country, steep,
rugged, with deep canyon-like ravines and
broad swift flowing rivers, lent itself to exten-
sive and effective demolitions. The work of
the R.E. units, the greater portion of which
were also South African, in the rapid construc-
tion of bridges and repair of roads was beyond
praise. Had there been any greater delay
imposed on the advance than was in fact the
case, there is every doubt whether our troops
would have been able to close with the enemy
and finally liquidate him before the really
heavy rains set in.

106. In the early part of the campaign much
success had attended the use of propaganda
leaflets scattered from the air. The capture
of an excellent printing press, capable of
printing in all Jocal languages, in Addis Abeba
greatly specded up the process of getting out
“hot ’? news by leaflet and many thousands
of these were dropped almost daily. Of a total
of 7,300,000 pamphlets dropped 3,500,000
