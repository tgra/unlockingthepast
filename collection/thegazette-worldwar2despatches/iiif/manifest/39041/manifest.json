The severe\n\n’ Arctic weather added to their- navigational\n\ndifficulties during winter months, but they ran\na greater risk of attack between March and\nSeptember owing to the continuous daylight\nof the Far Northern summer.

The air attacks started in the afternoon\nwith a. diversion by six bombers, followed\nimmediately by a massed attack by forty to\nfifty torpedo aircraft, each cartying two\ntorpedoes. This attack came in low, and little\nmore than visual warning was obtained, with\nthe result that the fighters were caught out of\nposition, chasing bombers and shadowers.

As a result of his experience on the first\nday, the Commanding Officer,\n.

This system, though it\ndid not give the fighters time to prevent an\nattack from developing, did ensure that they\nshould harass its final stages, disturbing the\nenemy and spoiling his aim.\n\n46. Combined with the greater accuracy of\nanti-aircraft gunfire, which came with experi-\nence, the new tactics proved successful. Two\nheavy torpedo attacks, by twenty-two and\ntwenty-five aircraft respectively, and two bomb-\ning attacks, all on 14th September, succeeded\nonly in sinking one merchant ship ; and a pro-\n\n. longed attack by about seventy bombers on\nthe next day was entirely. without success.\nDuring the whole period, just over two days,\nof concentrated air attack, the enemy lost at\nleast forty aircraft: there can be little doubt\n\nthat these heavy casualties, especially among,\n\nhis limited supply of really skilled torpedo\npilots, was largely responsible for the steady\ndecline in the size and vigour of his attacks.\n\n47. The AVENGER, whose flying deck is\nfoo small for landing on when the ship is pitch-\ning, was fortunate in having calm weather\nthroughout the operation. The precaution of\nattaching two Hunt class destroyers to the\nAVENGER, for her close protection, proved\nits value. Several attacks were directed\nespecially at her, but she suffered no damage.\n\n48. No more air attacks were made on\nP.Q.18 while the destroyer covering force was\nin company, but off Cape Kanin, near the\nentrance to the White Sea, three further attacks\nsucceeded in sinking one more ship. .

The westbound convoy of sixteen\nmerchant ships, escorted by two Hunt class\ndestroyers, two anti-aircraft ships, four\ncorvettes, three minesweepers and four trawlers,\nsailed from Archangel on 13th September.\nThey were. routed east of P.Q.18 to pass that\nconvoy in approximate Jatitude 73° 30’ North,\noff Nova Zemlya. Here, Rear Admiral Com-\nmanding, Home Fleet Destroyers with his six-\nteen destroyers, the AVENGER arid her two\nHunt class destroyers, and the two convoy\noilers, transferred in three groups from P.Q.18\nto Q.P.14 during the night of 16th/17th\nSeptember.\n\n50. The latter convoy had been sighted\nearlier by German aircraft, but the weather was\nnow thick and no shadowers were present to\nwitness the transfer.

But the convoy was located\nagain by two. enemy aircraft on the morning\nof 19th September, and the U-boat pack joined\nup again during the day.\n\n51. Rear Admiral Commanding, Home Fleet\nDestroyers had decided not to weaken the\nescort by going again to Lowe Sound to refuel.\nHe had detached two destroyers to bring one\noiler from there to join the convoy, and to\norder the other, with her escort, to return to\nIceland. One ship, which had straggled soon\nafter leaving the White Sea, rejoined; and\nanother straggler was collected by a destroyer\ndetached from the convoy and escorted to join\nthe Spitzbergen oiler force. ,\n\n52. No air attacks developed, but the U-boat\npack, whose performance so far had been\nmediocre, made a final effort to redeem their\nfailure. In spite of vigorous counter-attacks\nby the powerful escort, they succeeded in sink-\ning the minesweeper LEDA (Commander\nA. H.

Of the thirteen east-\nbound ships, five reached Archangel, four were\nsunk, one ran aground near South Cape, Spitz-\nbergen, and three returned to Iceland. Only\nfour westbound ships were sailed, of which\nthree arrived safely at Akureyri: the fourth\nwas recalled when it became apparent that there\nwas considerable enemy activity in the Barents\nSea, but failed to get the signal and was sunk.\nA fifth westbound Russian ship was sailed on\n14th November,: just ahead of Q.P.15, and\natrived safely. The Russians thereafter con-\ntinued to sail ships independently in the\nintervals between convoys: four more were\nsailed late in November and fifteen in\nDecember: all arrived without loss.\n\nQPAS\n5. The operations for the occupation of\nFrench North Africa left too few-ships in the\nHome Fleet-to provide escorts on the earlier\nscale ; but the light and ice conditions, more\nfavourable than at any other time of the year,\nand the withdrawal of much of the German Air\nForce in Northern Norway offered opportunities\nfor more lightly escorted convoys. It was there-\nfore decided to resume this traffic in mid-\n* November with a westbound convoy from the\nWhite Sea.\n\n6. As the passagé would be made in almost\ncontinuous darkness, and foul weather could\nalso be expected, I requested that the convoy\nshould be limited to twenty ships, but\nthe Admiralty directed that thirty ships\nshould be included. It -sailed on 17th\nNovember, escorted by five minesweepers,\nfour corvettes, one trawler and one\nA.A. ship; and was to be reinforced in the\nBarents Sea by five destroyers under the com-\nmand of Captain (D), 8th Destroyer Flotilla,\nrelieved by five others from a position west\nof Bear Island. The Rear Admiral Com-\nmanding, Ist Cruiser Squadron*, in the\nLONDON, with the SUFFOLK and ‘three\n\ndestroyers, provided surface cover west of Bear-\n\nIsland. One Russian and three British sub-\nmarines operated off the exits from Altenfiord,\nto deter the HEPPER and KOLN from sailing.\n\n_ 7%. The convoy met a succession of gales\n\nthroughout its passage. These, with the almost\ncomplete lack of daylight, caused it to become\nvery scattered. Neither destroyer force\nsucceeded in making contact with the main\nbody ; and by the time the convoy had passed\nBear Island, it and its escort had broken up\ninto a number of small groups, spread over a\nlarge area and without knowledge of each\nother’s whereabouts. The route was adjusted\nto pass south of Bear Island and avoid the\nnormal U-boat concentration between there\nand Spitzbergen, but many ships did not\nreceive the amending signal. :\n\n8. In the absence of air reconnaissance, for\nwhich the weather was quite unsuitable, the\nenemy was presumably even more lacking in\nknowledge of the situation than ourselves. Of\nthe thirty ships which sailed, twenty-seven\n\nAdmiralty footnote :— :\n* Rear Admiral L, H. K. Hamilton, D.S.O.\n\n5151\n\narrived safely in Icelandic waters, one returned\nto Kola Inlet and two were sunk, both probably\nby U-boats. The safe arrivals were rounded\nup and taken straight on in two convoys to\nLoch Ewe.\n\nMid-winter Policy\n9. From late November to mid-January the\n\n‘lack of daylight is such that air reconnaissance\n\nin the Arctic is virtually impossible. Provided\nthat a convoy is of such a size that it can\nbe handled and kept together, it therefore\nstands an excellent chance of evading both\nU-boat and surface attack, and even of com-\npleting the passage without the enemy know-\ning of its existence. A large convoy, on the\nother hand, is likely to fail to keep in company\nand to split, as did Q.P.15, into a large number\nof small groups, covering a vast area and un-\naware of each other’s position or composition.\nSuch small groups would be more liable to\ndetection by U-boats than a single concentrated\nconvoy, and would present the enemy surface\nforces with an ideal opportunity for an offen-\nsive sweep. Our own covering forces are\nalways handicapped by having to identify a\nradar contact before they are free to attack:\nthe enemy need not do so. The splitting of\nthe convoy into a large number of scattered\nunits would greatly add to this handicap.\n\n10. It was obviously advantageous to. run\nthrough as many ships as possible during this\nshort dark period, rather than to defer our\ncommitments until air reconnaissance could\nstart again. Though it would be impossible\nto provide strong surface escort for a large\nnuniber of small convoys, the chances of\nevasion were, in my opinion, so good that the\ntisk of interception by superior surface forces\nshould be accepted.\n\n11. I had asked that about six merchant\nships, escorted by three trawlers, should be\nheld ready in Iceland to sail shortly before the\narrival of Q.P.15. if the U-boats were drawn\nout of position by that convoy; but the\nAdmiralty did not approve this suggestion.\nThey proposed instead to wait until 22nd\nDecember and then to sail a convoy of thirty-\none ships, with an escort of summer dimen-\nsions. The experience of Q.P.15 confirmed —\nmy opinion that a convoy of this size could\nnot be handled: the Admiralty proposal, more-\nover, would waste the first half of the dark\nperiod,\n\n12. I therefore signalled my intention on\n25th November to limit the convoy in size and\nasked that the assembly of the first ten ships\nmight be hastened. This small convoy was to\nbe escorted by four destroyers from the Home\nFleet and any minesweepers and trawlers\nwhich could be made available. The\nAdmiralty, however, insisted in their reply of\n26th November that it was essential to provide\na covering force strong enough to deal with\nthe scale of attack which they expected, and\nconsidered that the only alternatives were\neither to sail thirty ships in company, or in\nthree groups so close together that one force\ncould cover all three. After.further discussion,\nincluding a visit to London by my Chief of\nStaff, I was directed to sail the convoy in two\nparts of sixteen ships each, escorted by seven\ndestroyers and some smaller craft; and the\nHome Fleet’ was reinforced by two 6-inch\n",

Of the thirteen east-\nbound ships, five reached Archangel, four were\nsunk, one ran aground near South Cape, Spitz-\nbergen, and three returned to Iceland. Only\nfour westbound ships were sailed, of which\nthree arrived safely at Akureyri: the fourth\nwas recalled when it became apparent that there\nwas considerable enemy activity in the Barents\nSea, but failed to get the signal and was sunk.\nA fifth westbound Russian ship was sailed on\n14th November,: just ahead of Q.P.15, and\natrived safely. The Russians thereafter con-\ntinued to sail ships independently in the\nintervals between convoys: four more were\nsailed late in November and fifteen in\nDecember: all arrived without loss.\n\nQPAS\n5. The operations for the occupation of\nFrench North Africa left too few-ships in the\nHome Fleet-to provide escorts on the earlier\nscale ; but the light and ice conditions, more\nfavourable than at any other time of the year,\nand the withdrawal of much of the German Air\nForce in Northern Norway offered opportunities\nfor more lightly escorted convoys. It was there-\nfore decided to resume this traffic in mid-\n* November with a westbound convoy from the\nWhite Sea.\n\n6. As the passagé would be made in almost\ncontinuous darkness, and foul weather could\nalso be expected, I requested that the convoy\nshould be limited to twenty ships, but\nthe Admiralty directed that thirty ships\nshould be included. It -sailed on 17th\nNovember, escorted by five minesweepers,\nfour corvettes, one trawler and one\nA.A. ship; and was to be reinforced in the\nBarents Sea by five destroyers under the com-\nmand of Captain (D), 8th Destroyer Flotilla,\nrelieved by five others from a position west\nof Bear Island. The Rear Admiral Com-\nmanding, Ist Cruiser Squadron*, in the\nLONDON, with the SUFFOLK and ‘three\n\ndestroyers, provided surface cover west of Bear-\n\nIsland. One Russian and three British sub-\nmarines operated off the exits from Altenfiord,\nto deter the HEPPER and KOLN from sailing.\n\n_ 7%. The convoy met a succession of gales\n\nthroughout its passage. These, with the almost\ncomplete lack of daylight, caused it to become\nvery scattered. Neither destroyer force\nsucceeded in making contact with the main\nbody ; and by the time the convoy had passed\nBear Island, it and its escort had broken up\ninto a number of small groups, spread over a\nlarge area and without knowledge of each\nother’s whereabouts. The route was adjusted\nto pass south of Bear Island and avoid the\nnormal U-boat concentration between there\nand Spitzbergen, but many ships did not\nreceive the amending signal. :\n\n8. In the absence of air reconnaissance, for\nwhich the weather was quite unsuitable, the\nenemy was presumably even more lacking in\nknowledge of the situation than ourselves. Of\nthe thirty ships which sailed, twenty-seven\n\nAdmiralty footnote :— :\n* Rear Admiral L, H. K. Hamilton, D.S.O.\n\n5151\n\narrived safely in Icelandic waters, one returned\nto Kola Inlet and two were sunk, both probably\nby U-boats. The safe arrivals were rounded\nup and taken straight on in two convoys to\nLoch Ewe.\n\nMid-winter Policy\n9. From late November to mid-January the\n\n‘lack of daylight is such that air reconnaissance\n\nin the Arctic is virtually impossible. Provided\nthat a convoy is of such a size that it can\nbe handled and kept together, it therefore\nstands an excellent chance of evading both\nU-boat and surface attack, and even of com-\npleting the passage without the enemy know-\ning of its existence. A large convoy, on the\nother hand, is likely to fail to keep in company\nand to split, as did Q.P.15, into a large number\nof small groups, covering a vast area and un-\naware of each other’s position or composition.\nSuch small groups would be more liable to\ndetection by U-boats than a single concentrated\nconvoy, and would present the enemy surface\nforces with an ideal opportunity for an offen-\nsive sweep. Our own covering forces are\nalways handicapped by having to identify a\nradar contact before they are free to attack:\nthe enemy need not do so. The splitting of\nthe convoy into a large number of scattered\nunits would greatly add to this handicap.\n\n10. It was obviously advantageous to. run\nthrough as many ships as possible during this\nshort dark period, rather than to defer our\ncommitments until air reconnaissance could\nstart again. Though it would be impossible\nto provide strong surface escort for a large\nnuniber of small convoys, the chances of\nevasion were, in my opinion, so good that the\ntisk of interception by superior surface forces\nshould be accepted.\n\n11. I had asked that about six merchant\nships, escorted by three trawlers, should be\nheld ready in Iceland to sail shortly before the\narrival of Q.P.15. if the U-boats were drawn\nout of position by that convoy; but the\nAdmiralty did not approve this suggestion.\nThey proposed instead to wait until 22nd\nDecember and then to sail a convoy of thirty-\none ships, with an escort of summer dimen-\nsions. The experience of Q.P.15 confirmed —\nmy opinion that a convoy of this size could\nnot be handled: the Admiralty proposal, more-\nover, would waste the first half of the dark\nperiod,\n\n12. I therefore signalled my intention on\n25th November to limit the convoy in size and\nasked that the assembly of the first ten ships\nmight be hastened. This small convoy was to\nbe escorted by four destroyers from the Home\nFleet and any minesweepers and trawlers\nwhich could be made available. The\nAdmiralty, however, insisted in their reply of\n26th November that it was essential to provide\na covering force strong enough to deal with\nthe scale of attack which they expected, and\nconsidered that the only alternatives were\neither to sail thirty ships in company, or in\nthree groups so close together that one force\ncould cover all three. After.further discussion,\nincluding a visit to London by my Chief of\nStaff, I was directed to sail the convoy in two\nparts of sixteen ships each, escorted by seven\ndestroyers and some smaller craft; and the\nHome Fleet’ was reinforced by two 6-inch\n",

Knot convoys are a serious menace to cover-\ning cruisers so far from their base. The experi-\nence of the past year, and especially the loss\nof the EDINBURGH, had underlined this risk.\nAfter balancing it against the risk of surface\nattack, my intention had been that the 6-inch\ncruisers, if they became available, should pro-\nvide cover as far as 25° East and then\nreturn to Iceland. The Admiralty, however,\nwere insistent that the cruisers should cover\n‘the convoys right through to Kola ; this insist-\nence was fully justified in the event, for other-\nwise the cruiser force would probably not have\nbeen present at the action on New Year’s Eve.\n\nIWSIA.\n\n14, For security reasons, the titles of the\nconvoys were changed from P.Q. and Q.P. to\nJ.W. and R.A., both starting with the number\n51. The first sixteen ships were assembled at\nLoch Ewe on 15th December. So that no\nmore time should be wasted, it was decided to\nsail them direct from there, followed a week\nlater by the next sixteen, all routed east of\nthe Faroes. -\n\n15. The first group, J.W.S1A, was escorted\nfrom Loch Ewe by three Hunt class destroyers,\none minesweeper, two corvettes and two\ntrawlers, the Hunts being relieved north-east\nof Iceland by seven destroyers under Captain\n(D), 8th Destroyer Flotilla from Seidisfiord.\n‘The Rear Admiral (D), Home Fleet* in the\nSHEFFIELD, with the JAMAICA, OPPOR-\nTUNE and MATCHLESS, was to provide\ncover to the vicinity of Iceland, enter Seidis-\nfiord to refuel and again provide cover from\n15° East: but low visibility prevented the\ncruisers from getting into Seidisfiord, ‘so the\ntwo destroyers were detached to fuel and join\nthe close escort, while the Rear Admiral (D)\nproceeded with the cruisers.\n\n16.

Only fourteen ships were ready for the\nnext convoy, J.W.51B, which left Loch Ewe on\n22nd December with an escort similar to its\npredecessor. The BULLDOG, on passage to\nSeidisfiord, suffered severe weather damage ; so\nCaptain (D), 17th Destroyer Flotilla had\nonly six destroyers in company when he sailed\nfrom there to join the convoy.

A westbound convoy, R.A.51, of thirteen\nships, with the escort from J.W.51A, left Kola\nInlet on 30th December. The Rear Admiral\n(D), Home Fleet, with his cruiser force, was to\ncover both these convoys in the Barents Sea and\nsubsequently, if fuel permitted, to return’ to\nSéidisfiord.\n\n_20. The first part of the passage of J.W.51B\nwas without incident, though it is possible that\nthe convoy was sighted by enemy aircraft on\n24th December. The ORIBI had a gyro\ncompass failure and lost touch on 28th: after\nsearching for twenty-four hours she failed to\nregain contact, and proceeded independently to\nKola. During that night a gale arose and the\nport wing column of the convoy lost touch:\n\ne B LE was detached to search for\nthese ships and the VIZALMA, stationed\nastern of the column, also lost touch with the\nmain body. Neither of these rejoined the con-\nvoy, but three of the merchant ships later\nsucceeded in doing so. :\n\nSurface. Action :\n\n21.

The experi-\nence of the past year, and especially the loss\nof the EDINBURGH, had underlined this risk.\nAfter balancing it against the risk of surface\nattack, my intention had been that the 6-inch\ncruisers, if they became available, should pro-\nvide cover as far as 25° East and then\nreturn to Iceland. The Admiralty, however,\nwere insistent that the cruisers should cover\n‘the convoys right through to Kola ; this insist-\nence was fully justified in the event, for other-\nwise the cruiser force would probably not have\nbeen present at the action on New Year’s Eve.\n\nIWSIA.\n\n14, For security reasons, the titles of the\nconvoys were changed from P.Q. and Q.P. to\nJ.W. and R.A., both starting with the number\n51.

So that no\nmore time should be wasted, it was decided to\nsail them direct from there, followed a week\nlater by the next sixteen, all routed east of\nthe Faroes. -\n\n15. The first group, J.W.S1A, was escorted\nfrom Loch Ewe by three Hunt class destroyers,\none minesweeper, two corvettes and two\ntrawlers, the Hunts being relieved north-east\nof Iceland by seven destroyers under Captain\n(D), 8th Destroyer Flotilla from Seidisfiord.\n‘The Rear Admiral (D), Home Fleet* in the\nSHEFFIELD, with the JAMAICA, OPPOR-\nTUNE and MATCHLESS, was to provide\ncover to the vicinity of Iceland, enter Seidis-\nfiord to refuel and again provide cover from\n15° East: but low visibility prevented the\ncruisers from getting into Seidisfiord, ‘so the\ntwo destroyers were detached to fuel and join\nthe close escort, while the Rear Admiral (D)\nproceeded with the cruisers.\n\n16.

Only fourteen ships were ready for the\nnext convoy, J.W.51B, which left Loch Ewe on\n22nd December with an escort similar to its\npredecessor. The BULLDOG, on passage to\nSeidisfiord, suffered severe weather damage ; so\nCaptain (D), 17th Destroyer Flotilla had\nonly six destroyers in company when he sailed\nfrom there to join the convoy.

A westbound convoy, R.A.51, of thirteen\nships, with the escort from J.W.51A, left Kola\nInlet on 30th December. The Rear Admiral\n(D), Home Fleet, with his cruiser force, was to\ncover both these convoys in the Barents Sea and\nsubsequently, if fuel permitted, to return’ to\nSéidisfiord.\n\n_20. The first part of the passage of J.W.51B\nwas without incident, though it is possible that\nthe convoy was sighted by enemy aircraft on\n24th December. The ORIBI had a gyro\ncompass failure and lost touch on 28th: after\nsearching for twenty-four hours she failed to\nregain contact, and proceeded independently to\nKola. During that night a gale arose and the\nport wing column of the convoy lost touch:\n\ne B LE was detached to search for\nthese ships and the VIZALMA, stationed\nastern of the column, also lost touch with the\nmain body. Neither of these rejoined the con-\nvoy, but three of the merchant ships later\nsucceeded in doing so. :\n\nSurface. Action :\n\n21. At 0830 on New Year's Eve, the situation\nwas therefore as follows. The convoy, now re-\nduced to twelve ships, was on, an easterly\ncourse, about 220 miles north-north-west of\nthe Kola Inlet and 13 miles south of its ordered\nroute.

Before the other destroyers had joined,\nthe ONSLOW sighted a large ship to the north-\nwestward, coming towards her at high speed.\nThis was probably the HIPPER. She turned\neast and opened fire on the ACHATES, who\nwas very conspicuous because. of her smoke\nscreen. The ONSLOW immediately opened\nfire, at 9,000 yards, and turned to a course\n\nparallel to the enemy to keep between her and .\n\nthe convoy. The other three “O” class\ndestroyers were now joining and the enemy re-\ntired to the northward under smoke, firing a\nfew salvos at the convoy as she did so.\n\n26. Captain (D), 17th Destroyer Flotilla\nconcluded that the enemy was unwilling to\nface the risk of torpedo attack by our\ndestroyers and for the next 25 minutes he made\nuse of this fact. He detached the OBEDIENT\nand OBDURATE to close the convoy and in-\ncrease its protection against any attempt by the\nenemy deéstroyers to attack ; and himself in the\nONSLOW, with the ORWELL in company,\nconducted an intermittent action with the\nHIPPER, scoring several hits and preventing\nher from coming any closer to the convoy. At\n1020, However, the ONSLOW was hit four\ntimes in rapid succession. and suffered con-\nsiderable damage. A and B guns were put out\nof action and fire broke out in the fore super-\n\nstructure and messdeck, the main aerials and |\n\nboth radar sets were destroyed, the engine room\nholed, and Captain (D) was severely wounded\nin thé face, disabling the left eye so that he\ncould not see, In spite of this severe handicap\nhe continued to direct the flotilla and his ship\nuntil compelled to disengage the ONSLOW as\na result of a further hit. Only after receiving\nTeports that the hole in his engine room was\nplugged, that the main engines and steering gear\nwere still efficient and that OBEDIENT had\ntaken charge of the destroyers in accordance\nwith his signalled instructions did he consent\nto leave his bridge to receive medical attention.\nFrom his sea cabin he continued to receive\nteports of the action and to advise Lieutenant\n‘Commander T. J. G. Marchant, R.N., who\nassumed command of the ONSLOW.*\n\nAdmiralty foo!note :-—~*\n\nbd Certain (D), 17th Destroyer Flotilla, Captain R.\nSt. Sherbrooke, D.S.0., R.N., was ” subsequently\nSwarded the V.C. for his conduct on this occasion. «\n\n5153\n\n27: Rear Admiral (D) meanwhile, away to\nthe northward, had at 0858 obtained radar con-\ntact on a ship to the north-westward of his\nforce. ‘While closing to identify this echo he\nsighted at 0932 gun flashes over the horizon to\nthe southward, but considered that they were\nH.A. fire. The echo was the VIZALMA and\nher merchant vessel ; but before they could be\nidentified as such, the gunfire to the south- .\nward increased and an enemy report was\nreceived from Captain (D) 17. Course was\naltered to close and speed worked up to 31\nknots.\n\n28. About 1030, soon after the ONSLOW\nhad suffered her damage, two ships were de-\ntected by SHEFFIELD’s radar, one bearing\n180° and the other 140°, both on an easterly\ncourse. From’ subsequent examination of the\nteports it apears probable (but by no means\ncertain) that the former was the HIPPER and\nthe latter the LUTZOW, some miles ahead of\nher. Although both ships came in sight soon\nafter’and Were seen to be larger than destroyers,\nand therefore enemy; it was impossible to_\nidentify them precisely: Rear Admiral (D)\ntherefore altered to the eastward to allow the\nradar action -plot to become clearer*.\n\n29. After the cruisers had been on this course\nfor about 20 minutes, the leading enemy ship\n(probably LUTZOW) altered to starboard to-\nwards the convoy and Rear Admiral (D) turned\ntowards the other, who soon followed her con-\nsort to the southward. The SHEFFIELD and\nJAMAICA opened fire on this second ship\n(probably HIPPER) and appeared to take her\ncompletely by surprise, as she failed to reply\ntill after the SHEFFIELD’s fourth salvo. Hits\nwere seen almost at once and the enemy\nappeared to alter towards under cover of\nsmoke. While the SHEFFIELD was starting\nto conform, a destroyer was suddenly sighted\nfine on the bow and fire was shifted to this new\ntarget. She was hit at once and repeatedly,\nand left in a sinking condition. The Germans\nlater admitted the loss of this destroyer. The\nJAMAICA meanwhile was engaging another\ndestroyer, which turned away and was lost to\nview.\n\n30.. During this action the radar had con-\ntinued to track the original target (probably .\nHIPPER), and as soon as it was over the chase\nwas resumed. She was sighted again at 1215\nand soon after two destroyers and the second\nlarge ship (probably LUTZOW) came in sight,\nall steering to the westward. The last named\nship had probably made a wider sweep to the\neast and south than her consort and sank the\nBRAMBLE in the course of it; for a report\nwas received from the BRAMBLE of an enemy\ncruiser, and an engagement was seen in her\nprobable direction between a heavy ship and\na much smaller one which fired a single gun\nand pom-pom tracer. At 1045 an enemy ship\nfrom the north-eastward came in sight of the\nOBEDIENT, and the destroyers protecting the\nconvoy once more went into action. It is not\npossible definitely to establish which ship this\nwas: there is some evidence to suggest that it\nwas a third heavy ship, possibly a 6-inch\ncruiser, or it may have been the LUTZOW.\n\n31.

The sky was mostly covered with\nlow cloud ; wind W.N.W. force 3; sea slight\n- with no swell... There were 16 degrees of frost,\nand ice on all ships.\n\n24, The HYDERABAD, on the. starboard\nquarter of the convoy; sighted two destroyers\n(ater seen to be three) bearing 180° at\n0820: she thought they were Russian destroyers\ncoming to reinforce the escort and did not re-\nport them: but they:-were sighted and reported\nsoon afterwards by the OBDURATE, stationed\non the starboard beam of the convoy. She\nclosed them at best speed and they retired to\nthe north-westward, across the stern of the con-\nvoy, opening fire at 0930 on the OBDURATE,\nwho retired on the convoy. ptain (D),\n17th Destroyer Flotilla, from stent altered.\ndown the port side of the convoy and ordered\nthe destroyers tq concentrate. While the\n\nORWELL, OBEDIENT and OBDURATE\n\n‘were moving to comply, the ACHATES, whose\nStation was on the port quarter, started to lay\na smoke screen to cover the convoy, which\nmade an emergency turn to 135°.\n\n25. Before the other destroyers had joined,\nthe ONSLOW sighted a large ship to the north-\nwestward, coming towards her at high speed.\nThis was probably the HIPPER. She turned\neast and opened fire on the ACHATES, who\nwas very conspicuous because. of her smoke\nscreen. The ONSLOW immediately opened\nfire, at 9,000 yards, and turned to a course\n\nparallel to the enemy to keep between her and .\n\nthe convoy. The other three “O” class\ndestroyers were now joining and the enemy re-\ntired to the northward under smoke, firing a\nfew salvos at the convoy as she did so.\n\n26. Captain (D), 17th Destroyer Flotilla\nconcluded that the enemy was unwilling to\nface the risk of torpedo attack by our\ndestroyers and for the next 25 minutes he made\nuse of this fact. He detached the OBEDIENT\nand OBDURATE to close the convoy and in-\ncrease its protection against any attempt by the\nenemy deéstroyers to attack ; and himself in the\nONSLOW, with the ORWELL in company,\nconducted an intermittent action with the\nHIPPER, scoring several hits and preventing\nher from coming any closer to the convoy. At\n1020, However, the ONSLOW was hit four\ntimes in rapid succession. and suffered con-\nsiderable damage. A and B guns were put out\nof action and fire broke out in the fore super-\n\nstructure and messdeck, the main aerials and |\n\nboth radar sets were destroyed, the engine room\nholed, and Captain (D) was severely wounded\nin thé face, disabling the left eye so that he\ncould not see, In spite of this severe handicap\nhe continued to direct the flotilla and his ship\nuntil compelled to disengage the ONSLOW as\na result of a further hit. Only after receiving\nTeports that the hole in his engine room was\nplugged, that the main engines and steering gear\nwere still efficient and that OBEDIENT had\ntaken charge of the destroyers in accordance\nwith his signalled instructions did he consent\nto leave his bridge to receive medical attention.\nFrom his sea cabin he continued to receive\nteports of the action and to advise Lieutenant\n‘Commander T. J. G. Marchant, R.N., who\nassumed command of the ONSLOW.*\n\nAdmiralty foo!note :-—~*\n\nbd Certain (D), 17th Destroyer Flotilla, Captain R.\nSt. Sherbrooke, D.S.0., R.N., was ” subsequently\nSwarded the V.C. for his conduct on this occasion. «\n\n5153\n\n27: Rear Admiral (D) meanwhile, away to\nthe northward, had at 0858 obtained radar con-\ntact on a ship to the north-westward of his\nforce. ‘While closing to identify this echo he\nsighted at 0932 gun flashes over the horizon to\nthe southward, but considered that they were\nH.A. fire. The echo was the VIZALMA and\nher merchant vessel ; but before they could be\nidentified as such, the gunfire to the south- .\nward increased and an enemy report was\nreceived from Captain (D) 17. Course was\naltered to close and speed worked up to 31\nknots.\n\n28. About 1030, soon after the ONSLOW\nhad suffered her damage, two ships were de-\ntected by SHEFFIELD’s radar, one bearing\n180° and the other 140°, both on an easterly\ncourse. From’ subsequent examination of the\nteports it apears probable (but by no means\ncertain) that the former was the HIPPER and\nthe latter the LUTZOW, some miles ahead of\nher. Although both ships came in sight soon\nafter’and Were seen to be larger than destroyers,\nand therefore enemy; it was impossible to_\nidentify them precisely: Rear Admiral (D)\ntherefore altered to the eastward to allow the\nradar action -plot to become clearer*.\n\n29. After the cruisers had been on this course\nfor about 20 minutes, the leading enemy ship\n(probably LUTZOW) altered to starboard to-\nwards the convoy and Rear Admiral (D) turned\ntowards the other, who soon followed her con-\nsort to the southward. The SHEFFIELD and\nJAMAICA opened fire on this second ship\n(probably HIPPER) and appeared to take her\ncompletely by surprise, as she failed to reply\ntill after the SHEFFIELD’s fourth salvo. Hits\nwere seen almost at once and the enemy\nappeared to alter towards under cover of\nsmoke. While the SHEFFIELD was starting\nto conform, a destroyer was suddenly sighted\nfine on the bow and fire was shifted to this new\ntarget. She was hit at once and repeatedly,\nand left in a sinking condition. The Germans\nlater admitted the loss of this destroyer. The\nJAMAICA meanwhile was engaging another\ndestroyer, which turned away and was lost to\nview.\n\n30.. During this action the radar had con-\ntinued to track the original target (probably .\nHIPPER), and as soon as it was over the chase\nwas resumed. She was sighted again at 1215\nand soon after two destroyers and the second\nlarge ship (probably LUTZOW) came in sight,\nall steering to the westward. The last named\nship had probably made a wider sweep to the\neast and south than her consort and sank the\nBRAMBLE in the course of it; for a report\nwas received from the BRAMBLE of an enemy\ncruiser, and an engagement was seen in her\nprobable direction between a heavy ship and\na much smaller one which fired a single gun\nand pom-pom tracer. At 1045 an enemy ship\nfrom the north-eastward came in sight of the\nOBEDIENT, and the destroyers protecting the\nconvoy once more went into action. It is not\npossible definitely to establish which ship this\nwas: there is some evidence to suggest that it\nwas a third heavy ship, possibly a 6-inch\ncruiser, or it may have been the LUTZOW.\n\n31. Since the Commanding Officer, H.M.S.\nOBEDIENT -had taken command and the\nAdmiralty footnote :—\n\n* The enemy force was in fact Lurzow, Hiprer and\nsix large destroyers, one of which was sunk,\n",

That an enemy force of at least one\npocket battleship, one heavy cruiser and. six\ndestroyers, with all the advantage of surprise\nand concentration, should be held off for four\nhours by five destroyers and driven from the\narea by two 6-inch cruisers, without any loss to\nthe convoy, is most creditable and_ satisfactory.\n\nAdditional Cover.\n\n37. Though full information of the progress\nof this action did not become available till later,\nit was evident that the cruiser force was unlikely\nto have enough fuel remaining to cover R.A.51\nthroughout the dangerous part of its passage.\nI therefore put to sea in the KING GEORGE\nV, with the HOWE, KENT, BERWICK, BER-\nMUDA and six destroyers, to give additional .\ncover. The weather limited the speed of the\ndestroyers, so the Rear Admiral Commanding,\n1st Cruiser Squadron was detached with the\ntwo heavy cruisers:to proceed at best speed to\na covering position south-west of Bear Island ;\nthe battlefleet occupied a covering area further\nto the west.\n\n38.

Though full information of the progress\nof this action did not become available till later,\nit was evident that the cruiser force was unlikely\nto have enough fuel remaining to cover R.A.51\nthroughout the dangerous part of its passage.\nI therefore put to sea in the KING GEORGE\nV, with the HOWE, KENT, BERWICK, BER-\nMUDA and six destroyers, to give additional .\ncover. The weather limited the speed of the\ndestroyers, so the Rear Admiral Commanding,\n1st Cruiser Squadron was detached with the\ntwo heavy cruisers:to proceed at best speed to\na covering position south-west of Bear Island ;\nthe battlefleet occupied a covering area further\nto the west.\n\n38. The enemy surface forces, however, had\n\napparently had enough. Captain (D), 8th\nDestroyer Flotilla, in command of the escort, by\n\n‘the help of D/F bearings and contacts obtained\n\nwith radar, manceuvred the convoy to avoid\nthe small number of U-boats which were on\npatrol and brought it without loss to the United\nKingdom.\n\nSummary of Results\n\n_ 39.

Tovey, K.C.B, D5S.O.,\nCommander-in-Chief, Home Fleet.\n\nExtract FROM DESPATCH COVERING THE\nPeriop Ist January To 31st Marcu, 1942\n\nHome Fleet,\n, 20th May, 1942.\n\nLoss of s.s. WAZIRISTAN\n\n1. The year started with the first loss from\nthese convoys; it was brought about by a\nmost unfortunate combination of circum-\nstances. Convoy P.Q.7 was so delayed by\ndefects while assembling at Hvalfiord* that the\nAdmiral Commanding, Iceland, decided to\nsail it in two parts. The first, which sailed late\nin December, consisted of only two ships: the\ncruiser and destroyers of the ocean escort were\ntherefore held back for the second, and larger,\npart ; and the two ships were given two mine-\nSweepers as ocean escort.\n\n2. These were sailed as usual to join the\nconvoy near Jan Mayen Island but failed to\nmake contact before the local escort of\ntrawlers parted company, or in fact at all. The\nmerchant ships thus arrived south of Bear\nIsland without escort: U-boats, working in this\narea for the first time, succeeded in sinking the\nWAZIRISTAN. The COLD HARBOUR,\nher companion, arrived off the White Sea a\nweek late.\n\n3. That the first appearance of U-boats\nshould coincide with the first: unescorted\nconvoy was most unfortunate. In order that\nescorting cruisers should not be exposed to\n\nAdmiralty footnote :—\n* On the west coast of Iceland.\n\n- would entail a 14-day cycle.\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1950\n\nU-boat attack at convoy speeds, they were\nordered after this attack to part company with\ntheir convoys between 14° East and 26° East\nand pass through this area at high speed, re-\njoining the convoys when the latter had come\nthrough. It was considered unlikely that\nenemy surface forces would operate in the same\narea as U-boats. .\n\nLoss of H.M.S. MATABELE\n4. Convoy P.Q.7B arrived safely, but P.Q.8\nwas attacked by U-boats north-eastward of the\nKola Inlet*. The ss. HARMATRID was\ntorpedoed on 17th January, but reached\nharbour in tow: the MATABELE, one of the\ntwo escorting destroyers, was torpedoed the\nnext day and lost with only two survivors.\n\n5. The increased enemy effort against the\nconvoys, of which these unfortunate losses\nwere evidence, though expected, was disturb-\ning. The early spring was approaching, with\na period of two or three months during which\nthe ice would still compel the convoys to pass\nthrough two narrow focal areas close to the\nenemy coast, without the compensation of foul\nweather and long darkness to restrict his air\nactivity. It seemed therefore that air attacks,\nand surface or U-boat attacks made possible\nby air reconnaissance, might reach a scale\nbeyond the escorting resources of the Home\n\neet.\n\n6. I pointed this out to Their Lordships and\npressed for strong and continuous Russian\npatrol activity off the Kola Inlet, to make that\narea untenable by U-boats, and for short-range\nand long-range fighter protection. The cruiser\ncould not remain in company with the convoy,\nin U-boat infested waters, solely to provide the\nA.A. defence which could come more effec-\ntively from fighters. The Rear Admiral Com-\nmanding, 10th Cruiser Squadronf, in the\nNIGERIA, ‘was stationed at Murmansk\nthroughout February to represent these require-\nments to the Russians, the NIGERIA provid-\ning escort for east and westbound convoys\nbetween Bear Island and the Kola Inlet.\n\nSurface Threat from Trondheim\n\n7. The presence of the TIRPITZ at\nTrondheim, where she artived on 17th January\nand, still more, her reinforcement on 23rd\nFebruary by the SCHEER and PRINZ\nEUGEN, constituted another and more serious\nthreat to these convoys. It seemed probable\nthat the heavy ships, if they attacked, would\ndo so between Jan Mayen and Bear Islands,\nleaving the eastern section of the route to their\nU-boats and aircraft. It was therefore neces-\nsary to provide heavy cover on this part of\nthe route, even though this could not be done\nwithout uncovering to some extent the\nNorthern Passages.\n\n8. To economise the use of this heavy cover,\nI asked the Admiralty on 26th February that\nthe convoys should be sailed simultaneously\nfrom each end, so that their passage through\nthe danger area should be synchronised. This\nI also asked for\nfour more destroyers, to enable the covering .\nforce to have a proper screen and the convoy\na close escort of two destroyers. °\n\nAdmiralty foo’notes :—\n* The entrance to Murmansk. -\n} Rear Admiral H.

The first convoys to receive heavy ship\ncover were P.Q.12 and Q.P.8, unusually large\nconvoys of between 15 and 20 ships each,\nwhich sailed from Hvalfiord and the Kola\nInlet on 1st March. Cover was provided by\nthe whole Home Fleet as far as longitude 14°\nEast ; but the real danger, in my opinion, was\n\nthat arising from U-boat and air attack further .\n\neast, and I was unable to obtain any increase\nin the meagre A/S escorts of these convoys\nor in the scale of A.A. defence, except for a\npromise of Russian long-range fighters, at some\nfuture unspecified date, in the approaches to\nthe Kola Inlet. .\n\n10. The eastbound convoy, P.Q.12, was\nfortuitously sighted by aircraft off Iceland.\nProbably, in my opinion, suspecting that the\nconvoy was transporting troops to effect a land-\ning in North Norway, the TIRPITZ was\ntempted out to attack it. She failed to locate\nit, but succeeded in sinking a straggler, the\nI-JORA, from the westbound convoy (Q.P.8)\n‘on the 7th March.\n\n11. The same low visibility which hampered\nthe TIRPITZ, and severe icing conditions\nwhich precluded the use of our aircraft for\nreconnaissance, prevented me from bringing\nher to action ; but she was attacked by the air-\ncraft of the VICTORIOUS off the Lofoten\nIslands, on her way back to Trondheim,\napparently without success. She immediately\n\ntook refuge at Narvik and completed her\n\npassage on 13th March.\n\n12, I had, despatched eight destroyers under\nCaptain (D), 8th Destroyér Flotilla, with the\nTRINIDAD in support, to sweep up the coast\nfrom 66° North on the night of 12th/13th\nMarch, in the hope that the TIRPITZ would\nmake an earlier move.

The next two convoys, P.Q.13 and Q.P.9,\neach of 19 ships, sailed on 20th and 21st\nMarch respectively, ‘after a 48-hour delay\ncaused by the presence of U-boats off the Kola\nInlet. It was not possible materially to increase\nthe A/S escort, which consisted of two des-\ntroyers, a minesweeper and two trawlers for\nthe eastbound convoy, and one destroyer and\ntwo minesweepers for the westbound one, but\none cruiser accompanied each as close cover,\nwith another west of Bear Island in support:\nthe main fleet, under the command of the Vice\nAdmiral Second’ in Command* gave cover\nover the western half of the route against the\nheavy surface forces at Trondheim, while five\nminesweepers and a Russian destroyer rein-\nforced the escorts off the Murmansk coast; no\nair support was available outside the immediate\nvicinity of the Kola Inlet.\n\n14.

Further representations to the Ad-\nmiralty were therefore made and some\ndestroyers .and corvettes from the Western\nApproaches were promised for the next con-\nvoys. The Russians also agreed to receive a\nmission from’ Coastal Command to help in\norganising their oversea reconnaissance and\nfighter protection. I recommended that the\nnumber of convoys should be reduced during\nthe next few months, when the German aero-\ndrome conditions and air reconnaissance would\nimprove, whilst the convoy routes would still\nbe restricted by ice: but the U.S.A. was now\ngiving first priority to deliveries to Russia, of\nwhich her quota was far behind schedule, and\nit seemed probable that the convoys would in-\ncrease rather than decrease.\n\nN\n\nEXTRACT FROM DESPATCH COVERING THE '\nPeriop 1st Apri To 30TH Jung, 1942\n\nHome Fleet,\n‘2nd August, 1942. -\n\n1.

Owing to the evident inability of the\n\n“Russians to provide air co-operation in the\n\nBarents Sea, I had asked for R.A.F. recon-\nnaissance and long-range fighter aircraft to be\nstationed in North Russia. These would pro-\nvide the convoys, during the worst part of their\npassage, with A/S patrols, fighter protection\nand reconnaissance against surface attack.\nBut the number of aircraft, in Coastal Com-\nmand was insufficient to meet any of these\nrequirements and the convoys had to continue\nthis most hazardous passage virtually without\nair co-operation (see also paragraph 32),\n\nP.Q.16 and Q.P.12\n\n26. P.Q.16, which sailed on 20th May, con-\ntained 35 ships and, despite the fact that this\nwas the most unfavourable time of the year,\nwas the largest convoy which had so far been\nrun. It was escorted by five destroyers, four\nites, four trawlers, one minesweeper and\nA.A. ship. It was located by enemy air-\ncrdtt on 24th May and, though one shadower\nwas shot down on 25th May by the Hurricane\nfrom the C.A.M. ship, was shadowed con-\n\ntinuously for the next six days.\n\n27. The first attack, 380 miles from the\nenemy aerodromes, was made on 25th May\nby eight torpedo aircraft and about’ twenty\none ship, the American s.s. CARL-\nTON, had a steam pipe fractured and turned\nback for Iceland, in tow of the trawler\nNORTHERN SPRAY:. one Ju.88 was shot\ndown and four more were probably destroyed.\n\n28. The main weight of air attack started\non the afternoon of 26th May and continued\nalmost without respite until 30th May. During\nthis period no less than 34 torpedo aircraft\nand 210 bombers attacked the convoy, sinking\nfive ships and damaging three others, as well\nthree air-\ncraft were shot down and twelve more were\nprobably destroyed. Numerous attempts were\n\nConvoy\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THs LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1950\n\nmade by U-boats to attack the convoy, but\nwith one exception they were driven off,\nseveral U-boats being damaged: in the one\nsuccessful attack, one.ship was sunk, making\na total loss of six ships out of 35. The small-\nness of the losses in comparison with the enemy\neffort was due to the skill and endurance of\nthe escort, under the command of the Com-\nmanding Officer of the ASHANTI, and to the\nsteadiness, good gunfire and excellent station\nkeeping of the convoy. The German bombers\npressed their attacks home on one day only,\nwhile their torpedo aircraft were cautious in\nthe extreme and generally ineffective.

The cruiser covering force was in com-\npany with P.Q.16 for the first air attack, but\ntheir operations were otherwise without in-\ncident, as were those of the heavy covering\nforce. The threat of surface attack by the\ntwo pocket battleships at Narvik did not\nmaterialise.\n\nP.Q.17 and Q.P.13\n\n431.

Owing to the evident inability of the\n\n“Russians to provide air co-operation in the\n\nBarents Sea, I had asked for R.A.F. recon-\nnaissance and long-range fighter aircraft to be\nstationed in North Russia. These would pro-\nvide the convoys, during the worst part of their\npassage, with A/S patrols, fighter protection\nand reconnaissance against surface attack.\nBut the number of aircraft, in Coastal Com-\nmand was insufficient to meet any of these\nrequirements and the convoys had to continue\nthis most hazardous passage virtually without\nair co-operation (see also paragraph 32),\n\nP.Q.16 and Q.P.12\n\n26. P.Q.16, which sailed on 20th May, con-\ntained 35 ships and, despite the fact that this\nwas the most unfavourable time of the year,\nwas the largest convoy which had so far been\nrun. It was escorted by five destroyers, four\nites, four trawlers, one minesweeper and\nA.A. ship. It was located by enemy air-\ncrdtt on 24th May and, though one shadower\nwas shot down on 25th May by the Hurricane\nfrom the C.A.M. ship, was shadowed con-\n\ntinuously for the next six days.\n\n27. The first attack, 380 miles from the\nenemy aerodromes, was made on 25th May\nby eight torpedo aircraft and about’ twenty\none ship, the American s.s.

The main weight of air attack started\non the afternoon of 26th May and continued\nalmost without respite until 30th May. During\nthis period no less than 34 torpedo aircraft\nand 210 bombers attacked the convoy, sinking\nfive ships and damaging three others, as well\nthree air-\ncraft were shot down and twelve more were\nprobably destroyed. Numerous attempts were\n\nConvoy\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THs LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1950\n\nmade by U-boats to attack the convoy, but\nwith one exception they were driven off,\nseveral U-boats being damaged: in the one\nsuccessful attack, one.ship was sunk, making\na total loss of six ships out of 35. The small-\nness of the losses in comparison with the enemy\neffort was due to the skill and endurance of\nthe escort, under the command of the Com-\nmanding Officer of the ASHANTI, and to the\nsteadiness, good gunfire and excellent station\nkeeping of the convoy. The German bombers\npressed their attacks home on one day only,\nwhile their torpedo aircraft were cautious in\nthe extreme and generally ineffective. Some\nRussian fighters were present on the last two\ndays and claimed to have destroyed some of\nthe enemy after their attacks.\n\n29..Q.P.12, escorted by six destroyers, one\nA.A. ship, one minesweeper and four trawlers,\nleft Kola Inlet on 31st May. They were\nsighted shortly after sailing; but the enemy\nconcentrated all his force on the more im-\nportant eastbound convoy and Q.P.12 reached\nIceland without being attacked.\n\n30. The cruiser covering force was in com-\npany with P.Q.16 for the first air attack, but\ntheir operations were otherwise without in-\ncident, as were those of the heavy covering\nforce.

Apart from submarine attack off the\nenemy coast, a more favourable disposition\ncould be brought about only by inducing the\nenemy heavy ships to come further to the west-\nward to deliver their attacks.\n\n3. With this object, I proposed to’ the\nAdmiralty that the convoy, on reaching the\napproximate longitude of 10° East, should turn\nback for twelve or eighteen | hours, unless in-\nformation showed that the enemy had not after\nall put to sea, or the weather was such as to\nprevent air shadowing. I hoped that this tem-\nporary turn back would either tempt the\nGerman heavy ships to pursue, or cause them\nto return to harbour, or compel them to cruise\nfor an extended period among our submarines,\nnine of which were concentrated between Bear\nIsland and the Norwegian coast. Three\nRussian submarines were also in this area.\n\n- 4 The Admiralty did not approve of this\nplan but, after further discussion, issued in-\nstructions on 27th June which envisaged the\npossibility, under certain circumstances, of the\nconvoy being temporarily turned back by\nthe Admiralty, but not of this turn being timed\nto achieve the object I had in view. In the\nevent, this question did not arise, as the enemy\nsurface movements took place later than had\nbeen expected, The Admiralty instruction also\nstated, inter alia, that the safety of the convoy\nagainst surface attack to the westward of Bear\nIsland must be met by our surface forces, and\nto the eastward of that meridian must depend\non our submarines ; and that the cruiser cover-\ning force was not intended to go east of Bear\nIsland unless the convoy was threatened by the\npresence of a surface force which the cruiser\n\n: force could fight, or in 1 any case to go beyond\n\n° East.\n\nDiversionary Operations\n\n5. In an attempt to divert the enemy surface\nand air forces, a dummy convoy, consisting of\nthe 1st Minelaying Squadron and four colliers,\nand escorted by the SIRIUS, CURACOA, five\ndestroyers and some trawlers, was assembled in\nScapa Flow for a week and sailed two days\nafter the convoy. It sailed westabout the\nShetlands and then eastward to 1° East, hoping\nto attract the attention of the German air re-\nconnaissance and simulate a raiding force\nbound for Soathern Norway (Operation ES).\nThe battlefleét sailed later the same ‘day and\nadjusted its course to give the impression of\ncovering the raiding force.\n\n6. The only German reconnaissance of Scapa\nduring the period of assembly apparently failed\nto notice this convoy, nor was it sighted on\npassage. The operation was therefore repeated\n\n~ on Ist July, but again without success.\n\nQ.P.13\n_ 1. The westbound convoy sailed from Arch-\n“angel on 26th June, some ships leaving Mur-\nmansk the next day to join. It-consisted of\n35 ships and.was escorted by five destroyers,\nthree corvettes, one anti-aircraft ship, three\nminesweepers, two trawlers and, as far as the\nBear id area, one submarine. It was\nsighted by enemy aircraft on 30th June and\n. 2nd July ; but once more the enemy’s policy was\nto concentrate on the eastbound laden ‘convoy,\nand Q.P.13 was not attacked.\n8. The convoy was divided east of Iceland,\none section proceeding direct to the\n\n5145\n\nUnited Kingdom and the-other to Hvalfiord, en\nroute for America. This change of plan was\nordered by the Admiralty when the convoy was\nalready at sea. The officer who became Com-\ntmodore of the Hvalfiord section was not there-\nfore aware of the position of the minefield in\nthe Denmark Strait nor of the danger of navi-\ngating in that atea without accurate knowledge\nof his position. This section ran foul of the\nminefield and on 5th July the NIGER (Com\nmander A. J. Cubison, R.N.) and five merchant\nships were sunk ; one other merchant ship was\ndamaged, These: were the only casualties\nsuffered by the convoy.\n\nP.Q.17.\n\n9. The eastbound convoy sailed from\nHvalfiord on 27th June. In addition to 34 mer-\nchant ships, an oiler for the use of the escort\nand three rescue ships sailed in this convoy.\nThe escort comprised six destroyers, four cor-\nvettes, three minesweepers, four trawlers, two\nanti-aircraft ships and two submarines.\n\n10. The route was considerably longer than\nthat for earlier convoys this year, for the ice\nallowed passage north of Bear Island and a\nconsiderable evasive detour in the Barents Sea ;\nand all the convoy was bound for ‘Archangel, 7\nrecent heavy air raids having destroyed most of\nMurmansk. oe\n\n‘11. Part of the convoy ran into drifting ice in,\nthick weather in the Denmark Strait. Two\nmerchant ships were damaged and had to return\nand the escort’s oiler, the GREY RANGER,\nwas also damaged: her speed reduced to eight\nknots and it was doubtful whether she could\nface heavy weather ; it was therefore decided to\ntransfer her to the fuelling position north-east .\nof Jan Mayen (Force Q) in exchange for the -\nALDERSDALE.\n\n12, The convoy was located by enemy aircraft\nand U-boats on Ist July, a little later than usual,\nand thereafters was shadowed continuously\nexcept for a few short intervals in fog. Though\nthis fog was not permanent enough to prevent\nshadowing, it did decrease the number of, air\nattacks. The first, by nine torpedo aircraft,\ntook place late on 2nd July: it was unsuccessful\nand one aircraft was shot down. A solitary air-\ncraft scored a torpedo hit on the morning of\n4th July, the merchant ship later being sunk\nby our own forces ; and there was an unsuccess-\nful attack by six bombers in the evening. Later\nthe same evening another attack, by twenty-five\ntorpedo bombers, took place: two ships were\nsunk and one damaged, and at least four aircraft\nwere shot down.\n\nCovering Forces\n\n13. Meanwhile the two covering forces were\nmoving into position. The cruiser force, under\nthe command of Rear Admiral Commanding,\n1st Cruiser Squadron*, left Seidisfiord dur-\ning the night of 30th June/Ist July and arrived\nin a covering position north of the convoy on\n2nd July. It consisted of the LONDON, NOR-\nFOLK, WICHITA, TUSCALOOSA and three\ndestroyers, of which two were American. They\nwere not sighted by the- enemy ‘until late on\n3rd July.\n\n14.

Apart from submarine attack off the\nenemy coast, a more favourable disposition\ncould be brought about only by inducing the\nenemy heavy ships to come further to the west-\nward to deliver their attacks.\n\n3. With this object, I proposed to’ the\nAdmiralty that the convoy, on reaching the\napproximate longitude of 10° East, should turn\nback for twelve or eighteen | hours, unless in-\nformation showed that the enemy had not after\nall put to sea, or the weather was such as to\nprevent air shadowing. I hoped that this tem-\nporary turn back would either tempt the\nGerman heavy ships to pursue, or cause them\nto return to harbour, or compel them to cruise\nfor an extended period among our submarines,\nnine of which were concentrated between Bear\nIsland and the Norwegian coast. Three\nRussian submarines were also in this area.\n\n- 4 The Admiralty did not approve of this\nplan but, after further discussion, issued in-\nstructions on 27th June which envisaged the\npossibility, under certain circumstances, of the\nconvoy being temporarily turned back by\nthe Admiralty, but not of this turn being timed\nto achieve the object I had in view. In the\nevent, this question did not arise, as the enemy\nsurface movements took place later than had\nbeen expected, The Admiralty instruction also\nstated, inter alia, that the safety of the convoy\nagainst surface attack to the westward of Bear\nIsland must be met by our surface forces, and\nto the eastward of that meridian must depend\non our submarines ; and that the cruiser cover-\ning force was not intended to go east of Bear\nIsland unless the convoy was threatened by the\npresence of a surface force which the cruiser\n\n: force could fight, or in 1 any case to go beyond\n\n° East.\n\nDiversionary Operations\n\n5. In an attempt to divert the enemy surface\nand air forces, a dummy convoy, consisting of\nthe 1st Minelaying Squadron and four colliers,\nand escorted by the SIRIUS, CURACOA, five\ndestroyers and some trawlers, was assembled in\nScapa Flow for a week and sailed two days\nafter the convoy. It sailed westabout the\nShetlands and then eastward to 1° East, hoping\nto attract the attention of the German air re-\nconnaissance and simulate a raiding force\nbound for Soathern Norway (Operation ES).\nThe battlefleét sailed later the same ‘day and\nadjusted its course to give the impression of\ncovering the raiding force.\n\n6. The only German reconnaissance of Scapa\nduring the period of assembly apparently failed\nto notice this convoy, nor was it sighted on\npassage. The operation was therefore repeated\n\n~ on Ist July, but again without success.\n\nQ.P.13\n_ 1. The westbound convoy sailed from Arch-\n“angel on 26th June, some ships leaving Mur-\nmansk the next day to join. It-consisted of\n35 ships and.was escorted by five destroyers,\nthree corvettes, one anti-aircraft ship, three\nminesweepers, two trawlers and, as far as the\nBear id area, one submarine. It was\nsighted by enemy aircraft on 30th June and\n. 2nd July ; but once more the enemy’s policy was\nto concentrate on the eastbound laden ‘convoy,\nand Q.P.13 was not attacked.\n8. The convoy was divided east of Iceland,\none section proceeding direct to the\n\n5145\n\nUnited Kingdom and the-other to Hvalfiord, en\nroute for America. This change of plan was\nordered by the Admiralty when the convoy was\nalready at sea. The officer who became Com-\ntmodore of the Hvalfiord section was not there-\nfore aware of the position of the minefield in\nthe Denmark Strait nor of the danger of navi-\ngating in that atea without accurate knowledge\nof his position. This section ran foul of the\nminefield and on 5th July the NIGER (Com\nmander A. J. Cubison, R.N.) and five merchant\nships were sunk ; one other merchant ship was\ndamaged, These: were the only casualties\nsuffered by the convoy.\n\nP.Q.17.\n\n9. The eastbound convoy sailed from\nHvalfiord on 27th June. In addition to 34 mer-\nchant ships, an oiler for the use of the escort\nand three rescue ships sailed in this convoy.\nThe escort comprised six destroyers, four cor-\nvettes, three minesweepers, four trawlers, two\nanti-aircraft ships and two submarines.\n\n10. The route was considerably longer than\nthat for earlier convoys this year, for the ice\nallowed passage north of Bear Island and a\nconsiderable evasive detour in the Barents Sea ;\nand all the convoy was bound for ‘Archangel, 7\nrecent heavy air raids having destroyed most of\nMurmansk. oe\n\n‘11. Part of the convoy ran into drifting ice in,\nthick weather in the Denmark Strait. Two\nmerchant ships were damaged and had to return\nand the escort’s oiler, the GREY RANGER,\nwas also damaged: her speed reduced to eight\nknots and it was doubtful whether she could\nface heavy weather ; it was therefore decided to\ntransfer her to the fuelling position north-east .\nof Jan Mayen (Force Q) in exchange for the -\nALDERSDALE.\n\n12, The convoy was located by enemy aircraft\nand U-boats on Ist July, a little later than usual,\nand thereafters was shadowed continuously\nexcept for a few short intervals in fog. Though\nthis fog was not permanent enough to prevent\nshadowing, it did decrease the number of, air\nattacks. The first, by nine torpedo aircraft,\ntook place late on 2nd July: it was unsuccessful\nand one aircraft was shot down. A solitary air-\ncraft scored a torpedo hit on the morning of\n4th July, the merchant ship later being sunk\nby our own forces ; and there was an unsuccess-\nful attack by six bombers in the evening. Later\nthe same evening another attack, by twenty-five\ntorpedo bombers, took place: two ships were\nsunk and one damaged, and at least four aircraft\nwere shot down.\n\nCovering Forces\n\n13. Meanwhile the two covering forces were\nmoving into position. The cruiser force, under\nthe command of Rear Admiral Commanding,\n1st Cruiser Squadron*, left Seidisfiord dur-\ning the night of 30th June/Ist July and arrived\nin a covering position north of the convoy on\n2nd July. It consisted of the LONDON, NOR-\nFOLK, WICHITA, TUSCALOOSA and three\ndestroyers, of which two were American. They\nwere not sighted by the- enemy ‘until late on\n3rd July.\n\n14. The heavy covering force, comprising the\nDUKE OF YORK (Commander-in-Chief),\n\nAdmiralty footnote :-—\n* Rear Admiral L, H. K. Hamilton, D.S.0.\n",

Later\non that day, course was altered to the north-\nward, to cross the convoy track and reach a\nposition north-west of Bear Island, within air\nstriking range of the convoy on the morning of\n4th July: this time was calculated from the\ninformation available to be the earliest at which\nsurface attack was likely to materialise. While\non passage to the new covering area, which was\noccupied for about 24 hours, the battlefleet was\njoined by the MANCHESTER and ECLIPSE\nfrom Spitzbergen.\n\n15. Air reconnaissance of the Norwegian har-\nbours had been hindered by the weather, but\n- the available information showed that the heavy\nunits were probably moving northwards, and an\nair photograph of Trondheim late on 3rd July\nconfirmed that the TIRPITZ and HIPPER had\nleft. The flying-boat patrol and the two lines\nof submarines between North Cape and Bear\nIsland were being adjusted to cover the line of\napproach to the convoy as it moved eastwards.\nIn view of the uncertainty of the enemy’s posi-\ntion, Rear Admiral Commanding, Ist Cruiser\nSquadron decided to continue to provide close\ncover, and to pass to the eastward of Bear\n\nsland. .\n\nRoute\n\n16. A fresh ice reconnaissance on 3rd July\nfound that the passage north of Bear Island had\nwidened. The Admiralty suggested’ to the\nKEPPEL (Setiior Officer of Escort) that the\nconvoy should pass at least fifty miles north\nof it, but he preferred to stay in the low\nvisibility on his original route and to make\nground to the eastward: Rear Admiral Com-\nmanding, ist Cruiser Squadron, however, on\nclosing the convoy, decided that a more\nnortherly route was necessary and ordered the\nKEPPEL to alter course to pass 70 miles north\nof Bear Island and, later, to open to 400 miles\nfrom Banak. .\n\nScattering of Convoy\n\n17. At 1230/4th July, the Admiralty gave\nRear Admiral Commanding, Ist Cruiser\nSquadron permission to proceed east of longi-\ntude 25° East, should the situation so demand,\nunless contrary orders were received from me.\nThis was a reversal of the policy agreed be-\ntween the Admiralty and myself (see para-\ngrapb 4): as no information in my possession\njustified this change, I instructed Rear Admiral\nCommanding, 1st Cruiser Squadron to with-\ndraw when the convoy was east of 25° East,\nor earlier at his discretion, unless the Admiralty\nassured him that the TIRPITZ could not be\nmet. The Admiralty at 1858, however, in-\nformed him that further information was\nexpected shortly and instructed him to remain\nwith the convoy pending further instructions.\n\n18. At 2111/4th July, the Admiralty made\na signal, prefixed .““ Most Immediate ”, order-\ning Rear Admirai Commanding, Ist Cruiser\nSquadron to withdraw to the westward at high\nspeed (this is understood to have been due\nto U-boat information, but that fact was not\nknown to the addressees): at 2123, the\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1950\n\n‘Admiralty, in a signal prefixed “Immediate”, -\n\nordered the convoy to disperse and proceed\nto Russian ports owing to threat from surface\nships; and at 2136 followed this up with\nanother “Most Immediate” signal ordering\nthe convoy to scatter (this latter signal was in-\ntended merely as a correction of technical\nwording from “disperse” to “scatter”, but\nthis too was not known at the time). Both\nRear Admiral Commanding, Ist. Cruiser\nSquadron and the Commanding Officer of the\nKEPPEL took these signals to indicate that an\nattack by the TIRPITZ was imminent: the\nconvoy was immediately ordered to scatter,\nthe escorting destroyers to join the cruiser\nforce, and the rest of the escort to proceed\nindependently. .\n\n’ Enemy Surface Forces\n\n19. The enemy heavy forces, however, had\nnot yet left North Norway: it was not unti\n1700 on Sth July that they were sighted and\nreported by the Soviet submarine K.21, north\nof North Cape outward bound: and three and\na half hours later the submarine P.54 reported\nthe TIRPITZ, HIPPER and six destroyers,\nstill steering to the north-eastwards. Soon\nafter, for some reason at present not estab-\nlished, the enemy fleet abandoned their enter-\nprise and returned to harbour: possibly their\ninformation of the position and composition\nof our two covering forces was at fault, or they\nwere unwilling to face the threat of our\nsubmarines.\n\n20. During the night of Sth/6th July, I\nreceived three signals from the Admiralty\nsuggesting that if the battlefleet was sighted\nsteering to the eastward it might make the\nTIRPITZ reluctant to go as far as the convoy ;\nand that the TIRPITZ might be damaged and,\nif I could refuel. my destroyers, might present\nan opportunity for the VICTORIOUS. The\nlatter seemed to me unlikely, for it was almost\ncertain that the TIRPITZ, especially if\ndamaged, would not be sailed down the\nNorwegian coast until adequate fighter cover\nand seaward reconnaissance were available:\nmoreover the DUKE OF YORK was short of\nfuel. Arrangements were made for the fleet\nto reverse its course if the approach of enemy\naircraft was detected; and at 0645/6th July\nwhen the destroyers had completed with fuel,\ncourse was altered back to the north-eastward.\nAn hour later an enemy aircraft passed over\nthe fleet, above the clouds: endeavour was\nmade to attract his attention by gunfire and\nfighters, but without success. The weather\ncontinued unfavourable for air reconnaissance,\nso that at 1545/6th July the course of the fleet\nwas again reversed and the units returned to -\nharbour.\n\n21. The submarines STURGEON and\nMINERVE, returning from patrol lines off\nNorth Cape, had meanwhile been diverted by\nthe Flag Officer Submarines to establish a -\npatrol off the entrance to Vestfiord. The\nGerman ships were sighted by a Mosquito air-\ncraft on the morning of 7th July, leaving Arno,\nin North Norway, on their way back to Narvik.\nIt is possible that they passed inside the Leads\nand thus evaded the submarines. .\nFurther Attacks on Convoy\n\n22. When the order to scatter the convoy\nwas received, it had covered: more than half\nits route with the loss of only three ships.\n",

At 1230/4th July, the Admiralty gave\nRear Admiral Commanding, Ist Cruiser\nSquadron permission to proceed east of longi-\ntude 25° East, should the situation so demand,\nunless contrary orders were received from me.\nThis was a reversal of the policy agreed be-\ntween the Admiralty and myself (see para-\ngrapb 4): as no information in my possession\njustified this change, I instructed Rear Admiral\nCommanding, 1st Cruiser Squadron to with-\ndraw when the convoy was east of 25° East,\nor earlier at his discretion, unless the Admiralty\nassured him that the TIRPITZ could not be\nmet. The Admiralty at 1858, however, in-\nformed him that further information was\nexpected shortly and instructed him to remain\nwith the convoy pending further instructions.\n\n18. At 2111/4th July, the Admiralty made\na signal, prefixed .““ Most Immediate ”, order-\ning Rear Admirai Commanding, Ist Cruiser\nSquadron to withdraw to the westward at high\nspeed (this is understood to have been due\nto U-boat information, but that fact was not\nknown to the addressees): at 2123, the\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1950\n\n‘Admiralty, in a signal prefixed “Immediate”, -\n\nordered the convoy to disperse and proceed\nto Russian ports owing to threat from surface\nships; and at 2136 followed this up with\nanother “Most Immediate” signal ordering\nthe convoy to scatter (this latter signal was in-\ntended merely as a correction of technical\nwording from “disperse” to “scatter”, but\nthis too was not known at the time). Both\nRear Admiral Commanding, Ist. Cruiser\nSquadron and the Commanding Officer of the\nKEPPEL took these signals to indicate that an\nattack by the TIRPITZ was imminent: the\nconvoy was immediately ordered to scatter,\nthe escorting destroyers to join the cruiser\nforce, and the rest of the escort to proceed\nindependently. .\n\n’ Enemy Surface Forces\n\n19. The enemy heavy forces, however, had\nnot yet left North Norway: it was not unti\n1700 on Sth July that they were sighted and\nreported by the Soviet submarine K.21, north\nof North Cape outward bound: and three and\na half hours later the submarine P.54 reported\nthe TIRPITZ, HIPPER and six destroyers,\nstill steering to the north-eastwards. Soon\nafter, for some reason at present not estab-\nlished, the enemy fleet abandoned their enter-\nprise and returned to harbour: possibly their\ninformation of the position and composition\nof our two covering forces was at fault, or they\nwere unwilling to face the threat of our\nsubmarines.\n\n20. During the night of Sth/6th July, I\nreceived three signals from the Admiralty\nsuggesting that if the battlefleet was sighted\nsteering to the eastward it might make the\nTIRPITZ reluctant to go as far as the convoy ;\nand that the TIRPITZ might be damaged and,\nif I could refuel. my destroyers, might present\nan opportunity for the VICTORIOUS. The\nlatter seemed to me unlikely, for it was almost\ncertain that the TIRPITZ, especially if\ndamaged, would not be sailed down the\nNorwegian coast until adequate fighter cover\nand seaward reconnaissance were available:\nmoreover the DUKE OF YORK was short of\nfuel. Arrangements were made for the fleet\nto reverse its course if the approach of enemy\naircraft was detected; and at 0645/6th July\nwhen the destroyers had completed with fuel,\ncourse was altered back to the north-eastward.\nAn hour later an enemy aircraft passed over\nthe fleet, above the clouds: endeavour was\nmade to attract his attention by gunfire and\nfighters, but without success. The weather\ncontinued unfavourable for air reconnaissance,\nso that at 1545/6th July the course of the fleet\nwas again reversed and the units returned to -\nharbour.\n\n21. The submarines STURGEON and\nMINERVE, returning from patrol lines off\nNorth Cape, had meanwhile been diverted by\nthe Flag Officer Submarines to establish a -\npatrol off the entrance to Vestfiord. The\nGerman ships were sighted by a Mosquito air-\ncraft on the morning of 7th July, leaving Arno,\nin North Norway, on their way back to Narvik.\nIt is possible that they passed inside the Leads\nand thus evaded the submarines. .\nFurther Attacks on Convoy\n\n22. When the order to scatter the convoy\nwas received, it had covered: more than half\nits route with the loss of only three ships.\n",

The experience of P.Q.17 had\nshown that the enemy was now ready to bring\nhis heavy surface forces against the convoys,\nwell to the eastward in the Barents Sea. Nor\ncould it be assumed that he would continue to\nleave the westbound convoys alone. The cover\nprovided by the battlefleet, while the convoys\nwere east of Bear Island, had always been more\nthreatening than real; for I had strong objec-\ntions to taking heavy ships into the Barents Sea,\nfar from their bases and exposed to heavy con-\ncentrations of U-boats and shore-based aircraft,\nwith little hope of bringing the enemy to action.\nThe battlefleet screen absorbed a number of\ndestroyers which could otherwise be used to\nprovide real cover, close to the convoy.

The cover\nprovided by the battlefleet, while the convoys\nwere east of Bear Island, had always been more\nthreatening than real; for I had strong objec-\ntions to taking heavy ships into the Barents Sea,\nfar from their bases and exposed to heavy con-\ncentrations of U-boats and shore-based aircraft,\nwith little hope of bringing the enemy to action.\nThe battlefleet screen absorbed a number of\ndestroyers which could otherwise be used to\nprovide real cover, close to the convoy. In the\nvariable visibility which prevails in those lati-\n\n. tudes, the presence of a strong force of\n\ndestroyers would constitute a threat which the\nenemy, in spite of the longer range of his-guns,\nwould probably be reluctant to face.\n\n32. I therefore decided to rely for surface\ncover on a strong force of destroyers, under the\ncommand of the Rear Admiral Commanding,\n\nlome Fleet Destroyers (Rear Admiral R. L.\n\nurmett, C.B., O.B.E.), flying his flag in the\nSCYLLA, and to accept the consequent re-\nstriction on the movements of the battleships,\nfor which small screens of low endurance only\nwere retained. The destroyer force was to\ntransfer off Nova Zemlya from P.Q.18 to\nQ.P.14, leaving the former to complete its voy-\nage with the normal anti-submarine escort, re-\ninforced by any forces which the Russians might\n",
