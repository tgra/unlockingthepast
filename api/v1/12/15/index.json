The Thracian entered the Bay and sank two river steamers, while a special agent succeeded in blowing up a third ship. The Thracian, however, in view of damage, had to be beached and dismantled. the following day."

            "description": "On the rrth December, Tavoy was bombed. A further enemy landing at Chumporn (Siam) gave access to the southernmost tip of Burma, and an advance on Victoria Point threatened. In the next two or three days the Japanese advance materialised and coincided with raids on Mergui by about fifty aircraft, propaganda leaflets being dropped as well as bombs. An effort was made to cut off the Japanese advance southwards by crossing the Siam frontier to demolish the railway a few miles south of Prachuabkhirikun, but the strength of the op- position and the heavy rains proved too great for the success of this expedition. The situa- tion was still in an undeveloped stage, but with a clear threat to Southern Burma, when on the 15th December Burma reverted to the province of the Commander-in-Chief, India. (See para. 29 above.)"

Ship- ping had to be found locally. Most of the troops were moved to the mainland but the remainder and all Europeans, except a few who remained behind at their own request, were evacuated. Asiatics serving in the Volunteers were given the option of being evacuated or of staying. The majority decided to stay to protect their families. Lack of transport would have made it quite out of the question to evacuate large numbers of Asiatics. Moreover it was undesir- able at that stage to increase the population of Singapore."

It promptly attacked and by dusk had secured 14,000 prisoners, 68 guns and much other material. By the 15th December all enemy troops had been driven out of Egypt, and the 7th Armoured Division had concen- trated South-West of Bardia. The 4th Armoured Brigade now cut the Bardia-Tobruk road while the Support Group engaged the Western and South-Western defences of Bardia. Meanwhile, the 16th Infantry Brigade moved up to the South-East face of the Bardia peri- meter, to cover our use of Sollum harbour. The greater part of the Italian army remaining in Cyrenaica had withdrawn within the defences of Bardia, which was now isolated. It was decided to capture Bardia with the 6th Aus- tralian Division as soon as ready, while 7th Armoured Division protected their left flank and prevented any movement along the Bardia- Tobruk road."

I was authorised to effect such re-grouping of operational units that 1 considered necessary to achieve maximum operational efficiency, and as a result R.AF. and U.S,A.A.F. transport units were merged on 15th December into one organisation which was given the title of Troop Carrier Command.

On 31st October, General Eisenhower again approached the Combined Chiefs of Staff with a full review of the need for landing craft and the resources necessary to meet those needs. The tasks for which the craft were required were threefold. The first was the build-up of auxiliary units to complete formations already in Ltaly. Secondly it was essential to be able to mount an assault behind the enemy lines in the strength of about a division, probably on the west coast. Thirdly it was necessary to meet the demands of the Strategic Air Force, which included not only the move of the operational formations themselves but also large numbers of airfield construction and servicing units. The Foggia airfields, though the principal base in South Italy for the Italian Air Force, were not all-weather and very large quantities of steel plank had to be transported. The require- ments of the Strategic Air Force had also been largely increased by the decision, communi- cated on 23rd October, to set up the XV United States Air Force in Italy. With our present resources, that is adhering to the existing programme of returning craft to the United Kingdom, the first of these tasks would not be completed before 15th December and there would remain only sufficient lift for one brigade or regimental combat team, which would be quite inadequate. If, however, we could keep until 15th December all the British Landing Ships, Tank (between forty-eight and fifty-six) and twelve United States, it would be possible both to complete the build-up of pre- sent formations and to mount a divisional amphibious assault. Even then only about a third of the task of establishing the Strategic Air Force in Italy would have been carried out; but if the craft could be retained for a further three weeks, until 5th January, the whole programme could be completed."

In this, operations in Jugoslavia were brought more into the fore- ground for the major r\u00e9le in the proposed spring offensive and the question of when to halt the offensive in Italy was more closely studied. Between roth and 23rd October the fiercest fighting on Fifth Army front had left us still short of Bologna, the exhaustion of our troops had increased and the lack of replace- ments, both British and American, had made itself felt. In this second paper, therefore, it was assumed that we were unlikely to have driven, the enemy back to the line of the Adige by the time that it became necessary to halt the offensive; instead our immediate objectives were limited to the capture of Bologna and Ravenna. The plan proposed was that Eighth Army should continue their offensive with all available forces at least until 15th November in order to capture Ravenna and, to draw off the enemy from Fifth Army. The latter was to go on to the defensive forthwith (this was ordered on 27th October), withdraw forces from the line to rest and prepare them for one more offensive effort and then launch them as secretly as. possible in a final attack on Bologna. If this plan was unsuccessful, then -we should have to accept the best winter position that could be managed; Eighth Army must endeavour, however, to capture Forli and open Route 67 to improve lateral communica- tions between the two Armies. I held a con- ference at my Headquarters to discuss this plan on 2gth October. The principles of the plan were agreed to but I decided to advance the date at which the offensive efforts of both Armies must cease from 15th November to 15th December; Fifth Army\u2019s final attempt to"

Rees) advanced from the Sittaung bridgehead, through Wuntho. 62 Brigade, advancing rapidly from the bridgehead, occupied Pinlebu on the 17th December after overcoming some opposition along the escarpment nine miles west-south-west of Pinlebu. Wuntho, on the Myitkyina-Mandalay railway, was reached on the 19th, and Kawlin on the 20th December. Further north, 64\u00b0 Brigade, passing through Pinbon on the 15th December, made a rapid advance of over 60 miles in seven days and occupied Banmauk on the 17th, making con- tact with 36 British Division and thus estab- lishing a continuous front with Northern Com- bat Area Command. After concentrating about Wuntho, 62 and 64 Brigades conformed with the main southerly axis of advance, and, by the 23rd, they reached Kokkogon, 25 miles south-east of Wuntho."

            "description": "44. Two regiments from 50 Chinese Division proceeded from behind 36 British Division and crossed the Irrawaddy to concentrate at Kontha, 24 miles south-east of Mawlu. By the 30th December, one regiment had reached Shwegu and the other a point 30 miles south- east of it. 5332 (United States) Brigade (\u201c Mars\u201d Brigade) was operating over a widely separated area from Bhamo to the south- east of Shwegu. 38 Chinese Division captured Bhamo on the 15th December after a siege of four weeks. The remnants of the Japanese garrison, some 300 strong, succeeded in break- ing out south of the town, but suffered severe casualties in doing so. After mopping up in the Bhamo area, 38 Chinese Division supported 30 Chinese Division in the advance on Namhkam. On the 28th December, one regi- ment crossed the Sino-Burmese frontier and occupied Loiwing (five miles north-north-east of Namhkam), together with its two all- weather airfields. ."

            "description": "154. Earlier, during their advance down the Kaladan Valley in the Spring of 1944, 81 (West African) Division had suffered a check at Kyauktaw. They were unaccustomed to open country and Kyauktaw lies in a cultivated valley four miles south of the confluence of the Kaladan River and the Pi Chaung. This time it had been planned to cross the river north of the confluence and to outflank Kyauktaw to the east, while leaving a holding force on the west bank. This would act as a protective detachment against any counter- thrust and mislead the enemy as to our inten- tions. Accordingly, on the 4th December, 6 (West African) Brigade advanced east from Kyingri on the Pi Chaung, with the intention of crossing the Kaladan at a point some ten miles north of the confluence of the two rivers. The first troops of the Brigade made the crossing on the 6th December ; by the 9th the whole of 6 Brigade and Divisional Headquarters were across, and three days later only a detach- ment of battalion strength remained west of the river. Beyond shelling the bridgehead, the Japanese were slow to react to this crossing and subsequent concentration, and it was not until the 15th December that they launched a night attack against 6 Brigade, which was covering the bridgehead. This attack was repulsed after bloody fighting."

            "description": "142, The 11th December saw 74 Brigade of 25 Indian Division beginning its advance in the coastal sector\u2014a flying start in order to attract the enemy\u2019s attention away from the Buthi- daung area. On the 12th December, 51 Brigade extended its hold east towards Buthidaung against slight opposition. By the 14th December, 53 Brigade had concentrated in the eastern foothills of the Mayu Range, four miles south of Letwedet. Forward elements of 82 (West African) Division had debouched from the Tunnels, passed through 51 Brigade, and had reached Buthidaung and Baguna. By the 15th December, 2 (West African) Brigade had secured Buthidaung and cleared it of the enemy, and 82 (West African) Division had secured its first objectives. The advance of 15 Indian Corps was thus success- fully launched on both the 25th and 82nd Divisional fronts."

            "description": "1 This despatch covers reports by Lieut.- General T. J. Hutton and by General The Honourable Sir Harold R. L. G. Alexander describing the operations in Burma between 15th December, 1941, when the defence of Burma became the responsibility of the Com- mander-in-Chief in India, and 20th May,\u2019 1942, when the last troops of the Burma Army were withdtawn across the frontier into India. The despatch is intended to explain how the general strategical situation affected operations in Burma and to record the actions I took as the Commander chiefly responsible for them. Although the defence of Burma was three times transferred from one Command to another dur- ing the period, I remained personally respon- sible except for a period of about one week at the end of February, 1942."
