SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 2 JANUARY, 1947

relating aircraft tracks to notifications of flights
previously given. This was clearly an unsatis-
factory situation but one which had to be
accepted in the circumstances. There is no
doubt that every step should be taken to hasten
the production of a really effective mechanical
method of indicating friendly aircraft, and I
consider that a great deal more scientific study
should be devoted to this subject in the future.

Balloon Defence.

510, In any future amphibious operation simi-
lar to Operation ‘‘ Neptune ”’ which is mounted
from a country in which exists a balloon de-
fence with all its attendant facilities, the cheap-
ness and comparative ease of providing balloon
protection unquestionably makes Balloon De-
fence profitable if there be any likelihood of
low-level attacks by enemy aircraft. For an
operation despatched from an area in which no
such facilities exist, the necessary lift in hydro-
gen, packed balloons, and ancillary equipment
to provide for initial inflation and to meet a
high casualty rate would, I consider, be justi-
fied only if the enemy air effort was expected
to be unusually strong and determined.

Operational Items.

511. The enemy air effort, taken as a whole,
was mediocre throughout. The lack of effi-
ciency and the low operational effort of the
G.A.F., especially during the critical assault
stage, were largely the result of previous atten-
tion paid to the G.A.F., his loss of Radar cover-
age, and of attacks on its bases and installations,
which constantly compelled him to change his
operational aerodromes and A.L.G.’s and to
operate his fighters outside effective range of the
assault area and shipping lanes.

512. As was forecasted in our early plan-
ning, marked Allied air superiority made it pos-
sible to use heavy night bombers by day with
outstanding success, and relatively slight losses,
since, if necessary, they could be escorted by
our fighters.

513. The fighter bomber proved to be a battle-
winning weapon. It showed tremendous power
in breaking up and destroying enemy concen-
trations, especially of armour, and contributed
greatly to the paralysis of enemy road and rail
Movement.

514. Heavy bombers can be employed to de-
cisive effect in a tactical role. A special treatise
on the principles of their employment in sup-
port of the land operations has been issued
jointly by 2x Army Group and A.E.A.F., with
the blessing of Supreme Headquarters, Allied
Expeditionary Force, and is now being con-
sidered by the U.S. Army and Air Force

515. The enemy’s Radar cover was effectively
disrupted and neutralised by air attacks,
and in consequence the enemy was virtually
‘* blinded ”’ at the time of the.assault.

516. Because of the possible risk of bombing
our own: land forces, Army Commanders in
some instances insisted on the bomb line being
pushed too far ahead of the line of our forward
troops. This often proved a handicap to the
effective ‘use of tactical support aircraft. The
land forces should accept a bomb line as close
as possible to our front line, and be prepared
to run some small risk of casualties in order to
enable the air to give them the maximum: close

support. The fixing of the bomb line for pre-
determined direct support when heavy bombers
are participating in a co-ordinated land /air
operation is, of course, a separate issue.

517. Armed reconnaissance of roads, rail lines
and the Seine crossing by Mosquitoes of British
Second Tactical Air Force during the hours of
darkness proved extremely effective and discon-
certing to the enémy. Intruder action of this
kind could have been most effectively extended
had more forces been available.

518. The value of good photographic recon-
naissance cannot be overstated. Our resources in
normal high altitude photographic reconnais-
sance were on the whole adequate, but here too
the weather adversely affected the fulfilment of
the reconnaissance programme after D-Day.
There were long periods of inactivity when lack
of strategic intelligence relating in particular to
movements in rearward areas and to damage in-
flicted by our bombing, had serious conse-
quences and sometimes even frustrated our
plans.

519. The absence of an intermediate and low
altitude photographic reconnaissance aircraft
became apparent very early on, and a few
armed Mustang III had to be converted at
R.A.F. Station Benson for this special type of
photography. There should be one medium
altitude and one high flying flight in each photo-
graphic reconnaissance unit.

520. It also clearly emerged that the control
of photographic reconnaissance of all types for
commitments outside the allotted tactical area
must be centralised in one authority. The for-
mation of the Combined Reconnaissance Com-
mittee at Uxbridge, which filtered and took
action on demands for reconnaissance from all
quarters satisfied this requirement.

521. The need for a highly efficient mapping
and target section which could turn out the
necessary material at the shortest notice was
fully appreciated before ‘‘ Neptune’’ was
launched. Experience proved that the person-
nel and the facilities at the disposal of the Sec-
tion were not adequate for the multiple tasks
by which it was faced. It is impossible to pre-
pare in advance dossiers of every possible target
which the air forces may have to hit. The only
solution is to have available as large an
organisation as may possibly be necessary for
the task of turning out with a minimum of delay
the material that might be demanded of it.

522. Modifications to the system of supply
of maps were found to be necessary during the
campaign. The changes made, as described
earlier in this Despatch, indicate the lines along
which I feel future plans for map supply
should be made.

523. Unless signal fadilities are much in-
creased and well planned in advance, and staffs
given ample time to develop them, major
operational and administrative headquarters,
when they move, are likely to get out of touch
with each other and with forward headquarters
and sources of intelligence. The direction of
air operations would at times have been more
easily and effectively achieved if the moving
of headquarters had been postponed until
adequate communications between the Con-
tinent and the United Kingdom had been
established.
