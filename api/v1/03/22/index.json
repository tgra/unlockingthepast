            "description": "The main attack by 30 Corps began at 2230 hours on 20th March when 50 Division advanced to the assault under cover of very heavy artillery fire and following an air bombardment. The Wadi Zigzaou, which ran in front of the enemy’s positions in this sector, was very deep and steep-sided and the bottom was everywhere muddy and in some places had standing water in it. It resembled, in fact, the fosse of an old-fashioned fortress and our troops advanced to the assault carrying fascines and scalingladders as though at the storm of Badajoz. The enemy’s fire, both frontal and enfilade, was very heavy and it was only by the greatest dash and courage that our advanced troops succeeded in crossing the wadi and establishing themselves on the far bank. Three of the powerful enemy strongpoints were captured and the infantry were firmly established. Unfortunately it was proving impossible to reinforce them, for the wadi which they had crossed on foot was quite impassable for wheels and almost impassable for tanks. A few of the supporting “‘ Valentines ’’ managed to get across ‘but none of the anti-tank guns could be brought forward. A heavy downfall of rain on the 2and added to our difficulties. As a result, when the enemy in the afternoon of 22nd March put in a heavy counter-attack, using the whole of 15 Panzer Division and part of go Light, our position became untenable. 50 Division  bridgehead was dangerously narrowed down and on the night of the 23rd our troops fell back once more, on orders, across the Wadi Zigzaou, under cover of artillery fire.",

            "description": "57. I discussed this matter with my operational commanders, and decided that in view of the forthcoming offensive in Italy, it was mostimportant that the fighter and fighterbomber strength of M.A.T.A.F. should not be reduced, and that because of the preliminary success of Marshal Tito’s offensive in Jugoslavia, the strength of B.A.F. should also be maintained as far as possible. On 22nd March, therefore, I replied to the Chief of the Air Staff, proposing an alternative programme of reductions, which would provide the same savings in manpower, and yet not affect the air power available for the direct support of the land forces. At the same time I strongly recommended that earnest consideration should be given to the possibility of postponing all reductions for this theatre until after the end of May, when it was expected that the operations then imminent would have passed their critical phase; and if that were not possible, that at least the postponement of the disbandment of 2 heavy bomber squadrons, and one light bomber squadron, which I had included in my programme, should be considered.",

            "description": "131. The main hindrances to the operations of the P.R. Force continued, even in the campaigning season, to be factors inseparable from flying in the tropics rather than the opposition of the enemy, which remained slighter than was usual in other theatres of war. Successful cover of the waterfront at Akyab, for instance, was secured in November, 1944, by two Spitfires flying at from 50 to 200 feet, at neither of which a shot was fired. But the lengthening range of Mosquito sorties month by month bore witness to the mastery of climate and terrain. Jt was in December, 1944, that the first cover of Puket Island was obtained, in the course of a flight involving a round trip of 2,100 miles, which marked the furthest penetration to be made in this area. This record was, however, eclipsed by another aircraft which in January flew 2,431 air miles in eight hours and 20 minutes to cover Moulmein and the railway from Bangkok to Phnom Penh. Finally on 22nd March a Mosquito XVI broke the long distance record for this type of aircraft in any theatre of war with a flight of 2,493 air miles in eight hours forty-five minutes, covering the BangkokSingapore railway to a point south of the Malayan frontier. It was thus that the Mosquito made amends for the structural defect which had seriously curtailed its use during November and December, 1944.",

            "description": "I therefore decided to recast the whole plan. T took the decision on 3rd May, based on a conference on 2nd May which I had been prevented from attending by impossible flying weather, to cancel the American assault in the west and transfer the whole weight of Seventh Army to the south-east of the island, on the immediate left of Eighth Army. I decided, in fact, to take a risk on the administrative side rather than the operational risk of dispersion of effort. This was contrary to what had hitherto been regarded as one of the fundamental principles of the operation: that we must capture Palermo at the earliest possible opportunity if we were to have a hope of maintaining sufficient forces for the reduction of the . island. On my new plan the only ports we should be certain of capturing in the first stage would be Syracuse and Augusta, the latter more a naval anchorage than a port, and possibly Catania; the whole of Seventh Army would have to depend on beach maintenance except for such help as it might get from the small port of Licata which, as already stated, was only rated at a capacity of six hundred tons a day.* The risk was therefore grave, but there were two factors which brightened the prospect. The first was that there was a reasonable probability of suitable weather in July for beach maintenance. The second was the coming of the Duxw. I need not describe these ingenious amphibious vehicles, which are now familiar to everyone, but it is interesting to note, in view of the great part they later played, that I had never seen one up to that time. General Millert, my Major General, Administration, had received advance reports and had ordered large quantities from the United States on 22nd March. When they arrived it was discovered that the claims made for them were fully justified by their performance. It is not too much to say, indeed, that the Duxw revolutionised the problem of beach maintenance. Nevertheless I arranged that Eighth Army should meet the commitment of providing a thousand tons per day through Syracuse for Seventh Army from D plus 14 to supplement their maintenance over the beaches until they could capture and bring into use the port of Palermo.:",

            "description": "129. But we ourselves were now faced again with the ever recurrent crisis of transport aircraft. General Sultan had agreed to hand over 36 British Division to Fourteenth Army, for General Slim to use for mopping-up work in the Mandalay area, with a view to the release of 19 Indian Division into Army reserve. 36 British Division would in any case have to be flown out to India as soon as possible as it could not be maintained for long, and it also needed ‘a rest after a year’s continuous fighting. An examination of the position on the 19th March had shown that we had insufficient transport aircraft to meet our present needs. This was likely to have the serious result that another division—probably a British one— would have to be flown out in April to relieve the supply situation. Further, I felt that the time had come when we should start to insure against the probable removal of the United States aircraft in the fairly near future. Admiral Mountbatten accordingly held a conference at my Tactical Headquarters at Monywa on the 22nd March, to discuss air supply. The following attended: LieutenantGeneral Sultan, Air-Marshal Park, MajorGeneral Stratemeyer, Lieutenant-General Slim, Major-General Fuller and Air Vice-Marshal Vincent. All the resources in transport aircraft which could be made available were to be used to help Fourteenth Army in their battle of annihilation and their subsequent dash for Rangoon. I asked for sufficient aircraft to enable me to keep 2 British Division in Fourteenth Army, and for a few over to enable General Christison to continue mobile operations in Arakan to contain the enemy there. Owing to the nature of the country, operations up the An track or inland from Taungup were impracticable on an effective scale without air supply. I also suggested that as many now unwanted American and Chinese troops as possible should be flown out, so as to release transport aircraft for Fourteenth Army. But I insisted that no transport aircraft could be spared for this task from those supplying my forces at this critical stage.",
