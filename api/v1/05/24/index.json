Brigade of the rath (A) Division could concentrate in the Dalle-Soddu area soon and could relieve rrth (A) Division of all ison duties, and protect its rear, This would release the two South African battalions to proceed to Berbera for embarkation, and would free the whole of gand E.A. Brigade for the further advance. In order to enable an advance also to be made on the Addis Abeba-Gimma road, where the enemy were holding a position at Abalti south- west of the Omo, I arranged to transfer the Nigerian Brigade to this front. To do this I relieved the 1st Nigeria Regiment in Addis Abeba by garrison troops and moved up 1/1 K.A.R. which had in the meantime been simi- larly relieved. As time was all important so"

            "description": "+ x. The narrative portions of this despatch have been compiled from the war diaries and other records of the General Staff at G-H.Q. These have been supplemented by war diaries, including those of the Swayne Mission, and by diaries, notes and records made by various commanders and staff officers at the time, or within a few days of their arrival in England. The records of the General Staff at G.H.Q. are only partially complete for the period roth\u201418th May, owing to some papers having been destroyed at Boulogne, and a portion of the records for 31st May lost at sea. Some records of less importance were burnt at Hazebrouck to avoid possible capture and others were destroyed in a lorry which caught fire near Cassel on or about 24th May."
