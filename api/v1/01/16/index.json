            "description": "396. As has already been narrated in Sec- tion II of this Report, by the 16th January, 1942, all Air Force units in Malaya had been driven back to Singapore Island. Even with the existing strength, aerodromes on the island were already congested, they would become more congested when reinforcements, now well on their way, arrived. The scale of Japanese air attack against these aerodromes was increas- ing. It had become imperative to disperse more widely Extra elbow room was par- ticularly desirable because H.M.S. \u2018\u2018 Indomit- able,\u201d\u2019 with 48 Hurricanes on board, was due to arrive at the end of January. If bomber units could be transferred to Sumatra, not only would they be dispersed more safely, but fighter squadrons could then be distributed to all the aerodromes in Singapore. It was not realised at the time how soon three of those aerodromes \u2014Tengah, Sembawang and Seletar\u2014would be- come untenable (para. 360)."
