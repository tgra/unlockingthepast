General Tuker had previously obtained permission to withdraw further to Cirene and El Faidia, and the qth Indian Division retired to that line without delay.

            "description": "I returned to my General Headquarters on the 1st February disquieted by the failure of the Eighth Army to check the enemy advance. The weakness of our armour was particularly disturbing, and I doubted whether we might not have to withdraw to the frontier positions. When I got back to Cairo, however, I found that the prospects of rebuilding our armoured force reasonably quickly were better than I had supposed, and I decided to try to hold Tobruk, since to possess it would undoubtedly make it very much easier to resume the offensive. I therefore sent General Ritchie preliminary instructions to hold the enemy as far west as possible without risking the destruction or isolation of the Eighth Army west of the Egyptian frontier."

            "description": "of rolling country that 29th Indian Infantry Brigade had to make its way ever since leaving Aicota. The advance of 2gth Indian Infantry Brigade compared with that of the other brigades was slow. This was due to the rearguard actions fought, the enemy's use of mines, and the fact that this brigade could be given no troop-carrying transport. Only one demolition of any size was encountered by this brigade when on reaching a road bridge approximately 12 kilos west of Barentu they found it severely blown and an alternative route through the bushes: heavily mined. This, however, did not impose any great delay, the artillery supporting 2gth Indian Infantry Brigade being brought forward into action with praiseworthy energy and determination. On 1st February, No. 2 M.M.G. Group S.D.F., having worked its way across-country, carried out a successful raid on the road running east from Barentu where it inflicted heavy casualties on an enemy Colonial Battalion Which was withdrawing eastwards. During the night 1/2nd February, the enemy evacuated Barentu, and, on the early morning of 2nd February, roth and 2gth Indian Infantry Brigades occupied the town. An immediate pursuit to the limit of endurance was ordered and taken up by No. 2 M.M.G. Group S.D.F. assisted by the R.A.F. The enemy suffered casualties all the way. He was intending to reach Arresa and the escarpment  by way of an old track which had been allowed to become overgrown. This track ran through from Barentu via Scipitale Defile Tole and thence up the Torrenti Ambessa to Adi Raghebla. Some miles beyond Adi Raghebla the track descends steeply into the valley of the Mai Terageit and here the enemy finally abandoned the last of his vehicles and guns. Only one light car and possibly one motor cycle reached Arresa. The rest of the enemy force escaped as a weary and disorganised rabble."

By 1st February the enemy was on the move, pursued by the mechanised column consisting of the carriers of 9th Indian Infantry Brigade and a Motorised Company of 3/12 Frontier Force Regiment, preceded by a detachment of 21 Field Company, Sappers and Miners. The enemy's retirement on this front was much less hurried than on the 4th and 5th Indian Divisional lines of advance and great delay was imposed by his lavish use of mines along the seventy miles from Metemma to Chelga. It was in clearing these mines that Second-Lieutenant Bhagat of 21 Field Company, Sappers and Miners, earned his V.C. for cool and conspicuous gallantry and endurance over a long period. After crossing the River Gandwa, where our mechanised column first made contact with the remnants of the Italian garrison of Karawa which was retreating in disorder harassed by the patriots, steady progress was made, and by roth February, contact was made with the Abyssinian patriots jn Wahni. By 13th February, 9th Indian Infantry Brigade, less 3/12 Frontier Force Regiment, was concentrated in Gedaref, leaving 3/12 Frontier Force Regiment supported by 144 Field Regiment, less one battery, 21 Field Company and one troop of   X   Light A.A. Battery, Sudan Regiment, in the areas Metemma Gandwa  Wahni. Part II."
