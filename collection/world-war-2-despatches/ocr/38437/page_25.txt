SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 20 OCTOBER, 1948

the rockets were coming from an area so remote
that armed reconnaissance of it could not be
performed with maximum efficiency by fighters
operating from this country. Unfortunately the
airfields on the Continent which had fallen
into Allied hands were already so congested
that facilities for my aircraft to operate from
them could not be provided. I could not resist
the conclusion that the task must now be done
by a force based on the Continent. Accord-
ingly, at the end of September the Second Tac-
tical Air Force assumed responsibility for
armed reconnaissance of the firing areas. Air
Marshal Coningham’s headquarters in Brussels
was not well placed, however, for the detailed
work of collating intelligence on this subject,
which came from a variety of sources; and we
arranged that this should continue to be done at
my headquarters, where good communications
existed. From the rst October onwards, there-
fore, my intelligence staff transmitted to
Brussels a daily signal—for which we coined
the name ‘‘ Benrep ’—containing a brief
appreciation of the most recent information and
a note of the areas in which armed reconnais-
sance seemed most likely to be fruitful.

190. Rockets continued to fall near Norwich
during the first half of October, but on the 3rd
October, as we shall see, London also became
a target once again. Thereafter little evidence
of firing from Garderen was forthcoming, and
most of the rockets apparently aimed at Nor-
wich seemed to come from northern Holland.
The evidence of the radar pointed to the shores
of the Zuyder Zee and the islands of Vlieland
and Terschelling; and secret informants con-
firmed the presence of firing points in wooded
country near Rijs, in the former area.

rgi. Altogether, from the 25th September
onwards, some 36 rockets apparently aimed at
Norwich ‘ell on land or close enough to the
shore to be reported. Not one fell inside the
city, although the enemy’s shooting against
Norwich was actually somewhat better than
that against London, inasmuch as the rounds

‘that reached this country were more closely

grouped. The last round of this phase fell on
a farm in Norfolk soon after half-past seven on
the morning of the 12th October.

192. Meanwhile fighters of the Second Tac-
tical Air Force visited a number of suspected
firing areas in the course of the operations of
wider scope which they were conducting in
support of the campaign on land. Apart from
a few trails, however, their pilots saw nothing
that threw much light on the activities of the
firing troops. But by the end of the attack on
Norwich.a number of fresh factors had com-
bined to produce a new situation, which ulti-
mately led to a further change in the allocation
of responsibility for armed reconnaissance.

{g) The Attacks: Third Phase (London, 3rd
October to 18th November, 1944).

193. Among the most important of these
factors was the resumption of attacks on Lon-
don. On the 3rd October an agent reported
that the firing troops might be in the process of
returning to the Hague. Sure enough, late that
evening a rocket fell at Leytonstone—the first
in Greater London for a fortnight. More
followed on the 4th and 7th. By the middle of
the month—when attacks on Norwich ceased—
the new phase of activity against the capital
seemed to be settling down to a rather unsteady

5609

average of two or three rounds a day. The
degree of concentration achieved was about the
same as in September, but the mean point of
impact was further east. ;

194. So far as we could judge, the Germans
were now firing at London from some half-
dozen wooded parks and open spaces within
the built-up area of the Hague and on its
southern outskirts. Possibly a few sites else-
where were being used as well. The firing
troops were said to have taken over a lunatic
asylum in the suburb of Bloemendaal and to be
storing rockets and equipment in the grounds
and neighbouring woods. In addition, inform-
ants who had usually proved reliable in the
past reported that vehicles and equipment were
stored in a wooded park adjoining the Hotel
Promenade, in the centre of the town. We
were told that supplies were reaching the Hague
by way of the goods station at Leiden, and that
Jaden railway trucks were often parked at the
main railway station in that town.

195. All this information, and much more
besides, we passed to the headquarters of the
Second Tactical Air Force by means of the
daily “ Benreps’’. Officers from my head-
quarters visited Brussels to give Air Marshal
Coningham’s staff the benefit of such experi-
ence as we had gained in the first three weeks
of the campaign. Both in the ‘‘ Benreps ” and
verbally we stressed the desirability of confirm-
ing by visual reconnaissance the intelligence
obtained from other sources, More than this
we could not do. The responsibility for con-
ducting tue armed reconnaissance sorties which
alone enabled visual observations to be made
now rested solely on the Second Tactical Air
Force; and according to a recent decision of the
Air Commander-in-Chief, this situation was un-
affected by the resumption of firing from the
Hague.

196. Whatever the merits of this decision, as
far as I was concerned the situation to which
it led had one grave disadvantage: Air Marshal
Coningham, with his many commitments in the
battle area, could spate few aircraft for sub-
sidiary tasks. Instead of making sorties over
the Hague expressly for the purpose of observ-
ing and harassing the firing troops, as my forces
had been able to do, the Second Tactical Air
Force was obliged to rely on its general pro-
gramme of armed reconnaissance over the
enemy’s lines of communication. This method
of tackling the problem was probably right in
the circumstances; but from my point of view
it had several shortcomings. It left us without
any means of judging the effect of so indirect
a counter-measure; nor did it throw any light
on what the enemy was doing at the Hague
or meet our demand for visual reconnaissance
of suspected areas. Indeed, from the date when
the Second Tactical Air Force assumed respon-
sibility for armed reconnaissance up to the
17th October—when this issue came to a head
—we were without any report to say that pilots
of that Command, while engaged on these
duties, had seen or attacked anything on the
ground which could be associated with long-
Tange rockets.

197. Another factor which helped to give a
new aspect to the problem created by the A-4
was an increasing scale of attack on Continental
cities. By the middle of October well over
roo rockets were known to have fallen on the
Continent; and with the capture of Antwerp,
