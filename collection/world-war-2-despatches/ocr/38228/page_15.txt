SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 11: MARCH, 948

backloading of valuable and vital stores from
Rangoon to the extent that would otherwise
have been possible; and great confusion and
waste of effort in the Irrawaddy Flotilla
Company.

45. The Base. The base must be far enough

in rear of the zone of operations to obviate the
need to move it. Rangoon was too far for-
ward. Base installations should have been
sited in Upper Burma before the outbreak of
war.
. The force was too highly equipped with
M.T. for the terrain which in the main de-
manded a very comprehensive employment of
pack transport.

The tendency of many Burma units, in-
cluding administrative units, to disintegrate
has caused administrative confusion and in-
efficiency apart-from the effect on operations.
Owing to demands for administrative units in
the Middle East and elsewhere, Burma was
advised to raise as many of such units as she
could from available indigenous material. This
is not generally possible under war conditions
and the personnel available were quite un-
reliable.

46. Transport Units landed without their
transport which had to be improvised. Impro-
vised transport impaired fighting efficiency
and was instrumental in lowering morale. As
the theatre of operations approached Rangoon
it was essential that transport should sail in the
same ship (or the same convoy) as the unit to
which it belonged. As it was troops had to go
into battle as soon as they landed, without
transport, and much equipment was lost in
consequence.

Transport has been very short and but for
620 lorries presented by the Generalissimo
from Lease-Lend the force would have been
immobilised.

Transport for supplying the Chinese armies
was obtained by taking up large amounts of
civilian transport employed’ on the Burma
road. A complete firm with its staff, work-
shops, spares and lorries was eventually taken
over as an army unit and proved invaluable.
The drivers, however, were local civilians who
proved of very doubtful quality.

47. Discipline. The continued withdrawal
and the inevitable straggling resulting from
fighting in thick jungle undoubtedly affected
discipline to a considerable extent. The pre-
sence of a large number of young officers and
soldiers accentuated this.
It is a mistake to ‘‘ make units up”’ with
recruits and young officers just before they go
on service. It would be better to send them
into their first battle below strength and to
make them up gradually later when the trained
men have become accustomed to war condi-
tions.

Sunilarly it would be better to send units
into battle on a low scale of equipment and
transport than to make them up to a new
scale to which they are unaccustomed, when
they are just on the point of embarkation.

48 Provost, etc The lack of Provost, Rest
Camps and Mess Units has all tended to break
down administration and, therefore, to impair
discipline.

The units from India were undoubtedly
handicapped owing to the lack of interpreters
or liaison personnel who could speak the local

1681

language. Every effort was made to remedy
this deficiency which had not been foreseen in
pre-war plans.

The composition of brigades and divisions
has constantly been changed which is not con-
ducive to the maintenance of an esprit de
corps. Great stress is laid in India on this
factor during training, and it is regrettable that
owing to unavoidable causes, the shortage of
troops and of reinforcements, and heavy
casualties, brigades and even units had to be
broken up.

49. Disembarkation One of the best adminis-
trative achievements during the period has been
the disembarkation arrangements, especially
during the period subsequent to the 21st Feb-
tuary. Lack of civilian dock labour, frequent
changes of orders, a virtual breakdown of
transportation all tested the embarkation staff
to the full. Lieut.-Colonel Hallett, the chief
embarkation staff officer, is to be congratulated
on a very fine achievement in that disembarka-
tion was so quickly and successfully carried out
under most difficult conditions.

50. Medical. Medical staff had to be created
and although medical conscription had been
accepted it had not been enforced to any con-
siderable extent by a committee appointed by
the Burma Government. Many potential
medical officers were thus lost.

The Indian Hospital Corps (I.H.C.) have
been satisfactory. The Burma Hospital Corps
(B.H.C.} poor originally in quality and quan-
tity, has failed badly in the time of stress
owing to mass desertions. The B.H.C. was
eventually in danger of disintegrating
altogether.

Sweepers, cooks, water carriers and washer-
men were difficult to find after the bombing

.of Rangoon. ~

Lack of transport has been a serious handi-
cap. Two Motor Ambulance Sections arrived
with no cars. One improvised Motor Ambu-
lance Section has never had more than 15

cars. All were Fords and all broke their
backshafts. Field ambulances arrived without
transport. .

Every medical unit must have transport of
some kind included in its War Equipment
Table (W.E.T.). Field medical units must be
self mobile. It is impossible to get transport
from any pooled sources in a crisis, and so
valuable equipment is lost.

All existing medical services were badly han-
dicapped by the cheeseparing policy adopted
when they were raised. Burma Army units
were raised on a reduced scale totally inade-
quate for their work.

Two improvised Ambulance Trains were pro-
vided initially. They were not good, being
non-corridor, but they have been of great value
and have saved the situation many times.
Number 3 Train was made up just before the
crisis and was fortunately kept where it was
intended, on the Prome line. This has time
and again proved its value. Without these
trains medical evacuation would have
collapsed.

The initiative and resources of some members
of all classes of the medical services, especially
British, Indian and Karen, have been excellent
on many occasions, and have frequently sur-
mounted considerable difficulties and kept the
service going.
