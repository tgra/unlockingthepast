ready to land and occupy the town in the
event of such surrender. Other troops were
at short notice to follow the Irish Guards. The
bombardment, however, did not achieve the
result hoped for by the naval commander. Sub-
sequent reports indicated that the defences were
not seriously impaired, though some casualties
were inflicted upon the enemy.

9. My hopes of prosecuting the land opera-
tions more vigorously were raised by the arrival
on the 28th April of General Bethouart with a
Demi-Brigade of Chasseurs Alpins. Two
battalions of these were directed to advance, in
co-operation with Norwegian forces, from the
Gratangen area to Bjerkvik at the head of
Herjangen Fjord. One battalion co-operated
with the South Wales Borderers on the Ankenes
peninsula where the latter had been landed
whens opposition although counter-attacked
ater.

Even those first class troops, the Chasseurs
Alpins, trained as they are, to snow conditions,
found themselves very seriously hampered, in-
deed almost immobilized, by the soft deep
snow. Their small proportion of ski troops in
each battalion and a lack of snow. shoes for the
remainder proved serious handicaps. They
suffered severely from frost bite and snow blind-
ness. The troops in the front line were sub-
jected to continual low-fiying air attacks against
which, owing to the state of the ground, they
could not adequately protect themselves either
by digging or by dispersion. (Later when I
was enabled to allocate a small number of light
anti-aircraft guns to the French troops, the
effect was excellent.) Nevertheless they made
some progress and took no little toll of the
enemy.

to. On 2oth April I was ordered to send
troops to Bodo. I accordingly despatched one
company of the 1st Bn. the Scots Guards. A
few days later developments at and South of
Mosjoen were brought prominently to my notice
by the serious effects they were having upon
our Norwegian Allies, and I soon found myself
concerned with two fronts—the Narvik area
in the East and Mosjoen and Mo in the South.
For the reasons indicated in paragraph 12
below, the Southern front caused me increas-
ingly greater concern.

11. The arrival of a Demi-Brigade of the
Foreign Legion and of a Polish Brigade, coupled
with gradually improving weather conditions
and an accession of much needed equipment
(notably anti-aircraft artillery, a very limited
number of landing craft and a French company
of light tanks) facilitated the undertaking of
more active operations on the Narvik front.
On 8th May I instructed General Bethouart to
clear up the Gratangen-Bjerkvik area and to
establish artillery on the Oijord peninsula, He
was then to explore the possibility of moving
through the mountains against the strong Ger-
man concentration in the Hundalen area East
of Narvik. At the same time I instructed the

aa (Guards) Brigade (with one battalion of

asseurs Alpins ander command) to hold the
Northern end of the Ankenes peninsula firmly
and to advance on Beisfjord as soon as weather
conditions should permit.
May, accordingly, General Bethouart landed
the Demi-Brigade of the Foreign Legion at
Bjerkvik. The landing was preceded by a naval
bombardment. An enemy machine-gun on the
left flank was knocked out by a destroyer’s

guns. At this point three light tanks from
motor landing craft and about 120 infantry
from assault landing craft (followed by
infantry from ships’ boats) were able to
land with little loss and so to work their
way round the head of the Fjord to deal with
the remaining machine-guns, on the beaches,
which had not been affected by the naval bom-
bardment. Distant machine guns were still in
action when the second battalion landed on
the East shore about 2 hours later.

The operation was entirely successful. With-
out the use of tanks and armoured landing craft
it might very easily have ended in a costly
failure. It was fortunate indeed that low clouds
prevented hostile air attack during the landing.

Touch was made with the force operating
from Gratangen. The Oijord peninsula was
seized. The stage was now set for the capture
of Narvik.

12. Meanwhile the situation in the South was
causing me some concern. Continued German
advances in that area were having most serious
results upon our Norwegian Allies and, indeed
seemed likely to result in the withdrawal of all
Norwegian support from the Allied forces. I
considered that the time had come to stop these
enemy advances and I welcomed Lord Cork’s
suggestion on gth May that troops should be
despatched with that Tibiect. T had been in
constant touch with Colonel Gubbins and two
companies of Scissors Force at Mosjoen and
with one company of that Force, under Major
May, at Mo. After the abandonment of Mosjoen
I decided that energetic measures must be taken
and accordingly sent the 1st Bn. the Scots
Guards (less one company already at Bodo),
with field and anti-aircraft guns, to Mo. Mo
was doubly important as being the terminus of
the most northerly road into Sweden and as
covering the Norwegian aerodrome a few miles
to the North. Should this aerodrome fall into
the hands of the enemy it would afford him
just that extra stepping stone he needed to bring
further air forces into action in the Narvik
area.

This detachment arrived at Mo at 0400 hours
rath May without loss. Colonel Gubbins with
his two companies from Mosjoen had mean-
while withdrawn to Bodo.

At the same time I instituted arrangements
for reinforcing the detachment at Mo with Head-
quarters 24th (Guards) Brigade and ist Bn.
The Irish Guards. Before these arrangements
were completed and put into effect (they were
subsequently modified) I handed over command
to my successor.

13. It will be apparent from the preceding
paragraphs that the period of my command was
perforce chiefly one of reconnaissance and plan-
ning and of carrying out such initial offensive
operations as the climatic conditions and the
gradual building up of my force to a reason-
able fighting organisation permitted. At the
same time the task of setting the administrative
organisaticn on a sound basis fitted to deal
with projected operations and with future
expansion made tremendous calls upon the
initiative and powers of improvisation of my
staff, all under Arctic conditions of great,
though decreasing, severity. Subsidiary bases
were established at Skaanland on Sander Fjord
and in Ballangen south of the Ofot Fjord.

14. I wish to place on record my deep
appreciation of the co-operation and assistance
