The situa- tion in Benghazi thus became precarious, and orders for demolitions were issued. Prepara- tions were made for the withdrawal of all R.A.F. Units from that area, and Benina was evacuated during the early evening of znd April, all demolitions having been completed."

            "description": "53. After the occupation of Asmara on the rst April, the advance continued on Massawa. As our threat to that objective developed, five Italian destroyers based at Massawa left har- bour in a Northerly direction on 2nd April. This force was located and attacked on 3rd April by Swordfish of the F.A.A. (H.M.S. Eagle) by No. 14 Squadron (Blenheims) and No. 223 Squadron (Wellesleys). The Sword- fish torpedoed two of the destroyers, sinking one of them and leaving the second in a sinking condition, the latter being subsequently bombed and sunk by a Blenheim. A further two destroyers were driven aground on the Hedjaz Coast twelve miles South of Jedda, where they were bombed and destroyed by Blenheims and \u2018Wellesleys operating in conjunction with H.M.S, Kingston. The surviving destroyer escaped = \u2018ee to Massawa, where she scuttled"

            "description": "108. However, when the offensive started on 1gth March, it very soon became evident that it was going very well and that the risk of in- cursion by German land and sea forces had considerably diminished. Accordingly, on zand March I pressed the Supreme \u2018ALied Com- mander to approve a modified form of Opera- tion \u2018\u2018 Accomplish \u2019\u2019 named Operation \u201c\u2018 Bing- ham,\u2019\u2019 and he agreed that this operation should take place at the earliest possible date. It was therefore started on the 2nd April, and as a result No. 281 Wing, which comprised all the short range single-engined fighter squadrons in B.A.F, except the Italian ones, was fully estab- lished at Zadar by the end of April. The effect of this was to enable B.A.F. to give an in- \u2014, and closer Air Support to Marshal Tito\u2019s"

            "description": "26. On 31st March the enemy counter offen- sive against our troops in Cyrenaica began. The attacking force consisted of the 5th German Light Armoured Division and two Italian divisions (one armoured, one motorised). It was supported by a considerable air force, the enemy being numerically superior throughout the operations, although they did not make full use of this superiority, largely as a result of the initiative and aggressiveness of our R.A.F. During the first three days the 2nd Armoured Division withdrew slowly northwards, and by the evening of 2nd April was north of Agedabia. The enemy so far had not pressed his advance with much vigour. Our intention was that the armoured force should maintain a position from which they would be on the flank of any enemy advance by the main road to Benghazi and would also block any attempt to turn our posi- tions in Cyrenaica by taking the desert route to Mechili. The Commander of the 2nd Armoured Division had originally intended to counter attack the enemy north of Agedabia if oppor- tunity offered; but on being warned that no tank reinforcements were available and that he should not attack unless a specially favourable opportunity offered, he decided to continue the withdrawal. ."

As communications to the Sudan were long and difficult, transport of all kinds was limited, and the needs of the fighting forces necessarily came first, it was to their own interests not only to prevent sabotage, but to repair the railway, roads and teleferica at the earliest possible moment. It was most strongly stressed that unless the port and port facilities at Massawa were surrendered intact, together with the shipping lying in the harbour, the British authorities could not guarantee to feed the civil population of whom so many were women and children, The civil authorities agreed to assist in reopening communications and in keeping order in the city, but said they could not answer for the military authorities in Massawa."

Both the road and railway bridges were found to be blown. The enemy put up some resistance to frontal attacks, but about half a mile from his main position a place was found where the tiver could be waded, and as soon as he dis- covered his flank was being turned he withdrew. A new road bridge was built and the advance was continued next day, 3rd April. The aand E.A. Brigade reached Adama that day, and were instructed to try to cross the river Auasc at Ponte Malcasa, and attempt to cut off the enemy column which was known to be withdrawing by Sire. The bridge had been destroyed and the enemy offered considerable resistance. .A large part of the enemy column therefore escaped, though the capture of the road junction south of Ponte Malcasa some days later resulted in the cutting off of some units."
