            "description": "meant a further reorganisation of my force and a readjustment of my slender resources. Although very few reinforcements had arrived as yet, and my pilots and air crews were beginning to feel the strain of heavy and continuous operations throughout the winter months, an additional burden was now thrust upon us. I still had to provide air support for the Greeks who were being ferociously attacked in Albania by the Italians, spurred on by the presence of Mussolini himself. I had to provide air escorts for incoming convoys, also some form of air defence for the ports of disembarkation of British troops which were becoming alarmingly congested. I had to deliver occasional attacks on the Dodecanese Islands to reduce the scale of enemy attacks on convoys which were becoming embarrassingly frequent, and finally, I had to allocate a portion of my force to support the position in process of occupation by British troops. I attach as Appendix ‘‘ A ’’* to this report a memorandum which I issued on 18th March, pointing out the very parlcus condition we were in at that time and describing how I proposed to attempt an almost impossible task. Apart from the fact that all my squadrons were much below strength in serviceable aircraft, due to the heavy casualties we had suffered and the unavoidable inability to keep us supplied with replacements, the re-equipping of my fighter squadrons with Hurricanes was not proceeding as rapidly as I had hoped. Furthenmore, the arrival of reinforcing squadrons was not keeping pace with the programme decided upon and those that did arrive were much below establishment in aircraft and equipment. In spite of these difficulties and disappointments, however, I still hoped that time would be on our side and that, when the German attack developed, we would ibe in a reasonable state of preparedness to meet it.",

            "description": "Meiktila were engaged in frustrating and destroying the Japanese built-up against them, the remainder of 4 Corps was engaged in pushing back the enemy west of the Irrawaddy, and in expanding the Nyaungu bridgehead southwards towards Chauk and eastwards towards Myingyan. On the 18th March, 33 Brigade (7 Indian Division) attacked prepared positions south of Myingyan, securing the road and railway crossing. On the 21st with tank support, they forced an entry into the town, and by the 23rd the whole of Myingyan had been cleared. Meanwhile, a detachment of the same Brigade had cleared the Chindwin-Irrawaddy confluence area to the north-west. The capture of Myingyan was a very important gain since it opened the way for our Inland Water Transport (1.W.T.) on the Chindwin. The administrative plan was to transport supplies by water from Kalewa to Myingyan, and thence by rail to Meiktila. It will be remembered that we had no all-weather road from Kalewa to Shwebo ; the alternative route by water was therefore very important. A very great deal of transport and constructional effort was being expended on this I.W.T. L. of C. as can be seen in more detail in the part of this Despatch which deals with administration, and it paid good ‘dividends.",

By the 15th, they were within two miles of the Myitnge River. On this date also, 6 Brigade operating to the south of 5 Brigade against strong opposition, inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy and reached a point two miles south of Tada-U. On the 17th March, 5 Brigade captured Ava Fort, liquidating a stubborn defence and, by the 21st, Japanese pockets of resistance had been mopped up, the Ava-Mandalay road opened, and junction effected with 19 Indian Division. 6 Brigade in the meantime had reached the Myitnge River and proceeded to inflict severe casualties on the enemy retreating before 19 Indian Division. 4 Brigade, transferred from the west, passed through 6 Brigade on the 18th and continued the advance towards Sado. While 19 Indian Division continued to advance southwards, 2 British Division were deflected south-west clearing the triangle Myitnge—Myingyan— Meiktila. On the 27th March, 4 Brigade cleared Pyinzi and on the 31st reached Mahlaing. 5 and 6 Brigades cleared the area between Myitnge and Myingyan, linking up with 268 Indian Infantry Brigade at Natogyi, 17 miles east of Myingyan, on the 30th March. 268 Brigade had cleared Sagaing at the north end of the Ava bridge on the 18th March, and then advanced south-west via Myotha.",
