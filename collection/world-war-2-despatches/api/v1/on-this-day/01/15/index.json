It was intended to make contact with the main body within seven days. We were to retain the necessary landing craft until 15th January but we now thought it unlikely that we should be within supporting distance until at least roth January. By 18th December it was clear that even this date could not be met and General Clark signalled to me   reluctantly   recommending the cancellation of the operation on the grounds that the arbitrary date  set for the surrender of landing craft made it impossible to mount the attack under the conditions necessary for success. I signalled this decision to General Eisenhower on the 2Ist but informed him that I was still studying the problem in the hope of being able to prepare a modification of the original plan for a later date."

On the 28th the parachutists were finally driven from the town. All our attacks on Orsogna in the meanwhile had failed  and the enemy remained in {possession for another five months.

The development of the Allied Central Air Bureau and of its communications to the headquarters of higher formations in France and to the Royal Air Force at home, was likewise to prove its worth in the days to come as an organisation for co-ordinating information and requests for air action."

At Akyab the main stone jetties and approaches required extensive repairs, and the removal of two ships sunk alongside was necessary. In addition considerable new construction was required. Development began on the 15th January. By the 12th February, seven pontoon jetties had been built, and a fortnight later the stone jetty had been sufficiently repaired to be used for personnel. A new solid timber piled wharf 600 feet long and twelve feet wide was built in a space of six weeks, and by the end of April, not only had a wreck at the main jetty been removed  but the jetty itself had been completely repaired, all the stone for which had had to be imported. For all this work, only one Port Construction Company was employed, which carried out its task more efficiently, despite shortages of material. The target set for the development was 1,200 tons daily before the monsoon and 800 tons daily during it. By the beginning of April, the target had been exceeded and on the 3rd April a record discharge of 2,406 tons was achieved. The initial working of the port in the early stages was by 41 Beach Group ut the responsibility was handed over early in February to a Port Commandant."

The maximum scale of Japanese attack was still estimated as one division against Moulmein and one division against Kentung with possibly brigade groups against Toungoo and Mongpan. I admit that I did not at this time consider the threat to Burma serious; I over-estimated the natural difficulties of the wooded hills on the Burmese frontier. Nor did I realise the unreliable quality of the Burma units nor the lack of training of the British and Indian troops."
