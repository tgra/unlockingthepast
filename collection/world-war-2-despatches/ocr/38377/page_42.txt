bombers, dive bombers and minelaying aur-
craft attacked. An emergency turn was made
to avoid the mines and torpedoes which had
been dropped outside the starboard screen.

Very soon after this 40 torpedo bombers were
reported ahead, followed immediately by a
Stuka attack on INDOMITABLE who became
obscured by splashes and smoke.

The net result of these series of severe
attacks was FORESIGHT torpedoed aft,
INDOMITABLE 3 hits by large bombs and
several near misses, causing two large fires and
putting the flight deck out of action. There
were many near misses elsewhere in the force
but no other ships suffered damage. .

The casualties to enemy aircraft are uncertain
but INDOMITABLE’s fighters shot down 9
certain, 2 probable and 1 damaged, for the loss
of 2 fighters, x pilot being saved. One JU.87
was probably shot down by ships’ gunfire.

50. TARTAR proceeded to FORESIGHT’s
assistance and subsequently took her in tow.

51. INDOMITABLE reduced speed and
turned to the west away from the wind.
CHARYBDIS closed her and some of Force Z
destroyers were ordered to form a screen on
her.” As the time was now 1855 and the attack
apparently over, Force Z was turned to the
westward and Force X was detached.

52. At 19x14 LOOKOUT was ordered to
close INDOMITABLE to pump water on the
fires but scdon INDOMITABLE reported
“situation in hand’? and at 1927 that she
could steam 17 knots. Shortly afterwards her
‘steering gear became temporarily disabled, but
by 2030 she was in all respects ready to pro-
ceed at 20 knots and shortly after ipotted able
to make 28} knots.

+ 53. Force Z withdrew to the westward at 18
knots, speed being restricted to this by boiler
tube defects reported by RODNEY.

Part II.

Detaching of Force X until their rejoining
Force Z.

The following account of proceedings of Force
X% from the time of their detachment at
1g00/D.3 until rejoining my flag at 1800/D.5
has been compiled from the reports of Rear-
‘Admiral Commanding, roth Cruiser Squadron
and Commanding Officers of ships concerned.
In the circumstances prevailing, discrepancies,
differences and uncertainties are bound to arise
in the recording of incidents.

Wednesday, 12th August (D.3).

2. At about 1956, as Cruising Disposition
No. 21 was being taken up, H.M.S. NIGERIA
leading the port column was hit, supposedly by
a torpedo, and within a few minutes H.M.S.
CAIRO, S.S. OHIO and another M.T. ship
(probably S.S. BRISBANE STAR) were also
hit.

3. Rear-Admiral Commanding, 1oth Cruiser
Squadron is of the opinion that all these
casualties were from torpedoes fired by one or
more U-Boats, though the possibility-of the
damage being caused by mines cannot be
excluded.

4. No detection of U- Boats by visual, asdic
or radar was made. The time intervals between
the explosions were such as to make it mprob-
able as beinz the work of one U-Boat:

5. Whatever the facts, however, H.MS. .
NIGERIA at once assumed a list to port of 13°
and circled to starboard. By 2oro the ship was
under control and at 2015 was stopped to trans-
ter Rear-Admiral Commanding, toth Cruiser
Squadron and his staff to H.M.S. ASHANTI.
Very prompt damage control measures had by

this time reduced the list to 5° and by 2030

the ship was able to proceed at 14 knots for
Gibraltar, despite her being 11 feet down by the
head. H.M. Ships BICESTER and WILTON
proceeded as escort, later in the night to be
joined by H.M.S. DERWENT.

temporarily brought to a stop. but, soon after, ;
gallantly proceeded on’ their way to the!
southward.

7. H.M.S. CAIRO, whose stern was blown
off and engines disabled, was sunk by our own
forces as soon as the survivors had been taken
off.

8. The effect of this series ai disasters was
to cause the convoy to become scattered, though.
they continued on their course for Cape Bon.

y. Meanwhile, Rear-Admiral Commanding,
roth Cruiser Squadron n H.M.S. ASHANTI
proceeded to close and direct the convoy.
Whilst doing so, HM.S, ASHANTI with
H.M.S. PENN endeavoured to protect the con-
voy from an impending air attack by laying a
smoke screen against the light westerly honzon.

to. At 2038, some 25 minutes after sunset,
a severe dive bomber and torpedo bomber air
attack developed and lasted until 2100. In this
attack several M.T. ships were hit and two, S.S.
EMPIRE HOPE and GLENORCHY, blew up
or were later sunk.

rz. At 2112, H.M.S. KENYA was hit on the
fore foot by a torpedo fired by a U-Boat which
she saw. One other torpedo passed under her
and two more narrowly missed her stern. She
was able to proceed, however, and soon after
rejoined H.M.S. MANCHESTER.

12. After these attacks, II merchant ships
were proceeding on their way, of which, how-
ever, only three or four were in visual touch
with H.M. Ships MANCHESTER, KENYA and
ASHANTI in the van.

The three T.S.D.S. destroyers were ahead;
H.M.S. PATHFINDER rejoining from H.M.S.
CAIRO, and H.M.S. PENN from her
rescue work, were overtaking astern.

13. At 2130, $.S. DEUCALION, who had
been proceeding separately with H.M.S.
BRAMHAYM, sank after having been torpedoed
by a torpedo bomber aircraft near the Cani
Rocks. Having picked up survivors, H.M.S.
BRAMHAM proceeded to overtake Force X.

Thursday, 14th August (D.4).

14. At 2354 the leading ships of Force X
passed Cape Bon, and 40 minutes later two
E-Boats were detected by radar on the port
beam and engaged by all-ships. Further run-
ning fights with E-Boats occurred until near
Kelibia Light and again at 0330 when some
twenty miles from position ‘‘R’’, and during
these attacks, H.M.S. MANCHESTER at
orzo and 3 M.T. ships, SANTA ELIZA,
ALMERIA LYKES and ‘WAIRANGI, were hit.
H.M.S. ASHANTI reports that near Kelibia
