KIPLING, KBLVIN and JACKAL - had |

left Malta at 2130/21st May and-had orders

. to join Force: Ar to the west of Crete at

(f) D.r4 int * JERVIS with NIZAM and

ILEX had returned to ‘Alexandria to refuel -

and were now steering for the Kaso Strait.

(g) D.to in STUART: with “VOYAGER
and VENDETTA had left Alexandria on the
21st May with orders to join orce ATI.

27. \At .0830 Force C was. ‘steering: towards
Milo when a single caique was sighted. This
caique, which was carrying German troops,
was sunk by PERTH whilst NAIAD engaged

large numbers of aircraft who were bombing. ©

At og09 CALCUTTA reported a small merchant
vessel ahead’ and destroyers were ordered to
sink her. At. 1000 Force C ‘was 25 miles south
of the eastern corner of Milo. PERTH had
rejoined after sinking the caique but NAIAD
was still some way astern, Ten minutes later

an enemy destroyer with four or five small .

sailing vessels -was sighted to the northward.
Our destroyers immediately gave chase, whilst
PERTH and NAIAD engaged the enemy
destroyer, causing her to retire under smoke.
KINGSTON .engaged an enemy destroyer at
7,000 yards, claiming two hits,
ported sighting a large number of caiques be-
hind the smoke screen, which the enemy
destroyer was now making. Although in con-
tact with the enemy convoy, .C.S.15 considered
that he.would jeopardise his whole force if he
proceeded any further to the northward.
H.A.. ammunition was beginning to run low.
The speed of his force, which he considered
must be kept together in face of the continuous
air attacks, was limited to 20 knots, on account
of CARLISLE’s maximum speed being
‘ax knots: C.S.15, therefore, decided to with-
draw and -ordered the destroyers to. abandon
the. chase. The Commander-in-Chief, -Medi-
terranean’s message timed o94x of 22nd May,
which showed ‘that this convoy was of con-
siderable size, was not seen by CSiz5 until
after 1100.

. 2%. Force C was bombed practically con-
tinuously from, 0945 for three and a half hours.
NAIAD was damaged by near misses which
put two turrets out of - action, flooded ‘sevéral
compartments ‘and reduced ‘her speed to
16 knots: CARUISLE was hit but not seriously
damaged. ‘At 1321 Force Ar was sighted
coming up.to the Kithera Channel from the
westward, in response to an appeal for support
from C. S.15.

29. During the night arst/aand. Mey, Force
B (GLOUCESTER and FIJI: with GREY-
HOUND and GRIFFIN) had been patiolling
off Capé Matapan. “Instructions from the Com-
marider-in-Chief, Mediterranean to proceed to
Heraklion with all despatch reached them, too
Tate to be tarried out; but they entered. the
Aegean, and, at daylight, were about 25 miles
north of Canea.
Force Az, Force B’ was attacked by dive
, bombers’ almost pay from’ 0630 for
_one and a half hours.’ FIJI received slight
damage and GLOUCESTER superficial damage
during .these attacks. Force.B joined Force
Ar at: 0830/22nd May. . t

31. CS. 7: had decided that he would | mi t
Force C in the Kithera Channel ‘about 1530.
Meanwhile he.continued to patrol with Fortes

- A, B and D between 20 and 30 miles to the

west of the channel, apparently, to use his own
words, “‘ serving.a useful Purpose by attracting
enemy . aircraft.”

32. At 1225, C.S.7 heard from €.S.15 that
NAIAD was badly damaged and in need of
support. C.S.7 immediately decided to enter
the Aegean and ‘increased to 23 knots.

33. ‘CS.7 sighted A.A. shell bursts from
Force B at 1312. Twenty minutes later WAR-
SPITE, in which C.S.7 was wearing his flag,
was hit by a bomb which wrecked the star-
board 4” and 6” batteries.

. 34. At.1320 GREYHOUND was detached
from Force Ar to sink a large caique between
Pori and Anti Kithera Islands. Shé success-
fully accomplished this and was returning to
her position on the ‘screen when at 135] she
was hit by two bombs and 15 minutes later
sank stern first in approximate position 270°
Pori Island 5 miles. C.S.15 (who was thé
senior officer. of forces present) ordered
KANDAHAR ‘and KINGSTON to pick up sur-
vivors from GREYHOUND. At 1402 C.5.15
ordered FIJI, and, five minutes later, GLOU-
CESTER, to give KANDAHAR ‘and KINGS-
TON .A.A; support and to stand by GREY-
HOUND until dark. These'rescuing ships and
the men s' in the water were subjected
to almost continuous bombing and machine gun
attacks, C.S.15 did not realise at first how
little A:A. ammunition was left in GLOU-
CESTER and FIJI. At 1413 C.S.15 asked
C.S.7 for close support as his force ‘had ‘prac-
tically no ammunition left. ‘Force Ar closed
Force C at WARSPITE’s best speed (18 knots)
and C.S.7 who, was feéling uneasy about the
orders given to GLOUCESTER and FIJI, in:
formed C.S.15 about the state of their H.A:
ammunition. At 1457 C.S.15 ordered GLOU-
CESTER and FIJI to withdraw, with ships in
company, at their discretion. :

35. At 1530 GLOUCESTER and FIJI were
sighted coming up astern of Force Az at high
speed, engaging enemy aircraft. ‘At ‘about
1550 GLOUCESTER was hit by several bombs
and immobilised in approximate position 294°
Pori 9 miles. She -was badly on fire and her
upper deck was a shambles. In-view of the
continuous air attacks, FIJI reluctantly decided
that she must leave GLOUCESTER. FIJI
reported .the situation to C.S.15. After. con-
sulting C.S.7, C.S.15 decided that to take the
battléfleet back if support of GROUCESIER
would only be risking more ships.

36, Air ‘attacks on Force Ar had continued
intermittently from 1320 until 1510. -At 1645
oe high’ level attacks were. made and

ot was hit aft by two medium bombs
ee no’ serious ‘damage’ was done. :
