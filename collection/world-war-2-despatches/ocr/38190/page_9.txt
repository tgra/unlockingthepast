SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 29 JANUARY, 1948

Camber and the R.A.O.C. Depot all suffered
some damage, though casualties were few. The
civilian population in Hong Kong remained
calm, though naturally the news of early evacua-
tion of the mainland came as a considerable
shock,

29. Withdrawal of troops from the mainland
(1r/12th December).—(a) Careful plans had
been drawn up by Brigadier Mainland Infantry
Brigade, and ail troops were employed on
successive positions.

The operation was well carried out. How-
ever, HQ details of 2/14 Punjab Regt. and
some others came down on to Kai Tak aero-
drome by mistake in the darkness and became
involved in street fighting in the outskirts of
Kowloon City. A launch was. sent over at
about oroo hours but could not gain contact
with them. The bulk of the Company, how-
ever, were taken off at Star Ferry pier at dawn,
breaking off a running fight with the enemy
as they actually cast off from the pier side.

(6) Battalion HQ of the 2/14 Punjab Regt.
and two Companies had been unable to main-
tain the timed programme during the night
owing to enemy action, and at dawn they were
withdrawing down the West side of Devils Peak
Peninsula. They stayed that day dispersed in
the foothills at the southern end, whilst two
companies of 5/7 Rajput Regt. held the Ma
Lau Tong line as planned, with one company
on the rear position Hai Wan.

. (c) The personnel of both Indian battalions
were in good heart but somewhat exhausted
after four days of continuous day and night
vigilance and long night carries, over rough
tracks and coolie paths, of many machine guns,
light automatics and mortars. Owing to the
simultaneous withdrawals of all three battalions,
the 5/7 Rajput Regiment’s transport had not
been augmented by mules from the other
battalions as planned, and this emphasised the
shortage of mule transport which had always
been apparent on peace exercises. It will be
realised that units were on an improvised scale
of trucks, lorries. and mules, as pooling of the
inadequate ‘‘ Colonial ”’ establishments had been
found to be necessary. The transport situation
had become much worse with the arrival of
the two Canadian battalions, for their transport
hhad been shipped in a different vessel, diverted
via. Australia, and had not arrived before war
with Japan broke out.

? (d) At midnight 11/12th December the Hong
Kong Telephone Company cut all communica-
tions between the island and the mainland.

(e) One troop of 3.7-in. Howitzers remained
at the southern end of Devils Peak in support
of the Ma Lau Tong position. Mainland In-
fantry Brigade HQ also remained on the-Penin-
sula pending further developments.* Most of
the Bren carriers and all the armoured cars
were safely evacuated from the mainland.

(f) At o600 hours r2th December military
cables to Kowloon were cut at the RN. Yard
cable hut.

(g) At dawn 2 Royal Scots temporarily took
over the North East sector of the island de-
fences, this being largely a precautionary

‘measure only, as the occupation of the Devils
Peak Peninsula by the 5/7 Raiput Regt.
covered this sector effectively. This North East

* Owing to shortness of time communications in
the Devils Peak area were incomplete, but excellent
work by Royal Signals provided efficient field cable
circurts in time .

707

sector thad previously been manned in skeleton
form by some HQ personnel of 1 Middlesex
Regt. plus a platoon of No. 3 Company
HHKVDC. In the North West sector was ‘‘ Z °”
Company x Middlesex Regt., consisting of spare
men of machine gun companies plus battalion
cooks, storemen, bandsmen, etc., manning forty
machine guns from Fortress reserve stocks.
This Company constituted a valuable fighting
force enabling inter alia the 1 Middlesex Regt.
to man the pill boxes on the entire perimeter of
the island from 11th to 13th December.

30. Air raids and shelling of the island con-
tinued throughout the day 12th {December.
The North shore Dockyard was badly
damaged and also the R.A.O.C. Depot, which
was hut on five occasions. Aberdeen and Green
Island cables were both cut. By now many
coast defence guns, especially 6-in., were being
used for landward firing, calculations to hit one
hundred points having been worked out in
peace time. Harassing fire by night, and
counter battery fire and the engagement of
observed targets by day, was carried out.

The allowance of 25 rounds per gun for such
landward firing was greatly exceeded. High
explosive Mk XIIIA shell of 1918 manufacture
was faulty, several bursting immediately in
front of the muzzle.

31. A.A.—There were insufficient guns to
give adequate gun density at any pomt. More
3.7-in. guns were expected shortly and also
more Bofors (the garrison had but two), for
‘‘ release telegrams ’’ had been received from
HQ Far East. The A.A. defences were well
known to be inadequate, but I realised that
the call for the European and Mediterranean
theatres of war had prevented reinforcements.
Targets were numerous (12th December) but
the A:A. positions extremely few owing to the
mountainous nature of the country of Hong
Kong Island. The enemy, with such good
observation from Kowloon, was very quick on
to any A.A. section opening up, and I consider
that Lt.-Colonel F. D. Field fought his com-*
mand very well. The scarcity both of trans-
port and roads severely handicapped the
mobility of the guns and also the ammunition
supply and administration of the sections. The
shortage of British officers was very much felt.
During the night one of the A.A. searchlights
on Green Island acted as a sentry beam on
receipt of a report that the enemy were landing
near West Point.

At this juncture Wing Commander H. G.
Sullivan, the Officer Commanding R.A.F.,
offered the services of one officer and 16 N C.Os.

for wireless and telephone duties, which I gladly ~

accepted. They were incorporated with Royal
Signals.

The morale of the civilian population had
been considerably shaken, and fifth columnists
became more active. (Rice distribution and the
monetary situation caused anxiety’ and necés-
sitated urgent measures.

32. During the afternoon 12th December the
enemy was reported to be occupying George
Island (off Lamma) and there was considerable
activity seawards.*

33. In the late afternoon a strong enemy
attack (about one battalion) developed against
the left company of 5/7 Rajput Regt. on the
Ma Lau Tong line but was successfully beaten
off, assisted by quick support provided by the
