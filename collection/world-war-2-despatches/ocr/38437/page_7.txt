knowledge of the enemy’s plans. I believe,
however, that aligned with these causes was a
psychological factor. It must be remembered
that for many months past the chief threat
had seemed to come from the “ ski sites ’’.
The use of our bomber forces against the ‘‘ ski
sites ’’ had therefore been felt as a necessary,
but still an unwelcome, diversion of effort at a
time when interest was focussed on the coming
European operations. To the officers responsible
for directing offensive operations the success of
the attacks on the “‘ ski sites.’’ must have come
as a great relief. In the circumstances, they
would have been hardly human if they had not
been more reluctant than perhaps they realised
to recognise that the neutralization of the ‘‘ ski
sites ’’ had not averted the menace after all.

49. I think, therefore, that at the end of May
and in the first half of June the threat from the
“* modified sites ’’ was pnder-estimated, not in
the sense of a failure to apprehend it intel-
lectually, but in the sense that it was not felt
as keenly as the original threat from the ‘‘ ski
sites ’’ six months earlier. If it had been, I do
not doubt that the ‘‘ modified sites ’’ would
have been attacked as vigorously then—despite
their shortcomings as targets—as they were a
few weeks later, when ‘‘ Diver ’’ had begun.

50. Whether this would have had much effect
on the subsequent course of events is another
matter. The question is one to which no final
answer is possible. My own opinion is that a
well co-ordinated series of attacks on the
“* modified sites’’ during the weeks immediately
preceding the ‘‘ Diver ’’ campaign would have
been worth making, but that nothing short of
the destruction of all the sites would have pre-

vented the Germans from using their new

weapon sooner. or. later. Nor does my belief
that the menace of the ‘‘ modified sites’ was
under-estimated necessarily imply that I think
the omission to attack the sites was wrong in
the light of the knowledge available at the time.
Even if their dangerousness had been fully
realised, there would still have been strong
arguments against attacking them. And while
it is easy to be wise after the event, at the time
there was no means of knowing how imminent

the danger was. On the contrary, until some’

36 hours before the first pilotless aircraft was
launched, such intelligence as was available
suggested that the “‘ modified sites ’’ were not
likely to be used for several] weeks.*

51. The fact remains that during the first half
of June the Germans were able to press on with
their preparations to bombard us with pilotless
aircraft, virtually unmolested by our bomber
forces.

52. At that stage, one of the tasks of my
Command was to prevent German reconnais-
sance aircraft from approaching the areas where
our forces were concentrating. In this we suc-
ceeded even beyond our expectations. Partly

* On the rth June, however, the Air Ministry
received a report which stated that a train loaded
with missiles had passed westwards through Belgium
two days earlier. On the same day photographic
reconnaissance revealed unusual activity at six of
the “modified sites’. This information did not
reach my headquarters until after the German offensive
had begun; but little or nothing would have been
gained if I had received it earlier, for the defence

jan had been ready since March, and I should not
Rave ordered deployment merely on the strength of
these two reports. :

on this account, the landings in Normandy
early on the 6th June achieved complete tactical
surprise. Even on subsequent days, when the
Germans had had time to appreciate what we
were doing, air opposition was far from ener-
getic. Naturally enough, the Air Commander-
in-Chief and his staff were jubilant, and had
little time or inclination to think of pilotless
aircraft.

53. It was equally natural that my staff and
I, with our defensive preoccupations, should
not entirely share this optimism. It seemed to
us that things were going almost too well. So
much was at stake for the enemy that we dared
not believe he would let us have ev i
our own way. We could not help suspecting
that he still had something up his sleeve.

(c) The Attacks: First Phase (13th June to 15th
July).

54. Events were soon to substantiate our
doubts. Shortly after midnight on the night
of the 12th-13th June the German Jong-range
guns opened fire across the Channel. In this
there was nothing novel; what was unusual
was that for the first and last time during the
war, a town some miles from the coast was
shelled. Eight rounds fell at Maidstone, one
at Otham, two-and-a-half miles to the south-
east, and twenty-four at Folkestone. The
bombardment doubtless achieved its purpose,
inasmuch as it gave some people the impression
that a novel weapon was being used and
tended to create an atmosphere of uncertainty
and rumour. At least one Me.q1o flew over
the London area during this phase and was
shot down by anti-aircraft fire near Barking.

55. At 0400 hours the shelling stopped. A
few minutes later an observer on duty at a
Royal Observer Corps post in Kent was passed
by an aircraft which made “‘a_ swishing
sound ’’ and emitted a bright glow from the
rear. In common with all his colleagues, he
had been briefed to recognise pilotless aircraft;
and in accordance with his instructions he
shouted ‘‘ Diver ’’. The missile continued
over the North Downs ‘‘ making a noise like
a model-T Ford going up a hill’’ and fell to
earth with a loud explosion at Swanscombe,
near Gravesend, at 0418 hours. During the
next hour three more of the missiles came down
at Cuckfield, Bethnal Green, and Platt (near
Sevenoaks) respectively. No casualties were
suffered except at Bethnal Green, where six
people were killed and nine injured; in addition
a railway bridge was demolished.

56. The attack then ceased for the time
being. I came to the conclusion that so small
an effort did not justify the major re-disposi-
tion of the anti-aircraft defences required by
the ‘‘ Overlord-Diver ’’ Plan. The Chiefs of
Staff agreed. I therefore gave orders that the
plan was not to be put into effect until we
could see more clearly what was going to
happen. In. the meantime the existing defences
were authorised to engage pilotless aircraft on
the same terms as ordinary aircraft. I had
already arranged that a visual reconnaissance
of the most likely launching areas should be
flown; and at the instance of the Air Ministry
several attacks were made on three of the so-
called ‘‘ supply sites ’’ on the 13th, rq4th and
15th June. These absorbed the whole of the
bombing effort that could be spared from other
