SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZPITTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

511. By 0730 hours a strong attack had
developed against the 12 Brigade holding the
right of the position and later the attack spread
southwards. Our troops were forced back to
positions covering Bukit Panjang Village and
Bukit Panjang to the south of it and further
south to a position astride the Jurong road
covering Bukit Timah Village. “A wide gap
developed between the left of the 12 Brigade
and the right of the 6/15 Brigade.

512. On the left of the Northern Area the
Commander 11 Indian Division, finding his left
flank exposed, ordered the 8 Brigade from
divisional reserve to move westwards and re-
occupy the high ground south of the Causeway.
This it succeeded in doing by about 1000 hours.
A little later a battalion of the 8 Brigade
attacked and re-captured Hill 95 overlooking
the Causeway.

513. During the morning I ordered the Com-
mander Northern Area to despatch a force of
three infantry battalions as soon as possible
from his Area to a rendezvous east of the Race-
course to come under the orders of the Com-
mander Western Area. This force was drawn
from the 18 British Division. It was commanded
by Lt.-Col. Thomas, Commander of the
Machine-Gun Battalion, and became known as
“*Tom Force.’”” As the 18 Division was still
holding a front line sector and at this time had
only two brigades under command, it was not
possible, regrettable as it was, to send a com-
posite formation.

514. After visiting Headquarters 3 Indian
Corps and rr Indian Division I returned again
to Headquarters Western Area at 1430 hours
and instructed the Area Commander to re-
capture the Kranji-Jurong Switch Line which
I looked upon as vital for the defence of the
important Bukit Timah area where so many
of our main depots were located.

515. The orders issued by the Commander
Western Area for the counter-attack provided
for an advance in three phases as under:

(a) To secure by 1800 hours roth February
the Bukit Panjang and Bukit Gombok
features.

(b) To secure by ogoo hours 11th February
a line from a point east of Keat Hong Village
to Ulu Pandan.
(c) To re-establish by r800 hours rth
February the Kranji-Jurong Switch Line.
The first advance involved only a slight re-
adjustment of the line and was effected with-
out difficulty. An enemy attack and penetra-
tion during the night, however, prevented the
- fulfilment of the remainder of the plan, which
subsequently had to be cancelled.

516.. At the same conference I decided, after
consultation with the Commander Western
Area, who had no ground communication with
the 27 Australian Infantry Brigade, to place
that brigade temporarily under command 11
Indian Division, through whose area its com-
munications now ran.

517. On the front of the x Malaya prisade,
the forward troops of the 2 Malay Battalion
were attacked and driven back east of the River

Jurong.

. 518. Early in the afternoon the Command-
‘ing Officer of a battalion of the 44 Indian
Infantry Brigade, which had been attacked,

1319

asked for and obtained permission to make
adjustments im his dispositions. Troops of the
other battalions, seeing this movement, started
moving themselves and, before the Brigade
Commander could regain control,’ the whole
brigade had reached the village of Pasir Panjang
4 miles away. Here the brigade was re-
assembled and marched back in good order,
tired but not demoralized, to a position ,one
mile south of Bukit Timah Village. This inci-
dént is recorded to illustrate the unreliability of
semi-trained and inexperienced troops in criti-
cal situations such as that which then existed.
It was not a question of fear or cowardice. It
resulted rather from bewilderment in conditions
which were entirely strange to these raw and
untried troops. Such incidents, however, make
the conduct of a battle difficult if not impossible.

519. On receipt of information that, the
enemy were approaching Isukit Timah Village
I gave orders for the Reserve Petrol Depot,
situated just east of the village, to be destroyed
at 1800 hours. These orders were duly carried
out. ‘

520. By dusk the 12 Brigade was in posi-
tion astride the main road south of Bukit
Panjang Village where at about 2015 hours it
was attacked by enemy tanks closely supported
by infantry. The tanks broke through and
proceeded south’ towards Bukit Timah Village
but were held up for a time by the 2/29 Batta-
lion A.I.F. and other troops. About 40 tanks
were used in this attack.

521. One more infantry battalion (5 Bedfs
and Herts) was withdrawn from the Northern
Area, and at 2200 hours roth February was
placed under orders of the Commander Southern
Area with instructions to proceed to a rendez-
vous designated by him.

522. The Supreme Commander South-West
Pacific arrived at Singapore early on oth
February and left late at night. During the
day he visited all formation commanders. Be-
fore leaving he issued orders to the effect that
Singapore must be held to the last. These
orders I passed on to all ranks.

523. During this and subsequent days enemy
aircraft were very active over the forward areas
and over Singapore Town. They were now
unopposed except for anti-aircraft and small
arms fire.

1942.

524. At o630 hrs. r1th February Tom Force
moved forward astride the Bukit Timah Road
with orders to re-capture Bukit Timah Village
which was then in possession of the enemy.
On reaching the line of the railway, however,
the leading troops came under small arms fire
and were held up. On the right contact was
made in the thick country astride the pipe line
east of the Bukit Timah Rifle Range where
close-range fighting developed. The front

«stabilized on this -general line for the rest of
the morning, =; ~

525. During the night there was a great
deal of mortar and patrol activity on the
Jurong Road front and by 0830 hrs. the enemy
was attacking this position in rear from the
direction of Bukit Timah Vilage. The 6/15
Brigade and other troops on this front fell
back south-eastwards -towards Reformatory
Road south of Bukit Timah Village. The
