On the 17th February came a preparatory order from London to send two more divisions to the Far East. On the 18th Admiral Cunningham received a telegram from the Governor of Malta reporting that the supply situation in the island was extremely precarious. And a few days later J learned that an enemy convoy carrying. a large number of tanks had reached Tripoli."

            "description": "To overcome the administrative difficulties of an advance down this coast, the plan was to use barges, dhows and small ships to move both troops and stores by sea first to Aqiq, and later to open a small port at Mersa Taclai. It was intended that if this force should be used later to threaten Massawa, Marsa Kuba would be opened as well. By zoth February, a column consisting of 1 Royal Sussex had occupied Mersa Taclai and by the rath, after some minor engagements, was moving towards Nakfa and Cub Cub. 7th Indian Infantry Brigade Group gained wireless touch with 4th Indian Division on 17th February and from then on a nightly conversation in Pushtu took place between the G.S.0.I. of 4th Indian Division and the Brigade Major of 7th Indian Infantry Brigade. The first serious resistance encountered was at Cub Cub where the Battalion Garby distinguished itself. By ist March, 7th Indian Infantry Brigade Group had cleared the Mescelit Pass, some 20 kilos north of Keren, and here the advance paused for a time to concentrate its scattered units and recast its plan for the advance on Keren."

            "description": "During the early stages of the war operations on the Boma Plateau had been confined to patrol activity only. It was not until forces operating from Kenya along the west side of Lake Rudolph were ready, that the Equatorial Corps could undertake an advance into southwest Ethiopia. Maji was the centre of the Italian resistance in this area. The natives were friendly neither to the Italians nor the British and even before the war had been a constant source of trouble. Sudan forces in this area consisted of four companies of the Equatorial Corps and a nebulous force of patriots who, in this area, achieved very little. Time and resources did not allow the making o. an all-weather road across the Boma ?.ateau towards the frontier. It was therefore not possible to maintain regular forces in active operations during the rains, which, in this area, begin early in the year. On 17th February these decisions were conveyed to the O.C. Equatorial Corps, He was instructed to take steps immediately to dump forward sufficient supplies to maintain at least one company of the Equatorial Corps and the patriots, who uuumbered about 500, during the rains."

            "description": "the assault. This began on 7th February and the intention was to capture the whole area in a night attack. In actual fact the stubborn resistance of 1 Division and counter-attacks by 45 United States Division meant that five days of heavy fighting were necessary before the objective was secured on the x2th. VI Corps was now back on its   intermediate   line astride the Anzio-Albano road and it was clear that this road would be the axis of the enemy's main attack. To meet it VI Corps relieved 1 Division and handed over the sector to 56 and 45 United States Divisions. On. 17th February General Truscott, Commander of 3 United States Division* was appointed Deputy Commander of the Corps. He directed, with great success, the defence against the great Gemman counter-offensive and on the 23rd succeeded General Lucas as Corps Commander. It was a new r le, for General Truscott had made his reputation, and continued to increase it, as a dashing commander of hard-hitting offensives; indeed the defence was a new r le altogether for our armies in Italy. The troops showed, however, that they were fully equal to the demands made on them, encouraged by the massive support of our concentrated artillery fire, which was augmented by the big guns of the Allied Navies and the bombs and machinegun fire of the Air Forces,"

The figure, however, gradually increased again to 27 om the 4th March, but fell to an average of about 17 aircraft from this date until the roth March."

Directly Akyab Island was occupied, work began on expanding the existing allweather airfield so that it could accommodate three transport and three and a half tactical squadrons, with a target completion date of the 15th May.. At the same time, to meet the immediate and pressing needs of Fourteenth Anny, a fair-weather transport field for two squadrons was constructed and opened on the 17th February. Two tactical strips were also made. Fourteenth Army's rapid progress, however, made further demands on the airfield development of Akyab. A second fair-weather transport strip was called for, and an advance on the completion date for the all-weather airfield, and finally an increase in the operational capacity of the latter was required. Despite many difficulties this programme of work was completed ahead of schedule. The works on Akyab Island were begun by the Chief Engineer, 15 Indian Corps, but early in February, the responsibility was taken over by the commander of an Army Group Royal Engineers, working directly under my Chief Engineer."

The remainder of the 48 Brigade was now brought up into line on the right of 16 Indian Brigade, where both 5/17 Dogra and 8 Burma Rifles were found to have vacated their positions, To protect the right flank an organisation of watchers backed up by Burma Military Police was put in operation along the coast."
