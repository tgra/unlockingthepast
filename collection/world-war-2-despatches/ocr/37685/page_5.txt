SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 14 AUGUST, 1946

shortly afterwards our troops took possession
of the town. The railway and all railway in-

stallations up to the Turkish frontier had been

captured intact as well as several bridges which.
had been prepared for demolition.

On 8th July, a column was sent to capture
Hassetche, the seat of the local Government.
in the Bec du Canard. Here the French de-
cided not to fight and the town and fort were
occupied without opposition.

On goth July Ras el Ain was found to be
clear of French troops. Lack of motor trans-
port made further advance impossible. 5th
Battalion 13th Frontier Force Rifles therefore
remained in occupation of the Bec du Canard
covering the railway and the remainder of the
column returned to Mosul on r4th July.

26. On return of the Headquarters of ryth
Indian Infantry Brigade to Mosul, the Head-
quarters of the zoth Indian Infantry Brigade
moved to Baghdad, being better placed there
to control its detachments dispersed in the
oilfields and on the Kirkuk-Haifa pipe line.

The roth Indian Division (less 20th Indian
Infantry Brigade) remained in Syria until re-
leased for operations in Iran, it reverted to
command of the General Officer Commanding
Troops in Iraq on Ioth August. It was main-
tained throughout from Iraq and this strained
to the utmost the very limited resources in
motor transport.

Reversion of Command to India and issue of

Revised Directive. :

27. Meanwhile, in view of the collapse of
the Rashid Ali regime and the improved situa-
tion in Iraq, His Majesty’s Government con-
sidered that control of the operations should
revert to India as soon as possible as she had
a greater interest and stake in them. It was
therefore decided that the Commander-in-
Chief, India, should take over contro] of all
land forces in Iraq as soon as he was able to
meet the administrative commitment.

At 0300 hrs. on 18th June the control of
operations in Iraq passed back to the Com.
mander-in-Chief, India, and Lieut.-General
Quinan took over command of all the land
forces in that area.

On 5th July, General Sir Claude Auchinleck,
who until then had been Commander-in-Chief,
India, became Commander-in-Chief, Middle
East Forces, in succession to General Sir
Archibald ‘Wavell, who took up the appoint-
tment of Cornmdnder-in-Chief, India, on 11th
July.

28. The outbreak of war between Germany
and Russia and the conclusion of operations
in Syria resulted in a changed situation in
Iraq. A revised directive was therefore issued
to Lt. General Quinan on 29th July. The in-
structions contained in this directive were to
the following effect:—

(i) Lt. General Quinan was instructed that
his object in general was to hold Northern
Traq against any ‘enemy attack developing
through Turkey and/or Iran, and to develop
facilities for the maintenance and employ-
ment in Iraq of-a force which might in cer-
tain circumstances amount to ten divisions
(somé armoured) and thirty squadrons
Royal Air Force.

* (ii) The operational boundary of British
Air Force in Iraq was extended to include
the area in Syria East of a line adjoining

Az

4097

Eamichliye to a point where the road Mosul-
Deir-ez-Zor crosses the Iraq-Syria frontier. ~

(iii) Lt. General Quinan was to submit

his plans for holding the Northern Frontier
of Iraq against hostile advance through
Anatolia or Iran. The construction of per-
manent defences in this area was to be con-
fined to denying, where possible, the main
lines of approach by armoured fighting
vehicles into Iraq from Turkey or Iran with
the object of slowing up an advance and
forcing it into unsuitable country. Plans in
detail were also to be prepared for an ad-
vance into Turkish or Iranian territory in
order to seize defiles suitable for delaying
action and to carry out extensive demoli-
tions, .

(iv) A suitable force was to be held in -
readiness to enable the occupation of
Abadan and Naft-i-Shah to be carried out at
short notice. :

(v) Basra base was to be developed to
maintain ten divisions and thirty squadrons
Royal Air Force. Um Qasr and Koweit were
to be developed as subsidiary ports. ~

Situation in Iran. :

2g. The policy to be adopted in view of the
unsatisfactory attitude of the Iranian Govern-
ment to the representations made regarding the
expulsion of Axis nationals from Iran had been
under consideration by His Majesty's Govern-
ment and the Soviet Government during the
early weeks of July and on 22nd July Lt.
General Quinan was instructed to be prepared
to occupy Abadan and Naft-i-Shah and at a
Tater date the oilfields in South West Iran.
On 24th July intimation was received that His
Majesty’s Governmént had approved of the
proposals for the application of Anglo-Soviet
diplomatic pressure backed iby a show of force
on the Iranian Government in order to secure
the expulsion of Axis nationals ¢rom their
country; should diplomatic pressure fail force
was to be used.

Instructions were therefore issued to Lt.
General Quinan to make preliminary arrange-
ments for:— .

(i) The concentration of a striking force
oe the Iranian Frontier in the Basra Area
of:—

One Indian Infantry Division.

One mechanized cavalry brigade. é
Two Indian Armoured Regiments. é
To be supported by one Army Co-opera-

tion squadron R.A.F.

The object of this force was to occupy
the oilfields and refinery at Abadan.

(ii) The assembly of a naval/rrilitary
force at the head of the Persian Gulf con-
sisting of three or four sloops and two com-
panies of infantry, to occupy Bandar
Shahpur and seize the port and shipping.
Lt. General Quinan was informed that the

above forces were to be ready to move into
Tran in the second week in August but that
troops ‘were not to be concentrated in the Basra
area, until further orders were issued. He was
further instructed to be prepared to send a
small force to seize the Naft-i-Shah oilfields and
to detail one infantry battalion for the occupa-
tion of Bushire.

For the purpose of this operation the 4th
Cavalry Brigade (later renamed 9th Armoured
Brigade) from Palestine had beer placed at
