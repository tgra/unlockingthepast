a ridge thrusts out, terminating abruptly in
Monte Cassino. This is a bare, rocky pro-
montory, seventeen hundred feet high, whose
sides drop sharply into the plain beneath. It
had been selected for its natura] strength and
inaccessibility by Saint Benedict as the site
of his first monastery and by the Italian General
Staff as an example of an impregnable position.
Before we could advance on Rome by this
route, and there was no other way except by
sea, we should have to storm this bastion de-
fending the gate, for from it the Germans could
command the whole floor of the valley.

Plans for an Amphibious Landing.

The desirability of employing our control of
the sea in amphibious outflanking movements
had been well in the forefront of all our plan-
ning ever since we first set foot in Italy. For
lack of resources in men and craft only one
operation had so far been ae be Eighth
Army’s small-scale but successful landing at
Termoli, but I had also been constantly ex-
amining the possibilities of a ‘‘ seaborne hook ”
on the west coast where it seemed to promise
still greater advantages. General Clark had
endeavoured to fit in such an operation as a
feature of almost all his attacks so far but, in
spite of his great keenness, had been unable
to find a suitable target for the resources avail-
able. Now that we were approaching the
narrowest part of the peninsula the advant-
ages of an amphibious strategy became even
more obvious. ‘With the shortening of their
line and the strengthening of their defences,
with only one really vulnerable point in their
front, the Liri valley, the Germans could
economise in troops while we, however well
our build-up might progress, would have diffi-
culty in bringing our full strength to bear.
The advantages of an outflanking move were
not, of course, limited to assisting the advance
on Rome and extending the area on which the
Germans would have to fight us; they included
also the possibility of the destruction of part
of the force opposing us. It was on hess
: grounds that I had urged this strategy at the

rthage conferences on 25th October and 3rd
November and it had been agreed that an
amphibious landing should be made south of
the Tiber when Fifth Army had advanced to
within reasonable supporting distance. I had
Proposed to use for this x British Infantry
Division, which had been originally intended
for Eighth Army. The landing craft situation
was quite uncertain. I pointed out on 8th
November that, on the present programme, my
Armies would still be ten thousand vehicles
short by xst January and that it would be
impossible to mount’ an amphibious operation
before 25th December. If the craft were then
withdrawn it would be impossible to lift as
much as a division with what would remain.
However, we decided to go on planning on
the assumption that sufficient might be avail-
able. The SEXTANT conference was due to
open in Cairo on 22nd November and General
Eisenhower agreed to press there for the re-
tention of the landing craft which I thought
Necessary.

My operation instruction of 8th November
had directed that in the third phase of the
operations then envisaged an amphibious land-
ing would be made south of Rome directed

on the Alban Hills. The choice of this objec-
tive was made for obvious geographical
reasons. Rising just south of Rome this large
massif of volcanic origin dominates both routes
from Rome to the enemy’s line on the Gari-
gliano, Routes 6 and 7, the Via Casilina and
the Via Appia. The latter can be cut with
ease by landing almost anywhere on the west
coast, but the Alban Hills mark the first point
where the inland route is not protected by
the almost trackless Aurunci and Lepini Moun-
tains. If we could seize them the enemy’s
communications would be cut and Rome almost
within our grasp. It would, admittedly, be
rather in the nature of a bluff, for a really
strong-nerved commander might still hang on
to his positions—although, of course, we in-
tended to attack them frontally in force simul-
taneously with our landing—and try to raise
a force from somewhere else to fight his com-
munications free. Such a course would cer-
tainly mean reinforcements from outside Italy,
which would be an assistance to, the other
fronts, and I felt myself that, provided we got
firmly on to the Alban Hills and across Route 6,
Kesselring would not dare to take the risk of
retaining his positions at Cassino.

With the objective thus designated, detailed
planning became a Fifth Army responsibility,
in conjunction with Rear-Admiral Lowry,*
United States Navy, who was appointed as
naval commander for the force. The code-
name SHINGLE was given to the operation.
On xz2th November, Fifth Army set up a plan-
ning staff; they were instructed by my Head-
quarters to work on the assumption that the
force would number about twenty-three
thousand men and that the target date would
be 20th December. The planning staff quickly

.decided on the area around Anzio as the site

of the landing. This would give immediate
access into relatively open terrain, though
broken by water obstacles, over which good
roads lead directly to the Alban Hills only
twenty miles away. The beaches were definitely
poor, with very shallow under-water gradients
and off-lying sandbars, but they were the best

‘ to be had south of the Tiber; there were three

possible landing sites, one east and one west
of Anzio and one in the port itself. The beach
to the west was particularly shallow and had,
in fact, to be abandoned after the initial assault.
The weather was likely to be bad for beach
working and forecasts promised only an average
of two good days out of seven. Conditions
would be much improved, however, if the port
of Anzio, which the Germans had been using
for coastwise maintenance, could be captured
undemolished. As.to opposition to the landing,
it was not expected that the enemy would have
any large force in the area. Our estimate of
the ed defences likely to be met was
made difficult by the fact that the first photo-
gtaphic coverage showed an enormous number

defences of all kinds in the immediate
vicinity of Anzio. It was learned, however,
that the area had been a much-used training
ground for Italian troops before and during
the war, and nearly all the defences were
marked as.unoccupied; in the event the masses
of trenches and strongpoints which dotted the
coast on the defence overprints issued to the
troops played no réle in resistance to the
assault.
