SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 20 OCTOBER, 1948

of the rockets fired at London seemed to be
coming.* By keeping a close watch on the
information pointing to these ‘‘ suspected
areas ’’ and ensuring that it was-passed to the
Fighter Groups concerned by means of frequent
and full reports from my intelligence staff, I
was able to satisfy myself that our armed recon-
naissance effort was employéd to the best
advantage. During the ten days which this
phase lasted, pilots of my Command carried
out approximately 3,000 sorties of this kind.
They attacked a variety of targets, including
road, rail, and water tramsport vehicles and
installations, suspicious constructions, and
German troops. On one occasion when Tempests
attacked a suspected firing point an explosion
occurred so violent as to wreck the leading
aircraft, Afterwards a large, shallow crater
was seen, such as might have been caused by
the detonation of a rocket in the firing position.

178. At this stage I was made responsible for
directing and co-ordinating all operations by
air forces based in the United Kingdom against
the rocket-firing area as well as the bases of the
German flying bomb air-launching unit.t This
meant that besides using my own aircraft for
such tasks as were within their power, I could
ask Bomber Command or No. 2 Group, Second.
Tactical Air Force, to bomb any objectives
which seemed to me to call for attack by heavy,
medium, or light bombers. But there was
nothing mandatory about these requests, and I
had no means of ensuring that they were carried
out, save that of making representations to
higher authority if direct appeals should prove
unavailing. My relations with Bomber Com-
mand and No. 2 Group left nothing to be
desired; but since both had many calls on their
resources, mere reiteration on my part and
goodwill on theirs were not enough to ensure
that my demands should always receive neither
more nor less than their due. These difficulties
become more intelligible if the requirements for
rocket counter measures which preoccupied my
attention are fitted into the vast perspective of
air operations at that time. In the circum-
stances it would have been too much to expect
a series of firm and favourable decisions on the
part of a well-informed and competent higher
authority, by means of which alone detailed
and adequate response to my special needs
could have been ensured. As it was, the Air
Commander-in-Chief was busy with the offen-
sive battle, and in any case had no power to
direct Bomber Command in matters of this
nature; while the Air Staff at the Air Ministry
were naturally reluctant to give other than very
broad directions to operational commanders. .

179. Soon after the rocket attacks had begun,
intelligence was received which suggested that
the Germans had made preparations to store
rockets on three properties situated at Wasse-
naar, just outside the Hague, and named re-
spectively Terhorst, Eikenhorst, and Raap-
horst. At the first two there were compara-
tively small wooded areas, which for various
reasons seemed eminently suitable for the pur-
pose; Raaphorst was a rather extensive pro-
perty, and we were not sure which part of it
was meant. In any case we had no proof that
any of the storage shelters which were said

*-During the first phase a few rockets were fired at
London from the Island of Walcheren as well.

to have been constructed on the three proper-
ties were actually in use. Nevertheless, I con-
cluded that the Germans must be storing their
equipment somewhere, and presumably also
supplies of fuel and rockets, unless they were
living entirely from hand to mouth. Accord-
ingly, after weighing the probabilities care-
fully, I invited Bomber Command to bomb
given aiming-points at Terhorst and Eikenhorst.
Meanwhile, as early as the zqth September,
and before receiving my request, they had sent
a small force to attack Raaphorst. An aiming
point close to the main road bordering the
property was chosen. A few days later fresh
intelligence gave us the probable location of
three supposed storage areas on the Raaphorst
estate, one of them close to this aiming point.

180. The first attack carried out by Bomber
Command in response to my request was made
on the 17th September, when a smali force
attacked Eikenhorst, dropping 172 tons of
bombs. The bombing was well concentrated,
and a large explosion was seen to occur in the
course of it. No further attacks were made
during the first phase of the rocket offensive,
which ended on the 18th September.

(e) The Lull (19th to 25th September, 1944).

181. During the next week no rockets
arrived in this country. Towards the end of
that period secret informants reported that the
firing, troops had received orders on the after-
noon of the 17th September to leave the Hague,
and been seen departing with their equipment
towards Utrecht. We know now that this in-
formation was correct; but the arrival of a
rocket at Lambeth on the evening of the 18th,
coupled with a report that rockets had been
fired from ‘Wassenaar on that day and the next,
made us a trifle disinclined to give it credence
at the time.* J decided that for the present
armed reconnaissance sorties over the Hague
and its neighbourhood should be continued,
and the suspected storage sites at Wassenaar
be left on the list of “‘ Crossbow ”’ targets
which I wished to see attacked by Bomber
Command. If no more rockets should come
from the Hague or Wassenaar within the next
few days, the sites would lose their value as
targets and be taken off the list.

182. Accordingly, aircraft of my Command
continued to fiy armed reconnaissance and
‘‘antruder " sorties over the Hague and its
environs during the period from the roth to
the 25th September, so far as the weather and
the demands of the Amhem operation allowed.
On the roth, three whole squadrons from No.
12 Group—to which I had delegated responsi-
bility for supervising the conduct of air opera-
tions a few days previously—were sent to attack
objectives in an area south-east of the race-
course at the Hague, from which we believed
the Germans had been firing rockets. Troops,
transport vehicles, and buildings there were
all attacked. On the previous night (as on
two other nights about this time) “* intruder ”
aircraft bombed a railway station at Woerden
which an agent had mentioned in connection
with the supply of rockets to the Hague.

* The rocket fired on the 18th must have been a
parting shot from a rear detachment of the departing
troops. The report that firing occurred on the 19th
was doubtless a mistaken one ; or perhaps the message
was misconstrued,
