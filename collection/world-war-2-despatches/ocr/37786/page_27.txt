SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 13 NOVEMBER, 1946

rrison has made large guerilla activities
impossible. None the less, the Gérmans have
been seriously disturbed, our mission has been
maintained and increased, and Cretan morale
stands high.

278. In Crete, and still more in Greece, the
personal popularity of the British liaison
officers has been of great value to them in their
difficult task of organising (and at times
testraining) the guerillas in their attacks on the
Germans whilst at the same time seeking a
settlement of the disputes between the bands.

279. Whilst these operations were being pur-
sued to achieve the liberation of the Balkan
countries, plans were also being made for their
administration after their liberation. In Feb-
Tuary, 1943, the Allied Territories (Balkans)
Committee was established, under the chair-
manship of the Lieutenant-General in charge of
Administration and including representatives of

all interested organisations in Cairo, to consider.

the steps necessary on military grounds to
ensure efficiency of the civil administration in
the Balkan territories after their liberation,

‘Planning was at first confined to Greece, but
was part of a wider policy of planning relief
for the civil population in the Balkans which
was started, on War Office instructions, on
x5th April, 1943. Middle East’s responsibility
was laid down as Greece, Yugoslavia, Albania
and the Dodecanese only, and no planning was
to be undertaken for Roumania or ‘Bulgaria.

280. By October, 1943, it became apparent
that owing to the speed of the Russian advance
in South-east Europe the commitment might
arise earlier than had at first been expected,
and that planning to meet it would have to be
accelerated.

‘On x2th October, 1943, therefore, British
Military Liaison Headquarters (Greece) was set
up, under command of Major-General Hughes,
to maintain liaison with the Greek authorities
and to plan for the relief of the country on
evacuation by the Germans. The basis of the
plan was that the Greeks themselves would be
responsible for civil administration and for the
execution of ‘relief measures to the maximum
extent compatible with their resources.

281. It was also accepted that only essential
telief could be undertaken by the army and
that the rehabilitation, of liberated territories
would be a matter for such civil relief authority.
as might be later appointed. The period of
military responsibility was arbitrarily fixed at
six months from the date of occupation, during
which time it was intended that the civil relief
authority should have observers in the various
territories to enable as smooth.a transfer of

’ responsibility as possible to take place.

282. A special Balkan planning section,
attached to the staff of the Chief Civil Affairs
Officer, was set up to prepare detailed estimates
of requirements for the first six months’ period.
These estimates, which included, inter alia,
requirements of foodstuffs, medical supplies,
clothing, petrol and oil, chemicals, soap and
coal, were based on intelligence received from
the territories concerned arid from information
given by the ‘War Office. The procedure
adopted was that all estimates were passed to
the ““Q”’ Staff at General Headquarters,
Middle East, for examination and, when finally
agreed, forwarded through staff or service
channels to the War Office for approval ‘and
action. ’

This planning section was later transferred
to the staff of Major-General Hughes, leaving
the Chief Civil Affairs Officer responsible for
planning for the Dodecanese only.

283. The intention was to stockpile in Middle
East sufficient quantities of the commodities
required to tide over the period needed to
organise supply direct from the United King-
dom or United States to Balkan ports. This
period was estimated by the War Office as six
to eight weeks, and by January, 1944, con-
siderable shipments of grain had been received,
but little progress had been made in the stock-
piling of the remaining requirements, other
than those available locally. . .

284. Another activity which came into
greater prominence as the Balkans increased in
importance was political warfare. The Political
Warfare Executive, Middle East, had been
active during the Tunisian, Sicilian and Italian
campaigns, using leaflets and radio to soften
enemy morale; officers trained by the Executive
went with our forces to the Aegean islands, and
now in preparation for activity in the Balkans
much valuable work was done. For this
theatre, a pool of trained officers was set up
and a school was established for training field
units. :

285. Whilst training, organising, equipping
and planning for those Balkan countries which
were already involved in the war has been a
difficult task, it has been even more difficult
to perform the same functions for Turkey, since
that country has been willing to enter the war
only on its own terms and when it considers
itself properly equipped to do so.

286. In the tortuous and interminable nego-
tiations with the Turks, and in providing and
forwarding the supplies which have been the
main object of discussion, Middle East Com-
mand has been closely concerned.

287. Our programme of assistance, resulting
from the Adana Conference on 30th and 31st

January, I943, was two-fold. First, we had-

to supply Turkey as soon as possible with suf-
ficient equipment to provide her armed forces
with one year’s reserve for war. Secondly, we
had to despatch to Turkey, if she were forced
into war, a self-contained force under British
command to provide fighter defence of vulner-
able points and to support the Turkish Army in
the field; in addition, certain British anti-tank
and anti-aircraft units were to be placed under
Turkish command. Later the Turks were given
the choice of further strong Royal ‘Air Force
reinforcements or a corps of two armoured
divisions; it was not considered practicable to
provide both until at least the Aegean was
opened to our shipping and the port of Izmir
could be used.

288. The limiting factor to our programme
of assistance, both in preparation for war and
after Turkey should enter the war, was the
capacity of the Turkish railway system, and it
was agreed that the staff talks should be re-
sumed at the earliest possible date to study this
problem and to consider the means by which
the capacity could be improved.

289. Accordingly, talks were resumed in
Ankara on 26th February, 1943, under the
chairmanship, on the British side, of the Mili-
tary Attaché, Major-General A. C. Amnold,
Progress was handicapped by Turkish inability
or unwillingness to appreciate the limitations ot
