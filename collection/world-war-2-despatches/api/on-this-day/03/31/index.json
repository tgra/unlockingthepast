            "description": "a4. The retarded progress of administrative preparations in Persia and the growing possibility of a German success in South Russia made it clear that  an intensive administrative effort was required to ensure that operations in North Persia could, in fact, be maintained. I fixed 31st March, 1943, as the target date by which the base and lines of communication were to be ready to take the strain of operations. This decision necessitated a review of all plans, if the most economical use was to be made of the available resources; any projects not clearly essential had to be dropped, and long-term constructional works reconsidered to ensure that their contintiance justified the effort involved. Some curtailment was thus effected."

In February, 1943, General de Larminat requested that a Fighting French Division should be formed from the two independent Fighting French Brigades then concentrated at Gambut. This was agreed, andi the division was completely equip by the end of March and moved from Tobruk to Tripoli on 18th April. There it came under command of the roth Corps and moved up to relieve the 51st Division in the line at Enfidaville on 6th and 7th May. A Fighting French Flying Column was also placed under command of Eighth Army during the advance to Tunisia. It came under command of the 30th Corps at Ben Gardane, and after a short attachment to the 4th Light Armojired Brigade it passed, on 31st March, under command of General Leclerc as part of  L  Force, which had come up from Chad."

During the period, February, 1943, to January, 1944, Royal Engineer workshops produced inter alia 2,660,000 fortygallon petrol drums and, including Jerricans, 5,400,000 four-gallon returnable petrol containers. The output of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers  base workshops was greater in December than in February, 1943, and included over 300 tanks, 600 armoured cars, scout cars or carriers, 3,500   B  vehicles and 6,000  B  vehicle engines. Similarly, the activity in ordnance installations during the quarter ending 31st December, 1943, was greater than during the quarter ending 31st March, 1943. Nearly 150,000 tons of ammunition were received compared with 135,000 tons; 113,000 tons of ammunition were issued compared with 102,000 tons; while 173,000 tons of stores were received compared with 148,000 tons."

It was facilitated by the fact that the enemy had thinned out in this area to reinforce other sectors but even so the dense scrub and the boulder-covered mountains were mos: serious obstacles. The attack began on 28th March in very heavy rain and made steady progress, assisted by the Corps Franc d  Afrique and a Tabor of Moroccan Goumiers on the left flank. On 30th March we re-entered Sedjenane, and the capture was completed by next day. The enemy was now reinforcing by recommitting his carefully husbanded reserves but they were unable to halt our progress. On 31st March we recaptured our former positions east of El Aouana; shortly afterwards the enemy withdrew from his positions on Cap Serrat. By this advance of  eighteen miles we had won back all the ground which the enemy had taken three weeks to capture; prisoners amounted to over eight hundred and fifty and there is no doubt that his losses in killed and wounded were heavy."

In spite of the favourable development of the Mareth battle very strong resistance was met to any progress beyond El Guettar. On 31st March General Patton tried to push an armoured force down the road but it was held up by mines after advancing only a short distance. He then tried a more deliberate advance with 1x Division working along the mountains north of the road and"

The general position in Iraq became so threaten-. ing that about the middle of April His Majesty's Government decided to land a force at Basra in accordance with our treaty rights of passing troops through Iraq. A line of communications from Basra to Baghdad by rail and thence by road across the desert to Haifa, had been prepared early in the war as an alternative line of communicati ns to the Middle East, should the Red Sea be rendered unsafe by enemy action; a large sum of money had been spent in improving the road across the desert from Haifa to Baghdad."

The attacking force consisted of the 5th German Light Armoured Division and two Italian divisions (one armoured, one motorised). It was supported by a considerable air force, the enemy being numerically superior throughout the operations, although they did not make full use of this superiority, largely as a result of the initiative and aggressiveness of our R.A.F. During the first three days the 2nd Armoured Division withdrew slowly northwards, and by the evening of 2nd April was north of Agedabia. The enemy so far had not pressed his advance with much vigour. Our intention was that the armoured force should maintain a position from which they would be on the flank of any enemy advance by the main road to Benghazi and would also block any attempt to turn our positions in Cyrenaica by taking the desert route to Mechili. The Commander of the 2nd Armoured Division had originally intended to counter attack the enemy north of Agedabia if opportunity offered; but on being warned that no tank reinforcements were available and that he should not attack unless a specially favourable opportunity offered, he decided to continue the withdrawal. ."
