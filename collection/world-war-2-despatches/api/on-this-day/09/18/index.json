Landing was accordingly fixed for the early morning of 18th September.",

Later a Naval Officer approached the quay in a landing craft bearing a white flag to present terms. He was greeted by machine-gun fire. Ships  guns, of light calibre only, opened fire. After very few minutes, a white flag was hoisted on land and firing immediately ceased. Troops were landed and the town occupied without opposition. Little damage had been done by the naval bombardment. Port facilities at Tamatave were better than at Majunga and disembarkation proceeded quickly.",

The small force of fighters which <ould be operated and maintained on Cos was not sufficient, in view of the strongly reinforced German Air Force, to ward off for long the determined attacks on the landing ground which began on the 18th September. This was the more so since an adequate early warning system could not be established and the ground anti-aircraft consisted of twenty-four Bofors guns only, a few poorly manned and out-of-date Italian anti-aircraft guns and the small arms weapons of the British troops. Air Transport by day had _ therefore to be cancelled and all future reinforcement took place by night,",

The 234th Infantry Brigade was in the meantime being prepared for operations, but, owing to th2 limitations of shipping and the time taken to collect it, the brigade could not be ready to sail until 18th September. The urgency was such that this delay was unacceptable, and one battalion was ordered to embark in motor launches and Royal Air Force launches for transit to Rhodes, while preparations for the mounting of the remainder of the brigade went on as fast as possible. It was, however, imperative that we should have a guarantee of unopposed entry into the port of Rhodes and an unopposed occupation of an airfield either at Marizza or on Cos before the expedition could be launched, since a landing against opposition was out of the question. Before anything could be done, the German commander, Von Kleeman, had taken advantage of Campicne's weakness and indecision, and the Germans assumed undisputed control of Rhodes.",

The Italian fleet and air force had surrendered in accordance with the terms of the armistice in so far as they were not prevented by the action of the Germans but the Italian army had been eliminated except for a few poorly equipped formations in the south and the troops in Sardinia and Corsica. Mussolini had been rescued from his prison on the Gran Sasso but this, though irritating, was not considered likely to add to our difficulties in Italy, an appreciation which proved wholly justified.

The terrain which there faced them pre- ~ sented a totally different picture from that in which they had been operating hitherto. So far they had been climbing up a steep ascent where the mountains offer a nearly continuous wall running east and west at right angles to the line of advance; once the line of the passes is reached the whole grain of the country is reversed and the mountains begin to trend north-eastwards in gradually descending spurs separated from each other by the valleys of swift rivers which drain into the plains of Lombardy. - For the greater part of their course in the mountains these rivers run through deep gorges which offer no scope for deployment or manceuvre but in a few places, as at Firenzuola on the upper Santerno, the valleys open out and it is possible for artillery and transport to deploy. The mountain spurs, as I said, descend gradually, and for nearly half their total length their height is very little less than that of the watershed, with isolated higher peaks offering good command of the surrounding in. There was little advantage, therefore, in the fact that we were now going, according to the map,   downhill  ; the immense difficulties of supply to the forward froeps and deployment of our strength in",
