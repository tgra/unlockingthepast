SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948

Taungdwingyi would: have opened the right
flank and rear of the. Chinese Fifth pea
whose advanced troops .were still south of
Pyinmana, and it would also have uncovered
the communications of the Imperial Forces
through Mandalay. |

On the 12th April therefore, I ordered 1 Bur-
corps to hold Taungdwingyi at all costs. This
order was received at Headquarters 1 Bur-
corps on the morning of the 13th April and
orders were then issued for the 48 Brigade
and the 7 Hussars to come under command
of the 17 Division and 7 Armoured Brigade
less one regiment to come under command 1
Burma Division. Enemy pressure on the
Burma Division south of Magwe continued on
the 13th and xr4th and this caused a wide gap
to. be opened between the two Divisions.
Moving across country the enemy pushed into
this gap threatening the oilfields. Orders for
the destruction of the Yenangyaung oilfields
were issued on thé night of the r4th April and
the denial scheme was successfully carried out
during the following 48 hours. It required two
full daylights to complete the destruction end-
ing with the blowing of the power house, which
took place when the Japanese were already in
the outskirts of Yenangyaung.

By the 16th April 1 Burma Division, less 2
Burma Brigade on the right bank of the Irra-
waddy, had withdrawn to’ Kadaung Chaung,
seventeen miles south of Yenangyaung. The
2 K.O.Y.L.1. who had been cut off in Myingun
fought their way out and rejoined their Division.

33. The Fight at Yenangyaung. On the 17th
April the enemy established road blocks north
and south of the Pinchaung, immediately
north of Yenangyaung, cutting off 1 Burma
Division and some of the ‘Corps Troops. The
2 Royal Tanks and Corps Troops fought their
way out north but, by the time 1 Burma Divi-
sion reached Yenangyaung on the night of the
17th April, the road blocks had been re-estab-
lished. After this action the greater number
of the enemy dead were found to be clad in
khaki uniforms and wearing felt hats of the
type used by Gurkha and Burma Rifle units.

34. Meanwhile the 113 Regiment of the
Chinese 38 Division had been moved from
Mandalay to Kyaukpadaung and placed under
command 1 Burcorps. On the morning of the
18th April this Regiment and the 2 Royal
Tanks attacked the enemy road block north of
the Pinchaung, but the attack went wide and

failed to dislodge the enemy. An attack by 1°

Burma Division failed to clear the block to the
south. On the evening of the 18th April infor-
mation was received that an enemy column
was moving north by Magwe. During this
time the 17 Division and 7 Hussars holding
Taungdwingyi and Natmauk were unmolested
by the enemy. ‘

35. On the 16th and 17th April, I Visited
Corps Headquarters and Headquarters of the
Chinese Armies at Pyawbwe. At this time, and
indeed previously, I impressed on General
Stilwell the importance of Meiktila as a big
centre of communications and I promised that,
if possible, I would make the 7 Armoured Bri-
gade, available for the defence of this place.
Arrangements had already been put in hand to
dump at Meiktila stocks of 87 octane spirit and
lubricants and a dump of supplies had already

1701

been formed there since the 17 Division had,
at.this time, to be supplied through Meiktila
and Pyawbwe. )

‘At’ our meeting on the 17th April, General

Stilwell discussed with me his plan for a counter
attack south of Pyinmana and I promised to

‘make the 7 Hussars available to assist the

Chinese in this operation and orders were issued
for them to be prepared to move to Pyawbwe.
On the 18th April it became clear to me that
the projected Chinese counter attack would not
take place and, in view of the situation on the
Irrawaddy front, and in the Shan States, I
again visited General Stilwell’s Headquarters
at Pyawbwe on the roth, having arranged to
meet the Commander 1 Burcorps there. At
this meeting, I stressed the importance of
holding strongly the centres of communication
from Chauk to Kyaukpadaung-Meiktila-Thazi.
General Stilwell and I were in full agreement
and it was arranged that the whole of the
38 Chinese Division should be placed under
the command of x Burcorps.

36. We then discussed plans for offensive
action. The deep penetration made by the
Japanese 33 Division at Yenangyaung appeared
to present a favourable opportunity for a
counter stroke but, owing to the nature and
extent of the country, this was beyond the
capacity of 1 Burcorps alone, as considerable
forces were required merely to find the enemy
should he elect to move into the jungle. General
Stilwell agreed to make available for a counter
stroke the 200 Chinese Division and one regi-
ment of the 22 Division in addition to the 38
Division, and arrangements were made to set
in motion the moves of these formations to-
wards Kyaukpadaung and Ywamun as soon as
possible. Having made these arrangements I
accompanied the Commander 1 Burcorps to
his Headquarters between Meiktila and
Kyaukpadaung. On arrival there I found that
the attacks of the 113 Chinese Regiment and
the 2 Royal Tanks had succeeded in clearing
the northern bank of the Pinchaung but that 1
Burma Division had been unable to clear the
Japanese from the south bank. 1 Burma Divi-
sion were being attacked by an enemy column
which had moved north from Magwe and
columns sent out by the 17 Division from
Taungdwingyi and Natmauk had not succeeded
in relieving the pressure. I told the Corps
Commander that 1 Burma Division must fight
its way out and that, if necessary, it would have
to abandon its wheeled transport. Commander
1 Burcorps issued orders to this effect on the
evening of the rgth and by the morning of the
2oth r Burma Division had succeeded in ex-
tricating itself with the loss of a great part of
its M.T. On the 21st April, 113 Chinese Regi-
ment crossed the Pinchaung and entered the
outskirts of Yenangyaung where it inflicted con-
siderable casualties on the enemy.

-37. Operations on the Chinese Front. At this
point it is necessary to turn to the events on the
Chinese front east of the Pegu Yomas. After
the withdrawal of the Chinese 200 Division from
Toungoo on the Ist April, the situation on the
Fifth Army front was as follows: —

‘the 22 Division at Yedashe,
the 96 Division in the area Pyinmana,
« the 200 Division in the area Yezin with
Fifth Army Headquarters. at Pyawbwe.
