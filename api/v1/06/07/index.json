In the early morning of x5th June, a force of -42 Beaufighters, escorted by 10 Mustangs of A.D.G.B. attacked a north-bound convoy consisting of a merchant vessel of 8,000 tons, a naval auxiliary of 4,000 tons and sevente\u00e9n escort ships off the Frisian Islands. The large. merchant vessel and the auxiliary were torpedoed and sank, one minesweeper blew up and sank, another was hit by a torpedo and probably sank, while five more minesweepers were seen on fire and four other escorts were damaged by cannon fire."

            "description": "64. In a directive dated 7th June 1944 from the Air Commander-in-Chief, M.A.A.F., a new composite group was formed known as Balkan Air Force. The operational units of Balkan Air Force consisted on an average of twentytwo squadrons excluding those employed on special supply operations. They operated fifteen types of aircraft, flown by air-crew of eight different nationalities (British, South African, Ttalian, Greek, Jugoslav, and for the supply dropping operations, American, Polish and Russian). It will be seen how \u201c\u2018 international \u201d\u2019 were the responsibilities of the A.O.C., B.A.F. as an Air Commander."

On 25th May I reported to the War Office that I was preparing a plan for an advance into Syria with the 7th Australian Division less one brigade, the Free French troops, and certain units of the xst Cavalry Division. This was a much smaller force than I considered necessary, also I disliked using the Free French since J knew that this would be likely to stiffen the resistance of the French in Syria, but I had no other troops I could make available. I was instructed by the Chiefs of Staff to advance into Syria as soon as the above force was reasonably prepared. I reported that 7th June.was the earliest date by which the operation could start, actually it began on 8th June."

            "description": "On these orders the pursuit was pressed rapidly. The main difference was that 13 Corps was no longer directed on the TerniRieti area but farther afield; this meant that the South Africans were no longer to turn eastwards to cross the Tiber to seize Narni as originally planned, but to press on to Orvieto. Here again a difficult question of routeing was involved since both they and II Corps were in danger of arriving simultaneously at Viterbo. I decided to give precedence to the armour and II Corps was halted in place until the South Africans were through. Meanwhile VI Corps made rapid progress up the coast in spite of the arrival of two fresh German divisions. On the gth it captured Tarquinia and a task force from 1 Armoured Division, operating on the inland flank, cut into II Corps\u2019 territory to capture the Viterbo airfield. On the rrth, however, VI Corps was relieved by IV Corps and moved to Naples, coming under command of Seventh Army for operation ANVIL. II ad pushed forward with 85 and up the axis of Route 2 and consolidated the position between VI and 13 Corps. It was relieved by the French on oth June. On the oth Eighth Amy had also carried out a regrouping; the Tiber was now to be the boundary between 13 and 10 Corps, with the latter commanding all the troops formerly in 13 Corps east of the river. The final result was to give 13 Corps 78 and 6 South African Divisions, with 4 Division in reserve, and 10 Corps 6 British Armoured and 8 Indian Infantry Divisions, with 10 Indian as reserve. The Canadians were grounded south of Rome. The Polish Corps, which had passed to Army Group reserve on 26th May after the capture of Piedimonte, assumed command of the Adriatic sector from 5 Corps on 17th June, remaining under direct command of my headquarters until 29th June when it passed to Eighth Army. The enemy had begun to fall"

            "description": "My tactical plans for the pursuit north of Rome envisaged two main lines of advance: along the west coast for Fifth Army and up the axis of the Tiber, both east and west of the river, for Eighth Army. Fifth Army\u2019s first objective was the port of Civitavecchia, which was now vital for our maintenance; Eighth Army was directed on the area of Terni and Rieti, the capture of which would disrupt any German plans for forming a continuous front across the peninsula and would threaten with envelopment the left wing of Tenth Amny. From the point of view of terrain the former task was rather the easier, for the country is of an open, rolling nature while the route up the Tiber, though not difficult by comparison with the country between Naples and Rome, offered many opportunities for delaying actions, especially on the east bank of the river. Enemy opposition was also much weaker on our left, for most of Kesselring\u2019s divisions had withdrawn northward east of the Tiber and, having rashly destroyed all the bridges from Rome as far as Todi, sixty miles to the north, were having great difficulty in getting across to the west to come to the support of the weaker forces retreating up the west coast. VI Corps therefore set the pace, with 34 Division on the coast and the 36th inland, both supported by armour from 1 Armoured Division. At 1030 hours on 7th June elements of 34 Division entered Civitavecchia, The speedy capture of this port, the most important between Naples and Leghorn, was a considerable gain and, although the Germans had carried out extensive demolitions, particularly fine efforts by the port reconstruction companies made it usable earlier than had been expected.
