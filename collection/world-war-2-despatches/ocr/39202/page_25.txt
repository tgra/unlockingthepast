when a rescue aircraft made a_ well-timed
evacuation. In the meantime, the Flight Com-
mander stayed with Force 136 Guerillas.

The Advantages of the Lysander Aircraft.

298. The advantages of the Lysander for the
unique type of work it was called upon to
carry out were as follows :—

(i) Weight lifting capacity.

(ii) Automatic flap action, meeting all the
conditions of flight, e.g. a sudden loss of lift
in a sudden violent turn or in conditions of
turbulence over the hills.

(iii) Capability of cruising at low speed in
conditions of bad visibility.

(iv) High rate of turn, of great value in
confined spaces.

(v) Fixed undercarriage, strong and able
to stand the shocks of heavy landings.

(vi) High engine power and light wing
loading, facilitating quick take-off from
waterlogged strips, and an immediate high
tate of climb.

(vii) Reasonable flying endurance of air-
craft, the pilot never being embarrassed in a
difficult operation by shortage of fuel.

299. But even with these advantages, the
technique required of the Lysander pilots was
one of skill, particularly when landing on very
small strips. On such occasions the normal
approach speed of 85 m.p.h. had to be re-
duced to 70 m.p.h., and a precision touch-
down at the very beginning of the strip, with
throttle promptly closed, had to be accom-
plished.

300. From May, 1945, to October, 1945,
357 Squadron Lysanders flew no less than
1,310 hours. 405 sorties were attempted and
363 of these -were successful. Personnel in-
filtrated had numbered 214, and evacuations,
330. In addition, some 104,580 Ibs. of stores
were landed behind the enemy lines.

301. A fitting tribute to the Lysander opera-
tions was paid by Headquarters, Group “ A”
of Force 136 on 23rd June, 1945,

PHOTOGRAPHIC RECONNAISSANCE

A Record of Achievement Built on
Perseverance of Crews.

302. Photographic reconnaissance has come
out of the South East Asia Theatre with a
record of achievement built upon the perse-
verance of its air crews to master the diffi-
culties of climate and terrain. A flight of
2,600 miles in nine hours five minutes was one
of the longest flights ever done in P.R.

303. The radius of P.R. cover in Decem-
ber, 1943, when the Command was formed,
was not more than 680 miles, since long range
reconnaissance by Mosquitos was only in pro-
cess of being attempted in the coverage of
the Andaman Islands from Comilla and, a
little later, of Bangkok in Siam. When the
war with Japan ended in August, 1945, the
range of P.R. aircraft in South East Asia
Command was such that coverage of the
Andaman and Nicobar Islands from Ceylon,
flights deep into Siam and French Indo China
from Rangoon, and a detailed coverage of
targets in Sumatra, Southern Malaya, Singa-
pore and Java by aircraft based on the Cocos
Islands; had become norma! routine.

304. The Mosquito indeed made amends
for the structural defect which had curtailed
its use in this Command, for it set up two
records in 1945. Firstly, a Mosquito XVI
broke the long distance record on March 22
for this type of aircraft in any theatre of war,
with a flight of 2,493 miles in eight hours
forty-five minutes, covering the Bangkok—
Singapore railway to a point south of the
Malayan frontier. This performance, however,
was eclipsed by a Mosquito XXXIV based on
the Cocos Islands, which on 20th August,
1945, flew 1,240 miles to Penang Island and
then went on to cover Taiping town and air-:
field at 17,000 feet. On the return home a
survey tun was made on the K8/12-inch
camera. This was the longest P.R. flight to be
made in the Command, and covered a total of
2,600 miles in nine hours five minutes.

Photographic Survey of Burma.

305. Possibly the two most outstanding con-
tributions by photographic reconnaissance to
the war in South East Asia were its survey
photography of Burma at the inning of
1944, and its detailed coverage of enemy
occupied territories after the fall of Rangoon
in May, 1945, in preparation for the large
scale assault on Malaya.

306. The survey photography of Burma
fulfilled a long-felt want by supplying accurate
and up-to-date maps of Burma which were
practically non-existent up to this time—the
Air Force and Army having to use 1914-15
ground surveys which, as photographic recon-
naissance proved, showed major errors. The
new survey of Burma was one of the best
examples of R.A.F. assistance to the Army in
this Theatre.

307. Faced with the urgent and extensive
programme of photographic reconnaissance in

‘Malaya and Sumatra for Operation “Zipper”,

a detachment of 684 Squadron (Alipore) com-
menced operations from the Cocos Islands in
July, 1945, with four Mk. XXXIV Mosquitos
which had just been released for service use
in temperate and tropical climates. The P.R.
programme for “Zipper” went steadily for-
ward and, by the end of July, was 60 per
cent. completed. A second detachment of
684 Squadron Mosquitos was operating at this
time from China Bay, Ceylon, for the cover-
age of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

P.R. organisation after fall of Rangoon.

308. At the time of Rangoon’s capture in
May, 1945, the Photographic Reconnaissance
Force was commanded by Colonel Minton W.
Kaye, United States Army Air Force, with
Group Captain S. G. Wise, D.F.C., as Assistant
Air Commander:

309. The Force controlled two RAF.
Squadrons, No. 681 (Spitfires) and No. 684
(Mosquitos), while the Americans had a P.38
(F.5) Squadron, a P.40, and a B.24 Mapping
Squadron. The American Units, however, had
completed their task as a P.R. integrated force
in the Command and, after carrying out a
few PR. sorties at the beginning of May, ‘they
then retired to are for withdrawal to
China with the remainder of the American Air
Forces in the Theatre. The two RAF.
squadrons, therefore, were left to operate on
