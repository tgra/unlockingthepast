Both the 3oth Corps and the roth Corps were brought up to strength, and by 3rd March, 11,318 reinforcements had been despatched from the Delta as against demands for 8,goo. Sixty-two per cent. of Middle East's intake of vehicles was sent up to Eighth Army during the period up to 15th March, including a special despatch of 520 vehicles which was sent up on 23rd February, and by the end of March 20,000 tons of ammunition had been sent through Tripoli for distribution to Eighth Army."

I had already dis cussed this point with General Monigomery. In view of the time available I had decided to employ II United States Corps in a limited operation on the extreme right of my line in Tunisia; the objects of this were to restore confidence after the earlier setbacks by a carefully planned successful operation, to exert pressure on the right rear of the enemy defending the Mareth positions, and to be ready to open an alternative line of supply for Eighth Army after they had broken through the Gabes Gap. I planned, therefore, that II Corps, now commanded by General Patton, who had relieved General Fredendall, should attack Gafsa on or about 15th March with r Armoured and 1 Infantry Divisions. They would secure firm possession of Gafsa and build up there a dump of petrol for the use of Eighth Army,"

After examination of the new intelligence available, which did not as yet include the air photographs, we decided that our previous plans were sound and could be carried out with the reduced forces available. On the military side, new topographical information suggested that the beaches were far better than was originally reported, The postPponement of the operation from April to May placed it at the beginning of the dry season, which considerably reduced anticipated difficulties of advance along the only. very doubtful, road which was available. Thanks to this  and   Bonus   Captain Garnons-Wilhams and myself were able to meet Brigadier Festing and Brigadier G. W. B. Tarleton, commanding 29 Independent Brigade and 17 Infantry Brigade respectively, and my advisers and heads of services, all of whom arrived in London on the morning of 15th March, with a completed outline-plan and an outline draft of the Force operation order."

            "description": "6. The reference in article (d) to offensive operations squadrons of the Tactical Air Force was hardly more than a convenient fiction. Its purpose was not so much to place these operations under my control, as to prevent them from prematurely absorbing the energies of the Air Officer Commanding and staff of the Tactical Air Force, to the detriment of their more important task of preparing for the coming events in Europe. Although the operations were planned and their execution ordered from the headquarters of No. 11 Group, which was part of my command, they were supervised until the 15th March, 1944, by the Air Commander-in-Chief himself. Thereafter they were directed by the Air Marshal Commanding, Second Tactical Air Force (Air Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham, K.C.B., D.S.O., M.C., D.F.C., A.F.C.). This arrangement was typical of a series of complex relationships brought about by the special circumstances of the time. In effect it meant that the Air Officer Commanding, No. rr Group {Air Vice-Marshal H. W. L. Saunders, C.B., C.B.E., M.C., D.F.C., M.M.), while he never ceased to be constitutionally my subordinate, acted for certain purposes as the agent first of Air Chief Marshal Leigh-Mallory and later of Air Marshal Coningham."

Another fighter ground attack was organised and took place between z3th-15th March, This operation resulted in the loss to the enemy of 20 aircraft, 6 destroyed in the air, 9 on the ground and 5 damaged. Qur losses were two Hurricanes. The value at this particular period of these heavy losses to the enemy was very great. Our further advance was over mountain roads through many narrow defiles and passes, where our columns would have been extremely vulnerable to air attack. Although they were bombed sporadically the attacks were not pushed home and lite damage resulted. Our columns were still able to advance by day."
