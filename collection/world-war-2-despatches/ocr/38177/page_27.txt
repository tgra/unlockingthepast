possibility that Rommel might not be ready for
his attack for many weeks made me give up this
idea; though with some reluctance. We know
now beyond any doubt that Rommel intended to
attack Tobruk from the east on the 23rd Novem-
ber and we have all his plans for this operation.

For various reasons our offensive had already
had to be postponed. After dumping had been
finished, it was not possible to rely on the trans-
port echelons being reorganised before the 11th
November in readiness for the advance.
Nor was it possible to complete the training of
the 22nd Anmoured Brigade, which disembarked
early in October, and that of the Armoured
Corps. Headquarters before that date. At the
Commanders’-in-Chief Conference held on the
3rd October, therefore, 11th November was
fixed as the date for the offensive to. begin.
Unavoidable delays arose, however, in provid-
ing the full quota of transport for the 1st South
African Division, and Major-General Brink
found it impossible to complete its training by
that date. The opening of the offensive was
finally deferred until 18th November

By the evening of the 17th November the
formations of the Eighth Army had concen-
trated behind the frontier and were ready to
advance,

The Plan,
30th Corps.

The main attack was to be ‘deBvered by the
30th Corps whose primary role was to seek out
and destroy the enemy, at the same time ensur-
ing that-the left flank of the 13th Corps was
protected against an attack in force by the
enemy armoured formations.. As a first step
towards bringing the enemy to battle, the bulk

335

of our armouged forces were to move to a cen-
tral position round Gabr Saleh whence they
could strike north-west or north-east according
to developments. Every effort was to be made
by ground and air reconnaissance to discover the
enemy’s whereabouts and the extentgto which
it would be possible to prevent his southward
movement by obtaining control of” the: few
crossings of the coastal escarpment, to the north
of which the enemy ‘was believed to be lying.

The Anmy Commander reserved to himself
the teqparaintiity for deciding which direction
the armoured forces should take, if the 30th
Corps were not able to engage the enemy under
favourable conditions on the first day. General
Cunningham intended to stay close to the head-
quarters of that Corps until he had sufficient
information to make a decision. In the event
of a westward move, he foresaw that it might
be necessary -to leave some of the armour to
protect the 13th Comps.

The more immediate plan was for the 7th
Armoured Division to take up a central posi-
tion astride the Trigh el Abd with the qth
Armoured Brigade on the right, the 7th in the
centre, and the 22nd on the left. The armoured
car regiments were to push well forward to
‘watch the main crossings of the escarpment
north of the Trigh Capuzzo. From this central
position the Armoured Division might have to
move right or left. If the other two brigades
were ordered to move left towards Tobruk, the
4th Armoured Brigade was to remain in its
battle position so as to be ready to protect the
right flank of the Armoured Division, the com-
munications of the 30th Corps and the left
flank of the 13th Conps. On the left, should
the Ariete Division withdraw, it was not to be
pursued, if pursuit involved dispersing our
armoured forces and allowing the German
Panzer Divisions to concentrate in superior force
against us.

The first task of the rst South African Divi-
sion was to protect the western and south-
western flanks of the communications of the
Armoured Division. Subsequently it might
have to secure a defensive locality round Bir el
Gubi on which the Armoured Division could
pivot. The 22nd Guards Brigade was to pro-
tect the lines of communication, supply dumps,
and landing grounds in the rear.

Tobruk.

The secondary role of the 30th Corps was to
relieve Tobruk, but no operations were to be
undertaken to this end until the main enemy
armoured forces had either been defeated or
prevented from interfering with’ the relief.
General Norrie was to give the signal when he
was satisfied that his own forces were or would
be in a position to support the sortie from
Tobruk. On receipt of this signal, the Tobruk
Garrison was to come under command of the
30th Corps and to remain under its command
until all enemy resistance in the neighbourhood
had ceased,

The basis of the plan for relieving Tobruk
was the capture of two ridges to the south-east
of it. These two ridges, Ed Duda and Sidi
Rezegh, 5,000 yards apart, between them com-
manded the two main lines of communication
of the Axis forces. The Tobruk by-pass road
climbs up from the coast, crosses a saddle,
and then turns west along the southern slope
of Ed Duda Ridge: in the valley between the
two ridges runs the Trigh Capuzzo. Provided
