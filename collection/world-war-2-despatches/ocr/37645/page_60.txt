greater efforts. As far as my troops were con-
cerned { was sure, if only they could come up
to the enemy, no further fighting would be
required to cause the enemy to give in.

I was convinced that the forces in Galla
Sidamo were on their last legs, my only fear
being that they might maroon themselves in
the mud and make it impossible for our troops
to reach them. My information was to the
effect that movement anywhere off the perma-
nent roads, which ended at Lechemti and
Gimma, was impossible after the middle of
July when it was said that even the villagers
shut themselves up in their villages and were
unable to move out until September when the
heavy rains finished,

51. On 3rd July, however, my anxiety on
this score was ended, as General Gazzera broad-
cast a message to Addis Abeba that he was
sending a car-load of delegates down the
Dembidollo-Gambela road to negotiate the sur-
render of all troops in the Galla Sidamo.

52. The only Italians now left in the area
for which I was responsible were the very in-
considerable party under Raugei, 600 Italians
and some Banda, marooned on the northern
borders of French Somaliland. The
Danakhils, who inhabited that area and who
had hitherto been friendly to him, had turned
against him and were attacking him. He was
in desperate straits for supplies and eventually
iw in two parties on 8th and rrth

ly.

53. The surrender of the Supreme Com-
mander, General Gazzera, the whole of the
province of Galla Sidamo and Raugei’s column
west of Assab, marked the elimination of all
Italian troops in the area for which I was
responsible and the conclusion of the cam-
paign waged by East Africa Force which had
started on r1th February.

It seems worth mentioning, in view of the
many enemy claims that they were over-
whelmed by superior numbers, that at no time
were more than three brigade groups plus two
battalions engaged in operations against the
40,000 enemy infantry and militia in the Galla
Sidamo, where as at the commencement of
these operations the enemy had five times as
many guns as we had. After the fall of
=~ ee only two brigade groups were
used.

B. Operations of 1st S.A, Brigade.
(13th April_8th May, 1941.)

(Order of Battle as in Appendix ‘‘ A ’’.)

54. On 13th April rst S.A. Brigade Group
left Addis Abeba and in spite of extensive
demolitions one mile beyond the Mussolini
tunnel some reo miles north of Addis Abeba,
were able to occupy Debre’ Sina with rst
D.E.O.R. on 14th April. This was done
after slight enemy opposition had been over-
come, while work on the road demolitions con-
tinued. On 16th April the advance continued
from Debre’ Sina and after encountering minor
toad blocks the leading troops on the 17th
reached the southern approaches of the Com-
bolcia Pass, where they came under enemy
shell-fire.

55. It was soon apparent that the brigade
was in contact with a strong enemy position
well supported by artillery and sited in most
difficult country. The enemy shelling was heavy
and accurate, and in addition to a number of

casualties two of our 18 pdr. guns were
damaged,

The road to Combolcia which ran over a
series of saddles with steep mountainous coun-
try on either side, could be seen to be
deliberately blocked by a mass of enemy
vehicles. To the west of the road the ground
was open and marshy and impassable to
vehicles, but on the eastern side where there
was a parallel valley a mile or two away, there
was promise of a possible covered approach.
The leading companies of the Ist D.#.O.R.
were therefore ordered to seize commanding
features on that side.

The battle then resolved itself into three
phases, which altogether occupied five days, a
long and difficult approach, the attack, and the
hurried flight of the enemy.

56. On 18th April the rst Duke of Edin-
burgh’s Own Rifles were ordered to move along
the high ground to the east of the road with
1st Transvaal ,Scottish operating on the lower
slopes and ist Royal Natal Carbineers in
reserve. Patriots under Lieut. A. G. S.
Campbell were directed round both flanks of the
enemy’s position to locate the extent of his
position and to harry his rear, and if possible
to get astride his L. of C. Enemy artillery
interfered considerably with these movements.
On the afternoon of the rgth April the Italians
launched a strong counter-attack on the right
flank of 1st D.E.O.R. which was beaten off
with heavy loss to the enemy.

Progress continued to be slow in the moun-
tainous country where all weapons, supplies
and water had to be carried by hand, and
where signal communications were very diffi-
cult. On the night of 20/21st April rst R.N.C.
relieved 1st D.E.O.R. who had then been four
days and nights in the mountains.

The steady pressure of our advance had
caused a continual thin stream of prisoners and
deserters, which undoubtedly lowered the
enemy’s morale, but all reports showed that
his main position was held by at least 2,000
Europeans, apart from African troops.

Meanwhile Campbell’s scouts had been doing
valuable work in occupying outlying features
and harrying the enemy’s flanks, and our artil-
lery had moved into more concealed positions
and gradually established a superiority of fire.

57. On 22nd April the assault was made by
ist R.N.C. who seized the main enemy posi-
tion, while the rst T.S. swept up enemy opposi-
tion on the lower slopes down the road. About
1430 hours the enemy were in flight, but road-
blocks and the difficulties of the country, no
less than the physical strain on the infantry
of the preceding days prevented any effective
pursuit. A large number of prisoners and
material were taken including 8 medium, 12
naval, 4 field, 3 light and 4 A.A. guns.

58. On 23rd April the extensive road-blocks
were cleared except for a small one which was
covered by accurate enemy artillery fire. The
artillery was brought forward into action and
the D.E.O.R. who were then once more in the
van, moved forward across country, finally
occupying on the morning of 26th April features
which overlooked Combolcia.

The road-block having been removed under
cover of darkness during the night 25/26th
April, rst T.S. moved straight on to Combolcia
where a considerable number of prisoners and
material were captured.
