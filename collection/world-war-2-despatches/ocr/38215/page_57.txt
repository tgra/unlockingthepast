SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON: GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

their reconnaissance and ground-strafing air-
craft often flying as low as roo feet. At mid-
mght 23rd/24th January the rearguards from
both the Segamat and Muar fronts passed
through Yong Peng.

369. The extrication of the Segamat Force
from its perilous position was a matter for con-
siderable satisfaction. The whole of the Sega-
mat—Muar operations required the most careful
handling by all commanders and quick com-
pliance with orders by all formations and units.
They imposed a great strain on commanders
and staffs, in illustration of which I may men-
tion that during the twenty-five days ending
23rd January I motored over 2,500 miles and
held numerous conferences in the forward areas
besides attending War Council meetings and
working late into the night at my Headquarters
at Singapore.

370. Plans for the Defence of Central
Johore.—At the Conference held south of Yong
Peng at 12.30 hrs. 21st January (see above) it
was decided that, after withdrawal from Yong
Peng, our forces would be re-organized as
under: —

Eastjorce.—All troops in the Mersing and

Kahang area under command of an officer

to be detailed by the Commander 3 Indian

Role.—To hold Jemaluang with detach-
ments forward in the Mersing area.

Westforce.—g Indian Division and A.I.F.
Jess 22 Australian Brigade Group under com-
mand of Major-General Gordon Bennett.

Role.—To hold the area exclusive Yong
Peng—inclusive Kluang—Ayer Hitam.

II Indian Division.—53 British Brigade
Group when released from Westforce).

6/15 Brigade Group of two battalions etc.

28 Indian Brigade Group,
under command of Major-General Key.

Role.—To hold the Batu Pahat area and
operate on the West Coast road. ,

371. At a conference held at Rengam on the
morning of the 23rd January I decided that
Westforce would come under command of 3
Indian Corps as soon as the last troops had
been withdrawn south of the Yong Peng road
junction. The Commander 3 Indian Corps
would then command all troops in Johore
except those anti-aircraft defences and adminis-
trative units under Headquarters Malaya
command and the Pengerang Defences under
Comdr. Singapore Fortress.

I directed that the general line Jemaluang—
Kluang—Ayer Hitam—Batu Pahat would be
held and that there would be no withdrawal
from this line without my permission.

372. In this connection I cabled to the
Supreme Commander South-West Pacific on the
24th January as under:—

‘'T want to be able to hold line of road
Kluang—Batu Pahat for another 24 hours at
least as positions further south are NOT
good...... Hope you will press for con-
tinuous attacks ‘by Fortress bombers on
Kuala Lumpur and Kuantan aerodromes. I
feel that if we can drive back his fighters we
can then deal with his bombers.”’

On the 25th January I received the following
telegram from the Supreme Commander South-
West Pacific:—

“Recent reports of heavy fighting on the
Muar front show what determined resistance
your troops are making against odds. You

1301

have not much ground behind you and this

resistance is necessary and well timed. I

have no doubt that troops have inflicted

severe casualties on the enemy. Well done.”

373. The denial of the line of aerodromes in
Central Johore to the enemy until the 18
British Division had safely arrived was now of
primary importance, t was clear that the
crisis of the campaign had arrived.

A copy of Malaya Command Operation In-
struction No. 35 issued on the 23rd January,
1942 is attached as Appendix F to this
dispatch.

374. The Batu Pahat Operations. — Batu
Pahat was a small coastal port of the same type
as Muar. The town lies on the south bank of
an estuary some seven miles from the coast.
The estuary was crossed by a road ferry. Batu
Pahat is also linked by good roads with Yong
Peng to the North, Ayer Hitam (20 miles away)
to the East, and Pontian Kechil (46 miles
away) to the South. The Air landing-ground
was at Koris, 7 miles south of Batu Pahat.
South of that the road runs within 2 or
3 miles of the sea. The country border-
ing the road and between it and the sea consists
mostly of mangrove and cocoanut plantations.
To an enemy possessing command of the sea
this route was accessible at any point and
indicated the necessity for holding both Batu
Pahat and Pontian Kechil for the protection of
the main L. of C. 20 miles inland.

Batu Pahat is dominated by the jungle-
covered Bukit Banang which lies to the south
of the town. Into this area the Japanese troops
who had landed at the lighthouse on the 16th
January (see above) had disappeared.

375. By the evening of the 19th January the
6/15 Infantry Brigade (Brigadier Challen) had
taken over responsibility for the Batu Pahat
area with the following troops under com-
mand :—

The British Battalion

2 Cambridgeshire

One Company 2 Malay Battalion
One battery 155 Field Regt. (4 guns)
rr Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery.
Administrative Units.

Batu Pahat was now also used as a base for
the Royal‘ Naval West Coast Flotilla.

The task allotted to the Commander Batu
Pahat Force was to hold the town and to keep
open the road to Ayer Hitam. To assist in the
latter task the 5 R. Norfolk Regt., whose with-
drawal from Jemaluang I had authorised, was
to co-operate, working from the Ayer Hitam
end.

376. During the 22nd and 23rd January
skirmishes took place with enemy detachments
on the Batu Pahat—Ayer Hitam road, as a
tesult of which the road was finally closed on
the evening of the 23rd January. 5 R. Norfolks
were then despatched to Batu Pahat by M.T.
moving south via Pontian Kechil. They
arrived on the morning of the 24th January and
came under orders of the Commander Batu,
Pahat Force. , 4 os

In the Bukit Banang area also the.,enemy
had become active and fighting developed in
the gun position area. The enemy troops here
were supplied with food and ammunition from
the air.

377. On the evening 23rd Jantiary the Com-
mander Batu Pahat Force, being unable to
