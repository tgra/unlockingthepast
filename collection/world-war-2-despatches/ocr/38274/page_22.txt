Among the causes were insufficient experience
in processing, climatic conditions, lack of swt-
able machinery and packing matenal, and the
difficulty of getting really suitable hygenic con-
ditions in Indian factones.

The. absence of suitable packing material in
India also handicapped production of the hght
scale and composite rations. I therefore asked
the War Office 1f the U.S.A. Forces ‘‘ K ”’ and
‘* Mountain ’’ rations could be provided for the
India Command. These are extremely well
packed, and are suitable for Brith Troops in
a tropical chmate. They are also suitable for
air supply dropping. 7

In the meantime the existing special pack
rations produced in India were found for various
reasons to fbe unsatisfactory, and were revised.

The following are now prepared in this
country :— ,

A 24 hour ration designed for assault troops
and issuable up to 48 hours. ‘Each day’s
ration is self-contained, in a carton, wrapped
and sealed in wax proof paper.

A light scale ration designed for L.R.P
troops and long distance patrols. These also
are put up in daily self-contained packs.

A complete non-cooking ration with
separate scales for British and Indian Troops.

31. Remounts and Veterinary.

A great increase in animal reinforements was
required in the cold season 1942-43 for the
Eastern Army, and a heavy toll was taken by
disease, especially surra.

In the period now under review, the exten-
sive conversion of the Army in India to a mixed
animal and mechanical transport basis caused
a further large demand for animals. In fact
by the end of the period, the number of animals
in the Army in India exceeded any previously
recorded figure even before mechanisation
began, and it was expected. during 1944-45 to
amount to some 125,000 animals. My Director

of Remounts visited South Africa to contact,

Union Defence Force officials and the Remount
Purchasing Officer there, since that country is
now our main source of supply.

Imports from South Africa during the period
came to 2,415 mules and 850 donkeys, while
over 4,000 animals were bought in India.
Arrangements were also made to import 1,500
mountain artillery mules from the U.S.A. under
Lease-Lend arrangements.

. During a period of twelve months in Assam
and nine months in Arakan a total of 9,418
animal casualties occurred Of these 34 per
cent, returned to remount depots after treat-
ment. The above total casualties exceeded our
total purchases of mules and donkeys, .etc.,
in South Africa for a corresponding period
by 996.

The ‘Chinese Forces in India received 422
horses, ponies and mules during the penod.
This made’ the total of animals issued to these
forces 6,526, against their combined demand
for 8,690.

Surra has continued in forward areas and
during the period of this Despatch, in the
4th Corps area, 828 horses and mules were
‘cured while 375 died of the disease. About
“a thousand: were usually. under treatment at
any one time. Surra was also detected in

Arakan in the. middle of August, but only
sixteen deaths occurred, while some 200 cases
were generally under treatment.

32. Ordnance Services.. ... . .

Advanced ordnance and ammunition depots
were established at Gauhati and Kanglatongbi
(near Imphal) and an advanced ammunition
depot at Palel. These were in addition to the
base and advanced depots already at Manipur
Road. In Arakan, the existing ordnance field
depot at Chittagong was expanded into ad-
vanced depots for ordnance and ammunition.
Two new ordnance field depots were formed
for divisions operating forward of Chittagong,
and a further one at Comilla for air supply

Ammunition laboratories and mobile ammuni-
tion inspection units were provided for both
the Fourteenth Army and the Eastern
Command.

Manpower in the ordnance services  stiil
remained a difficulty, ‘and recruitment of
educated types as N.C.O. clerks for office and
store duties continued to ‘be unsatisfactory.* Re-
inforcements, however, were steadily despatched
to the Fourteenth Army for ordnance field
units, and the strain was then eased.

33. The Elecincal and Mechanical Engineers
(E. & M.E,). ~

Generally speaking, the rst and and Echelon
units of the service proved satisfactory, except
the recovery company in the Light Division.
For this a heavier vehicle for jeep recovery
was found necessary and was provided, As
regards actual st and 2nd Echelon repair of
vehicles, this was satisfactory in so far as the
supply of spare parts allowed.

A lack of. and Echelon wireless repair facili-
ties was felt Tus was remedied by the addition
of wireless sections to each mobile workshop
company in an operational formation, but in the
meantime wireless repair suffered. There were
no 2nd Echelon wireless repair facilities avail-
able at all; and wireless sets which could have
been repaired in the field, had to be evacuated
to base or command workshops for the purpose.
This resulted in overloading these shops, and
heavy delays in repairs. The lack of ‘up-to-
date wireless workshop sections has been due
to a continued shortage of special test equip-
ment and artificers from England. ‘

With a view to providing some of these units
‘rom India, wireless mechanics ‘were under
“training in this country and the raising of
nine workshop sections was commenced. -

The great expansion of lines of communica-
tion continued to make heavy demands on
‘E. & ME. resources, principally in lines of
communication recovery companies, In order
to economise in mobile workshops on the lines
of communication, sixteen station workshops
were installed, thus releasing mobile units for
the forward areas.

Road transport on the lines of communica-
tion, and in particular between Manipur Road
and Imphal, continued to absorb a large amount
of E & M.E. maintenance. The thousand
vehicles employed -there were plying on a
terrain in exacting conditiéms; and to a con-
“round the clock ’’ running routine.
The water-proofing of vehicles and equipment
also required constant attention.
