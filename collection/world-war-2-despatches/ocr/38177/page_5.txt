SUPPLEMENT to tae LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 1948

Brigade, through no fault of its own, from lack

of training and its movements were also ham-
. pered by superfluous transport. Consequently

it arrived too late to assist the New Zealanders,
who in the face of powerful attacks had to
retire, first from Sidi Rezegh and then from

Belhamed.

The enemy were now again in possession of
the vitally important ground at Belhamed and
Sidi Rezegh. The troops of the Tobruk gar-
rison were still holding the Ed Duda salient,
but their front ‘was enormous relative to thdir
strength and was exposed to attack from north,
east, and south. On the frontier, the 13th
Corps had captured the Omars, but the enemy
garrisons at Bardia and Halfaya were still
holding out and were strong in artillery. Of

* the two ‘brigades of the 1st South African Divi-
sion one had been practically destroyed. Two-
thirds of the New Zealand Division had been
cut to pieces, and had had to be withdrawn to
refit. The three armoured brigades with whith
the offensive had been launched had been re-
duced to one composite formation mustering
about a hundred and twenty taiiks, all of them
inferior to the German tanks of which there
were at least half as many. Moreover there
were numerous Italian tanks, which had shown
themselves to be better than we had believed.

Apart from the 7th Armoured Division (Sup-
port Group and composite Armoured Brigade),
there remained the 22nd Guards Brigade,
which had scarcely been engaged; the 4th
Indian Division, one ‘brigade of which had
captured the Omars after heavy fighting; the
Ist South African Infantry Brigade; the 5th
New Zealand Infantry Brigade; and the 2nd
South African Division, only partially trained,
which was in process of relieving the 4th Indian
Division in front of (Bardia and Halfaya. There
were also the independent armoured car units,
the Oases Force committed in the Gialo region,
and the Tobruk garrison, which was not, how-
ever, capable of more than a limited offensive
effort. ,

But the enemy also had had a severe ham-
mering both on the ground and from the air
and was much reduced in strength. It became
therefore a question of maintaining the momen-

. tum of our attack, and I was determined that
it should be maintained. In order to be on the
spot, should a decision be required from me,
I stayed at General Ritchie’s headquarters from
the Ist to rrth December and was able to
confer with him constantly on the course of
the operations. General Ritchie clearly needed
fresh troops. I therefore arranged to make the
Royal Dragoons from Syria and the 12th Royal
Lancers, newly arrived from England, imme-
diately available, and ordered the 1st Armoured
Division, which had just arrived from the
United Kingdom, and a brigade group of the
soth Division, which had been ordered to
Iraq, to join the Eighth Army. I also formed
three Indian battalions into the 38th Indian
Infantry Brigade to help in the defence of the
lines of communication.

General Ritchie still had enough forces to
continue, and he had already made up” his
mind, rightly, that the ridges north and south
of El Adem, due south of Tobruk, were the
key to the whole position. He therefore in-
structed the two Corps Commanders to secure
them as soon as possible: the 13th Corps was
to advance westwards along the northern ridge
from the flank of the Tobruk salient and the

313

3oth Corps to capture El Gubi and close on El
Adem from the south. The role of the Armoured
Division remained unchanged: to neutralise
and destroy the enemy’s armoured forces.

For various reasons the operation did not
materialise. First, a hitch arose over the pro-
vision of transport to lift one of the Indian
brigades from the frontier—we were working to
very fine margins with: transport—and' the
Indian Division was nearly a day late in
assembling. Then a preliminary attack against
the enemy’s southern flank at Bir-el Gubi met
with strong opposition and failed in its object
of clearing the way for the advance. Finally,
when the 30th Corps had massed for the opera-
tion, the enemy had occupied the general line
E) Adem—Bir el Gubi in strength, with the
greater part of his armoured forces on the
southern flank, astride the proposed axis of
advance. The enemy having failed meanwhile |
in a last attempt to reach Bardia, and, having
several times attacked the Tobruk salient
furiously but in vain, had divined our plah
and withdrawn from the east of Tobruk. The
Armoured Division succeeded in destroying
quite a number of Italian tanks during this
time, but the German armour and the greater
part of the enemy forces remained inaccessible
behind a powerful screen of artillery and anti-
tank guns.

Light columns and armoured cars of the
3oth Corps were operating well to the north-
west of Bir el Gubi, but the Anmoured Division
was unable either to dislodge the enemy from
the southern flank or to turn the position.
Seeing that there was no time to lose, General
Ritchie took the initiative with the 13th Corps.
During the night of the 7th December the 7oth
Division began to advance along El Adem
Ridge, and by the oth they were well to the west
of the Tobruk—E] Adem road, having cleared
the whole area between the perimeter and the
by-pass road. At General Godwin-Austen’s
request, General Ritchie sent the 5th New
Zealand Infantry Brigade from Bardia to rein-
force this advance.

On the 8th December the enemy began to
withdraw rapidly but in good order towards
Gazala, covering his retirement with rearguards
strong in anti-tank artillery. The pursuit was
closely pressed by motorised columns on the
flanks and by the infantry of both Corps in the
centre and was accompanied by harassing air
action. On the roth December the Polish
Brigade broke out of the western perimeter of
Tobruk, and the long investment of the fortress
came to an end.

After the withdrawal to Gazala a brief lull
followed during which the supply lines were
reorganised with Tobruk as a forward base;
but by the 12th December our forward troops
were increasing their pressure on the new line
which the enemy had taken up, running south-
wards from Gazala. The 13th Corps took
command of operations in the forward area,
and the headquarters of the 30th Corps Iwent
back to direct operations against the enemy -
garrisons in the frontier positions.

Thad at first thought that the enemy’s stand

- at Gazala was only another delaying action to

cover further withdrawal. But the resistance
offered to our pressure, his heavy counter-
attacks, of which the 4th Indian Division bore
the brunt, and numerous air attacks showed
that he hoped to check our advance on this
line and was using all his available forces to
