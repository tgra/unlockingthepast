SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 23 MARCH, 1949

defects, to put to sea and to fly off two sorties
of four Hurricanes each to reinforce ARGUS.
One of these sorties was unable to locate
ARGUS and returned’ to AVENGER,

87. The slow assault convoy hove in sight
at 0547 and closed the L.SIs. At 0614,
AWATEA and escort were sighted. The
S.N.O., Commander P. Stubbs, R.N., had de-
cided to abandon the assault on Djidjelli be-
cause of the swell, which was causing heavy
suri on the beaches, AWATEA carried
R.AF. stores, maintenance personnel, and
petrol, it having been the intention to operate
RAF. fighters from Djidjelli aerodrome by
noon at the latest to provide cover. This de-
cision was to have far reaching effects.

88. In the meantime, friendly signals had
been received from the coastguard station, and
at 0540 ships were invited to enter. At 0702,
B was ordered by the Naval Com-
mander to enter the port and to find out the
French intentions. At about the ‘same time,
Rear-Admiral Commanding, 10th Cruiser
Squadron ordered WILTON to carry out a
similar mission. .

89. At 0720, the Naval Commander decided

to hoist all craft and close the harbour. Com-
mander Thery and the Military Commander
of Bougie boarded WILTON at 0800. As a
_ Fesult of the ensuing interview, KARANJA,
CATHAY, MARNIX and AWATEA were
anchored in Bougie Bay at 1000. The M.T.
ships of the slow convoy anchored soon after-
wards,

90. At 1140, Rear-Admiral Commanding,
10th C.S. received my order for Force “O” to
withdraw to the westward. SHEFFIELD
therefore closed ARGUS and her screen and
withdrew as ordered. Fighter protection of
shipping ceased at 1200. R.A.F. fighters were
to have flown on to Djidjelli aerodrome during
the forenoon of the lith, but when the news
of the failure to land petrol and stores at
Djidjelli reached Algiers, their. departure was
delayed until the following day.

91. At 1345, the shipping in the bay was
attacked by five S.M. 79 torpedo bombers. One
was shot down, one probably destroyed, and
two were damaged. There was no damage to
ships.

92. During the afternoon the M.T. ships
URLANA, GLENFINLAS and STANHILL
entered harbour. Unloading of personnel from
KARANJA, CATHAY, AWATEA and
MARNIX continued from the bay.

93. At 1305, BLYSKAWICA and BRAM-
HAM sailed for Algiers, where they arrived at

_ 1740. They were required to escort STRATH-
NAVER to Bougie. ;

94. At 1625, AWATEA had finished un-
loading R.A.F. personnel, stores and petrol,
and sailed for Algiers with HMS.
BICESTER and H.M.S. WILTON as escorts.

95. At 1640, a very heavy dusk air attack by
about 30 Ju. 88s developed. This was followed
by a T/B attack by He. 111 aircraft. One
T/B was shot down.

96. S.S. AWATEA was hit by four bombs,
one bomb causing a fire in No. 2 hold and

- others flooding the engine-room, causing a list
of 40°. PENSTEMON, detached from A/S
patrol by S.N.O., immediately proceeded along-
side. Later BICESTER proceeded alongside

1519

too, but efforts to extinguish the fire were abor-
tive and the ship was abandoned. About 300
survivors were taken off by PENSTEMON, .26
others were rescued from 1 lifeboat by
BICESTER, and 3 boat loads by MULL. The
ship sank by 2300 in deep water. .

97. H.M.S. ROBERTS was hit by two
bombs. One of these exploded in the issue
room and one on the. sloping side armour.
Boiler room fans were put out of action and
the inner and outer bilges on the port side
flooded, but otherwise the ship’s -fighting
efficiency was not impaired. ,

98. CATHAY was hit by one bomb in the
galley, which did not explode, and had‘ some
near misses. She still had 1,200 troops on
board. All the available landing craft were
sent over and the majority of the soldiers
landed. The ship was abandoned by all. At
2315, a fire started. This took hold and the
ship burned all night.

99. As CATHAY was known to have depth
charges on board, KARANJA and MARNIX
shifted berth, MARNIX anchored off Cap
Aokas outside the A/S patrol.

100. The vital petrol for: the fighters at
Djidjelli had been landed from AWATEA
before 1630, but as the AWATEA carried no
MT. (except a few Bren-gun carriers which
were appropriated by the 5th Buffs) and as the
M.T. ships had not yet been unloaded, the
R.AF. Servicing Commandos had _ no trans-
port to take it to the aerodrome. It was not
until 2030 that the S.N.O. ex AWATEA,
Lieutenant R. H. H. Webber, R.N., who had
taken over Beach Master in control of landing
craft at the Eastern Boat Slip was asked by the
M.L.O.,* Major Jordan, if the Navy would
undertake the transportation of petrol to the
aerodrome as there was no army transport
avaliable, priority one having been allocated
to the 5th Buffs. Lieutenant Webber then
volunteered to take the petrol, stores and
R.A, Commandos by landing: craft at dawn
the next day.

101. At 0445 12th November, H.MSS.
TYNWALD weighed anchor in readiness for
the expected dawn air attack. Thirty minutes
later, two violent explosions occurred and the
ship’ settled down in seven fathoms of water.
The ship was abandoned and survivors were
picked up by boats from ROBERTS and
SAMPHIRE. The cause of the explosion is
not known, but it is thought to be mines laid
by aircraft as flares were dropped over the
harbour at 0205.

102. At dawn (0540), a small sharp air attack
was delivered by a number of Ju. 88s from low
cloud. KARANJA was hit by at least two
bombs. An oil fuel fire immediately broke
out and the amidships. portion burst into
flames.

103. The fire spread very rapidly. Survivors:
from CATHAY and some military personnel
lowered the lifeboats without orders. The
ship’s company of KARANJA behaved in an
exemplary fashion, salvaging some Oerlikon
guns and ammunition, and eventually abandon-
ing ship at 0830 when nothing further could
be ie The ship. was empty except for some
petrol. .
