32. At Port Y, BEDOUIN at 0626,- while
leading the landing craft in towards the shore,
intercepted the Norwegian ferry steamer MIRA
flying the Norwegian flag and endeavoured to
stop her by firing a shot across her bows. As
this had no effect a second shot was fired into
the fore part of the ship, but as the ship still
did not stop effective fire was opened. One -
shot entered the ship below the funnel, steam
poured from her and she lost way. BEDOUIN
then left her to see the landing parties safely
ashore This done, BEDOUIN, acting in ac-
cordance with my instructions, returned to sink
the MIRA. It was seen that she was being
abandoned and, when this was completed and
the rafts were clear, fire was opened. MIRA
was very soon severely damaged and started to
sink slowly. ‘

33. I was subsequently informed by a mili-
tary officer of one of the landing parties tha:
the captain of the MIRA was forced at the
pistol-point by a German officer on board to
continue on his course, despite BEDOUIN’S
warning shots. It is believed that this officer
-and 12 German soldiers who were also on board
were later taken prisoner and brought back
in QUEEN EMMA. It is feared that there
were some casualties to Norwegian civilians as
a result of BEDOUIN’S gunfire.

34. By 0840 it had become evident that the
work of the Janding parties at Port Y would
shortly be completed. QUEEN EMMA, whe
had been lying off Port X, was accordingly
directed to proceed to Port Y to commence
te-embarkation of A.L'C.s.* This was com-
pleted at 1024 when QUEEN EMMA, with
BEDOUIN, returned to Port X who had re-
ported all tasks completed at 1orr and parties
ready to re-embark,

35. By 1030 SOMALI was proceeding to
cover the landing parties at Port A as LEGION
had moved southward to investigate two
trawlers which subsequently proved to be
Norwegian puffers. During ‘this passage, dense
columns of heavy black smoke could be seen
at Ports X and A rising to the tops of the
surrounding mountains, a height of several
thousand feet, sure evidence of the thorough-
ness with which the landing parties were
carrying out their tasks of destruction.

36. At Port A the military completed their
tasks successfully and LEGION was not called
upon to give any, support. Two German
trawlers, the ANDO, 300 tons, and the
GROTTO, 200 tons, which were the only
enemy ships in the harbour, were sunk by the
naval demolition party from H.M S. RODNEY
under the command of Lieutenant C.P. N.
Wells-Cole, R.N. By the trme SOMALI had
arrived at 1100 re-embarkation of troops had
already commenced.

37. At Port B, as at Port A, ESKIMO was.
not called upon to give any support to the
landing parties, who completed their tasks
successfully, nor was there any enemy shipping
present against which she could take action.

38. SOMALI returned to Port X at 1200 to
find re-embarkation in progress. The time
required for this: was increased by the large
number of prisoners and volunteers to be em-
barked in QUEEN EMMA who sailed with 852
persons on board. By 1230, however, the last

landing craft had left the shore and at 1255
QUEEN EMMA reported that she was ready
to proceed. At 1256 PRINCESS BEATRIX
made a sumlar report from Port B.

39. SOMALI, BEDOUIN, TARTAR, and
QUEEN EMMA proceeded to position C at 20
knots. LEGION, ESKIMO and PRINCESS
BEATRIX joined company at 1330 and the
whole force, in day cruising order, set course
at best speed down Vestfjord. Columns of
smoke were still rising from the burning oil
tanks and plant and a heavy pall lay over the
scene of the day’s operations.

40. At 1530 as the force was passing Vaeroy,
a German reconnaissance aircraft was sighted
by BEDOUIN and was heard by the same
ship to make a W/T report: BEDOUIN
accordingly carried out jamming procedure.
The aircraft flew at about 6,000 feet making full
use of cloud cover and was engaged by ships’
guns as opportunity offered. Although con-
ditions appeared very favourable for a bomb-
ing attack none was made and the aircraft
disappeared shortly after 1600. In view of this
sighting, I made the W/T report of the success-
ful completion of the operation at once, without
waiting antil the force was clear of the area.

41. At 1700 course was altered to the west-
ward for position P which was reached at ogoo
on 5th March, after which course was altered
to the southward. Vice Admiral Commanding,
18th Cruiser Squadron, in EDINBURGH, with

. NIGERIA in company, were sighted at 1020

on 5th March and provided escort for the

‘remainder of the passage.

42. It was known on the morning of 5th
March that the Germans had announced that
a raid had been made and I therefore con-
sidered it desirable to signal a bnef report of
the success of the operation as early as could
ibe done with safety. Accordingly when the
force was in position of approximately 64°00'N.
4°00'W and darkness was approaching W/T
silence was broken for this purpose. Unfortu-
nately signalling conditions were very un-
favourable and it took much longer than had
been anticipated to clear the message.

43. The wounded prisoners from the KREBS
were accommodated in the sick bay, and my
harbour cabin during the return passage They
received the greatest care and skilful attention
from my Medical Officer, Surgeon ‘Lieutenant
M. G Low, R.N.V.R., assisted by the sick
bay staff, the Flotilla chaplain and the canteen
amanager. The Army ‘other ranks also assisted.
Two of the men were very seriously wounded
and owe their lives to the skilled nursing they
received. Similar good arrangements for the
wounded were made in QUEEN EMMA.

44. The return passage was made without
incident and Force “ Rebel ”’ arrived at Scapa
at 1300 on 6th March.

45. After arrival prisoners and volunteers
were disembarked from all ships, the wounded
being discharged to H.M.H.S. AMARAPOORA.

General Remarks.

46. I was greatly impressed with the efficient
handling and station-keeping of the troop
carriers, particularly as they were both newly
commissioned ships with no previous experience
of working in formation. The lowering and
hoisting of the landing craft during the opera-
tion was carried out in a most efficient manner.
