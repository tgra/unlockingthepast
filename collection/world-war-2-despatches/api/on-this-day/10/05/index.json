            "description": "203. The loss of Cos deprived us of our only airfield from which single-engined fighters could operate over the Aegean, As a result, no adequate daylight cover could be given to our shipping, which now became exposed to attack iby a greatly strengthened German Air Force based in Greece and Crete, which had been rapidly expanded until it was at least equal to that in Italy; sea transport was henceforth confined to darkness. The disposition of our forces in the Aegean was Teadjusted on 5th October, when the small garrison which we had established in Calino, the neighbouring island to Cos, was withdrawn; but patrols were maintained there and on Gairos, Kythnos, Stampalia and Simi."

Arrangements were also made for dropping by air; this method was used mainly to meet urgent demands for ordnance stores and in the latter stages of the operation for various natures of ammunition, as there was no other teliable and fast method of meeting such demands, Initially, one aircraft was used each night, but ultimately as many as eighteen were used, During the period, 5th October to rgth November, 334,000 Ibs. and 200 personnel were dropped by 216 Group, Royal Air Force. A greater effort was attempted but thwarted by adverse weather,"
