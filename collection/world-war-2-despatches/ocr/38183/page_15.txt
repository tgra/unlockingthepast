shelter. Where none could be constructed, the
policy was to provide accommodation in open
spaces outside the town, where it was expected
that the population would move as soon as
bombing started. Compulsory evacuation was
not enforced. ’

Denial Schemes and Evacuation.

65. A denial scheme was prepared early in
1941 for the event of an invasion of Malaya,
and necessary instructions issued. This scheme
was directed principally to the destruction or
removal of everything that might facilitate the
movement of invading forces. It included such
things as the removal of food stocks, or their
dispersal amongst the villages, the destruction
of any form of repair workshop, as well as
the demolition of bridges and the removal or
destruction of all forms of vehicle or boat. The
plan did not envisage a complete ‘‘ scorched
earth’ policy. (See para, 119 below.) For
instance, in the case of tin mines it was only
laid down that essential parts of the machinery
of dredges were to be removed and brought
away. A plan for the denial of British-owned
tin mines in the Kra Isthmus was also worked
out by the O.M. Section of the Ministry of
Economic Warfare, including arrangements with
Commander-in-Chief, China, for the evacuation
of British personnel by sea after the denial
scheme had been carried out.

66. Originally, civil officials were ordered to
remain at their posts in the event of invasion.
This, however, was modified in December 1941,
enabling those who were suitable, physically and
otherwise, for service with military units to be
withdrawn, so that they could be used for
defence. This also applied to a proportion of
the civil medical staff.

67. The problem of British families in Singa-
pore and Malaya generally was somewhat
involved. In the case of the Navy, families
were permitted for those stationed ashore, i.e.,
officers in the light cruisers were not allowed to
bring their families out to Singapore. In the
Army and Air Force, families were allowed in
those units which were considered to be the
permanent garrison in Singapore, which in prac-
tice meant the units existing before September
1939. Units which arrived since that date were
counted as reinforcements, and families were
not allowed in their case. This gave rise to
anomalies, because some of the units, ¢.g.,
Headquarters, Malaya Command, and the
Royal Air Force Depot at Seletar, had expan-
ded very considerably since September 1939,
although they were still counted as part of the
permanent garrison. In the case of the families
of civil officials and civilians there were no
restrictions. Apart from 50 W.R.N.S. at the
Naval Wireless Station and a number of nurses,
many women were employed in the different
services for clerical, cipher and other duties,
including intelligence work in F.E.C.B. Had
all these been sent away, it would have meant
a large increase in the number of men absorbed.
As it was, we were short of women to fill suit-
able posts and thus relieve men for the fighting
units. ,

On the other hand, the presence: of large
numbers of women and children led, in Janu-
ary 1942, to hurried evacuation, with conse-
quent loss of personal belongings and dis-
comfort, and, later, to casualties. (See para.
rar below.) :

Service and Civilian Communities.

68, Relations between the Services and
civilia: communities were better up-country
than in Singapore.

The view held in the Colonial Office was that
rubber‘and tin output was of greater importance
than the training of the local forces; for instance,
a telegram, dated the 31st December, 1949, to
the Governor, states: ‘‘ The ultimate criterion
for exemption should be not what the General]
Officer Commanding considers practicable, but
what you consider essential to maintain the
necessary production and efficient labour
management.”’.

Attitude of Non-British Population.

69. With regard to the other races in Malaya,
the most numerous were the Chinese. Many of
them had no particular roots in Malaya. There
was difficulty in filling the Chinese companies
of the Volunteers up to establishment, nor could
we get a sufficient number of Chinese motor
drivers. This may have been partly the fault
of the British, and there was not sufficient con-
tact between the British and the leading men of
the Chinese community. My experience of the
Chinese under’ air bombing was that they were
calm, and with no tendency to panic.

There were several thousand Indian labourers
in Malaya, mostly Tamils, who worked on the
rubber estates. So long as they were kept free
from agitators, these Tamils were a law-abiding
community. .

Some probable fifth columnists were marked
down at Kuala Lumpur and rounded up.at the
start of the war, but there was very little fifth
column work or treachery. There was no diffi-
culty in recruiting for the two battalions of the
Malay Regiment, and young Malays who had
been specially trained in technical schools
worked well in the aircraft maintenance unit on.
Singapore Island, and were not unduly worried.
by bombing.

70. The late Major-General Dennys was.
appointed Military Attaché in Chungking shortly:
after my arrival in Singapore, with the inten-
tion that, when war with Japan broke out, he
would become head of the British Military
Mission with the Chinese, this being known as.
204 Mission. Chiefly owing to his work,
seconded by Wing-Commander Warburton and.
backed by the Ambassador, Sir A. Clark Kerr,
our relations with the Chinese were very satis-
factory, and considerable progress was made im
plans for co-operation, and, to some degree,
in their execution.

‘Co-operation as regards air consisted mainly
in the preparation of aerodrome sites and the
dispatch to China of stocks of aviation petro!’
and, finally, bombs, all for British squadrons
which it was hoped to send up later. (See
para. 26 above.) The aerodrome sites were
in threc groups: the first inthe area north
and west of Kunming, the object of which was:
largely to protect the Burma Road; the second,
an area north of Hong Kong, from which it was
hoped to assist in the defence of that place;
and the third, an area further east, from which
it was hoped that one day it might be possible
to deliver air attacks on Japan. It was only
in the ‘first.group that these preparations could
be called complete when war broke out. Trans- .
port was one of the main difficulties, and it:
