SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

the destruction of REPULSE. They are
divided mto five separate attacks with varying
periods between them, the interval between
numbers four and five being very brief.

6. The first attack developed shortly after
roo when nine aircraft in close single line
abreast formation were seen approaching
REPULSE from about Green 50* and at a
height of about 0,000 feet Fire was
at once opened on them with the Long
Range H.A. by PRINCE OF (WALES
and REPULSE. It was very soon obvious
that the attack was about to be en-
tirely concentrated on REPULSE. The
formation was very well kept and bombs were
dropped with great accuracy, one near miss on
the starboard side abreast B turret and one hit
on the port hangar burst on the armour below
the Marines’ messdeck and caused damage.
The remainder of the salvo (it was thought
seven bombs were dropped altogether), fell
very close to the port side and this concluded
this attack. There was now a short lull of about

twenty minutes during which the damage con-’

trol parties carried out their duties in a most
efficient manner and fires which had been
started by this bomb had all been got under
control before the next attack; and the bomb
having ‘burst on the armour no damage was
suffered below in the engine or boiler rooms.
It 1s thought that the bombs dropped were
about 250 pounds.

7. The second attack was shared by
PRINCE OF WALES and REPULSE and was
made by torpedo bomber aircraft. They
appeared to be the same type of machine, be-
lieved to be Mitsubishi 86 or 88. I am not
prepared to say how many machines took part
in this attack but on its conclusion I had the
impression that we had succeeded in combing
the tracks of a large number of torpedoes,
possibly as many as twelve. We were steaming
at 25 knots at the time I maintained a steady
course until the aircraft appeared to be com-
mitted to the attack when the wheel was put
over and the attacks providentially combed
I would like to record here the valuable work
done by all Bridge personnel at this time in
calmly pointing out approaching torpedo bomb-
ing aircraft which largely contributed to our
good fortune in dodging all these torpedoes.
PRINCE OF WALES was hit on the port side
right aft during this attack and a large column
of water appeared to be thrown up, larger than
subsequent columns of water which were thrown
up when REPULSE was hit later on.

8. The third attack was a high level bomb-
ing attack again concentrated on REPULSE.
Possibly the enemy were aware, and particu-
larly so if they were using 250 pound bombs,
that these bombs would have had little chance
of penetrating PRINCE OF WALES’S horizon-
tal armour. I was manoeuvring the ship at
high speed at the time and we were actually
under helm when the bombs fell. No hits
were received. There was one near miss on the
starboard side and the remainder fell just clear
on the port side. The attack was carried out
in the same determined manner as was the
first. PRINCE OF WALES had ‘‘ not under
control ’’ ‘balls hoisted at this time and I ex-
changed some signals with the Commander-in-
Chief. I asked PRINCE OF WALES about

her damage and she appeared to have a list to

. port but I got no reply though she still made

some signals by Aldis hght after this Although
uncertain at this time of the signals PRINCE
OF WALES had made, I made an emergency
report ‘‘ Enemy aircraft bombing ’’ followed
immediately by an amplifying report which
was just about to be transmitted at the time
the ship sank. I also made a visual signal to
the Commander-in-Chief telling him that we
had up to date fortunately avoided all torpedoes
fired at REPULSE and that all damage re-
ceived from the bomb had been got under con-
trol. I also asked the Commander-in-Chief
whether his wireless was still in action in case
he wished me to make any reports. I closed
PRINCE OF WALES at this time and reduced
to zo knots, the better to ascertain her damage,
and to see if I could be of any assistance.
Very shortly after this the fourth attack started
to develop.

g. In the fourth attack about eight aircraft
were seen low on the horizon on the starboard
bow. Being low down it signified another
torpedo bombing attack was impending. When
about three miles away they split into two
formations and I estimated that those on the
right hand would launch their torpedoes first
and I started to swing the ship to starboard.
The torpedoes were dropped at a distance of
2500 yards and it seemed obvious that we
should be once more successful in combing their
tracks. The left hand formation appeared
to be making straight for PRINCE OF
WALES who was at this time abaft my port
beam When these aircraft were a little before
the port beam at a distance of approximately
2000 yards they turned straight at me and fired
their torpedoes. It now became obvious that,
if these torpedoes were aimed straight,
REPULSE would be most certainly hit as any
other alteration of course would have caused
me to be hit by the tracks of those torpedoes
I was in the process of combing. One torpedo
fired from my port side was obviously going
to hit the ship and it was possible to watch its
track for about a minute and a half before this
actually took place. The.ship was hit amid-
ships port side. The ship stood this torpedo
well and continued to manoeuvre and steamed
at about 25 knots There was now only a very
short respite before the final and last attack.

ro. I think it is interesting to report here
the remarkable height from which the torpedoes
were dropped, estimated to be between three
and four hundred feet and all torpedoes ap-
peared to run perfectly straight from the point
of dropping.

tx. The second Walrus aircraft which had
been damaged by the first bombing attack was
auccesstilly got over the side to avoid a petrol

Ire.

12. From what I saw myself and from evi-
dence I received at this period it became
evident that the whole ship’s company were
carrying out their duties as if they were at
ordinary peace exercises. The damage control
parties working under Commander R. J. R.
Dendy had replaced damaged lighting, had put
out fires, and successfully coped with every
situation as it arose.

13. The torpedo bombers had carried out
some machine-gunning on the port deck and
the gunnery control positions aloft but this
was not experienced on the Bridge.
