The situation regarding Beaufort aircraft has been mentioned in para. 79 above, and small arms ammunition in para. 92. In addition to this, Australia also supplied many items of signalling equipment and special radio sets for coast defence guns. After the war started four Hudsons from Australia reached Singapore on the 23rd December and Army reinforcements were promised. (See para. 118 above.)",

            "description": "The Japanese floated troops down the Perak River by night, and on the 2and December the rath Indian Infantry Brigade was forced back South of Kuala Kangsar, The, 28th Indian Infantry Brigade was also pressed in the same direction, small detachments only being left North of Kuala Kangsar and West of the Perak River. Bridges were destroyed as the troops retired. While this was taking place on the Perak front, the Kelantan withdrawal was also continuing, the 8th Indian Infantry Brigade retiring South of Kuala Krai along the railroad. A problem similar to that of Krohco] and the r1th Division referred to above (see para. 115) now arose in regard to 8th Indian Infantry Brigade and the main body of III Corps in Perak, and, to a lesser degree, in regard to the force at Kuantan and the 8th Indian Infantry Brigade. {It was therefore decided to withdraw this 8th Brigade much further South into Central Malaya, and it took-up completely new positions in the Kuala Lipis-Raub area. A small party known as ‘‘ Macforce ’’ was left with an armoured train at Dabong to withdraw down the railway, demolishing it as they went. The Kuantan force was ordered to prepare to withdraw Westwards at short notice. On the 23rd December all our fighters on the mainland were withdrawn to Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Port Swettenham being kept as advanced landing grounds. The enemy was also occupying various points down the East coast of Malaya, and had proceeded from Kuala Trengganu to Dungun. By the 25th December it would be true to say that something like onehalf of Malaya had passed from our control.",

Squadron, engaged the Japanese air force in the defence of Rangoon and in the support of our Army in Tenasserim and Burma.

Up to the fall of Rangoon—by which we lost our warning system and our organised airfields, in this vicinity—air superiority over Rangoon had been maintained and after its fall continued until the Magwe action on the 2zst March.",

            "description": "49. Finally, although the planning and details of the operations in Arakan are dealt with in a later section of this part of the Despatch, the main events should be noted. On the 9th December, 81 (West African) Division crossed the Kaladan River. On the 15th December, Buthidaung fell to 82 (West African) Division. In the coastal sector, the advance of 25 Indian Division had been very rapid. On the 23rd December they reached Donbaik and on the 26th they were at Foul Point looking across the water at Akyab Island. Akyab itself was occupied on the 3rd January.",

            "description": "146. On the 19th December, the Navy turned their attention to a strategical target and the NAPIER shelled the town of Rathedaung, east of the Mayu Range and on the far bank of the Mayu River, which was the Headquarters of the Japanese “Sakura Detached Force.” Their fire was controlled by an Army Air Observation Post and the incident constituted an innovation in inter-Service liaison in this theatre. The results were most satisfactory. Indin Village was occupied on the 21st and its airstrip was soon in commission. In country where operational airfields were not easy to construct, this acquisition proved of great value in subsequent operations. 74 Brigade’s next bound was to Dombaik, the scene of the battle of early 1943. The enemy had recently improved this strong position, and it might have provided us with a problem. But the Japanese had been left far in the rear and the defile was occupied on the 23rd December before the enemy could get any garrison back to man their defences. They did, however, cut in behind our troops, but our advance continued unchecked. The incident merely served to illustrate once again the importance of sea power ; had we been dependent on supplies by road, this severance of land communications could not have been thus ignored. As it was, the Brigade was effectively maintained by Naval landing craft and the I.W.T.",

            "description": "13. On 23rd December and 25th December the Japanese made two large scale air raids on Rangoon. They caused practically no military damage but civilian casualties in the first raid were high, and the flight of the population from Rangoon began. From now to the final evacuation of the city, the working of the essential services, the provision of labour to unload ships and the cessation of all business became a major problem for the Government and a serious military embarrassment. The presence ‘on all routes leading towards India of many thousands of refugees, which soon grew to hun‘dreds of thousands, was another problem that occupied both civil and military to the end of the campaign.",
