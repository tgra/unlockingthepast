324. On the 9th January the situation at
Muar was reported to be serious. Twelve
Buffaloes carried out an offensive sweep of the
area, using surplus ammunition on barges
durmg their return. The latter were also
attacked twice during the day by 3 Hudsons
escorted by Buffaloes. That night, r9th/2oth
January, 6 Vildebeestes bombed the aero-
drome at Kuala Lumpur, where some twenty
fighters had been observed by Buffaloes of
No. 488(F) Squadron.

325. On the zoth January two Blenheims
made an offensive reconnaissance against ship-
ping off the coast. Later, 6 Buffaloes carried
out an offensive sweep of the Muar—Gemas
area where the Army reported heavy dive
bombing against troops of IIIrd Corps. They
met a formation of 6 Army 97’s, destroyed one
and forced the others to jettison their loads.
That evening, at last light, 7 Blenheims bombed
and machine-gunned Kuala Lumpur with great
success, claiming the destruction of over 20
fighters. 6 Hudsons attacked Kuantan at the
same time. These attacks were followed up
that night by 24 Vildebeestes, 12 bombing each
aerodrome.

326. From the 21st to 24th January, many
requests for support of the Army in the Muar
area were received, but these were days during
which the protection of convoys took pre-
cedence, and little was available with which to
meet them. On the 21st January, 6 Buffaloes
carried out sweeps in the morning and after-
noon in the Parit Salong—Batu Pahat area;
2 Albacores and 2 Buffaloes attacked small
boats near Batu Pahat; and 2 Albacores
dropped supplies successfully for troops who
had been cut off, and thus assisted them to
extricate themselves.

‘327. On 2and January the Japanese were in-
filtrating from Muar to Batu Pahat. This road
was attacked by 2 Albacores, x Shark and 6
Buffaloes. More supplies were dropped by
Albacores of No. 36 Squadron to troops cut off
in the Parit Salong area. That night, 22nd/
23rd January, 21 Vildebeestes again bornbed
Kuala Lumpur.

328. On the 23rd January, 5 Buffaloes
patrolled over the withdrawal of troops from
the Yong Peng area (N.NE, of Batu Pahat)
and engaged 12 Navy ‘QO’ fighters which were
harassing them. All available Sharks, Alba-
cores and Wirraways attacked enemy troops on
the road leading south from Muar. That mght,
a3rd/24th, 12 Vildebeestes bombed Kuantan
aerodrome.

329. On the 24th January, 6 Vildebeestes
attacked troops on the bridge at Labis on the
Segamat—Singapore road, whilst 3 ozhers
bombed oil tanks left standing at Muar

330. On the 25th January, 12 Buffaloes
carried out sweeps, morning and evening, in
the Kluang—Gemas—Batu Pahat area, whilst
that night 24 Vildebeestes and 3 Albacores
carried out 2 sorties each to cover the sea
evacuation of a battalion which had been cut
off in the Batu Pahat area. During that day
5 U.S.A. Fortresses from Java bombed Sungei
Patani under Abdair direction. At night, 3
Hudsons attacked Kuala Lumpur. *

also the strips which had been prepared in S.

SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

Johore. ‘Their loss was a severe blow, as’ it
had been hoped they would ‘be available for
the reinforcing Hurricanes; they had been
specially prepared and equipped for that pur-
pose. Seletar, which had now to be used in-
stead, was not so well equipped with dispersal
points.

Air Action against the Lavediny at Endau.

332. To turn to the East coast. On the 26th
January, at 0930 hours, Hudson reconnaissance
sighted 2 cruisers, 11 destroyers and two 10,000
ton vessels accompanied by barges, 10 miles
off the coast approaching Endau. (para 32z).
They were being protected by st aaa fighters
based on Kuantan.

333. The forces available for! opposing them
were : —

~ g: Hudsons of Nos. 1 and 8 (GR) Squad-
rons, R.A.A.F.

az Vildebeestes, 3 Albacores of Nos. 36 and
too (TB) Squadrons, i

334. The attack was orgamised in two waves.
The: first wave comprised 9, Hudsons and 12
Vildebeestes and was escorted by 15 Buffaloes
and 8 Hurricanes; the second, 3 Albacores and
g Vildebeestes, escorted by 4 Buffaloes and 8
Hurricanes.

335. Unfortunately, as ie Vildebeestes and
Albacores of Nos. 36 and 100 (TB) Squadrons
had been operating throughout the whole of the
previous night (para. 330), the first wave of
attack could not be launched until the early
afternoon. By this time most of the Japanese
troops were probably clear of their transports.

336. However, the first wave, consisting of 9
Hudsons and the Vildebeestes of No. 100 (TB)
Squadron, was able to press its attack home,
being helped by rather cloudy conditions. 5
Vildebeestes were lost. It was claimed that one
cruiser and two destroyers were sunk, both
transports were hit (one set on fire), and
casualties were caused to troops in barges and
on the beaches.

337. With the arrival of the second wave, the
Vildebeestes of No. 36 (TB) Squadron, the
weather in the area suddenly cleared and enemy
fighters intercepted the squadron before it could
attack. 6 Vildebeestes and 2 Albacores were
shot down and other aircraft damaged and air-
crews wounded. Later, 5 Hudsons of
No. 62 (B) Squadron from Sumatra arrived in
the area and attacked barges.

338. The fighter escort problem had not been
easy owing to the slow speed of the T.B. air-
craft and the distance of the target from their
aerodrome. During these two attacks, 12
Japanese Navy ‘‘O”’ fighters were shot down
and 4 damaged for the loss of 2 Hurricanes and
x Buffalo, one Hurricane pilot personally
accounting for 4 Japanese fighters.

339. No. 36 & roo (TB) Squadrons suffered
very heavily. More than half their aircraft were
shot down, including those of both Command-
ing Officers. The remainder were badly shot
about, and a number of aircrews in them were
wounded. Both were withdrawn to Java on
2gth/3oth January for reorganisation after their
very gallant effort.
