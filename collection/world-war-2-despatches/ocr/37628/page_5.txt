Part II.—SzconD PHASE—OPERATIONS FROM
Barpia TO TOoBRUK—DECEMBER I5, 1940,
TO JANUARY 21, I94I.

4. Bardia—Enemy Position and Sirength.

27. The enemy forces within the perimeter of
Bardia comprised the greater part of four in-
fantry divisions, together with guns and tanks.
Some of these formations had taken part in
the later stages of the fighting after the cap-
ture of Sidi Barrani.

28. The defences of Bardia, apart from
coastal and anti-aircraft defences, consisted of
a perimeter seventeen miles in extent, lying
mainly on a level plain South-West of the
escarpment. The perimeter itself consisted of
concrete posts at intervals of some seven hun-
dred yards, containing machine guns and anti-
tank guns, each post being wired and having
an anti-tank ditch. Five hundred yards behind
the first line was a second but less elaborate
line of support posts. Outside the whole ran
a continuous anti-tank trench and wire obstacle.
Only at the Southern end of the perimeter was
there an additional switch line, three to four
thousands yards from the oiter line.

8. Plan of Attack on Bardia.

2g. The troops available for the attack
were: —
7th Armoured Division:
Creagh.
6th Australian Division:
Mackay.
16th Infantry Brigade.
7th Battalion R.T.R.: Now reduced to 26
tanks.
ist Battalion Royal Northumberland Fusi-
liers: Machine-gun battalion. -
Corps Artillery: Consisting of one field and
one medium regiment,
Two squadrons of the Australian Divisional
Cavalry Regiment had been diverted to observe
Jarabub, to which a considerable enemy force
had withdrawn. The réle of 7th Armoured
Division was to prevent the enemy reinforc-
ing from or escaping to the North, and the
assaulting troops therefore consisted of approxi-
mately 20,000 men, 122 guns and 26 tanks.

30. The diminished resources of infantry
tanks necessitated a bold employment of infan-
try both in the assault and in the exploitation.
This demanded a high expenditure of ammuni-
tion for their protection. The period of six-
teen days between the arrival of the first in-

fantry outside Bardia and the launching of the.

attack was occupied mainly in bringing up
large additional supplies of ammunition from
railhead at Mersa Matruh. The harbour of
Sollum, which the enemy withdrawal behind
the defences of Bardia had put at our disposal,
was used for this purpose, and its possession
greatly facilitated the task.

31. The following was the general plan: —
One infantry battalion, of the 16th Aus-
tralian Brigade, closely followed by en-
gineers, was to attack at dawn at a point
due West of Bardia, where the anti-tank
Az

3265

ditch and the wire nearly coincided. Covered
by a heavy artillery concentration, the bat-
talion was to seize and hold a bridge-head
while the engineers filled in the anti-tank
ditch at five separate points. This achieved,
tanks and infantry were to enter the peri-
meter and sweep South-Eastwards on a wide
front as far as the road Bardia-Capuzzo and
the edge of the escarpment overlooking
Bardia. Thereafter units of the 17th Aus-
tralian Brigade were to break into the peri-
meter South of the original point of entry,
and, driving still further to the South-East,
contain the enemy forces manning the strong-
est positions at the Southern end. The attack
would then be exploited East and North-East
to Bardia.

While these operations were in progress
demonstrations were to be made against parts
of the perimeter remote from the real attack;
on the North by 7th Armoured Division, and
on the South by those units of 17th Aus-
tralian Brigade not taking part in the attack,
The area North of the road Bardia-Tobruk
was to be subjected to heavy bombardment
both from the sea and from the air.

9. The Assault on Bardia.

32. By the 27th December, the 16th and 17th
Australian Brigades were in position opposite
the defences, and on New Year’s Day the 19th
Australian Brigade also arrived. On the 3rd
January, at 0530 hours, the attack began. The
2/xst Battalion Australian Infantry successfully
established the bridge-head, and the engineers
had completed their task within 50 minutes.
16th and 17th Australian Brigades (Brigadiers
Allen and Savige) captured their objectives with
small loss, in spite of a counter-attack by enemy
tanks. At £745 hours on 4th January tanks and
infantry entered Bardia; and on the 5th the
defenders of the South-Eastern sector sur-
rendered. 45,000 prisoners and 462 guns, of
which 216 were field guns, were taken—117
eet and 12 medium tanks were also cap-
tured.

10. Tobruk.—Enemy Position and Strength.

33. With the loss of Bardia, the Italian forces
remaining in Cyrenaica were: —
(a) At Tobruk :—
61st Sirte Infantry Division.
Headquarters and Corps troops of
XXII Corps.
Coast Defence and Anti-Aircraft units of
Tobruk garrison.
Remnants of the divisions from the for-
ward areas,
(6) Further West—
6oth Infantry Division.
(c) About Mechili_
Nucleus of armoured formation under
General Babini.

Even before Bardia fell I had decided that
an attack on Tobruk was justified on both
operational and administrative grounds. By
the 6th January, 7th Armoured Division had
cut the roads Tobruk-Derna and Tobruk-
Mechili, and was in contact with the perimeter
and with enemy troops East of Derna and
Mechili, causing the enemy to abandon the
aerodromes at Gazala, Tmimi and Bomba. By
the 7th January, r9th Australian Infantry Bri-
gade (Brigadier Robertson) was in position fac-
ing the Eastern defences, and the remainder of
