SUPPLEMENT. to tue. LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

Navy, other -than the lightest units, to remain
in Malayan waters, particularly in the absence
of such support.

620. The freedom of the seas which the enemy
gained by his use of air power both at Pear]
Harbour and off the coast of Malaya, was
such that he was virtually free thereafter to
hit when and where he liked. The consequences
to the army and air force dispositions and
operations in Malaya were profound. No
criticism is levelled, the war against Germany
and Italy had stretched our resources as never
before. The small forces which were available
in the Far East were faced with overwhelming
circumstances and were too weak to overcome
the advantages which the enemy gained in the
first and most vital days of the campaign. In
short, neither the Air Force nor the Navy was
in a position to support the other.

Mutual Army | Air Support.

621. The enemy army proved to be more
effective than had been expected: our army
had a number of shortcomings. It is not for
this paper to say what they were or to expand
upon them: it is appropriate only to say that
they existed and that the army, in consequence,
was unable to play its part adequately in the

. provision of secure air bases for our air forces.

The root cause was the same, namely the over-
riding calls of the war in Europe and the Middle
East. .

622. When war came, the construction of
aerodromes in Malaya had outstripped the pro-
vision of air forces to occupy them. But the
aerodromes had had to be defended—a factor,
amongst others considerably more important,
which led to the army adopting a forward
policy. The army had insufficient troops for
the purpose, particularly in the absence of the
additional interim strength it required pending
full Air Force expansion. It became widely
scattered in trying to meet all its commitments,
and was defeated in detail.

623. The R.A.F., although inadequate for the
task, had to occupy these forward and ineffec-
tively defended aerodromes. There it suffered
severe losses which could not be replaced, and
it was driven out.

624. Thereafter the army had to fight in
northern and central Malaya without any air
support, and to face an enemy whose air sup-
port was constant and strong. It was not until
the Japanese advance brought the larid battle
within effective range of aerodromes on Singa-
pore island, that our army could be supported
from the air. Even then this support fell far
short of the scale demanded by the situation,
although it was the maximum available. The
enemy’s air support remained undiminished.
Neither service was in a position to support the
other or to fulfil its commitments: both suffered
severely in attempting to do both.

Mutual Support between Japanese Forces.

625. The Japanese, on the other hand, had
sufficientsforces to support one another. Their
naval and air forces were adequate to cover
the initial landings of their army, and to give
its subsequent expeditions virtual freeddm of
action to strike where and when they liked.
Their army was strong enough to hold the
countryside as it was overrun, and in particular
to deferid the aerodromes it captured. Their air

forces were able to fill those aerodromes with
aircraft, maintain them there at full strength,
and from them gain and fully exploit the advan-
tages of air superiority in the land, sea and air
battles.

They possessed what we had not—balanced
harmony by land, sea and air, their forces in
which elements were strong enough to play their
respective parts and to support one another
fully.

Joint Navy / Army | Aw Co-operation.

626. Two lessons emerge from the foregoing
factors : —

Firstly, that only by full co-ordination of
the fighting services—in strength, organisation
and methods of operating—can success be
achieved.

Secondly, that the issue of a modern war
largely depends on the struggle for secure
air bases, which all three fighting services
have a joint responsibility for obtaining,
defending and maintaining.

That side which is successful, and which
denies its opponent the advantage of secure
air bases, dominates the whole theatre of war
within air striking range. It has then every
prospect of success, while its opponent has but
little.

Tue Civir Community.
Shortages of Labour and Material.

627. Civil interests and the fighting services
competed keenly for labour, M.T., construc-
tional material and equipment, all of which
were in short supply (see paras 21 and 24).
Before war came it was difficult to obtain access
to land for the construction of aerodromes and
other installations (see para. 19), particularly
if its acquisition affected the production of
rubber or tin, which were Malaya’s most impor-.
tant contribution to the war in Europe and
which her administrators had been enjoined to
raise to a Maximum.

628. The complicated administrative
machinery in Malaya, which comprised numer-
ous states with varying constitutions, was slow
to produce results. Speed was further handi-
capped by the multiphcity é£ nationalities—
Chinese, Malay, Indian and European—who
populated Malaya and whose interests and out-
look varied widely.

Natwe Labour.

629. Experience confirmed the unreliability
of unenlisted. natives .employed as domestics,
as M.T, drivers and for construction and re-
pairmg- damage to aerodromes. They dis-
appeared en bloc, as did many: native em-
ployees of the railways, whenever bombing
started or the siren sounded. At critical
moments dislocation occurred to the domestic
hfe of R.A.F. stations, and to road and rail
movements

630. It is imperative in these days of air
warfare to enlist all native personnel on whut
dependence is to be placed in war. If enlisted,
and officered by trained leaders, the natives in
the Far East proved to be most reliable. This
was demonstrated by the R.A.F. Special Tech-
nical Corps of enlisted Chinese, Malays: and
Indians, whose service in Malaya and Java
during the war was exemplary.
