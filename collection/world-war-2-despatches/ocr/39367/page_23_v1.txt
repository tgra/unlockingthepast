275. At dawn the 2nd New Zealand Division attacked over the Sillaro River due east of Massa Lombarda and towards Medicina, and by mid-day had established a firm bridgehead. To the north, Conselice was finally occupied, while to the south, the Polish Corps captured Imola on Route 9, and swept on towards Castel San Pietro.

Summary of the First Phase.

276. Thus by the r4th April the first three of the river lines on which the enemy depended had been breached, and the Eighth Army's advance was gathering momentum. On the right flank the threat to the Argenta gap was growing, and the ground forces would soon be able to break out along Route 16 to the Po River. On the Eighth Army's left flank good progress was being made along Route 9g towards Bologna,

277. The time had therefore come to launch the Fifth Army into the Po Valley to be the left thrust of the pincer movement aimed at encircling the enemy south of the Po. On the morning of the 14th April the Fifth Army joined in the general offensive.

possibly be used even some which had previously been considered unfit for operations  was pressed into service. A total of 1,790 bombers and fighters were airborne. This force was given two tasks. The first was to attack az targets nominated by the Fifth Army, such as command posts, dumps and enemy-occupied areas, in the area south of Bologna; the second was to attack communications and stores targets further north. Some 1,600 tons of bombs were dropped by the first force, and some 800 tons by the second. The effort by the heavy bombers was augmented by that of 258 medium bombers of Tactical Air Force, which attacked enemy reserve areas at Praduro on Route 64, and at Medicina, though the latter was more intimately concerned with Eighth Army operations. Meanwhile, XXII T.A.C., in missions against targets along the front, including ground positions, command posts, occupied buildings and dumps, flew just under 500 sorties,

280. By the evening of the r5th, Vergato and Montese had been captured, and during the, night, the Fifth Army II Corps, on the right of the 4th Corps, joined in the attack.

Ground and air effort, 16th to 19th April, Fifth Army front. :

281. During these four days, all the Fifth Army forces were engaged in heavy fighting among the mountains which the enemy held so strongly, but gradual progress was made towards Bologna. Immense assistance was given in this task by both Strategic and Tactical Air Force aircraft, and the heights guarding the approaches to Bologna became universally scarred and pitted with bomb craters.



283. The night of 16th/17th April provided No. 205 Group with another communications target of importance. Casalecchio, which is located three miles south-west of Bologna, offered an excellent opportunity for the interdiction of the flow of German reserves from Bologna which was attempting to stem the Fifth Army advance. The raid was successful, the road bridge in the town being destroyed, and much other damage being caused.
