‘SUPPLEMENT To tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 2: JUNE, 1048

At 0630 the first strike took off to attack
Ishigaki airfields. This attack, and a further
one flown off at 1230, left all the mea
unserviceable.

.. At 0930 the second strike took off to attack
Miyako airfields, where previous craters were
found to be filled in and evéry endeavour had
been made to keep the airfields unserviceable.
This attack, together with another flown off at
1533, left all Miyako airfields out of action.

‘CAPS were left over both islands throughout

the day; the one over Miyako being called up -
bya Japanese who invited our aircraft to return.

to base. -Rocket-carrying Fireflies straffed a
radar station at Miyako, and ground. installa-
tions, barracks, and grounded aircraft generally
were straffed. There was no airborne opposi-
tion over the targets and flak was moderate.

At 1700 bad height estimation was the catise

of failure to intercept a bogey which crossed
ahead of the Fleet from east to west.
' At 144r two divisions of fighters staggered in
height and range got close to an erratic and fast
moving bogey but were unable to, find any
target.

At 1505 a bogey was detected, range 9 miles,
and followed from 25,000 feet to sea level where
it disappeared. At about this time a large cloud
of smoke was seen on the horizon and an un-
identified twin was reported as sighted over
the Fleet. ‘

At 1536 fighters failed to find a 320 knot
bogey closing from the westward, the bogey
fading at 25 miles.

A possible explanation for these srysiotious
bogeys is that they were piloted flying bombs
Jaunched too far away and which failed to reach
the Fleet before exhausting their fuel.

At 1722 Hellcats shot down a Myrt* which
was apparently stalking an American Privateer
search plane.

. In the evening false alarms were caused by
some of our fighters returning from the islands
and in one case ship fire was opened on them
due to an improper approach by the

and faulty recognition by the ship.

In the afternoon a Seafire landing on

INDEFATIGABLE bounced, cleared the bar-,

tiers and crashed. The pilot was unhurt, but
the plane wrecked an Avenger, damaged a
Firefly, and knocked two ratings over the side.
QUIBERON picked up one, but the other man
was unfortunately not recovered.

In spite of having received no replenish-
ment aircraft since gth April and the lack of
fighters consequently felt, A.C. informed me

that he considered a sixth operation period, if

confined to one day, would be possible. I was
happy therefore, in view of the sustained heavy
enemy air attacks on our Fleetmates. at and
around Okinawa, to inform Commander 5th
Fleet as follows :—

Continuing operations Sakishima tomorrow.
Own “idsses' light. Little. enemy activity
except anti-aircraft fire. If light losses con-
an tinue, can strike final blow roth April. Same
*" Dumbo and submarine services needed.

_A further signal altering -the final-strike date
from gth tozoth April was made to Commander

3th Fleet as A.C.x informed me that main-
tenance of aircraft necessitated two days’ work
in the fuelling area..

At dusk the Fleet disengaged to the south
eastward and CIF 57 assumed tactical com-
mand at 2110.

The score for the day was :—

Enemy:

Destroyed—airborne ty

total 2.

Own: ' .
Destroyed in combat 2, operationally 33
total 5.

17th April.

A.C.1 assumed tactical command at 0520.

CAP was flown off at o600 from position 23°
34’ N 125° 38’ E.

In view of the apparent success of yester-
day’s neutralisation, the number of bombers in
the main ‘strikes was reduced; the first strike
taking off at 0630. First reports showed that
considerable effort had been made to fill in the
runway craters at Miyako but none at Ishigaki.
Consequently no bombing strike was sent to
Ighigaki. Of the three strikes sent to Miyako,

on ue ry

’ the first two left all airfields unserviceable and

the third attacked municipal buildings and
barracks.

In this last attack an Avenger was shot down
and one of the crew succeeded ‘in baling out
and alighted on the water 14 miles from Hirara
town. A Walrus was quickly flown off and
rescued the airman, whilst a fighter escort kept
down fire which was opened from the town.

‘CAPS were maintained ‘over both islands,
but reported no activity on any airfields, all of
which remained unserviceable at the end of the
day. No operational aircraft could be found
on the ground.

At 0609 a few bogeys were detected to the
north west of the Fleet. Fighters sent to
investigate splashed one Zeke.

At 1627 bogeys were detected 110 miles west
of the Fleet. Fighters intercepted at 55 miles
and two out of 6 Zekes were shot down, the
others _ escaping in cloud.

the afternoon a Privateer American
aircraft flying at zero feet between Ishigaki and
Triomote was momentarily mistaken for a
bandit* and given a short burst at extreme
range by Corsairs. No damage-resulted. This
unfortunate incident has since been cleared up
with the U.S. authorities and the question of
periodical U.S. search planes approaching Task
Force 57 fully discussed. It is hoped that the
arrangements made will ‘obviate.such incidents
in the future.

At 1750 close range weapons in KING
GEORGE V suddenly opened, fire on what
appeared to be a blazing aircraft diving
vertically on the ship. It turned out ‘to be a
dropped tank from a Corsair overhead—both
parties missed. .

The score for the day was: —
Enemy:
.. Aircraft destroyed—airborne 3.

Several small ships damaged.

, Own:
Aircraft lost in combat 1.
