            "description": "\" the air at the time it was needed; the telephone .service would undoubtedly be overloaded; letters or telegrams provided no confirmation of delivery of the message and I -finally con- cluded that messages by hand to key men, through whom the order would be spread down- ward to all who were involved, provided the only satisfactory solution. It so happened that when mobilization was required the defences were already manned in part and had been as a precaution since+28th April, 1939, with the result that the problem in the end was not fully presented."

            "description": "On the northernmost sector progress by II Corps was steady and continuous throughout this period. The enemy defences were strong and long-established and the terrain, as I have said, was particularly difficult; these advan- tages outweighed in the early stages their numerical inferiority and the lack of reserves for the defence, but as position after position was wrested away there were increasingly less troops to man the positions in rear. 9 and 1 Infantry Divisions attacked on, the morning of 23rd April on the Sedjenane-Mateur and B\u00e9ja-Mateur axes respectively. On the first day 9 Division gained its objective west of El] Aouana 1 Division made slightly slower progress but by the 25th had reached the high ground a mile to the south-east of Sidi Nsir station. This advance had exposed the left flank of the division and 34 Infantry Divi- sion was now brought in between the other two to clear up the area astride the Sidi Nsir- Mateur road. The mdge of hills west of Sidi Nsir was cleared by 28th April after three days of concentrated artillery fire and on the same day the high ground east of the village was captured after close and heavy fighting."

The scale of attack in this area was considerably increased after 27th April when our column from the South captured Dessie, Nos. 47 and 237 Squad- tons making over 80 bomber and fighter sorties on enemy positions around Amba Alagi be- tween 28th April and 3rd May to break down the remaining resistance. The enemy was still holding out, however, at the end of the period under review, although the forces -there, uftder the Duke D\u2019Aosta, \u2018subsequently capitulated on 16th May."

            "description": "The Emperor entered the citadel at Debra Markos on 6th April. As Ras Hailu (be- lieved to be in communication with the enemy) remained in the town with 6,000 Banda, and as relations between him and the Emperor were frigid, the bulk of Gideon Force was kept in Debra Markos until 28th April, when they accompanied the Emperor across the Blue Nile to Addis Ababa. By this time some of the Frontier Battalion M.T. had been skilfully driven across the difficult country of Belaya and hauled by rope and manpower up the escarpment, and the pontoon bridge across the Nile at Shafartak had been repaired. The last remaining Italian force in eastern Gojjam, 69 Colonial \u2018Battalion at Mota, had also been re- duced by the usual combination of deception and harassing force, after a strenuous march by the Sudanese plainsmen of the Frontier Bat- talion in their cotton uniforms through a blizzard in the 14,000 foot Chokey Pass. At Mota 400 Italian Colonial troops surrendered to sixty Sudanese and stores and ammunition were captured. Similarly big stores of foodstuffs had been saved from looting at Debra Markos."

The situation in 20 Indian Division\u2019s area on the 26th April was as follows. 80 Brigade in the Magwe area had pushed patrols across the river, which reported enemy motor transport moving west out of Minbu. Magwe itself was being heavily shelled from the west side of the Irrawaddy. 100 Brigade was pass- ing through 32 Brigade on the road leading from Satthwa to Allanmyo. After clearing opposition 26 miles north of Allanmyo on the 27th, 100 Brigade again made contact just north of the town. Allanmyo fell the following day, after 36 hours fighting, and we captured five guns. Meanwhile, 80 Brigade, advancing south from Magwe, was destroying many par- ties of the enemy who were trying to cross the river from the right bank and escape east- wards. At Allanmyo, 100 Brigade were 252 miles from Rangoon on the 28th April. By the 2nd May, breaking through all enemy attempts to stop it, it had advanced a further 40 miles and captured the great river port (now in ruins) of Prome, the eastern terminus of the road from Taungup. The last escape route of the rem- nants of the Japanese forces in South Arakan was now blocked."

Kimura had apparently no hope of retaking Toungoo itself, but ihe directed 15 Japanese Division to accelerate its move west from Mawchi and block the Toungoo\u2014Mawchi road at the point where it enters the hills. The object was two- fold. First, this threat.to 4 Corps might delay fits advance and cause it to divert troops; secondly, this position would protect the flank of those elements of 33 Japanese Army still north of Mawchi, who were retreating south. The Japanese Commander\u2019s next step was to concentrate every available man for the defence of Pegu. 24 Independent Mixed Brigade was rushed north from Moulmein to the Pegu\u2014 Mokopalin area. He also formed two new Mixed Brigades rom the Rangoon garrison, which were largely composed of administrative and naval personnel. The Rangoon Anti-Aircraft Command, the largest in Burma, provided the guns for this scratch force, all its batteries being utilised for this punpose. These two brigades were moved up to Pegu on 27th April with orders \u201cTo destroy the enemy north of Payagyi and 'Waw \u201d, which lie 10 and 15 miles north and north-west of Pegu respectively. While this was going on, the major portion of the small detachments guarding the mouth of the Rangoon River were moved back into Rangoon \u201c To cover demolitions \u201d. With effect from the 28th April, therefore, Rangoon was prcieaily denuded of troops, except for 5,000"
