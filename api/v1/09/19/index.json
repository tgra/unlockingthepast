            "description": "28. The Military situation, stabilised on D+6, 15th September, gradually improved; indications of a general German withdrawal were seen on D+7. On 19th September, Eboli and, on 20th, Campagna and several other towns in the vicinity were captured. Five days later the port of Salerno was re- opened, followed quickly by the capture of Castellammare on 28th and of Torre Annunziata the next day. Naples was entered on lst October and with its capture, Operation \u201c Avalanche \u201d drew to a close. The port of Naples had been carefully and methodically wrecked by the withdrawing enemy, but even so, two days later five Liberty ship berths, six coaster berths and eight holding berths were cleared. By the 6th October discharge over the Salerno beaches was almost completed, the port of Naples was functioning slowly, and on that day Operation \u201c Avalanche\u201d was officially deemed to have been completed."

Nor had any U-boats apparently succeeded in following the covering. force across. The favourable weather con- tinued, and in -spite of one aircraft sighting on 18th September, Rear Admiral Commanding, Home Fleet Destroyers had hopes of getting safely past the southern end of Spitzbergen and evading further attack. by a turn there to the north-westward. But the convoy was located again by two. enemy aircraft on the morning of 19th September, and the U-boat pack joined up again during the day."
