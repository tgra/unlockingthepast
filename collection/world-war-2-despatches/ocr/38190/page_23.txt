SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 JANUARY, 1948

remained in enemy hands. Information indi-
cated that the enemy’s local HQ and organising
centre was at Wong Nei Chong Gap, but owing
to the configuration of the ground it was not

~ possible to shell this over the top of Mount

Nicholson, for the remaining sections of mobile
artillery were in positions in the area Victoria
Peak-Mount Gough-Mount Kellett. Wowever
I am confident that heavy casualties were in-
flicted on the enemy on the stretch of Blacks
Link between Wong Nei Chong Gap and Middle
Gap, for a g.2-in. gun from Stanley had been
engaging enemy in this area for the last two
days with immediate observation from Shou-
shon Hill nearby. In addition Major H. Marsh
had expended some 20,000 rounds from his
medium machine guns on very good targets
at ideal ranges. It was now learnt that two
small ammunition convoys had got through to
Little Hong Kong during the previous night and
had returned successfully with much needed
supplies. At this time Stanley was being
supplied with ammunition by motor torpedo
at.

118. Meanwhile the situation to the North
was causing me considerable anxiety. The
composite company of 5/7 Rajput Regt. much
reduced in numbers and short of ammunition
and food, had been forced to withdraw at about
-o800 hours, exposing the right flank of the
Middlesex Leighton Hill position held by Cap-
tain C. M. Man’s Z” Company. At 0922
hours he was holding on, though the enemy
was infiltrating into the houses and streets
around him. He had only forty men, with six
machine guns. At 1000 hours the enemy
attacked him strongly, and heavily shelled the
Bowrington area.

At rroo hours the bombardment again in-
tensified and the positions of one machine gun
platoon were completely destroyed. The guns,
however, moved into the Lee Theatre to hold
the North flank. At Fortress H.Q. fifty Royal
Artillery and 2 Royal Scots personnel were
gollented and sent to reinforce 1 Middlesex

egt.

rrg. At z000 hours 23rd December Com-
mander East Infantry Brigade reported that
a counter-attack on Stanley Mound had failed.
The Royal Rifles of Canada had had heavy
losses, the enemy were infiltrating and the
Commanding Officer felt he must fall back.
The Infantry Brigade was in the process of re-
connoitering and organising three defensive
positions in depth which were to be held to
the last, the most northerly being well forward
of Stanley Village. The Canadians felt that
they could put up a better resistance on flatter
ground, and on a narrower front, where com-
munications would be simpler. The loss of
the tactically important high ground was fully
realised and very regrettable.

120. At 1000 hours the enemy were attacking
Bennets Hill and bombing Aberdeen Dockyard,
also A.A. positions in Victoria City.

rar, At 1130 hours HQ 1 Middlesex Regt.
was forced to withdraw to a prepared posi-
tion. At noon the line ran:—South-east corner
Race Course to (exclusive) Leighton Hill (sixty
men‘of 5/7 Rajput Regt.)—Leighton Hill and
northwards (by 1 Middlesex Regt) to pill
box 55.

At about 1500 hours the enemy attacked, but
was beaten off.

122. At 1330 hours 23rd December communi-
cation was re-established with HQ West Infan-
try Brigade at Magazine Gap and it was learnt
that about 250 enémy were round St. Albert’s
Convent, that our troops on the Northern slopes
of? Mount Cameron were withdrawing* and
that Magazine Gap and Wanchai Gap were
being heavily bombed. The positions at every
“ gap ’’ were unenviable, for the nature of the
country was such that local defence was bound
to be restricted and confined to the gap itself,
thus providing an excellent target for the enemy
air force, which did not fail to take due advan-
tage of the opportunity. These positions were
originally prepared for limiting any enemy ex-
ploitation after a South shore landing.

At 1430 hours our line ran from Bennets
Hill to Wanchai Gap, and a patrol of 2 Royal
Scots was going out to Mount Cameron.

123. At 1645 hours 23rd December the last
Army W/T set was knocked out by shell fire,
and communications with the United Kingdom
and Singapore ceased except that military mes-
sages could be and were transmitted by Royal
Navy W/T.

124. At 1730 hours communication was re-
opened at HQ 2 Royal Scots at Wanchai Gap,
who reported that they were holding the western
slopes of Mount Cameron.

125. With difficulty eight ammunition lorries
had been collected and organised, and during *
the night six of these managed, with the help
of an armoured car of the HKVDC, to get to
the Ordnance Depot at Little Hong Kong and
obtain some badly wanted gun and mortar
ammunition. There were unfortunately no
hand grenades there (they were in the other
Reserve Depot at The Ridge), for these were
now urgently needed in the street fighting
which was developing in the area North of the
Race Course.

126. Morning (23/24th December) disposi-
tions of West Infantry Brigade were—Brigade
HQ Magazine Gap, HQ 2 Royal Scots and
Winnipeg Grenadiers at Wanchai Gap, 2 Royal
Scots still holding the West slopes of Mount
Cameron and patrolling forward, Winnipeg
Grenadiers holding down to Aberdeen Reservoir,
Little Hong Kong area still holding out, 4 and 7
Companies HKVDC on the new line to which
they had been moved (Mount Kellett to Mount
Gough).

127:—(a) At about 0400 hours 24th Decem-
ber the Royal Rifles of Canada were back on a
hne across Stanley Peninsula from near pill box
27 on Tytam Bay, through St Stephens College
buildings to West Bay, but the battalion re-
quired regrouping. A forward lne had been
formed through the Police Station manned by
““B”’ and “‘ D’’ companies 1 Middlesex Regi-
ment, some H K.V.D.C., prison warders (en-
listed as volunteers), and a few other personnel.
The 1 Middlesex crews from the pill boxes
in the area of Repulse Bay had been ordered
to withdraw and had joined the Stanley Forces
with all their machine guns, equipment and
most of the small arms ammunition—a timely
reinforcement and an excellent achievement,

(6) Bngadier Wallis assured me that Stanley
Force were in good heart and that he was con-

* It was not till some time later that this statement
ve withdrawal was found to be untrue,
