SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1941

beaches were organised at La Panne, Bray Dunes
and Malo-les-Bains, one being allotted to each
Corps; and military beach parties were impro-
vised on each Corps beach. They carried on
without naval assistance for two days, but were
hampered by a.shortage of small boats and by a
lack of experience in their use. The troops were

unable to handle boats on a falling tide, and —

during daylight on thé 27th, when only one
destroyer and two whalers were available for
work on the beaches, not more than two hundred
men were embarked.

Dunkirk, which for some days had been
heavily bombed, received a particularly severe
attack on 27th May; lorry columns had been
set on fire in the town and a pall of black smoke
from the burning oil tanks hung continuously
over the town and docks, impeding the air
defence.

Though the outer mole could still be used
the inner harbour was now blocked except to
small ships.

Dunkirk was therefore cleared of all troops
and they were sent to the dunes east of the
town to await embarkation. The port itself
was kept under the control of G.H.Q. and
manned by naval ratings. At one ‘time it
seemed likely to go out of use at any moment,
but troops were in fact embarked there till the
end, in numbers which far exceeded expecta-
tions.

Supplies, water and ammunition were des-
patched from England to the beaches, and
on 28th May the first convoy arrived. Unfortu-
nately a high proportion of these stores were
destroyed on th
anchored off the shore. Nevertheless consider-
able quantities were landed at Coxyde and La
Panne and served to create a badly needed
reserve.

During 27th May, the move of 5th and soth
Divisions was completed and the left flank thus
extended as far as Ypres. On the front from
Bergues to Hazebrouck enemy pressure steadily
increased. .

On the same afternoon, G.H.Q. moved from
Premesques to Houtkerque (six miles W.N.W.
of Poperinghe). Communications were difficult
throughout the day since Corps headquarters
were all on the move, and it had not yet been
possible to re-establish . line communications
which hitherto had run through Lille.

The Belgian Armistice.

51. During 27th May, I received a further
telegram from the Secretary of State which
read “. .. want to make it quite clear that
sole task now-is to evacuate to England maxi-
mum of your force possible’. It was therefore
very necessary to discuss further plans with
General Blanchard, for no policy had yet been
laid down by G.Q.G. or any other French higher
authority for a withdrawal northward of the Lys.
I had no idea what plans either he or Admiral
Abrial had in mind.

In the evening, I left my headquarters at
Houtkerque with the C.G.S. and the French
liaison officer from General Blanchard’s head-
quarters to try and get into touch with General
Blanchard. I failed to find him at La Panne,
so I went on to Bastion No. 32 at Dunkirk to
visit Admiral Abrial, only to find-that both he
and General Fagalde were equally unaware of
his whereabouts.

While at the Bastion, General Koeltz asked
me, shortly after 11 p.m. whether I had yet
heard that H.M. the King of the Belgians had
asked for an armistice from midnight that
night. This was. the first intimation I had
received of this intention, although I had
already formed the opinion that the Belgian
Army was now incapable of offering serious
or prolonged resistance to the enemy. I now
found myself suddenly faced with an open gap
of 20 miles between Ypres and the sea through
which enemy armoured forces might reach the
‘beaches.

Owing to the congestion on the roads, I did
not get back to my headquarters at Houtkerque
until about 4.30 a.m. on 28th May. There I
found that a telegram had been received from
the War Office at 1.30 a.m. saying that H.M.
the King of the Belgians was capitulating at
midnight. :

_ Withdrawal. to’ the Sea.

52..Next morning (28th May), General

‘Blanchard arrived at my headquarters at

Houtkerque at about 11 a.m., and I read him

.the telegram which I had received the previous

day from the Secretary of State. It was then
clear to me that whereas we had both received
similar instructions from our own Government
for the establishment of a bridgehead he had,
as yet, received no instructions to correspond

‘with those I had received to evacuate my troops. ©

General Blanchard therefore could not see his
way to contemplate evacuation.

I then expressed the opinion that now the
Belgian Army had ceased to exist, the only
alternatives could be evacuation or surrender.
The enemy threat to the North-Eastern flank
appeared certain to develop during the next
forty-eight hours. The long South-Western flank
was being subjected to constant and increasing
pressure, especially at Cassel and Wormhoudt,
and the arrival of the enemy heavy columns
could not be long delayed. These considerations
could not be lightly dismissed. While this dis-
cussion was taking place, a liaison officer arrived
from General Prioux, now in command of the
French 1st Army, to say that the latter did not
consider his troops were fit to make any further
move and that he therefore intended to remain
in the area between Bethune and Lille, protected
by the quadrangle of canals.

I then begged General Blanchard, for the sake
of France, the French Army and the Allied
Cause to order General Prioux back. Surely,
I said, his troops were not all so tired as to be
incapable of moving. The French Government
would be able to provide ships at least for some .
of his troops, and the chance of saving a part of
his trained soldiers was preferable to the cer- -
tainty of losing them all. I could not move
him. Finally he asked me formally whether it
was my intention to withdraw that night to the
line Cassel~Poperinghe-Y pres.

I replied in the affirmative and informed him
that I now had formal orders from His Majesty’s
Government to withdraw the B.E.F. and that
if I was to have any hope of carrying them out
I must.continue my move that night. General
Blanchard’s parting was not unfriendly, and
when he left I issued my orders for withdrawal
to provide for that change of mind on the part
of the French High Command for which I so
sincerely hoped and which in fact took place
later.
