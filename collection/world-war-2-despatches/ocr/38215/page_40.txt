ong. making for Sampit in the centre of_ the
south coast and the. other for Pankalang Boen
120 miles to the. West. It was hoped to find
sea transport which would take the columns to
Java. The columns left early in February and
arrived at their ‘destinations simultaneously.
On arrival at Sampit the eastern column found
a Japanese force there which it engaged. It
then joined the western column by marching
on a compass bearing through dense jungle
for six days. The distance covered by the
eastern column from Kuching to Sampit was
over 800 mules, the major portion on foot
through jungle. On the 3rd April the whole
force, which was in an exhausted state after
its long march, became prisoners of war. A
high standard of discipline had been main-
tained by the troops who had covered hundreds
of miles carrying their light automatics and
ammunition with no transport through some
of the worst country in the world, ‘

226. Labuan.—On the 3rd January, 1942,
a small Japanese force took possession of the
Island of Labuan, which was not defended,

227. British North Borneo.—The State of
British North Borneo was organized into two
Admimstrative Divisions, the east and wes!
coast Residencies. The seat of Government was
at Sandakan.

On the 3rd January a small detachment from
the Japanese force which had landed at Labuan
proceeded in a captured motor vessel to Mem-
pakul on the coast of British North Borneo
and from there to Weston, a small port at the
mouth of the River Padar. At Weston the
detachment commandeered a train and pro-
ceeded to Beaufort .20 miles distant The
detachment at Beaufort was reinforced on the
evening 3rd January. On the 6th January
Japanese forces entered Jesselton by rail from
Beaufort (56 miles). All the west coast area
was now under Japanese control and the
Governor (Mr. C. R. Smith) severed all con-
nection between the east and west coast Resi-
dencies.

On the 19th January a Japanese force, esti
mated at 600 strong, arrived at Sandakan,
British North Borneo, having assembled at
Banggi Island off the north coast of North
Borneo two days earlier. It came in two
coastal vessels captured in Brunei waters and
twelve Japanese motor fishing vessels. The
troops from the latter landed in two creeks to
the north of the Sandakan area and reached
Sandakan by land at about 0900 hrs. The two
coastal vessels entered Sandakan harbour at
about 0930 hrs. The Governor surrendered
the whole State at ogoo hrs. rgth January and
refused to carry on the administration under
Japanese control. He and his staff were
interned.

Tawau, situated on the east coast near the
N-E.I. border, was occupied by the Japanese
on the 24th January and Lahad Datu, between
Tawau and Sandakan, on the 26th or 27th
January. Kudat on the north coast was occu-
pied about the rst February and the whole
State then came under Japanese control.

A great deal of denial damage*was done
under the Governor’s orders in accordance with
plans carefully prepared beforehand. In par-
ticular, coastal vessels and local craft, includifig
a number of Japanese craft, were sunk. The
Japanese occupying forces were much incensed

at the damage done, especially at Sandakan
and Tawau. :

228. Christmas Island.—On the zoth January
our Coast Defence Artillery at Christmas Island
engaged an enemy submarine which had tor-
pedoed a Norwegian vessel.

-SecTion XXVI.—THE HIGHER COMMAND.

229. On 5th January, Vice-Admiral Sir

Geoffrey Layton, Commander-in-Chief, Eastern
Fleet, moved his headquarters from Singaporé
to Batavia:
* This move was decided on primarily because
of the now vital necessity of taking every pos-
sible step to ensure the safe and timely arrival
of troop convoys at Singapore. This necessi-
tated close co-operation with the American and
Dutch Commanders, which could only be
achieved at Batavia.

Moreover, by this date it had become
apparent that Singapore’ would shortly be ex-
posed to heavy air attack by bombers escorted
by fighters and therefore would be of little value
in the immediate future as a base for heavy
surface ships. The Rear-Admiral Malaya
(Rear-Admiral Spooner) became Senior Naval
Officer at Singapore, and resumed responsi-
bihty for the whole of the local naval defence
of Malaya.

230. On the 23rd December, 1941, Lt.-Gen.
Sir Henry Pownall arrived to succeed Air Chief
Marshal Sir Robert Brooke Popham as Com-
mander-in-Chief Far East in accordance with
a decision which had been made before the out-
break of hostilities. He immediately went
North to the 3 Indian Corps area, visiting the
11 Indian Division on the 25th Dec. and the
g Indian Division on the 26th Dec. On the
7th Jan., 1942, General Sir Archibald Wavell
(now Field-Marshal Earl Wavell) arrived at
Singapore to assume the appointment of
Supreme Commander South West Pacific Com:
mand. After visiting Headquarters 3 Indian
Corps and troops of the 11 Indian Division on
the 8th Jan. General Wavell left Singapore for
Java. The Far East Combined Bureau accom-
panied him except for a few officers who were
left to strengthen the Intelligence Branches of
the Service Staffs at Singapore. On the estab-
lishment of Headquarters South West Pacific
Command, the appointment of Commander-in-
Chief Far East lapsed.

231. Mr. Duff Cooper, the Cabinet represen-
tative in the Far East, also left Singapore early
in January.

232. It was generally agreed that these rapid
changes in the Higher Command, necessary
though they may have been, had an unsettling
effect and did not make for continuity. -

233. Early in 1941 a denial scheme for the
event of the invasion of Malaya had been pre-
pared and necessary instructions issued. This
scheme was directed principally to the destruc-
tion ‘or removal of everything that might facili-
tate the movement of invading forces, i.e.,
the destruction of any form of repair workshop,
the demolition of bridges and the removal or
destruction of all forms-of vehicle or boat, The
plan did not envisage a complete Scorche
Earth Policy. ‘i
