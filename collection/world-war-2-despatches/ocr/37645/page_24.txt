which. any observation could be got on to the
top of the plateau. The enemy has command
of movement in the valley. His guns and
mortars are placed out of range of anything
smaller than 25 pounders. The country round
Debivar is such that Battery positions for
field artillery, within effective range and under
cover from enemy fire, are difficult to find.
One battery of 25 pounders is about the limit
that can be fitted in.

The only other way on to the escarpment so
far discovered is by a mule track which winds
eighteen miles through the hills and comes up
on to the plateau at Bosa, fifteen miles west of
Debarech. This track is only fit for mules, and
at times in the rains is impassable even by them.
The plateau itself reaches 10,000 feet. Condi-
tions on the top in the rainy season are un-
comfortable and cold. The country on top is
rolling. As far as is known, no great physical
difficulties exist between Wolchefit and Gondar.
The road Wolchefit-Gondar is an all-weather
M.T. road. Up the pass it is mined and blocked
by demolitions. The exact extent of these
demolitions are not yet known but it is believed
that they are not unduly serious and that a
Sappers and Miners Company with power tools
could probably clear a way in a few days
uninterrupted work.

Operations.

Up to date it has been impossible to force
a way up the Wolchefit Pass. Operations have
been confined to assisting patriot forces already
on the plateau. These consist of a force operat-
ing from Bosa, commanded by Major Ringrose
with onecompany of3 Ethiopian Battalion under
command. Nearer Gondar a party of patriots
under el Bimbashi Sheppard came across
from the Chelga direction and occupied Amba
Giyorgis on the road ‘Wolchefit-Gondar. The
third party are the patriots who assisted in the
capture of Debra Tabor under Major Douglas.
These three parties, all of which vary daily
in numbers, have been the only forces directly
threatening Gondar since the fall of Debra
Tabor and the withdrawal from Chelga.

Capture of Debarech.

By 28th May el Bimbashi Sheppard was
occupying Amba Giyorgis and the whole road
from inclusive Amba Giyorgis to exclusive
Debarech was in patriot hands, Between 28th
and 31st May severe fighting in the Debarech
area resulted in the capture of Debarech. The
enemy suffered more than 400 killed and over
150 deserters. Three small forts to the west
of Debarech were also captured and the enem
was penned into the tongue of land immedi-
ately round the Wolchefit forts. *

Night Attack 17th June.

Nothing further was undertaken until 17th
June when Major Ringrose made a successful
night attack on one of the forts at the Wolche-
fit. His troops were allowed to enter by
unsuspecting sentries and the Italians were
caught sleeping. The enemy casualties were
over 100, several places were burnt and mines
laid. Our casualties were three slightly
wounded.

Loss of Debarech.

On 23rd June the enemy counter-attacked
strongly against Ringrose’s patriots who were
dispersed and defeated, Ras Ayalu and his

son, who had loyally supported Ringrose, were
captured. Major Ringrose himself was
slightly wounded and barely escaped with a
small ‘bodyguard and his two British wireless
operators. The enemy recaptured Debarech
and advanced some distance westwards
towards Bosa.

Formation of Necol.

On 27th June one battery 28 Field Regi-
ment was sent down to the Wolchefit and
““Necol "’ was formed consisting of 28 Field
Regiment less one battery, No. 2.M.M.G.
Group, $.D.F. less one company, 5% Com-
mando and 20 Field Company, Sappers and
Miners. This force was ordered to assist the
patriots by every means in their power with
the object of securing a bridgehead on the top
of the pass, and thus allow the road-blocks to
be cleared for an advance on Gondar. On 6th
July a plan was made to attack the Wolchefit
Pass with regular troops, the patriots co-operat-
ing. In outline the plan was as follows:—

Plan to attack Wolchefit.

3/14 Punjab Regiment was to start from
Zarema, the village where the mule track to
Bosa leaves the main road, and march to Bosa.
From there a reconnaissance was to be made,
it being left to the discretion of the Officer
Commanding 3/14 Punjab Regiment to decide
whether or not the operation was feasible. He
alone could decide, after having seen the
country. A gunner O.P. with a wireless set
accompanied 3/14 Punjab Regiment. The
supply of regular troops on the top of this
pass was a matter of difficulty, and the suc-
cess or failure of the operation depended upon
very close timing and the maintenance of wire-
less communication with the troops on the
plateau. The R.A.F. guaranteed 30 sorties by
Wellesley aircraft for the purpose of dropping
ammunition and supplies. It was realised that
a full scale of rations for Indian troops could
not be maintained until the road was opened.
Major Ringrose was confident that sufficient
fresh meat and vegetables could be obtained
locally, and would be supplied by the patriots
to ensure that this battalion had enough to
eat. There was no organised mule transport
but patriot volunteers were plentiful, though,
in the event, proved themselves extremely
unreliable.

Course of the Operation,

3/14 Punjab Regiment arrived at Bosa on
z3th July. On 14th July a reconnaissance in
strength was made. The enemy had been
fully: informed of these operations anil
launched an immediate counter-attack against
the leading companies of 3/14 Punjab Regi-
ment, The gunner O.P. was over-run within
I5 minutes of being established. A cloud,
descended, making observation difficult.
Patriot forces had become mixed with the
enemy native troops, and it was impossible to
distinguish friend from foe. There were un-
doubted cases of treachery. Patriots supposed
to be friendly were seen firing on our officers
and men, Commander 3/14 Punjab Regi-
ment was killed. Surprise was lost, and, there
‘being no further chance of renewing the opera-
tion, 3/14 Punjab withdrew.

In these operations time again was the
limiting factor, not only on account of supply-
ing 3/14 Punjab Regiment but also because
