309. From the brief description of the Ls. of
C. it is plain that the main problem through-
out the period of this Despatch was the main-
tenance of Fourteenth Army. The difficulty
of this problem was not only qualitative but
quantitative. Requirements of course varied
with the number of formations and nature of
operations ; but, as an example, during April,
1945, the daily maintenance tonnage required
by Fourteenth Army, including R.A.F. and
Civil Affairs (Burma) requirements, averaged
2,090 tons (long) per day, while the equivalent
requirement by 15 Indian Corps was 84 tons
per day. (The size of 15 Indian Corps at this
period had been reduced to allow the maximum
tonnage for Fourteenth Army.) Of these
amounts, the quantities delivered by air
averaged, for Fourteenth Anmy 1,845 tons, and
for 15 Indian Corps 16 tons.

310. To sum up, we were entering Burma
by the back door, with wholly inadequate land
communications. We were fighting an enemy
who had a first rate port behind him and good
rail and road communications, since he was
operating with his supply system on the same
lines that Burma’s internal supplies were car-
Tied in normal times. We were enabled to con-
quer him as a result of the tremendous effort
that was put into overcoming the administra-
tive difficulties and in particular by supple-
menting the inadequate land Ls. of C. with an
air L. of C., developed to an unprecedented
extent. The details of this conquest of the
administrative problem set by the natural and
geographical peculiarities of the Theatre are
the main burden of this part of this Despatch.

311. I propose to deal with the development
of the land Ls. of C. first, as a proper under-
standing of the difficulties and limitations of
these Ls. of C. is essential to any real compre-
hension of the administrative aspect of the
compaign as a whole, including the air supply
aspect. I regard it as absolutely essential, too,
that it should be realised what a prodigious
effort had to be put into the land Ls. of C.,
as the spectacular results of air supply and
the successful capture of Rangoon, with the
consequent restoration of a more normal L. of
C. tend to obscure the extent and duration of
this effort.

812. The organization and development of
the Northern line will be described first. When
I took over command in November 1944, orders
had already been issued for the formation of
L. of C. Command, which actually took place
on the 15th-November. The two L. of C.
Areas 202 and 404, were transferred from the
command of Fourteenth Army to the new L.
of C. Command, the Commander of which,

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

Major-General G. W. Symes, was directly
responsible to me. Hitherto H.Q., Allied Land
Forces, South-East Asia (or H.Q., 11 Army
Group as it had been called before it became
an Allied Command) had been represented by
Advanced Echelon North at Manipur Road
and Advanced Echelon South at Comilla.
These Advanced Echelons were almost en-
tirely concerned with movements and with the
processing of stores, etc., along the complicated
L. of C. To ensure continuity and relieve
Commander, L. of C. Command of purely
movement problems these Advanced Echelons
were retained under the new organization.
Fourteenth Army was thus relieved of L. of C.
responsibilities and could concentrate on the
main offensive. The boundary between
Fourteenth Army and 15 Indian Corps and
L. of C. Command very nearly coincided with
the political boundary between India and
Burma with a deviation south-east of Chitta-
ong. The whole of L. of C. Command
lay in India, 202 Area consisting of most of
Assam, including Manipur State, while 404
Area consisted of that part of Bengal lying
east of the Meghna River, and a part of
Assam lying to the south of Shillong.

313. The system of maintenance at this time
on this L. of C. was that supplies were sent
forward from the India Base by rail and Inland
Water Transport to the Advanced Bases at
Gauhati on the Brahmaputra, and at Manipur
Road (Dimapur) in Assam. It can be seen
that this was not a simple, straight run-
through. In India Command there was the
transhipment at the Ganges Ferry at Mokameh
Ghat and, for stores coming by rail from Cal-
cutta, the change from broad to metre gauge
railway at Parbatipur. Further tranship-~
ments were necessary at the Brahmaputra
ferries at Dhubri Ghat, Amingaon or Tez-
pur or at the I.W.T. transhipment points
at Pandu or Neamati. The distribution from
the Advanced Bases was affected by motor
transport (L. of C. Transport Column) to
Tiddim, and thence via Tamu to the Corps
Maintenance Areas.

314. The Assam Railway system worked
well on the whole, any occasional shortfall
on stores tonnage being quickly rectified by
increased despatches later. -Where target
figures were not reached, it was usually due
to a temporary shortage of wagons or to the
lack of stores ‘ready to load. Only one serious
accident ocourred during the period of this
Despatch, when a buckled rail caused a derail-
ment and the foss of 18 wagons by fire.
Throughout the period there were extensions
and improvements made to the transhipment,
marshalling, reception and departure yards.
Engine shed accommodation and yard layouts
were improved and the ferry and personnel
ghat lines developed.

315. When control of the L. of C. was taken
over from Fourteenth Army by H.OQ., Allied
Land Forces, South-East Asia in November
through L. of C. Command, the responsibility
for and control of the movement of replacement
vehicles forward of Calcutta also passed from
#.Q., Fourteenth Army to my H.Q. This not
only freed Fourteenth Army from ali responsi-
bility in rear of the Army boundary, but,
through the closer control which my H.Q.
could exercise, being on the spot, it resulted
