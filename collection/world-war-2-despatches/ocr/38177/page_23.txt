it into practice. I informed the Minister of
State and the Chief of the Imperial General
Staff accordingly.*

Before I was aware of the decision to relieve
me of my command I had arranged with the
Chief of the Imperial General Staff -that
Lieutenant-General B. L. Montgomery should
come out from England to take over the Eighth
Army as its permanent commander, as it was
obviously impossible for me to continue indefi-
nitely in the dual role of Commander-in-Chief
and Army Commander. General Montgomery
arrived. before I handed over to General
Alexander and I explained the situation to him
and my plans for the future.

In accordance with the Prime Minister’s in-
structions, I handed over my command to
General Alexander on the 15th August.

I wish to take this opportunity of recording
my gratitude and appreciation of the unfailing
help and ready co-operation I received through-
out my tenure of command of the Middle East
Forces from my colleagues in chief command,
Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham, Admiral Sir
Henry Pridham Whippell and Admiral Sir
Henry Harwood, who successively held the post
of Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean; and
Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder with whom
I worked in the closest possible accord through-
out the whole period.

I am deeply indebted also to the Ministers of
State who by their assumption of great political
and economic responsibilities made it possible
for me to devote much more attention to
strategical matters than I could otherwise have
done. These were successively Captain Oliver
Lyttelton, Sir Walter Monckton and Mr.
Richard Casey.

My Army Commanders and I owe much to

the consistent support and wise counsel of Sir
Harold MacMichael, High Commissioner for

Palestine and Trans-Jordan, Sir Kinahan
Cornwallis, His Majesty’s Ambassador in
Baghdad, and Sir Reader Bullard, His

Majesty’s Minister in Teheran. I wish to ac-
knowledge also the great help and encourage-
ment I received from the visits of Field Marshal

. Smuts to my command, His profound know-

ledge of the world in general and of war in
particular made his comments and advice on
matters of higher strategy of great value.

In my first Despatch, I alluded to the great
help I had received from the Egyptian Govern-

* ment and the Egyptian Army. This support’

was continued in full measure throughout the
period under review and was greatly enhanced
by the calm and generally courageous be-
haviour of the civil population of the country
during the prolonged struggle at El Alamein,
when the enemy was at their gates. The
absence of panic and disorder made the task of
those charged with organising the ultimate de-
fence of the Delta immeasurably lighter than
it might otherwise have beer. To His Excel-
Jency Nahas Pasha, Prime Minister of Egypt,
and to his predecessor, His Excellency Hussain
Sirry Pasha, I gratefully acknowledge my
indebtedness. :

PART II.

THE CAMPAIGNS IN CYRENAICA AND
THE WESTERN DESERT.
THE INVASION OF CYRENAICA.

On the 2nd September, 1941, after consult-
ing the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean,
and the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, I
told Lieutenant-General Sir Alan Cunningham,
commander designate of the Eighth Army, in
a personal letter that I intended to drive the
enemy out of North Africa.*

The offensive was to be carried out in two
phases, the first being the capture of Cyrenaica
and the second the capture of Tripolitania.
The immediate object was to destroy the
enemy’s armoured forces.

At that time two courses seemed possible.
We might base our main striking force on
Giarabub and advance through Gialo to cut the
enemy’s line of supply from Tripoli, leaving
sufficient forces to contain him in front and
prevent his trying to turn the tables on us by
advancing on Alexandria, in the hope that he
would then be caught between two fires and
forced to fight at a disadvantage. Or we might
make a direct attack towards Tobruk with our
main force, while feinting from the centre and
south to distract the enemy’s attention and
cause him to disperse his strength. I in-
structed General. Cunningham to prepare
detailed plans for both courses by the 1st
October.

The plan must be flexible, since the enemy
might modify his dispositions when he saw
our preparations or received information about
the growing strength of our forces in the
Desert. For this reason and to deceive the
enemy as to the direction of our main blow,
the original deployment must be on a wide
front and our depots of supplies in the forward
area disposed to allow of this.

The forces available for the offensive were
two corps headquarters, one armoured division,
an armoured brigade group, four infantry
divisions, two infantry brigades and an ammy
tank brigade. There was also the Tobruk
garrison consisting of four infantry brigade

ips, a mixed armoured force of about a
hundred tanks, and a considerable amount of
artillery—anti-aircraft, field and medium.

The campaign would require the closest
possible co-operation between the three ser-
vices. The land and air forces would depend
on the Royal Navy not only for direct support,
but to a large extent-for maintenance. Arrange-
ments would be made to Jand a brigade group
behind the enemy lines, if General Cunning-
ham so wished, but the success or failure of
the general plan was not to depend on whether -
this operation was feasible or not. «

Maintenance and mobility would be vital
factors, and I directed that formations must
be made fully mobile and trained to operate on
a strictly limited allowance of baggage, food
and water. ©

I estimated that the forces could be trained
and concentrated, and the maintenance
arrangements completed by the beginning of
November. I asked General Cunningham to
make every effort to avoid having to postpone
the operation, and to begin building up for-
ward magazines of supplies and munitions as
