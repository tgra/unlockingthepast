SUPPLEMENT to THz LONDON

16. A battleship was sighted to the northward
at 1058. Half a minute later she opened an
accurate fire from about 32,000 yards and no
time was lost in altering to the southward,
increasing to full speed and making smoke.
ORION was the target for the first ten minutes
and the first salvos fell over. ORION was
straddled and suffered minor damage from a
near miss.

17. When the smoke began to take effect,
GLOUCESTER, being to windward, was the
only ship in view orths enemy battleship and
she became the target. She was repeatedly
straddled. The destroyers could hardly keep
up at the speed of about 31 knots which the
cruiser was maintaining. Only one destroyer,
HASTY, succeeded eventually in reaching a
position from which her smoke was of any
benefit to GLOUCESTER.

18. At 1127 our own aircraft attacked the
enemy with torpedoes and she tumed away
and ceased fire, though owing to the smoke,
I did not know this until GLOUCESTER’S
signal reporting this fact got through the smoke
at 1138.

1g. Information for the enemy’s movements
during this 28-minute action is very scanty, as
the battleship was only occasionally sighted
from GLOUCESTER and PERTH. She
appears to have steered a course approximately
160 degs. at 31 knots or more. Nothing could
be seen to the north-and west on account of
smoke and I felt sure that the enemy cruisers
which I had beer following would now be
closing my force from the north-west.

20. When certain that the enemy had ceased
fire, I ordered ships to stop making smoke.
This took some time to clear, and when the
horizon could be seen (at 1148) there was
nothing in sight. The enemy cruisers evidently
proceeded to join the battleship. :

21. Course was now steered to make contact
with our own battlefleet. When touch was
gained at 1230, it was found that my position,
which had been confirmed within one mile by
a fix at noon, was ro miles 342 degs. from that
which the battlefleet had been using.

Puase II (1230-1800).

22. ILEX, HASTY and HEREWARD were
detached to join the battlefleet, and the cruisers
drew ahead on a bearing of 290 degs. from the
battlefieet to maximum V/S distance, as
ordered in your 1305.

23. At 1651 I received your 1644 ordering
me to press on and gain touch with the
damaged enemy battleship. Speed was
increased to 30 knots.

Puase III (1800/28-0700/29).

24. I decided to spread the cruisers by 2000
in order to locate the damaged enemy battle-
ship. Orders to start spreading were given at
1907, but when, seven minutes later, three or
four ships were sighted ahead against the after-
glow, these wére taken to be enemy cruisers
dropping back to drive off shadowers and I
concentrated my squadron to deal with them.

25. At 1935 and 1945 the enemy’s retalia-
tion to the dusk torpedo attack by our own
aircraft could be distinctly seen from my
squadron some 12 miles away. The sky was
filled with streams of tracer ammunition of
various colours and they must have been: very

gallant men who went through it to get their
torpedoes home.

26. As it was evident that a large number of
ships was in close company I decided to close
concentrate. Speed was kept down to reduce
bow waves.

27. At 2015 ORION obtained a deflection by
of a vessel six miles ahead. At the same
time GLOUCESTER saw a dark object low in
the water on the port bow about a mile away.
This was not seen from ORION and was not
reported by GLOUCESTER at the time. Speed
was reduced to 15 knots, and over a period of
eighteen minutes, Radar ranges were plotted,
proving that the vessel was stopped or moving
very slowly. She was thought to be a large
vessel, bigger than any cruiser, and without
other vessels in the vicinity unless they were
alongside her. AJAX reported the same object
by W/T.

28. By 2033 ORION was within three and a
half miles of this vessel, which I thought at the
time to be the damaged battleship because of
her size. She still could not be seen.

2g. At this juncture I decided to lead the
squadron clear to the northward and then
continue in search of the remaining ships. If
this ship was the battleship she was “ fixed,’’
and, if not, it was necessary to regain touch.

30. The Commander-in-Chief, acting
presumably on AJAX’S report, ordered the
14th and 2nd Destroyer Flotillas to attack the
battleship, giving ‘ther position exactly as
reported by AJAX, but giving her speed as 13
knots on a course of 295 degs.

31. At 2040, I reported the same vessel as
stopped, and supposed that Captain (D), 14th
Destroyer Flotilla, would attack her in that
position.

32. I was considering spreading the cruisers
to find the remainder, when I realised that, if
Captain (D), x4th Destroyer Flotilla, went
further west on the assumption that the enemy
was moving at 13 knots, he would almost
certainly encounter our cruisers. Furthermore,
the enemy had been reported as having altered
course to 230 degs. during the dusk torpedo
attack’ and it seemed that he might now be
steering, if anything, to the northward of 295
degs., if, as I suspected, he was making for
Messina.

33. At 2155 AJAX reported deflection by
Radar of three vessels, five miles to the south-
ward of us. This would be rather farther west
than our flotillas were likely to have reached
at the time but I decided to keep concentrated
and steer more to the north so as to keep clear
of them, and later to alter course and increase
speed so as to intercept any part of the enemy
force that might have continued towards
Messina, on a course of about.300 degs.

34. I kept on to the north-west so as not to
be silhouetted against the star shell that were
being used during the night action then in
progress astern.

35. During this time a red pyrotechnic signal
was sighted to the north-west at what seemed a
long range, though it was difficult to judge its
distance. I was about to spread when your
signal was received ordering all forces not
actually engaged to withdraw to the north-east.
