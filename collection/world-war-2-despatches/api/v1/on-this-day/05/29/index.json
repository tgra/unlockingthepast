In the meantime, following the engagement with the enemy at Habbaniya on 6th May, there was little land fighting until roth May, when our troops, in company with the mechanised force from . Palestine, occupied Fallujah after nearly a whole day's fighting. During this operation an air-borne detachment was landed in rear of the enemy position. Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force operating from Habbaniya, had been busily engaged attacking Iraqi aerodromes and other military objectives, with such success that by 8th May the Iraqi Air Forces had been practically eliminated. On 12th May, German aircraft were first reported in Iraq, and after that date encounters took place almost daily between our aircraft and German M.E.110 s, casualties being sustained by both sides. On 29th May, Italian aircraft were also in action neat Baghdad,"

General Ritchie was concerned for the safety of Tobruk and the forward bases and ordered the 7th Support Group to occupy the ridge south of Sidi Rezegh, until the 21st Indian Infantry Brigade should arrive. Next day the 4th Armoured Brigade put an end to this threat by driving the goth Light Division well away to the south, and on the 29th May the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade came up from Bir el Gubi to take over the El Adem locality permanently."

Throughout the 29th May the enemy had been attempting to cross the canal between the French-Belgian frontier and Nieuport. At the latter place, where the bridge had not been blown, they established a bridgehead in the town. Everywhere else they were driven back. Some attempted to cross in rubber boats ; others were disguised as civilians, even as nuns, and attempted to cross with the refugees, horses and cattle. On this day enemy forces advancing near the coast were shelled by H.M. ships."
