SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 1048

an enemy attack through Anatolia only. It is
considered that, although an attack through
Persia from the Caucasus is at least equally
probable, it could not be staged so early as
the attack through Anatolia. The steps neces-
sary to meet such an attack will, therefore, be
dealt with in a subsequent Instruction.

1. Object._The object is to ensure the se-
curity of our bases and ports in Egypt, Iraq
and Persia and of our oil supplies in South-
western Persia and the Persian Gulf

2. Forces Available—Forces likely to be
available in this Command during the next four
months, are given in Appendix ‘‘ A’’.

3. The following forces are the minimum
required to provide for the security of the
Western Frontier of Egypt and Cyprus in exist-
ing circumstances:—
(a) Western Frontier of Egypt—
One armoured division.
(One armoured brigade group.)
(One motor brigade group.)
One armoured brigade group.
One army tank brigade.
Three infantry divisions.
Two infantry brigade groups.
(b) Cyprus—
One armoured regiment.
One armoured car regiment.
Three infantry brigade
One infantry battalion (general reserve).
Five infantry battalions (static).

4. The forces at present available for Ninth
and Tenth Armies and G.H.Q. Reserve are too
weak to prevent an attack through Anatolia,
on the maximum scale the enemy can develop,
from penetrating Northern Iraq and Syria.
These forces are given at Appendix ‘' B ’’.

5. Intention.—Should this attack take place,
I intend from the start to impose the greatest
possible delay on the enemy’s advance, so as
to gain time for reinforcements to arrive.

The enemy will not in any event be allowed
to establish himself south of the general line
Little Zab River—Ana—Amman—Jericho—
Nablus—Haifa,

6. Method.—It is essential that, while in-
flicting the maximum loss and delay on the
enemy, our own forces should not be depleted
to such an extent that on reaching this line
they cannot hold it. The defences on this line
will therefore be completed as soon as possible
for occupation by the forces given in Appendix
Be. ,

7. Delay will be imposed upon the enemy:—

(a) By supporting Turkey if she resists,
provided the necessary air and land forces
are available.

(b) By protecting, for as long as possible,
the northern aerodromes so as to allow our
air forces to carry out the heaviest possible
attacks against the enemy’s lines of advance
through Anatolia. :

(c) By thorough demolitions, as laid down
in Operation Instruction No. 115 and a Joint
Directive by the Commanders-in-Chief to be
issued shortly, and by early evacuation of

such war materials as would be of value to -

the enemy if they fell into his hands.

387.

(d) By holding positions, in country un-
suited to armoured fighting vehicles, astride
his main lines of advance.

(e) By counter-attacking whenever a suit-
able opportunity offers. "

8. The process of delaying the enemy will
start as far forward as possible, depending on
the land and air forces available and the atti-
tude of the Turks. The plans made by Armies
for initial concentrations will provide for any
of the following opening moves, and the open-
ing move will be selected and ordered by the
Commanders-in-Chief, according to the condi-
tions prevailing at the time.

Case A.
Hy pothesis,

Turkey resists German aggression. Ade-
quate Army and R.A.F. resources exist for
operations in Northern Anatolia, in co-
operation with the Turks,

Opening Move—

(i) Air striking force, with an Army com-
ponent from Ninth Army will move into
Turkey under separate instructions from
G.H.Q., MEF. and H.Q., R.A.F., ME.

(#) When maintenance facilities permit,
Ninth Army [less special force referred to in
para. (i)] and Tenth Army will advance into
. Turkey to general line El Azig (Kharpur)—
Malatya~-Taurus Mountains, with a view to
improving communications, preparing demo-
litions on main Turkish communications, and
subsequently covering withdrawal of special
force, if this becomes necessary.

Case B.
Hypothesis.
Turkey acquiesces in German aggression,
or collapses quickly. Probable attitude of
Turks, if we enter from the south, unknown.

Opening Move—

Ninth and Tenth armies enter Turkey and
seize and hold general line Diyarbekir—
Siverek —- Gaziantep (Aintab) — Bulanik
(Baghche)—-Payas, with the object of de-
molishing communications and delaying
enemy as far forward as possible.

Case C.

Hy pothesis—

(a) The Turks come in openly on the sid
of the Germans; or .

(b) The Turks have strengthened their
forces on the Syrian frontier with evident
intent to come in on the German side, and
entry of our forces into Turkey will obviously
be opposed.
Opening Move—

Ninth and Tenth Armies carry out demoli-
tions as far forward as possible, and delay
‘enemy’s advance.

9.—(a) The Boundary between Ninth and
Tenth Armies will be:—

(Ninth Army incl.) Malatya—excl..
Karacali Dagh (Karadja Dagh)—incl.
Hasseche (El Haseke)—Garat Motteb—

thence Syrian-Iraqi Frontier to Abu Kemal
—Qasr Muhaiwir—thence a line due south to
frontier of Saudi Arabia.
