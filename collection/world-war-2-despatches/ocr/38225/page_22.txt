The Approach of the Convoy and the Despatch
of Landmg Craft.

“15. The cofvoy approached Courrier and
Ampbararata (Bays from the West. The leading
assault ship, M.V. Winchester Castle anchored
outside the range of the coast defence guns in
case these were not silenced by dayhght. Assault
Landing Craft and Motor Landing Craft were
lowered from the Winchester Castle the Keren
and Kavanja, and Motor Landmg Craft from
the motor transport ships. The assault flotillas
left for Red, Green and White béaches at 0230,
0227 and 0319 hours respectively, being led
in for some of the way by corvettes and mine-
sweepers; and, in the case of Green and White
beaches where the low lying ground offered no
good landmarks in the moonhght, using Lorenz
beam apparatus.

The approach of the transports and the mine-
sweeping, escorting, and covering warships was
a difficult and dangerous operation. It was
subsequently discovered that, in the defence
appreciation, approach from this direction by
mght was discounted. There is no doubt that
the success of the whole operation and the com-
paratively low casualties sustained by.the Army,
were largely due to the acceptance of tais risk
by the Naval Commanders concerned, and by
the skill and seamanship displayed by the
Royal Navy and Merchant Navy in executing
this part of the plan.

The Landing at Courner Bay and the Action
of 5 Commando

16. 3 Commando with B Company and two
ecarners of 2 East Lancashire Regiment landed
at the Red beaches at 0435 hours unopposed.
Commando HQ and three troops, landing at
Red North beach, captured No. 7 Coast De-
fence battery, consisting of four modern 6.1 mm.
guns, at 0500 hours. The garrison was sur-
prised and offered no resistance. The remain-
ing two troops landed unopposed at ‘Red South
beach, but were unable to find the reported
No. 8 Battery, which in fact did noi exist.‘
The two Commando columns, less one troop
left at No. 7 Battery, then advanced inland;
meeting at the Col du Courrier at 0945 hours.
By 1130 hours the Commando, which now in-
cluded B Company 2 East Lancashire Regi-
ment commenced its advance over the Andra-
kaka Peninsula, and at 1430 hours it had
reached the village of Diego Suarez on the
Eastern-most end of the peninsula. They met
slight opposition on the initial advance but
rapidly dispersed it. Attempts were made with-
out success to find boats to cross to Antsirane.

In the Red beach area, a machine gan and
some snipers came to life at daylight. The
troop holding No. 7 Battery spent a large part
of the day stalking these enemy parties, but
in the difficult and precipitous country, they
continued to give trouble until D2, when they
were finally mopped up by B Company 2
Royal Scots Fusiliers which had taken ove
the Red beach area. .

The Main Landings—2gq Independent Brigade.

17. 1 Royal Scots Fusiliers at Green Beach
and 2 Royal Welsh Fusiliers at White beach
were landed punctually and accurately and
met no opposition, Green beach was found
unsuitable for vehicles and White difficult even
for tracked vehicles. Blue beach was now
approached from the rear by C Company 2

SUPPLEMENT 1o THs LONDON GAZETTE, 4 MARCH, 10948

Royal Welsh Fusiliers which had Janded at
White beach. Although an infantry post had
been reported on this beach, in the half light
it appeared to be unoccupied. A and C
Compames 2 East Lancashire Regiment were
therefore signalled in, using the landing craft
which had returned to the Royal Ulsterman
from the Red beaches. On the approach of
these landing craft, a machine gun post manned
by Senegalese opened fire but caused no
casualties, but when fired on from the rear and
from the Janding craft, withdrew and left the
beach unguarded. Thus by 0630 hours all
beaches were in our hands. Meanwhile at
o615 hours Brigadier Festing had issued the
order for the assault floating reserve, 2 South
Lancashire Regiment less B Company in un-
armoured landing craft, to land at White beach.

Air Action and the Diversion by H.M.S.
Hermaone.

18. At first light, about 0530 hours, aircraft
of the Fleet Air Arm bombed the enemy aero-
drome about six miles South of Antsirane, and
the shipping in the harbour. This was most
successful and appears to have deprived the
enemy of any means of air reconnaissance or
support, except for a few isolated machine gun
attacks by aircraft from the South, which were
promptly dealt with by the Fleet Air Arm,

At 0440 hours H.M.S. Hernnone opened fire
with star shells and made smoke in the vicinity
of Ambodivahibe Bay, the most probable land-
ing place on the East coast South-East of
Antsirane. At first light, Fleet Air Arm air-
craft dropped parachutes with dummies in the
inaccessible country about Mahagaga, which
was on the route from Ambodivahibe Bay.
It was subsequently learned that this diversion
combined with the lack of air reconnaissance,
caused the enemy to despatch troops to
Mahagaga some time before other troops were
despatched towards Ambararata. It did how-
ever awaken the French and it is difficult to
assess the real value of this diversion,

The Advance of 29 Independent Brigade.

1g. 2 Royal Welsh Fusiliers followed by 1
Royal Scots Fusiliers now commenced the ad-
vance to Antsirane, at first with marching in-
fantry and a few cyclists and motor cyclists
only. The carriers overtook the leading ele-
ments of the 2 Royal Welsh Fusiliers about
0730 hours at Mangoky, five miles East of the
beaches. They had not yet met the enemy
but about 0815 hours a French naval officer and
three ratings were captured a short distance
East of the Ansahapano River. In accordance
with instructions, the officer was given a letter
demanding the surrender of the base, and sent
back to Antsirane in his own car.

About roo hours the leading carriers came
under fire from the high ground about one
mile East of Anamakia. The enemy were
holding a well-defined spur which commands
the flat area between it and the Anamakia
Woods and which the road crosses by a rocky
and tortuous col, known as the Col De Bonne
Nouvelle. By r1r5 hours there were in the
Anamakia area, about 15 miles from the
beaches, two companies 2 Royal Welsh
Fusiliers, two 3.7 howitzers of 455 Light
Battery, as well as carriers and motor cycles.
The Brigadier, who had also reached
Anamakia, ordered the infantry to attack sup-
ported by the guns. While they were de-
ploying, two Valentines and one Tetrarch, the
