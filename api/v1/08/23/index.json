This proposal was accepted at a further conference of Commanders-in-Chief on 1st August; we agreed that \u00a9 a lodgement im Calabria was necessary but. hoped to be able to achieve it without using ro Corps at all. In any case our strategy was flexible enough to allow us to switch 10 Corps to either objective and this was laid down in a directive issued after another Carthage cont ference on gth August.

By the 4th September an outline plan had been prepared which showed that the operation ;could \u2018be undertaken, subject to certain modificahons, with the forces needed for the assault on Akyab."
