SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON

145. It would be idle to close this report with-
out reference to the assistance given by the
Union of South Africa, without which the cam-
paign could not have been undertaken.

Apart from the fighting troops, I was in-
debted to the Union tee much wie mechanical
transport which made the supply of troops over
such great distances in front of the railheads
and ports possible, and to them also I owed
the provision of a large number of special
technical units without which operations in the
type of terrain covered could not have taken
place. It was with remarkable forethought
that these units had been formed before the war
and furnished with the most modern equip-
ment. F

Through the personal interest of Field
Marshal Smuts I was at the start able to knit
the Force into a whole, and all the many re-
sources which the Union placed at my disposal
were pooled for the common good of the whole
force. I knew that no appeal to them would
go unanswered if it was humanly possible to
meet it. The spirit of co-operation extended
tight down to the lowest ranks, giving me the
greatest confidence in the South African ‘troops,
a confidence which was fully justified by the
achievements of the South African Division and
all other South African troops during the
campaign. ‘

SECOND REPORT ON EAST AFRICA
FORCE OPERATIONS COVERING THE
PERIOD FROM OCCUPATION OF ADDIS
ABEBA ON 6TH APRIL, 1941, TO THE
CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES IN THE
AREA FOR WHICH EAST AFRICA
FORCE WAS RESPONSIBLE. ON 11TH

Parr I.—Intropucrion.

My previous report dealt with the operations
carried out by E.A. Force up to the entry of
the troops into Addis Abeba on 6th April, rg4r.

After this date my immediate responsibilities
were both operational and political. It was
most desirable to deal the enemy a knock-out
blow as soon as possible, but at the same time
it was imperative to release as many units and

‘as much transport as possible for Egypt. On
the political side it was necessary to place the
administration of Ethiopia on a firm base, to
re-establish the Emperor, and to lay the founda-
tions of an Ethiopian administration so that
full use of Ethiopian military resources could
be made after the shortest time, with the even-
tual object of releasing more of my troops. The
pacification of the occupied territories and par-
ticularly of the eastern border of British Somali-
land where there had been considerable looting
of cattle and rape was also imperative.

2. After the fall of Addis Abeba, Asmara
and Massawa, the enemy withdrew into three
centres or “‘ ridotti’’ and into the province of
Galla-Sidamo. The centres were Dessie, Amba
Alagi and Gondar, whereas in the Galla-Sidamo
his main forces of approximately 40,000 in-

fantry and militia with about 200 guns, ice

in three groups covering an area of about 400
by 300 miles, one group in the Uaddara-Alghe-

area and one in the Lechemti area. The Civil
Government had gone to Gimma, but the
Viceroy himself went to Dessie.

3. The situation of my own troops was as
follows: (H.Q.) rst S.A. Division and sth S.A.
Infantry Brigade were in process of being trans-
ported to Egypt. and S.A. Infantry Bade
had also been offered to Middle East and were
at or near Berbera waiting for ships to take
them north.

tith (A) Division, consisting of 1st S.A.
Brigade, 2zand E.A. Brigade (less one battalion
on the L. of C.) and 23rd Nigerian Brigade,
were at Adama and Addis Abeba.

r2th (A) Division were attacking northwards
from Iavello with 21st E.A. Brigade. One
Battalion 24th G.C. Brigade was garrisoning
Neghelli and the remainder of the Brigade were
employed in restoring order in southern. Italian
Somaliland. 25th E.A. Brigade, also under this.
division, was advancing towards Maji. .

4. After the fall of Addis Abeba I felt my
best chance of a speedy liquidation of the
enemy in the south was to advance on Gimma,.
the seat of Government for Iea, and I com-
menced operations to this end. Before these
had developed I received a message from the
C.-in-C. to the effect that it was essential that
the road from Addis Abeba north to Asmara
should be opened as soon as possible so as to.
allow passage of troops to Egypt via Massawa.
or Port Sudan, and he wished me to attack
Dessie which was 250 miles north of Addis
Abeba. I therefore instructed Commander r1ths
(A) Division to undertake this task with
Ist S.A. Brigade Group with the idea that they
should fight their way northwards and even--
tually embark from Massawa or Port Sudan
for Egypt. This Brigade Group commenced:
their advance from Addis Abeba on 13th April.
I informed C.-in-C. Middle East that I felt I
could not-clear the road northwards of Dessie
with my own resources, and asked that the
Sudan forces should attack Amba Alagi which:
wad the only important remaining defended.
position on the road. In due course I received
notification that the Sudan Forces would carry
out this attack but not until 3rd May.

5. It was now apparent to me that I had not
enough troops to carry out my first intention
of both advancing on Gimma and, by pressure
from both divisions advancing north and south,
clearing the enemy out of the area of the Great
Lakes south of Addis Abeba. I considered that
of the two objectives, if only one were to be
carried out, the latter was the more important.
The troops at Sciasciamanna were a constant
threat to my L. of C. at Moggio and Adama,
and it would be a great advantage to me also
to have a through road via Neghelli from
Kenya. I therefore ordered 11th (A) Division
to concentrate on attacking Sciasciamanna, and
rath (A) Division to advance on Dalle and
Hula. For this latter purpose I relieved the
Commander and two battalions of 24th G.C.
Brigade, who- were restoring order in Italian
Somaliland, by garrison battalions, and on 16th
April sent them to 12th (A) Division.

The account of the action of 1st S.A. Brigade
on Dessie and the operations of 11th and x2th
(A) Divisions are given in paras. 54 to 62.
