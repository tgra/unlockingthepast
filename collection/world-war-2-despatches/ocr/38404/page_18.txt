5032 SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 16 SEPTEMBER, 1948

Far East. .With them went No. 232 Squadron, ,
which had returned to the Command in
July after being absent for training in Combined ,
Operations earlier in the year.

‘x95. The outcome was that the Command

reached the end of 1941 with a strength of 100

squadrons—comprising 23 night defensive

squadrons, two ‘‘ Intruder ’’ Squadrons, and

75 day squadrons—in addition to ten “‘ Turbin-

lite’? Flights (as they were called), whose

function was to carry airborne searchlights. In

the event these ‘‘ Turbinlite ’’ Flights, despite ,
the skill and enthusiasm of those concerned with ;
them, were to accomplish little, for by the time

they were used in substantial numbers the

enemy had virtually ceased to send over the

slower bombers with which they might have

coped successfully,

196. Thus by the end of the year, the Com-
mand had achieved approximately the strength
which I should have wished to have at my dis-
posal in the Spring and Summer. The
squadrons had, however, been drained of most
of their more seasoned members, and the gene-
tal level of experience was not so high as I
could have wished. But since the size of the
opposing force left in the West after the open-
ing of the German campaign against Russia in
June was only about a third of that which had
opposed us in 1940, there is no doubt that at
this stage the country was adequately defended.

197. On the other hand, the enemy was work-
ing on internal lines of communication and could
have moved back units from Poland or the
Mediterranean more quickly than we could have
brought squadrons from overseas. It would be
a mistake, therefore, to conclude that we were
needlessly strong.

198. From August to December two Hurri-
cane Squadrons were detached for service on the
North Russian Front in No. 151 Wing under
the command of Wing Commander H. N. G.
Ramsbottom-Isherwood, A.F.C.

(d) Expansion of Group and Sector System

199. During the period covered by this
account a considerable expansion of the Group
and Sectur system took place, mainly in accord-
ance with plans laid before the period began.

200. The need for new Fighter Groups on the
flanks of Nos. 11 and 13 Groups had become
apparent at an early stage of the War. Indeed,
a Group in the West of England was visualised
in the Command’s tentative plans even before
war broke out. Accordingly, Nos. ro and 14
Groups had been formed during the Battle of
Britain. Thus by the beginning of November,
1940, there were five Groups and 23 Sectors in
existence, as against the three Groups and
eighteen Sectors required by the approved pre-
war programme.

201. Furthermore, on the fall of France it had
become necessary to plan a further extension of
the air defence system up the West Coast.
Clearly another Group would be needed to take ©
charge of the Sectors which were to be formed
in Wales and the West Midlands. Accordingly,
No. 9 Group began to form at Preston early in
August, 1940, and on 16th September its first
Air Officer Commanding, Air Vice-Marshal
W. A. McClaughry, D.S.0., MC., D.F.C.,
took up his appointment. :

202. At the beginning of November, 1940,
the development of this Group had not yet
reached the operational stage, mainly because
the necessary airfields and communications
were not yet ready. Consequently, such specific
fighter defence as 1t was possible to allot to the
area for which the Group would ultimately
become responsible was still being provided by
No. 12 Group.

203. In the middle of October special
measures had been set in train to bring No. 9
Group to the operational stage as rapidly as
possible. These efforts continued, with the
result that on Ist December the Group was able
to assume operational control of two of the four
Sectors (later increased to five) which were
allotted to it. By the middle of March, 1941,
No. 9 Group had assumed responsibility for all
its Sectors in daylight, although No. 12 Group,
with its better night-flying facilities, continued
to defend one Sector at night.

204. Before this a Sector, planned before the
War, had been established in Ulster, where one
fighter squadron was established in the Summer
of 1940. At the same time improved facilities
for operating fighters under the control of No. 13
Group were set up in South-Western Scotland.

205. These measures, of which some had been
executed and all had been planned when the
period under discussion opened, now bore
fruit, and the twin problem of providing
adequate defences in the West and protecting
shipping between the Rhinns of Islay and the
Bristol Channel was much eased in consequence.

206. In the Spring of 1941, there were six
operational fighter Groups and 29 Sectors in
existence. On the outbreak of war the flanks of
the air defence system had stood on the Firth
of Forth and Spithead, although there was an
outlying detachment at Filton for the defence
of Bristol, In a little over eighteen months the
system had been so expanded that the Command
was now able to operate short-range fighters,
under close control, over almost every part of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland and
adjacent waters, with the exception of North-
West Scotland.

207. Towards the end of 1940 the Com-
mand was asked to form two new Sectors in
this Jast area in order that shipping in the
Minches and objectives in the Western High-
lands and the Hebrides might be brought under
the shelter of the Fighter Command
“‘ambrella’’. Although this desire was
natural, its accomplishment was far from easy.
There were no airfields suitable for short-range
fighters on the mainland, and the nature of
the country made it impossible to construct
them. From a practical viewpoint there was
much to be said for placing the responsibility
for this distant area on Coastal Command,
whose long-range fighters- could operate in
safety from airfields in the Hebrides. How-
ever, the Air Ministry rejected this solution,
and eventually a compromise was adopted,
whereby short-range fighters to be provided by
Fighter Command would be supplemented vy
long-range fighters, which would be provided
by Coastal Command. The latter would
operate under Fighter Command when used
for controlled interception.

208. The arrangements necessary to put this
scheme into effect were not completed until’
