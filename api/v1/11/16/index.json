My Headquarters, however, assumed full control with effect from the Ist May, 1944, with the exception of some administrative matters which were more con- veniently handled by G.H.Q. India."

Although it was possible to move stores to Kusadasi, and the short journey to Samos presented no difficulty, the main problem was the onward distribution to Leros, since, after the fall of Cos, great difficulty was found in persuading the crews of the caiques to make the voyage to Leros. However, from 28th September to 16th November, a total of 3,000 tons was shipped to Samos and of 480 tons to Leros, including civilian foodstuffs."

The battle of Leros lasted five days, and from the beginning the Samos garrison was standing by to provide reinforce- ments should they be needed. On 12th November, Leros asked for the despatch of the Royal \u2018West Kents; preparations were put in hand to move the battalion that night, but in the absence of suitable shipping the men were returned to their battle stations. night, 13th-r4th, a suitable vessel was found and one company was sent to Portolago, where it arrived the following night; the remainder of the battalion arrived by destroyer on the night of the 15th-16th. The Greek Sacred Squadron, too, was ordered to move and was actually embarked, but since it was reported that Leros had fallen on the afternoon of 16th November, the squadron stood down."

There was an even more pressing reason for capturing the coastal group of landing grounds. No convoys had sailed to Malta since the previous April owing to the impossibility of providing air protection and the garrison and people of the island were now on the verge of starvation. The situation would be beyond control unless a convoy put- ting out from Alexandria on 16th November arrived safely and of that there was little hope without strong fighter protection from the coast of Cyrenaica. It might very well have proved impossible to supply any further advance, see- ing that 10 Corps had advanced two hundred and twenty miles in six days and that heavy demolitions had been carried out both on the road and the railway. But the adminis- trative arrangements stood the strain, stores were landed at Sollum and the harbours of Matruh and Bardia were opened within two days of their capture so \u2018fat enough supphes were available to allow y Light Armoured Brigade to continue. While the main body hastened down the road and secured Tmimi on 14th November another column moved across the desert via Bir"

            "description": "During the period of Eighth Army\u2019s attack on the Adriatic sector Fifth Army had been rest- ing and regrouping its troops in accordance with the orders of 16th November. \u2018The next operation was divided into three phases. The high ground dominating the Mignano Gap was to be captured in sections, first that to the south, and then that to the north; in Phase I, that is to say, Monte Camino, Monte La Difensa and Monte Maggiore were to be captured and in Phase II Monte Sammucro, combined with an attack westwards along the Colli\u2014Atina road; Phase III, the main advance into the Liri valley, was only to be initiated on Army orders after the completion of the first two phases. Of the three British and six United States divisions in Fifth Army at the beginning of the period, two, 7 Armoured and 82 Airborne, (less one Regimental Combat Team) were being withdrawn to the United Kingdom. 1 United States Armoured Division began arriving at Naples and x Special Service Force, six battalions of specially trained mixed American and Canadian troops, also came: under command.* 2 Moroccan Division was due to arrive in the first week of December. II Corps Headquarters arrived from Sicily in October and took over command of the centre of the line with 3 and 36 Divisions on 18th November; VI Corps now commanded on the extreme right with 34 and 45 Divisions. 1 Armoured Division remained in Army reserve; it was not expected that it would be used until the Liri valley was reached, when it would debouch through IT Corps. The Germans had also been reinforcing; 2g Panzer Grenadier Division came in from reserve and 44 Infantry Division, an Austrian formation, from Slovenia. 5 Mountain Division arrived from Russia in December."

            "description": "On the other hand, it involved the B.E.F. in a forward move of some sixty miles against time, while it also necessitated the holding by the French on our right of the Gembloux gap which contains no natural anti-tank obstacle. This plan was twice discussed by General Georges with me on 13th October at my headquarters at Le Cauroy and again on 16th November at Folembray the headquarters of the French First Group of Armies; on this occasion there were also present General Billotte, who commanded the Army Group, and Generals Blanchard and Corap, Commanding the French 1st and 9th Armies, At this conference it was agreed that the frontage of the B.E.F. on the Dyle position was to be from Wavre to Louvain, both places inclusive, and a formal instruction to this effect was issued to me by General Georges on the following day. From this time onward, Com- manders and Staffs were studying simultaneously two alternative plans for advances to the Dyle or the Escaut; these became known as plans D and EL"

            "description": "5. In mid-November, a reorganization of the chain of command took place, which had been planned by General Giffard with the object of freeing the Commander, Fourteenth Army, from the control of opera- tions in Arakan, and from the responsibility of administering the long and difficult lines of communication in Assam. In this way he would be enabled to concentrate his full atten- tion on the coming offensive across the Chindwin River into Central Burma. Accord- ingly on the 15th November, Lines of Com- munication Command was formed under Major-General G. W. Symes, with its H.Q. at Comilla. It comprised 202 L. of C. Area (H.Q., Gauhati), consisting of four sub-areas and the Fort Hertz Area, and 404 L. of C. Area of four sub-areas; it included a very great number of Base and L. of C. units. The policy was to be that the rear boundaries of Fourteenth Army and 15 Corps would be adjusted as the progress of operations allowed, in order to free them from rearward responsi- bilities. On the 16th November, 15 Corps was separated from Fourteenth Army and came direct under my command. I thus had under my command three major formations im con- tact with the enemy, 15 Corps, Fourteenth Army and Northern Combat Area Command, with the L. of C. Command in the rear up"
