sight, and a second destroyer was not seen until
the sights were past. All torpedoes were heard
to hit ana the destroyer vanished. As the enemy
gun-fire was getting hot and they had the advan-
tage of the light I increased speed and cleared
out.

6. Just before entering the harbour two
columns of water were seen ascending just in-
shore of the HUNTER, and it is thought that
they were caused by badly aimed torpedoes from
an enemy destroyer.

7. While leaving the harbour | passed close
to NORTH CORNWALL, and one of the
guards there fired on the bridge with a revolver.
He was silenced by a Lewis gun.

8. Firing now increased from the harbour
and HAVOCK was straddled but not hit. Fire
was returned by the after group and an ex-
plosion seen in an enemy ship, while the fore-
most group bombarded the shore with H.E.
shell, from which quarter a hot fire from rifles
and machine guns was arriving.

g. Once clear of the harbour HAVOCK
passed backwards and forwards across the en-
trance engaging ships inside with gunfire at
3,000 to 4,000 yards. Spotting was almost im-
possible owing to smoke but blind ladders were
used and success hoped for.

Io. At 0507 a number of torpedoes were seen
approaching from the harbour and were avoided
by going full speed ahead or astern. One tor-
pedo appeared to pass underneath the ship, and
if it was fitted with a magnetic pistol the de-
gaussing circuit undoubtedly saved the ship. I
then withdrew out of torpedo range and as ships
were interfering with each others fire formed
astern of Captain D. who made a_ signal
** Follow Round ”’ at 0514. By this time we
were 6,000 yards from the harbour.

11. At 0535 we passed the harbour for a
second time but were not fired at and then
HARDY led towards Rombaks Fjord.

12. At 0540 three German destroyers were
sighted bearing 350 degrees apparently coming
from Herjangs Fjord. Captain D. ordered 30
knots and withdraw to the westwards at
the same time opening fire on the second ship.
I turned to follow him and engaged the leading
ship at 10,000 yards. HARDY made an enemy
report of a cruiser and two destroyers and in
the bad light this looked possible. The enemy
however appeared to turn away under our fire.

13. At 0558 two more enemy destroyers
appeared ahead and opened fire. HAVOCK
was slightly to port of HARDY and I engaged
the left hand ship but as soon as I saw that
the leader was not fired at shifted to her. The
range was about 3,000 yards, and fire soon took
effect, the third salvo hitting aft and caused a
violent explosion. She ceased fire with her main
armament but continued to fire machine guns,
an incendiary bullet from which set fire to a
ready-use cordite locker at A gun.

14. As we passed her I ordered the remaining
torpedees to be fired but they unfortunately
passed astern due to an underestimation of the
enemy speed.

15. Just before HAVOCK fired! torpedoes
enemy torpedoes were seen approaching on the
surface and easily avoided by combing the
tracks. HARDY however who was steering
more to port appeared to be hit by one as

SUPPLEMENT 10 THE LONDON GAZETTE, 3 JULY, 10947

there was a high column of smoke from her
after boiler room and much flame from the
funnel. Actually from accounts afterwards this
was a salvo of shell, and she rapidly lost way
and passed astern.

16. As I was now at the head of the line
and no enemy appeared to be to the westward
of us, I turned to starboard 180 degrees and
closed the enemy astern, opening fire at 10,000
yards, 2

17. During 'this run I passed HUNTER who
was on fire and losing speed and HOTSPUR
whose steering gear seemed to be out of action.

18. Unfortunately the order to open fire
could not be complied with as both foremost
guns were out of action, and having no tor-
pedoes I decided that it would be folly to close
the range any further, and turned to starboard
passing close astern of HOSTILE who was
making smoke.

1g. At this moment the two leading enemy
appeared to be unhit and were firing well
placed salvos, while two in rear were very
ragged. HAVOCK was again straddled but
not hit except by splinters. -While withdrawing
the after group continued the engagement, until
the enemy was lost in smoke.

20. While .running to the west HOTSPUR
was observed to collide with HUNTER who
appeared to be in a bad way, but the former
got clear.

2x. Once clear of the smoke I drew up along-
side HOSTILE and both foremost guns being
reported again in use, followed her back into
the action to relieve the pressure on HOTSPUR.
Fire was opened at 10,000 yards and continued
until HOTSPUR was out of range when all
ships withdrew. The leading enemy appeared
to be still untouched and were straddling effec-
tively while we were turning. They made no
attempt however to close the range, after we
had slowed to HOTSPUR’S speed.

22. On the way down the fjord a merchant
ship was sighted which proved to be the
German S.S. RAUENFELS, and HOSTILE
stopped her with a shot and ordered me to
examine her. I fired another round into her
bow and she stopped and her crew hurriedly
abandoned ship. I stopped and picked them
up while the ship slowly drifted to the beach.
T sent an armed boat over but she was burn-
ing furiously and I was uncertain as to whether
she had used her W/T to call her friends, I
decided not to risk the loss of my party and
ordered their return. When the boat was
hoisted I fired two H.E. into her to hasten
the fire and went ahead. The result was cer-
tainly startling, as the German literally erupted
and a column of flame and debris rose to over
3,000 feet as testified both by HOSTILE and
HARDY’S survivors to the west who saw it
over the mountains that height. Fortunately
no casualties were sustained in HAVOCK but
some damage to the hull was done. Judging
from the fragments picked up she contained
all the reserve ammunition and torpedoes for
the destroyer flotilla, and also the Narvik mine-
field.

23. HAVOCK then joined HOSTILE off
Tranoy Light.

24. From the evidence of the crew of the
NORTH CORNWALL there were four
destroyers in Narvik harbour when the attack
