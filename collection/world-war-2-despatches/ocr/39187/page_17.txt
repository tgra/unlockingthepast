SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 1951

Arrangements for Internal Security in re-
occupied Burma.

134. As we advanced into Burma, we had to
‘find troops for internal security in re-occupied
territory, until such time as the police force
could be re-created.

I had of course no intention of detaching
battalions from infantry divisions on such duty.
The most suitable type of unit was one com-
posed of officers and men who had had ex-
perience in the Burma Frontier Force or
Burma Military Police. [, therefore, arranged
with the Commander-in-Chief, India, for 2 and
4 Burma Regiments to be trained for'this duty
and earmarked for Fourteenth Army. I said
that I should probably need more battalions.

I also asked the Commander-in-Chief, India,
to obtain the agreement of the Government of
Burma to disband the Northern Kachin Levies
and to re-form them into two Kachin battalions
for use later for internal security.

Re-organization of the Chain of Command.

135. I had come to the conclusion in August
that future operations would make continued
control of the Arakan operations by Head-
quarters, Fourteenth Army, impossible. I there-
fore ordered that a re-organization of command
should be examined on the following basis :—

(a) That the command of 15 Indian Corps
should pass from Headquarters, Fourteenth
Army, to H.Q., 11 Army Group.

(6) That H.Q., Fourteenth Army, should
be reconstituted as a mobile Field Army
H.Q., for the command of two Corps, and
be relieved of the responsibility for the lines
of communication.

I was also examining the formation of a new
headquarters to be known as H.Q., L. of C.
Command, to be located at Comilla. I in-
tended that the Commander of the Lines of
Communication should command both the
existing Areas (202 and 404) of the L. of C.
and thus free the Commander, Fourteenth
Army, and Commander, 15 Indian Corps, from
the work which the control of the lines of
communication involved.

136. As a result of this examination, I gave
the following orders:— -
(@) H.Q., Fourteenth Army, to be re-
ganized.

o i

{b) H.Q., L. of C. Command, to be set
up, the commander of which would assume
control directly under H.Q., 11 Army Group,
of the existing 202 and 404 L. of C. Areas.

(c) Establishments of H.Q., Sub-Areas, to
be standardised to simplify the future adjust-
ment of boundaries of sub-areas.

(d) Two Advanced Echelons, 11 Army
Group, one of which already existed, to be
formed to assist H.Q., 11 Army Group to
control general administration on the L. of C.
The date selected for the transfer of 15 Indian

Corps to command of 11 Army Group and the
formation of H.Q., L. of C. Command, was the
15th November. H.Q., Fourteenth Army,
moved to Imphal at the same time.

137. In re-organizing Command and Admini-
stration I was looking ahead. I foresaw that
when the re-occupation of Burma was com-
plete, the commander of these Ls. of C. would
probably extend his command to include the
whole of Burma and that 202 and 404 Areas

(4487)

1727

would then be transferred to the command of
the Commander-in-Chief, India. The ‘flexi-
bility of the organization should admit of future
adjustments and extensions.

138. This examination of the organization of
the L. of C. confirmed my opinion that some
re-organization of the establishments of recep-
tion camps, reinforcement camps, feeding and
welfare arrangements generally on the L. of C.
was overdue.

It was not, however, possible to start this
re-organization for lack of men, as all British
personnel likely to be available were to be
absorbed in the formation of H.Q., L. of C.
Command, and the re-organization of Head-
quarters, L. of C. Areas and Sub Areas. I had,
therefore, to defer these measures until the
manpower situation had improved.

Changes affecting East African Forces.

139. (@) It was necessary to re-organize 11
(Hast African) Division to bring it as far as
possible into line with an Indian Standard
Division. -

(6) 22 and 28 (East African) Brigades, which
formed part of the garrison of Ceylon, were
on a different establishment from the brigades
of 11 (Bast African) Division. It was always
my intention to re-organize these two Brigades
so that they should be inter-changeable with
those of 11 Division. It has not, however, been
practicable to make this change.

I foresaw, however, that additional brigades
would be needed both in Fourteenth Army and
15 Indian Corps. I therefore arranged to
withdraw 22 and 28 (East African) Brigades
from Ceylon. This left Ceylon with three
locally enlisted battalions only.

Re-organization of Armoured Formations.

140. I mentioned in my first Despatch that
major changes in the organization of tank
brigades were necessary and that—

@) all regiments should be re-equipped
with medium tanks,

(6) a troop of flame-throwers should be
included in each squadron, an

(©) an infantry battalion should be in-
cluded in each brigade.

The Commander-in-Chief, India, has agreed
to this re-organization and an_ infan
battalion has been provided for each brigade,
but we are still short of medium and flame-
throwing tanks. 3
Command Changes.

141. There are two other important changes,
the policy in regard to which was decided while
I was Commander-in-Chief, 11 Army Group,
although it was not put into effect until after
I had left. Since, however, I was closely
associated with this policy, I should, I consider,
mention these two changes in this Despatch.
The first was the appointment of an Allied
Land Commander-in-Chief. The second was
the transfer of Headquarters, Allied Land
Forces to the vicinity of Calcutta.

142. As long as General Stilwell operated
under the command of General Slim no diffi-
culties regarding command arose. When, how-
ever, General Stilwell came under the direct
command of the Supreme Allied Commander,
there was a duplicate chain of command as
General Slim operated under my orders and
General Stilwell under the Supreme Allied
