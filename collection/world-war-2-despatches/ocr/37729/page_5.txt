enemy A.F.V’s. and M.T. moving towards
Msus. Whether this column was; in fact,
an enemy one still remains uncertain, but
according to the pilot the lorries were Italian

and the personnel inside them opened ‘Ate, on ,

his aircraft.

23. On the 4th April, enemy armoured forces
threatened to outfiank the Australian Division
holding the Benina-Tocra position, necessita-
ting their withdrawal to new positions on the

. Barce escarpment.

In the meantime, as the Army withdrew to
new positions, our Squadrons moved to landing
grounds further East. On the 4th April, No, 3
Australian Squadron, No. 6 (A.C.) Squadron
and Advanced H.Q., Cyrenaica, moved to
Maraua, No. 55 Squadron to Dera and H.Q.,
Cyrenaica to Tobruk. On the same day 8
Blenheims of No. 45 Squadron reinforced
No. 55 Squadron.

The Australian Division withdrew to the
Barce escarpment on the 5th April, covered
by Hurricane patrols of Nos. 3 and 73
Squadrons. The Hurricane patrols were also
extended to cover elements of our troops re-
tiring towards Mechili. In these operations,
on 5th April our fighters destroyed 14 enemy
aircraft for a loss of 2 Hurricanes.

By the 7th April the Australian Division and
support group had withdrawn, first to Derna
and then to Gazala area. Meanwhile, our
armoured forces, which had already suffered
heavy losses, had fallen back on Mechili and
joined up with the Indian Motor Brigade. At
this stage R.A.F. Squadrons had withdrawn
to aerodromes in the Tobruk area, and further
movements were necessary on the 8th April
when the Blenheim Squadrons and No. 3
R.A.A.F. Squadron withdrew to landing
grounds East of the Cyrenaica-Egyptian fron-
tier, and the Wellingtons to their bases in the
Fuka area. No. 6 (A.C.) and 73 (F)
Squadrons continued to operate from landing
grounds within the Tobruk perimeter.

The Awmstralian Division withdrew to the
outer perimeter of Tobruk on the roth April.
The following day enemy A.F.V’s. cut the road
between Tobruk and El Adem and our support

- group retired towards Sollum. From Mechili

the enemy’s forward troops continued their
advance, and by the 13th April they had
occupied Bardia and the Sollum escarpment
where their advance was temporarily halted.

24. The situation by 13th April had become
more stabilised and was as follows: —

The enemy’s thrust in the forward area at
Sollum had lost momentum and there were
indications that his troops there were experi-
encing administrative difficulties as a result of
their rapid advance.

Tobruk was held by a. strong force of our
troops and was invested by the enemy whose
troops were concentrated West and South of
the perimeter, with armoured forces astride the
El Adem road.

H.Q. No. 204 Group, which formed at
Maaten Bagush on the r2th April under the
command of Air Commodore R. Collishaw,
C.B., D.S.0., O.B.E., D.S.C., D.F.C., had
taken over the control of the Squadrons in the
Western Desert from H.Q. Cyrenaica.

The tasks of the R.A.F, at this stage were :—_

(a) To continue to attack lines of com-
Munication to aggravate the enemy’s
existing M.T. difficulties.

(b) ‘10 provide close support for the Atmy
by attacking enemy A.t.V’s., M.T. con-
centrations and troops both in the forward

--areas and at Tobruk. ~-

(c) To attack enemy aerodromes, primarily
with the intention of destroying his transport
aircraft which he was using to supply his
forward troops.

_(@ To bomb harbour facilities and ship-
ping at Benghazi in order to interrupt the
use of the port by the enemy and thereby
prevent him from shortening his long lines
of communication from Tripolitania.

(e) To provide the fighter defence of
Tobruk.

25. Soon after the investment of Tobruk it
became evident that it would uo longer be
possible to maintain No. 6 (AC.) and
No. 73 (F) Squadrons on the aerodrome
within the perimeter. In addition to frequent
dive bombing attacks, which were liable to
destroy or damage the aircraft ‘beyond repair
capacity available, the landing ground was
within range of enemy artillery tire. These
Squadrons were accordingly withdrawn to
aerodromes in the vicinity ot Maaten Bagush,
with advanced landing ground near Sidi
Barrani for re-fuelling. .

Owing to the distance of Tobruk from these
aerodromes and even from the advanced
landing ground at Sidi Barrani (120 miles from
Tobruk), the task of maintaining | fighter
defence over Tobruk Harbour at such long
Tange became extremely difficult. In addition,
the depth of enemy penetration to the East
put Tripoli out of range of our Wellingtons
operating from the Western Desert, and made
it most difficult to provide fighter escorts to our
ships supplying the Tobruk garrison. On the
other hand, it enabled the enemy to develop
repeated bombing attacks on Tobruk without
regular fighter interference, and it reduced the
distance for his bombers operating against
Alexandria or ships in the Eastern
Mediterranean.

26. After a German-Italian attack on Tobruk
on April ‘4th, during which No. 73 (F)
Squadron shot down g E/‘A for loss of 2, there
followed a period of comparative inactivity
from a military standpoint. In the Sollum
area, patrols of our mobile forces made raids
well behind the enemy’s forward troops. The
enemy, however, continued to, supply his
forward areas by means of M.T. and transport
aircraft, although harassed by the activity of
our mobile patrols and the continued attacks
of our aircraft on his lines of communication
and forward aerodromes.

Enemy air activity at this stage was con-
centrated largely on Tobruk, apparently with
the primary intention of denying the port to
us, Hurricanes of No. 73 Squadron, providing
the fighter defence of Tobruk, on several
occasions engaged greatly superior numbers
of the enemy with success, although not with-
out loss to themselves. As an example, in
a series of raids on Tobruk during 22nd and
