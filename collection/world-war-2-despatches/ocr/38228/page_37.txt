SUPPLEMENT 10 tae LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948

forced to leave that country. General Lin Wei
agreed : —

(a) That the bulk of the Chinese Fifth
Army should withdraw north via Shwebo,
and.

(b) That it would be better that no Imperial
‘Forces should withdraw towards Lashio and
that the tanks should be employed for the
battle of Mandalay on the most suitable
ground, which was north of the Irrawaddy
towards Shwebo.

On the 22nd April an outline of the new plan
was sent by liaison officer to the Headquarters
1 Burcorps and, on the 23rd April, Operation
Instruction No. 46, the contents of which had
been agreed by General Stilwell’s staff at
Maymyo, was issued.

45. Situation North of Yenangyaung.—Before
explaining in detail the new plan for a with-
drawal north of Mandalay it is necessary to
return to the situation of r Burcorps north of
Yenangyaung. On the 2oth April, the day
following my agreement with General Stilwell
to undertake offensive operations in this area,
the dispositions of 1 Burcorps were as follows:—
‘7 Division holding Taungdwingyi-

Natmauk. .
- 9 Armoured Brigade under orders to move

to the Meiktila area.

38 Chinese Division under command
I Burcorps with—

113 Regiment and two battalions 112

Regiment area Yenangyaung.

114 Regiment under orders to move from

Mandalay to Taungtha.

1 Burma Division reorganising in the area
of Mount Popa. This Division had lost, in
the fighting at Yenangyaung, about 20 per
cent. of its personnel, two Bofors, four 3.7
howitzers, four 25 pounders, most of its 3-in.
mortars and nearly allits M.T. The Division
was not in a fit condition to fight for some
days.

Efforts were being made to organise as rapidly
as possible the move of the 200 Chinese Division
from the Meiktila-Thazi area to Kyaukpadaung

and one regiment of the 22 Division to.

Natmauk. Owing, however, to the lack of
transport and to the difficulty of co-ordinating
plans with the Chinese Fifth Army, it appeared
improbable that the force could be concen-
trated and ready for offensive action before the
morning of the 22nd April at the earliest.

46. On the 2zst April the seriousness of the
situation in the Shan States brought about the
abandonment of the projected offensive against
the Japanese 33 Division in the Yenangyaung
area. The 200 Chinese Division was ordered
by General Stilwell to move to Kalaw and the
22 ‘Chinese Division to concentrate in the Thazi
area. In these circumstances it became a
matter of supreme importance to hold securely
the centres of: communication south of
Mandalay. Accordingly the following moves
were ordered by 1 Burcorps: —

38 Chinese Division to concentrate at

Kyaukpadaung.

rt Burma Division to be prepared to move

to Taungtha.
17 Division to withdraw from Taungdwingyi
- and later from Natmauk to positions north
west and west of. Meiktila” at Mahlaing and

Zayetkon.

1703

7 Armoured Brigade to Meiktila under
command of General Lo, who now took
over command of the Chinese forces on the
Pyawbwe front, General Tu having moved
with the 200 Division to Kalaw.

47. The New Plan.—The plan contained in
Operation Instruction No. 46 envisaged the
following dispositions north of the Irrawaddy:—

West of the River Mu.—z Burcorps less the
7 Armoured Brigade with the 1 Burma
Division astride the River Chindwin and a
strong detachment covering the approach to
Kalewa via the Myittha valley.

Between the River Mu and the Northern
Reach of the Irrawaddy.—38 Chinese Divi-
sion and the 7 Armoured Brigade.

In and South of Mandalay and holding the
Crossings over the River Myitnge.—22, 28
and 96 Chinese Divisions.

It will be realised that a withdrawal from the
Meiktila area would uncover the communica-
tions with Mandalay of any Chinese forces in
the area Kalaw-Taunggyi and would prevent
their withdrawal via Mandalay. The plan
therefore was for all Chinese forces east of the
railway -Mandalay-Pyawbwe to move towards
Lashio. The situation was very delicate at this
time and it was impossible to issue a hard and
fast plan for any. further withdrawal since no
decision could be made in the existing situation _
as to whether the 22, 28 and 96 Chinese Divi-
sions would withdraw to the north or whether
they would fall back on Lashio.

48. I must emphasise here that I had no
intention of withdrawing north of the Irrawaddy
unless forced to give up Kyaukpadaung and
Meiktila and, for the defence of these areas,
I had grouped my forces as follows: —.

(a) Under command of General Lo
(Chinese C.-in-C.).—22 Division, 96 Division
and the 7 Armoured Brigade (for the defence
of the area Meiktila-Thazi-Pyawbwe).

- (b) Under the command of: Lieut.-General

Slim, z Burcorps—r7 Division, 1 Burma

Division, 38 Chinese Division.

- 28 Chinese Division (less one regiment not
yet arrived) was preparing -the defences of

Mandalay.

I had to consider the dangerous bottleneck
of Mandalay through which run the approaches
to the Ava Bridge, the only bridge over the
Irrawaddy. These approaches were very vul-
nerable to air attack. I was determined not to
allow my forces to be pushed into the loop of
the Irrawaddy below Mandalay and be forced
to fight with this obstacle at their backs. In
order to avoid this and also to avoid undue
congestion in the approaches to the- Ava
Bridge, I had decided that the moment to order

the withdrawal would be’ when my advanced

forces had to leave the Meiktila area. I had
also arranged earlier in the month for prepara-
tions to be put in hand for the construction of
ferries over both the Irrawaddy and the
Myitinge Rivers and of the approaches thereto
in order to eliminate the bottleneck as far as
possible.
