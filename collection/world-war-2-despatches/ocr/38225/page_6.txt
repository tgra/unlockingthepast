general conditions of the occupation of Diego
Suarez by British forces. These allowed for
the port remaining under French admumistra-
tion, to be handed back +o them after the
war, for payment of salaries and pensions to
all who would co-operate, and for repatriation
of those who would not, excluding wives and
families who, however, could be evacuated by
private arrangements at their own risk.

TRANSLATION OF THE ULTIMATUM.
On Board the British Flagship,
3rd May, 1942.

Your Excellency,

The strategic position of Diego Suarez re-
quires that it should not fall into the hands of
the Japanese and that the territory should be
available for those forces which are fighting to
restore freedom in the world and secure the
liberation of France and French territory. It
cannot be allowed to suffer the fate of Indo
China.

I therefore request that in order that blood-
shed may be avoided you will surrender the
territory under your control to me uncondition-
ally and instruct your officials and Armed Forces
to obey the orders which I shall issue.

The action which I am now taking on the
instruction of H.M. Government has the full
approval of the Government of the United
States.

In order to assist you in reaching a favour-
able decision I have been instructed by H.M.
Government to inform you of the following :—

(x) Diego Suarez is French and will remain
French, and will be restored to France after
the war. H.M. Government have repeatedly
made it clear that they do not covet an inch
of French territory. I repeat this assurance.

(2) Funds will be made available to meet
the salaries and pensions of all personnel,
Civil and Military, who elect to co-operate
with the United Nations. a

(3) If any Civil and Military employees do
not wish to co-operate, they will, provided
they can claim the right to residence in Metro-
politan France, be repatriated as and when
shipping becomes available.

. (4) The trade of Diego Suarez with the
United Nations will be restored. H.M. Gov-
ernment will extend to Diego Suarez all the
economic benefits accorded to French terri-
tories which have already joined the United
Nations.

(5) There must be no destruction of Civil
and Military installations, ‘W/T Stations, War
Stores, etc. Those responsible for any such
sabotage will not benefit by conditions (2) and
(3) above.

Your reply to this communication should be
sent to me immediately in plain language by
radio on 500 kc/s (600 metres) using call sign
GBXZ.
