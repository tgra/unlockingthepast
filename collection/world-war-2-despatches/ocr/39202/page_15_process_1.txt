231. The period, May to August, 1945  covering the re-entry of the Allied Forces into Rangoon and later the surrender of Japan  cannot be termed spectacular in air supply operations when reckoned against such efforts during the Allied advance down through Burma earlier in the year, when the mobility of Fourteenth Army was almost entirely provided by the Allied Air Forces whose record

A Prominent Lesson which Emerged from the Campaign in Burma.

233. The great saving of lives and raising of morale due to air casualty evacuation was one of the main lessons which emerged from the Campaign in Burma.

234. This service was easily one of the best morale builders among Allied front-line troops. It inspired the fighting man's confidence and allayed any fears he may have had about being wounded, with the possibility of falling into the hands of the Japanese as a prisoner.

235. Air casualty evacuation, once it became known as the recognised method for dealing with serious cases by flying them out of the forward areas in Burma, was a triumph both for the Allied medical staffs and the aircrews alike. The Japanese had no air organisation for similar evacuation of their troops, and the low condition in which many enemy prisoners were found as a result of acute sickness in the jungle areas was, in itself, a contributory factor to their defeat.

236. The general policy was for supply aircraft to deliver supplies and take back from forward airfields on their return trips loads of casualties to the base hospitals, and the special centres established at Comilla, but when adverse landing conditions compelled supply by dropping, there were temporary difficulties in clearing casualties from Corps and Army medical centres. Austers and L.5 aircraft (Sentinels) were used in the Theatre with conspicuous success in the forward areas.

237. For the purpose of handling casualties from forward medical units and forward transport landing grounds, R.A.F. Casualty Air Evacuation Units were set up. These units were situated on the transport air strip covering a particular area.  Emplaning of the casualties on to the aircraft was effected according to their degree of urgency for base hospital medical treatment. The average strength of a Casualty Air Evacuation Unit was 40 British other tanks, with a varied number of Indian personnel. Approximately 100 wounded could be staged at these C.A.E.U.s. for as long as was necessary. As many seriously wounded and sick personnel required medical attention whilst travelling in aircraft to base, an air

supply tonnage averaged 2,900 tons per day in il, 1945.

232. The period, May to August, was not only the monsoon period but the period, with the exception of the July battle in Burma, during which the Allied Forces on ground, sea and in the air were building up their organisation and strength to deliver the next blow which would have fallen upon the Japanese in Malaya in early September. Nevertheless, the R.AF. Transport supply squadrons met the demands required of them, and the supply effort for that period may be summarised as follows :

ambulance orderly pool was established at base. This was composed of specially trained nursing orderlies who flew in all aircraft. It is noteworthy to record that these nursing orderlies flew as much as 200 hours a month. They carried with them complete first-aid equipment, including oxygen-giving apparatus. In the Burma Theatre, due to the mountainous nature of the country, portable oxygen equipment proved to be essential in air casualty evacuation work, and its employment actually saved many lives.

238. The Casualty Air Evacuation Units in the forward areas were also responsible for the off-loading, treatment and conveyance of casualties received direct from the battle line in light aircraft such as the L.5S. These aircraft proved invaluable in evacuating casualties from jungle clearances and small strips in the forward areas.

239. Air evacuation of casualties began in Burma in the opening months of 1944, when the Allied ground forces found themselves: encircled in the Arakan, and later during the period of the Siege of Imphal. By September of that year, some 48,789 casualties had been evacuated by air, and as the months passed, and the campaign developed in intensity, the casualty evacuation figures steadily increased.

240. By the end of April, 1945 three days before the fall of Rangoon the total casualties evacuated by British and American aircraft in Burma was 110,761, of which 50,285 were evacuated by R.A. aircraft.

241. In the period May to August, 1945, the closing stages of the war against the Japanese, R.AF. aircraft evacuated a total of 9,972 casualties.

242. That air casualty evacuation proved itself a triumph both from the point of view of morale and the lives saved, is undisputed. Perhaps more convincing is the fact that, throughout the campaign, only one death in the air among ground personnel evacuated was recorded, and only one aircraft, carrying 24 casualties, was lost due to weather.

243. H.Q. ALFS.E.A. stated that air

evacuation reduced mortality of wounded by 60 per cent. .
