SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 APRIL, 1948

The position now is that the manpower
ceiling has almost been reached as regards
R.A.F. personnel, and the provision for future
expansion in this Command, the necessity for
which no one can doubt, is a problem still to be
solved.

That the W.A.A.F, should be brought to
the rescue was an idea that did not come to
fruition within the period of this Despatch.

40. The Indiap Aw Force (I.A.F.).

Previous Despatches from the India Com-
mand have not so far dealt specifically with
developments in this Service, and a stage has
now been reached when a review of it 1s
opportune.

The Indian Air Force has now almost reached
the peace time strength of the Royal Air Force
ten or eleven years ago. Numerous facilities
for technical and flying traiming have been
thrown open to the youth of the country who,
as regards technical training, have realised the
value of what was being offered to them and
responded accordingly.

The process of expansion, however, has been
so rapid that many difficulties have arisen.
The Indian Air Force 1s at the moment com-
pletely Indian, with the exception of a limted
number of R.A.F, 'N.C.Os. No European can
hold a commission in the Indian Air Force,
which differs m this respect from the Royal
Indian Navy and the Indian Army. Up tll
the beginning of 1942, R.A.F. officers did in
fact command I.A.F. units without, however,
being specifically commissioned in the ].A.F.
After the success of No. 1 Squadron in the
Burma campaign, policy was changed and since
that date only one Royal Air Force officer
(for a bref period of two or three months) has
commanded an I.A.F. Squadron. It will be
seen then, that as far as possible, the Indian
Air Force as a service has been kept Indian,

In regard to efficiency, however, the I.A.F.
up to November, 1943, had hardly succeeded
as well as its first Squadron did in Burma.
Owing to the rapid expansion of the Service
since the outbreak of the War there is a defi-
nite lack of officers suitable for important
commands. At the moment it depends almost
entirely for its leadership on the limited num-
ber of officers who in pre-war days were trained
at Cranwell: The intake of officers since war
broke out has been large, and their training
necessarily has been far less thorough than that
given at Cranwell. 79g

It is early yet to form any idea as to whether.
and to what extent the I.A.F. should be assisted
by a cadre of R.A.F. personnel. Several com-
pletely Indian Squadrons will shortly go. into
action. If these acquit themselves well, their
success will obviously reduce the number of
R.A.F. personnel necessary to give assistance.
It may, however, be necessary later to increase
the R.A.F. element in J.A.F, Squadrons.

With regard to the recruiting of Indian man-
power for the I.A.F the rate of intake of the
previous six months was maintained.

The rate of intake, although it only amounted
to 60 per cent. of the target, was still six times
greater than the 1942 average, and recruiting
in fact has been successful beyond what was
expected.

The recruitment of airmen with the ultimate
object of finding suitable material as officers,
presented some difficulty. Those few I.A.T.C.
cadets who were keen to become pilots were

26075

not willing to enter the ranks and take their
chance of being subsequently selected for pilot
training, when they could probably obtain
direct commissions in the Army or the Royal
Indian Navy, The policy of commissioning from
the ranks was vigorously pursued, but few of
the men selected were good officer maternal,
and fewer succeeded in completing their train-
ing as pilots. After the success of the campaign
for technicians, however, an aircrew publicity
campaign was launched, stressing the ad-
venturous aspects of flying. xperienced
officers were detailed to tour India, with the
result that a list of over 400 candidates was
obtained for imterviews by the Officers’
Selection* Board,

Moreover the Air Training Corps, which is
already functioning in six universities and is
due to begin shortly in two others, has now
been converted to an organisation for the pro-
duction of general duties officers. On the other
hand the number of recruits required to keep
up the ten I.A F. squadrons has increased, and
there has also been an increase in training
wastage. It is not, therefore, certain as yet
that an adequate flow of recruits will be main-
tained.

With the above manpower difficulties and
complications it was mot surprising that the
original target of ten squadrons for the I.A.F.
had not been achieved by the end of 1943.
Eight were ready and two were forming. All
ten should be operational by the end of 1944.

Future policy regarding the I.A.F. is not
clear-cut though it has been laid down in
principle.

Since pilots are scarce, and R.A.F. crews
are already employed in I.A.F squadrons, it
1s not intended to form further I A F. squad-
rons for some time. The future in peace time
of the I.AF. will best be served by making
these squadrons as efficient as possible, amd for
this purpose the pilots trained under the Empire
Training Scheme, many of whom will gain
operational experience in Fighter Command at
home, and certain I A.F. officers who will
have gained similar experience by posting on
an ‘ exchange ’ basis to Royal Air Force fighter
squadrons in India, will prove extremely
useful

The next stage in the J.A.F. expansion
desired by the Indian Government is the build- °
ing of L-A.F maintenance, training and ad-
ministrative units appropriate to the firstline
strength. It would be possible to work in this
direction by increasing the Indian element in
certain agreed units suitable to the purpose,
but no final commitments have been entered
into as yet.

41. L.A.F Traming.

The actual training of officers and airmen
of the I.A.F. has presented difficulties owing to
the almost complete absence of R.A.F officers
with a knowledge of India, the general shortage
of instructional staff, and inevitable delays over
building projects. Elementary and service
training for IAF. pilots have indeed been
carried out, but the wastage rate was alarm-
ingly high, often amounting to over sixty per
cent. During the period under review, thirty-
seven pilots left for Canada under the Empire
Air Training Scheme after completion of their
elementary training, and thirty-two success-
gly passed out of the Service Flying Trairing
