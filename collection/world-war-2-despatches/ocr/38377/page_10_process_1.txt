at first accepted. Further imterrogation of Swordfish crews revealed that visibility from the air at the time was poor and the vessel reported as LEINSTER was probably BROWN RANGER. Subsequently Vice-Admiral Commanding, North Atlantic corrected the position to read Carnero Point and added that mihtary ranks had  been disembarked.

16. I considered it impracticable to take any steps to transfer the personnel from LEINSTER. HERMIONE was a_possibility, but her return to Gibraltar at this stage would have inevitably compromised secrecy In any case, she could not have taken more than 500 men without seriously affecting her fighting efficiency and I considered her presence with Force H on D.4 most necessary in view of possible eventualities. A signal to this effect was passed to Vice-Admiral Commanding, North Atlantic, by means of a_ returning Sunderland.

17. Clocks were advanced one hour at 1000 to Zone -2* By 1230 Group 4 was abeam and to the northward of Group 5 and the destroyer screens were readjusted leaving three Tnbals, NESTOR, FOXHOUND  and FIREDRAKE, all of whom were destined for and could refuel at Malta with Group 4, and ie remainder with Group 5 so as to economise uel.

18. At 1500 Group 4 altered course to 060  to open from Group 5 and at 1600 reduced speed to 18 knots. The two groups were then approximately 30 miles apart.

19. Dunng the day ARK ROYAL eat a fighter  section ranged on deck whilst Sunderlands operating from Gibraltar provided A/S patrols ahead of both groups to avoid the use of Swordfish which would have suggested the presence of ARK ROYAL. No hostile or unidentified aircraft were sighted or detected throughout the day but two merchant ships were sighted by Group 4. The first passed westbound at 1255 some 15 miles to the northward of RENOWN who was then 32 miles south-west of Almeria. The second was sighted at 1900 when 35 miles south of Cape Palos, this ship bore E.S.E., 10 miles, and appeared to be northbound from Oran. .

Movements during Daylight Hours, 22nd July (D.2).

20. At o400 Group 4 altered course to 070  when 36 miles S.E. of Formentera, and to 130  at o7oo when 75 miles east of Formentera with the object of covering Group 3 from air observation, Fighter and A/S patrols were flown off for Group 4 at 0715 and maintained during the day.

az. At o8zo aircraft reported a southbound ship 18 miles south-west of the group. It was estimated she would pass 13 miles ahead of Group 5 at 1230.

22. An unidentified floatplane was sighted at 0850 low down to the northward of Group 4 and about ro miles away. Owing to low air to air visibility the fighters were unable to intercept and the aircraft disappeared to the eastward. A few minutes later an Italian signal was intercepted, timed 0850, which appeared to refer to Group 4.

23. At noon Group 4 reversed course to the westward for two hours to close the distance from Group 5 and turned east again at 1400. One or two aircraft were detected passing 25 mules north of RENOWN at 1430; ARK ROYAL flew off six fighters but these failed to intercept.

24. The Sunderland A/S aircraft was instructed By V/S* at 1453 to locate Group 5 and to inform Rear-Admiral Commanding, 18th Cruiser Squadron that Group 4 would remain 20 miles to the eastward of the convoy during the night and close at daylight. This Sunderland returned at 1732 reporting Group 5 bearing 240 , 25 miles from RENOWN. RearAdmiral Commanding, 18th Cruiser Squadron reported via this aircraft that one French merchant ship had passed northbound 9 miles ahead of the convoy at 1300, that all destroyers had been fuelled during the day from BROWN RANGER and that Group 5 would pass through position 37  40  N., 6  25  E. at 0300/23.

25. During the day th  sea was calm with fair surface visibility and a light easterly wind which enabled ARK ROYAL to operate independently for flying inside the screen.

26. Group 4 streamed paravanes at 1800 in position 37  49  N., 05  04  E., and at 2030 again turned west till 2200 to maintain a distance of about 20 miles to the eastward of the convoy during the night. As far as I am aware Group 5 had not yet been sighted by the enemy.

Submarine Attack on fines H on Night 2and/ 23rd July.

3, At 2315 when in position 38  03  N,

  45  E. proceeding at 15 knots on a course

obs NESTOR, who was the starboard wing

* destroyer of the screen, reported a torpedo

approaching from starboard. Immediate avoiding action was taken by means of a drastic turn to port. After a short period three heavy explosions were felt at regular intervals followed a little later by a fourth explosion about a cable ahead of RENOWN. Subsequent reports from NESTOR indicated that a submarine on the surface had fired a salvo of four torpedoes and that NESTOR had counter-attacked.

Hovemanls; early a.m. 23rd July (D.3).

28. At 0648 ARK ROYAL flew off the first fighter patrol and Group 4 closed Group 5. At 0657 RENOWN reported a shadowing aircraft in sight ahead of Group 4. Fighters were sent out 10 miles but owing to the low sun and mist were unable to sight and the shadower made good her escape. A second shadowing aircraft was reported at 0729 ten miles to the northward but owing to low visibility and the fact that the aircraft was too low for R.D.F. Teports, no contact was made by the fighters.

29. It became apparent that both groups had been sighted. At 0745 Group 4 was formed as a flexible port column of, the convoy with the object of providing A.A. protection whilst still Temaining free to manceuvre for flying. This formation was maintained during the day. The sea was calm with a clear sky and good visibility but a very light and variable wind made
