6. During the whole period after passing
Harrar my commanders were receiving con-
tinual requests from civilians in outlying dis-
tricts all round Addis Abeba and along the lines
of communication to rescue them from the
threats, either real or imaginary, of attack by
Ethiopians. The answering of these calls for
assistance was hampering the real effort of the
fighting troops, and I felt the time had
come to make another approach to H.R.H.
Duc D’Aosta and to tell him that I could no
longer be responsible for any civilians not in
our hands. Therefore on gth April I tele-
graphed to General Wavell asking him if I
could make an approach on these lines, and
received permission from him to do so by
teturn.

I thereupon had the following message
dropped from the air at both Gimma and Dessie,

‘To His Royal Highness Amedeo of

Savoia, Viceroy of Ethiopia, Duke of Aosta

or to his representative of the Supreme Com-

mand, from General Cunningham, Com-

manding British Forces in East Africa.
‘In view of present military situation have

further communication to make to Supreme

Command on the subject of the safety of

Italian women and children in Ethiopia

which is now precarious. If in the interests

of Italian civilians the Supreme Command
wishes to receive this communication

arrangements will ibe made as before for a

representative to land by aeroplane on

Chinile aerodrome between the hours of 9

and xo returning betwen 2 and 3 on the

14th or 15th April.’’

7. In due course an Italian aeroplane landed
at Diredaua satellite aerodrome between og00
and 1000 hours on 15th April. I met the en-
voy myself and explained the situation to him
verbally, namely that all the Rases who had
worked with the Italians had submitted to the
Emperor and Ethiopians everywhere were
flocking to his standard; moreover the whole
country was swarming with armed deserters
from the Italian army who were turhing into
marauding ‘bands, which were attacking Italian
civilians and property; if I were to answer all
requests for protection which I was getting,
military operations would be hampered, and
that neither myself nor my Commanders would
be fulfilling our military duty of waging war
against the Italians to the utmost degree; only
on one condition could we accept any msi~
‘bility for civilians not in our hands and that was
the unconditional laying down of arms, when
we would be in a position to undertake the pro-
tection, feeding and evacuation of Italian
nationals. The envoy asked me to confirm that
we would look after the civilians already in
our hands. I said I would to the best of my
power, but took the opportunity of impress-
ing upon him that incidents such as shooting
of Abyssinians in Addis Abeba by Italian
police made my task extremely difficult. I gave
the envoy until rooo hours on 17th April to
reply. On that day an aeroplane again landed
at the same aerodrome with a message to the
effect that, in view of the importance of the
proposals and the grave responsibilities they
carried, they would have to be referred to
Rome. Furthermore they were required in
writing. I thereupon sent the following

essage :
‘“In the interests of humanity, and in
view of the perilous military situation in

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 10 JULY, 1946

which the Italians in Ethiopia are now
placed, I am authorised by the Commander-
in-Chief, Middle East, to send the following

message : —

‘* Unless the Italian troops in Italian East
Africa Jay down their arms, no responsibility
for protecting and succouring Italian nationals
can be accepted except in places already
occupied by forces under British Military

command.

“It is the duty of the British Military
Commanders, with all the forces at their dis-
posal, to prosecute the war against the Italian
army with the utmost vigour, and nothing
will be allowed to interfere with this object
as long as fighting continues.

‘A reply may be sent on 9700 K/cs
British call YNC, Italian call YNI, between
the hours of 0515 and 0815 GMT, and rar5
and 1515 hours GMT up to inclusive 2oth
April.”

That very morning the BBC made an
announcement to the effect that H.R.H. Duc
D’Aosta had sent an envoy over to ask for
peace terms. It was quite clear to me that such
a premature announcement, which was in fact
an iniquitous misrepresentation of the real facts,
could only result in prejudicing any chance
there was of getting the Duc D’Aosta to agree
to the terms. Up to that time his attitude, as
shown through his envoys, had been courteous
and displayed a willingness to listen. The
announcement could only have the effect of
stiffening him, more particularly as it would
prejudice him in the eyes of the Fascist Chiefs
with whom he was reported already to be on
bad terms.

On 2oth April I received the reply given in
full below.

“ With reference to your letter do not take
into consideration your proposals of military
character Stop The responsibility concerning
white population passes on to you when your
troops or natives armed ordered by your
officers or whoever under your orders occupy
the places in which the white population is.
di Savoia.””

8. In order to understand the background
against which operations by my troops were being
undertaken, it is necessary here to lain the
activities of the Ethiopian patriots. Em-
peror, by his presence in the Gojjam, had rallied
most of the leaders in that province to his
cause. The notable exception was Ras Hailu,
who had been working in co-operation with the
Italian forces in Debra Marcos. When forces
under the Kaid occupied this place and the
submission of Ras Hailu to the Emperor had
been obtained, the Patriot movement grew in
momentum and it became possible to direct
forces to specific tasks under instructions from
the Emperor.

On the arrival of the Emperor at Addis
Abeba on 5th May he re-established personal
contact with the leaders from other provinces
and fresh impetus was given to the movement
in different parts of the country.

On the same day, all irregular troops which
had entered Ethiopia from the Sudan came
under my command, except for certain
Sudanese units, which were gradually being
withdrawn to the North.

g. In the Gojjam it had been found that the
formation of ‘‘ operational centres’? was a
good method of enlisting and directing patriot
