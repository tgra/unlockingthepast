women to men was roughly 2 to 1. Women
carried out every job except those involving
heavy manual labour such as loading and
manning the gun itself. .

The problem had been considered before the
outbreak of war when I asked for the advice
of Miss Caroline Haslett, ‘C/B.E., who, after
spending days and nights in the field examining
the various duties, told me she had no. doubt
that women were capable of doing all but the
heaviest tasks.

It was on 25th April, 1941, that regulations
were put into force making women eligible for
operational duties. In May, 1941, the first
mixed battery began its training and it became
operational on 21st August, 1941.

5. Two projects were formulated. The first
was that all Heavy Batteries coming forward
from Training Regiments would in future be
Mixed Batteries and the second was that, as the
number of trained women increased, some of the
existing male batteries should be converted to
Mixed Batteries. The Mixed units would only
have static and not mobile guns. It was hoped
that by the end. of 1941 there would be pro-
vided .just under 40 batteries through each
project, but this proved an over-optimistic fore-
cast: Nevertheless, it was now clear that we
could expect both to remedy existing deficiencies
and to continue the expansion of the anti-air-
craft defences. I was promised that of the
expected total of 220,000 A.T.S. at the end of
1942, I could anticipate having 170,000. In
actual fact, this estimated figure proved over-
optimistic as other Army demands on the avail-
. able women power limited the number of

A.T.S. in Anti-Aircraft Command to a maxi-
mum, at any time, to just over 74,000.

6. The welfare of these women was one of the
considerations which was uppermost in all our
minds and this had a considerable effect upon
the areas in which they were deployed. I
wished to be quite certain that their accommo-
dation would be suitable, and it was also
necessary to ensure that they would not find
themselves in the probable path of an invading
army. A high.standard of accommodation was
set, but the general labour shortage throughout
the country resulted in the programme of build-
ing falling behind schedule and it was not
always possible to supply the full standard.

7. The possibility of invasion caused addi-
tional complications. Plans to counter any
invasion, adapted to our increasing resources,
were steadily improved. The summer of 1941
found an elaborate and detailed plan prepared,
in which the anti-aircraft guns had to be ready
for rapid moves in order to fit into the needs
of the situation should it arise.

8. Some time previously I had reluctantly
accepted a large and expanding programme of
static 3.7-inch guns rather than mobile guns
because the former were so much more rapidly
‘produced. The task of shifting a static gun
was very considerable and a great deal of
preparation was necessary before it could be
emplaced on a new site. As soon as the Chiefs
of Staff advised me which defences must re-
main and which must be moved in the event of
invasion, an interchange of 244 mobile and
static: guns was ordered so that the number of
moves to be made if invasion took place would
be cut to a minimum.

g.-This interchange had repercussions upon
the deployment of ‘Mixed batteries. Some sites
where. accommodation had been provided for
them were now equipped with mobile guns on
which -women could not be deployed, so that
some mixed units had perforce to be put in
quarters which were below the desired standard.

Io. The original projects had in fact been
based upon a degree.of immobility in the anti-
aircraff defences which could never exist. If
the enemy chose to change his objectives, as he
later did, units had to be moved in accordance *

‘with operational] needs rather than with some

theoretical accommodation problems of our own,
Consequently, as time went on and the de-
ployment of guns changed, the general standard
of accommodation for Mixed batteries became
further removed from that originally set. So
long as reasonable recreational facilities during
periods of inactiom and satisfactory ablutions
at all times were available for them, the morale
of women in an operational réle was always
high, and subsequent events proved their.great
courage. I cannot jpraise too highly the
valuable work these women performed or the
splendid spirit which they. brought to it.

’ xx. In the emergency deployments of Heavy
guns later in the war, women had'to be accom-
modated in emergency conditions jf the de-
fences were to remain operative, and they not
only accepted those conditions but even chose to
remain at their posts when offered an oppor-
tunity to leave.

During the temporary concentration of de-
fences on the south coast to protect our
invasion forces and Jater in the emergency de-
ployments to counter the flying bomb, they
were accommodated under canvas with all the
accompanying inconveniences and finally some
units were withdrawn from my command to
serve in the anti-aircraft defence of Antwerp
and Brussels during a winter campaign, a
decision which was the finest possible tribute
to the work of the Mixed batteries as a whole.

12, Although generally women were employed
on Heavy guns where units were concentrated,
the serious loss of manpower in searchlight
units led me to consider whether it might not
be possible to employ them in this réle also.
Owing to the impossibility of mixing the sexes
in small detachments, any such units had to
consist wholly of women and though one search-
light regiment was created in this form and
gave a good account of itself, I was dissuaded
from extending the experiment for twe. reasons.
First, it was not possible to find a sufficient
number of women officers capable of assuming
tactical as well as administrative responsibility
and secondly, searchlight sites were normally
provided with Light Machine-Guns for local
air and ground ‘defence, and women,’ however
willing to do so, were not allowed to handle -
guns of any kind..

13. However, further demands for economies
in manpower were already upon us. In October,
1941, a cut of 50,000 men for the Field Force
was ordered. In order to man the equipment
which was now réaching the Command ih large
quantities, the employment of Home Guards for
anti-aircraft defence was once more considered.-
Home Guard personnel could not, however, do
continuous manning and it was not easy to
