SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 30 OCTOBER, 947

British Admiralty opinion, on the other hand,
supported these estimates in view of the ex-
tremely heavy burden that would be thrown on
all the repair facilities on the south coast
shortly before the operation. Experience
in the Mediterranean had shown that a
greater number of ships and craft always
offered for loading for an assault than had
been expected, as the incentive of action
had a clearly salutary effect on repairs
previously deemed essential. While I there-
fore really expected the planning figures to be
exceeded I was very loath to gamble on this
and I only accepted higher figures for U.S.
L.S.T.- of 95 per cent. after Rear-Admiral A. G.
Kirk, U.S.N. (Naval Commander, Western
Task Force) had agreed them. In the event,
due to the splended efforts of COMLANCRAB-
ELEVENTHPHIB* (Rear-Admiral J. Wilkes,
U.S.N.), and his staff, the record overall figure
of 99.3 per cent. for all types of U.S. landing
‘ships and landing craft was attained. The
similar British figure was 97.6 per cent., and,

in my opinion, the very highest credit is due to ,

all concerned in the maintenance and repair
organisations of both countries for this achieve-
ment, which is the more outstanding when it is
remembered that the majority of the assault
ships and craft had to be used -continuously
during months of training before the operation.

Increasing Enemy Naval Activity.

23. Although the enemy were slow to react
to our much publicised invasion preparations
from the end of April onwards, enemy naval
activity in the Channel did increase. On 2gth
April in an engagement between two Canadian
destroyers, who were covering a minelaying
operation off Ile de Bas, and two Elbing class,
one of our destroyers and one of the enemy’s
were sunk. Throughout the month of May
enemy E-Boat activity in the Central Channel
increased, and it was apparent that more
E-Boats were being moved to Cherbourg and
Havre. Our destroyers and light coastal forces
operated by Commanders-in-Chief, Portsmouth
and Plymouth, were, however, able to keep
the er in chetk and to inflict casualties
on him.

24. The first enemy U-Boat was reported in
the Western Channel on 2oth May, which
“necessitated a change in the dispositions of our
covering forces. The Admiralty had some
weeks earlier announced their intention of
allotting four A/U Support Groups to Com-
mander-in-Chief, Plymouth, to operate in the
Western Channel and to co-operate with
Coastal Command in sealing this approach to
the ‘‘ Neptune’”’ convoy routes. The Air
Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Coastal Com-
mand, had similarly made new dispositions to
be effective some weeks before D day in antici-
pation of the movement of the U-Boat battle
to the Channel. Coastal Command threw
themselves into the preparations for ‘‘ Nep-
tune "’ with as much enthusiasm as any unit
in the Allied Expeditionary Force, and I
personally and the whole Naval Expeditionary
Force are deeply indebted to them for the
efficiency of the measures they adopted, which
was reflected by the very small scale of U-Boat
attack that eventuated.

a5. No weapon that the.enemy might have
employed before D day against our forces
caused me more anxiety than the potentialities
of minelaying. Mines were employed de-
fensively on a considerable scale in the Bay
of the Seine during the months prior to D day
and caused the naval plan largely to be framed
round the requirements for sweeping our forces
through the enemy’s minefields. In the six
weeks before D day the enemy also consider- ~
ably intensified his minelaying off the south
coast of England, using aircraft on a scale
which had not been attempted for over two
years and introducing two new types of mine.
This minelaying was confined to moonless
periods. Had D day been in such a period it
is doubtful ‘whether the Portsmouth channels
could have been cleared in time. “As it was,
no interruption was caused to the rehearsals
nor to the assembly of our forces and it is
considered that the enemy missed a great oppor-
tunity in not still further extending this form
of attack. That he did not attempt more was
yet another result of the air superiority we .
achieved before D day. Towards the end of
May some aircraft minelaying was combined
with night air bombing attacks on a light
scale on south coast ports, but very few casual-
ties were caused to ships and‘personnel,

D Day and H Hour, .

26. No single question was more often dis-
cussed during planning than that of H_ hour.
As H hour was linked to tidal conditions,
D day was dependent on it. Until obstructions
appeared on the assault beaches, the argument
was largely confined to the determination of
the ideal balance between a sufficiency of light
for.aimed air and naval bombardment and the
minimum daylight approach, taking into con-
sideration the number of days to which post-
ponement in the case of bad weather would be
acceptable in view of the different tidal con- -
ditions on later days. But as beach obstruc- ‘
tions in some numbers ‘were erected on ‘the
beaches, the need to deal with these dryshod,
and therefore to land below them, overcame
all previous arguments and H hour and D day

were finally largely determined by. the position
of these obstacles. i

27. As on the western (U.S.) beaches the
obstructions were known to be in place further
down the beach than on the eastern (British)
beaches and as in Force J’s sector near low
water there were some rocks which would be
a danger to the assault craft, it was finally
necessary to select five different H hours,
ranging over a period of one hour and twenty-
five minutes. Anxiety was felt on two counts,
first, that the earlier H hours in the U.S. Sector,
coupled with their requirements to arrive in
the transport area earlier relative to H hour-
than the British, might prejudice surprise in the
west before it was lost in the east, and second,
that so many H hours might confuse some or
many of ‘the ships and craft taking part. In
the event the lack of alertness of the enemy
-obviated the first and good briefing prevented
the second.

28. Owing to the need to take account of the
latest photographic reconnaissance showing the
exact positions of the obstacles, the final de-
cision as to D day and H hour was not made -
until 17th May. when 5th June was selected,
