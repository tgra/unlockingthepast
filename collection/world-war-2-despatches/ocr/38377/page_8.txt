Torpedo Bombing and High Level Bombing

Altack on Fleet, a.m, 23rd July (D.3).

30. The first group of enemy aircraft was
detected at ogro bearing 055°, 60 miles. This
developed into a well synchronistd torpedo
bomber and high level bombing attack which
commenced at 0942 and was completed in
approximately four minutes. Six torpedo planes
attacked from ahead and concentrated on the

convoy while eight high level bombers crossed -

from south to north dropping their bombs
amongst the convoy.

3x. The torpedo bombers approaching low
down from ahead were engaged with barrage
fire by the destroyer screen. This fire appeared
effective and on coming within range the enemy
split into two groups of three, one group alter-
ing course to port, the other to starboard, One
of the starboard group followed by one of the
port group attacked FEARLESS who was
stationed in the starboard bow position on the
screen. The remaining two aircraft of the port
group pressed home their attack on the port
bow of the convoy which took avoiding action.
There is no clear record of any torpedoes having
been dropped by the remaining two aircraft of
the starboard group, but MANCHESTER
observed two tracks from port and one from
starboard before a final torpedo approaching
from port hit her. .

Loss of FEARLESS.

32. The two aircraft which attacked FEAR-
LESS released their torpedoes from a height of
70 feet at a range of about i,500 and 800 yards
respectively. Avoiding action was taken and
the first torpedo passed about 90 yards ahead.
The torpedo from the second aircraft ran
shallow. Course was shaped to comb the
track but when abreast the stem on the port
side, at a distance of about 30 feet, the torpedo
broke surface, altered course to port, and hit
the ship abreast the 3-inch gun. \

33. Both engines were put out of action, the
rudder was jammed at hard-a-port, all electric
power failed due to the switchboard being
demolished and an extensive fuel fire was
started aft. One officer and 24 ratings were
killed outright or died later. FEARLESS
reported she was entirely disabled. As she
was badly on fire and I did not consider the
detachment of a second destroyer to attempt
towing was justified under the circumstances, I
ordered FORESTER to take off survivors and
then sink the ship. This was effected by one
torpedo at 1055.

Damage to, and Detachment

CHESTER.

34. Meanwhile, MANCHESTER,ewho was
to starboard of the convoy, sighted torpedoes
approaching and turned to port to comb the
tracks. Two torpedoes were seen to'pass down
the port side and another one passed astern
from ‘starboard. In order to avoid collision with
PORT CHALMERS a turn to starboard was
then commenced. At this time another aircraft
released a torpedo from a position between the
first and second M.T. ships of the port column.

Wheel was immediately reversed in an en-
deavour to avoid this torpedo, but it struck
MANCHESTER aft on the port side.

35. The immediate effects of the torpedo hit
were to cause a list of 12° to port with large
reduction of speed and steering gear out of
action. Steermg was changed over to the after
position and a reasonable degree of control was,
obtained. Subsequently the steering motors ’
failed and hand steering had to be used. The
explosion had travelled upwards through the
decks to the upper deck, driving large quan-
tities of oil fuel upwards into all the compart-
ments affected. Water and oil fuel flooded the
after engine room, after 4-inch magazine, main
W/T office, ‘XX ’ magazine and various other
compartments between 179 and 209 bulkheads.
Many ratings were overcome by fumes from the
oil fuel but most of these recovered after treat-
ment and were able to resume their duties.
Only the starboard outer shaft remained service-
able. A speed of 8 knots was at first obtained
which very gradually increased to 12 knots.
Emergency leads were run to the steering
motors and mechanical steering was again in
use by 1315. j

36. MANCHESTER’s initial signal informed
me that she could steam 8 knots so I ordered
her to return to Gibraltar escorted by AVON
VALE. Her casualties were 3 naval officers, 5
military officers, 20 naval ratings and 7 other
ranks killed, 3 naval ratings missing, and 1
military officer, 1 naval rating and 4 other ranks
wounded.

37. MANCHESTER had approximately 750
military personnel on board but as the sea was
calm I decided to limit her escort to one
destroyer in the hope that a single cruiser and
destroyer might either escape detection by
enemy aircraft or else avoid.attack in view of
the better targets offered by the convoy and its
escort.

High Level Bombing Attacks on Fleet, a.m.

23rd July (D.3).

38. The high level bombing attack carried
out simultaneously with the T/B* attack was
ineffective. The approach was made clear of
the sun, and the aircraft were heavily engaged
Fire appeared to be accurate
although no aircraft were seen to be hit. Bombs
fell harmlessly amongst the convoy.

39. At Torx a second wave of 5 high level
bombers (probably B.R.zos) approached from
north to south and dropped two groups of
bombs, the first of which fell clear of the screen
to port and the second close to SIKH and
FOXHOUND on the port bow of the screen.
This was rather a half-hearted attack and the
aircraft which were at a height of over 17,000
feet were not engaged by the fleet until after
the first bombs had fallen. The presence of
5 Fulmars 1,000 feet below and astern,
endeavouring to overtake the bombers, may
have induced them to get rid of their bomb
loads as soon as possible.

40. In the first high level attack, Fulmars
shot down two S.79s and two more probably
failed to return. Three T/B aircraft (S.79s)
were shot down by gunfire, AVON VALE
