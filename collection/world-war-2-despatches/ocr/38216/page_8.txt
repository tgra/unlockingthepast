63. As the result of this recorinaissance, ex-

:tensions to the grounds at Lho’nga and Sabang,

were put in. hand to make them suitable: for
modern aircraft. :

64. Assistance was also given to .B.O.A.C.
to organise facilities at Sabang for the opera-
tion of an alternative seaplane route Rangoon
—Port -Blair—Sabang instead of the normal

one via Bangkok.,

Java.

65. Visits were paid to Java by a number
of staff officers from A.H.Q. who thus gained
useful information. about Dutch maintenance
establishments and resources generally.

66. A memorandum was prepared about
June, 1941, and’ issued by A.H.Q. detailing
the bases to be developed in this area; their
status was defined and priority of provisioning
was laid down. By December, 1941, the posi-
tion was as follows:—

Andamans and Nicobars—at Port Blair
and Nancowrie, moorings and petrol had been
laid, and limited accommodation constructed
for operating flying boats. Port Blair was

-gencé. personnel and records in-the Far East
shad been centralised in the Combined Intelli-
-gence Bureau (F.E.C.B.) which functioned
under the control of C.-in-C. China Station.
- Theoretically it served, inter alia, the needs of

A.H.Q. In practice, however, its means for
obtaiming ‘air’ information throughout the Far
-East was totally inadequate; its staff was in-
sufficient to cope: fully even with G.H.Q. Air
Intelligence requirements; and although the in-
formation it possessed was always available
‘to A.H.Q., F.E.C.B. had not the means of
supplanting the missing intelligence machinery
at A.H.Q.

Representations .were therefore ‘made by
A.H.Q. of the need for a thorough intelligence
system throughout the Command. About
July, a conference was held with G.H.Q., who
wished to create a second Combined Intelligence
Centre to serve the joint needs of A.H.Q. and
H.Q.M.C. A second joint organisation of this
nature would not, however, have been suitable
for building up the Intelligence organisation
equine? one ea the Command at all levels
from A.H.Q. downwards. This view was
accepted.

An establishment for an Intelligence organi-
sation for the whole Command was drawn up
and submitted to the Air Ministry, and in late
autumn, in anticipation of approval, personnel
were made available locally and were appointed
to H.Q. and Units. The nucleus organisation
thus “formed was fortunately in being when
hostilities broke out, but its development was
backward, and in ‘particular the information it
had collated for briefing crews was scanty.

68. According to intelligence curtent in the
Command, thé efficiency of the Japanese Naval
Air Units was known to be good, but that of
their Army Air Units was not high despite the
fanatical valour of their personnel.

This wrong assessment of their Army Air
Units was partly due to the ‘fact that the system
for collecting intelligence throughout the Far
East was only sufficient to enable F.E.C.B. to
obtain incomplete air information, and the re-
liability of most of this was far from high.
And it was partly due to the fact that A.H.Q.,
stations and squadrons possessed only the em-
bryonic intelligence organisatiom already re-
ferred to: the result was that such intelligence
as the Command received, was not effectively
digested, promulgated or acted upon.

A particular outcome: of this state of affairs,
which was destined to havé far-reaching con:
sequences in Malaya, was thatthe personnel of
the Command reinained unawaré up to’the out-
break’ of war of the qualities of the Japanese
fighter ‘squadrons, whose Zero fighters were-to

‘ 69. The Air Ministry had’ “been unable to
approve requests made during thé year to estab-
lish an O-T.U.,in Malaya. But in September,
1941, owing to. the fact that large numbers of
personnel required operational training, A.H.Q.
