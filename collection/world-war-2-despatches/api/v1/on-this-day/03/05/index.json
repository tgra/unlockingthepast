Mopping up in the thick mountainous jungle was a difficult and necessarily slow operation, and it was not until the 5th March that we were able to resume the interrupted course of our offensive. Razabil was captured by 5 Indian Division on the 12th March. It was found to be a position of great strength, complete with underground rooms, etc. The Tunnels position was surrounded by the 19th March, and was finally captured by 36 British Division some days later. Meanwhile, 7 Indian Division had taken Buthidaung and had also captured the outer ring of the Kyaukit defences. These defences were evacuated by the enemy on the 23rd March and considerable equipment fell into our hands. On the 25th, about 500 enemy again infiltrated to the Negakyedauk area, but were dealt with expeditiously."

The system of giving   escort  ,  protection   or   cover  to convoys, according to circumstances, remained in force, but I arranged that   escort   should be given more generously than hitherto in specially dangerous areas, and that, where attacks were likely to be made without warning, fighters giving   protection   should be kept airborne while the risk continued."

On the same day the New Zealand Division, which had secretly and swiftly been brought forward from Tripoh, concentrated in the area south of Medenine. On the 3rd a local attack by Italian troops on the Mareth front, which cost them severe casualties, was also probably designed to distract our attention from the west but the signs there were too strong: all that day and the next heavy movement continued in the mountains, at Toujane, Cheguimi and Ksar el Hallouf. The enemy rested all day of 5th March and on the 6th poured down from the mountains to the attack. As the Panzer Grenadiers moved off on the evening of the 5th down the steep, winding road from Ksar el Hallouf they defiled past the Army Group Commander, standing in his open car at the top of the pass. According to an eye witness on the spot Rommel was obviously a sick man, with a dirty bandage round his neck where he was suffering from desert sores; to a party who stopped near him he said that unless they won this battle the last hope in Africa was gone."

Commander 12th (A) Division anticipated that if Bardera was occupied he could capture it by 2nd March and Iscia Baidoa by 5th March. To assist in the capture of Bardera and subsequently to garrison that place it was arranged that one battalion of 21st E.A. Brigade from Wajir should move there direct. Considerable apprehension was felt at the time about troops  getting caught by the rains in Bardera and Iscia Baidoa with insufficient supplies. The same day a report was received that a patrol of the 24th G.C. Brigade had entered Bardera which was found to be unoccupied. Reports were also received that Iscia Baidoa and Dinsor had already been evacuated as a result of a message from the Duce ordering the evacuation of Italian Somaliland for Abyssinia. This was confirmed by patrols which occupied Iscia Baidoa on 27th February and captured 200 native troops and large quantities of ammunition, supplies and petrol."

Hurricane Effort Consequently _ the maximum number of Hurricanes reached in action with the enemy was about 30 Hurricanes, i.e, the equivalent of 2 instead of 4 Squadrons. This strength, moreover, fell away rapidly due to lack of reinforcing aircraft, proper operational facilities and absence of spares, and was on 11th February 15 serviceable Hurricanes, and on 5th March only 6."

The forces which Kimura concentrated to recover Meiktila were as follows: 18 Japanese Division (less 114 Regiment), brought south from the Northern Combat Area Command's front: 119 Regiment (53 Japanese Division), from south of Mandalay ; 214 Regiment (33 Japanese Division) from the Irrawaddy front, opposite Pakokku; and 49 Japanese Division (less 153 Regiment) which had been hurried north from Pegu. These forces were reinforced by Army Troops, including medium artillery and some tanks. It was a formidable concentration and it was being rapidly effected. Our forces in Meiktila comprised 17 Indian Division and one tank brigade. The only reinforcement available was 5 Indian Division, which moved forward from Jorhat (700 miles distant) on the 5th March. Its forward concentration was carried out with great speed and the whole Division (less its air-transportable brigade) had reached 7 Indian Division's bridgehead at Nyaungu 10 days later. The fly-in of the remaining brigade from Palel to Meiktila was completed on the 17th March, but I will refer to this again. It will be seen, therefore, that the enemy was concentrating the equivalent of six brigades, plus Army units, against our four infantry brigades and one tank brigade. There was nothing perturbing about this, but it must be remembered that our communications were vulnerable ; our forward airfields were exposed to attack, as, also, was the road back via Taungtha, while the road west, via Kyaukpadaung, was of course still"
