The Littorio Division had been practically
destroyed and few of the Trieste escaped.

The action around Ghazal on 4th November
ended the battle of El] Alamein. Rather less
than a third of the original Axis force suc-
ceeded in making good its escape. We esti-
mated enemy casualties as ten thousand
killed and fifteen thousand wounded; over
thirty thousand prisoners were taken, ten
thousand of them Germans, and nine Generals
were included m the bag. Of six hundred
enemy tanks four hundred and fifty were left
on the battlefield. Over a thousand pieces of
artillery were destroyed or captured. Large
quantities of ammunition, stores and equipment
of all natures fell into our hands intact in the
early stages of the pursuit. The hostile force
with which we now had to reckon amounted
to little more than one composite division. 90
Light Division, upon whom fell the burden of
covering the retreat, had been reduced to about
a strong regimental group. The survivors of
164 Division equalled about another regimen-
tal group. Of the hundred and fifty tanks re-
maining about seventy belonged to the Ariete
Division and shortly fell out along the road.
The remnants of 15 and 21 Panzer Divisions,
mustering some eighty tanks between them,
formed the armoured component of the force.
In reserve there were the Pistoia Division on the
frontier and 80 Spezia Division which had re-
cently arrived in Tripolitania, both as yet
umtried.

Our own casualties were not unduly severe—
thirteen thousand five hundred killed,
wounded and missing, or just under eight per
cent. of the force engaged. A hundred guns
had been destroyed and, although more than
five hundred tanks were disabled in the battle,
only a hundred and fifty were found to be
beyond repair. It is fitting at this point to
mention that it was very largely the high effi-
ciency of the repair and recovery organization
which enabled us to retain our superiority in
armour throughout the fighting. In ro Corps
alone, of five hundred and thirty tanks received
in workshops, three hundred and thirty seven
were put in service again during the eleven
days the battle lasted.

Our casualties were a negligible factor as far
as the pursuit was concerned; on 4th November
the Eighth Army could put into the field very
nearly six hundred tanks against eighty Ger-
man. The main problem was, not to find
forces strong enough to defeat the fleeing
enemy, but to arrange that the pursuit should

in the early stages of the pursuit, though pre-
parations had, of course, been made to repair it
as fast as possible. For the leading troops road
transport was the only means of supply. Even
the road was not entirely reliable, since there
were many places, such as the escarpment pass
at Sollum, where it could easily be demolished,
necessitating a long detour. Motor transport,
though a great deal more plentiful than in
earlier campaigns, was still inadequate to
supply the whole of ro Corps beyond Matruh
and a pause would be necessary before we could .
advance across the frontier. The overnding
consideration of the next phase of the offensive,
therefore was to cut off and destroy as much
as possible of what remained of the enemy
before they could withdraw beyond our reach.

The battle of E] Alamein had been a stand-up
fight, lasting for eleven days but skilful leader-
ship and the tenacity of the fighting soldiers
and airmen won the day and with it the first
great victory for the Allies. It proved to be
the turmng point of the war. This great
battl® was the fore-runner of a series of vic-
tories which never ceased until the enemy were
finally cleared from the African continent and
it had been decisively won four days before
the Anglo-American [Expeditionary Force
under General Eisenhower landed in French
North Africa. The world knew that the Axis
had suffered a major disaster and there is no
doubt that this knowledge, by its influence on
French and Spanish opinion, was of vital
importance in assisting General Eisenhower’s
mission.

The Pursust to Agheila.

The enemy withdrew from his delaying
positions south of Ghazal during the night of
4th November and on the 5th the pursuit
proper began. xo Corps commanded the
pursuit force with 1 and 10 Armoured Divisions
directed on Daba and 7 Armoured Division
directed on Fuka. The New Zealand Division,
which had some difficulty in extricating itself
from the confusion of the battlefield, also
moved off at dawn on its way to Fuka, passing
from 30 to 10 Corps; it had 4 Light Armoured
Brigade under command. The importance of
Fuka lay in the fact that the road here passes
up a three hundred foot escarpment which is
almost impassable except on the axis of the
road and railway. If we could get there across
the desert quicker than the enemy could along
the road we should be able to cut off a good
deal of his rearguard. 30 Corps, with 51 and
9 Australian Divisions, was held in reserve and
ordered to clear up the coastal area; the task
of clearing the main battlefield was entrusted
to 13 Corps.

The first stage of the pursuit went well. By
midday on 5th November 1 Armoured Division
had taken Daba and was ordered to strike
across the desert to cut the road west of Mersa
Matruh. At the same time 10 Armoured Divi-
sion fought a sharp but short engagement with
a German armoured rearguard at Galal,
between Daba and Fuka, in which it destroyed
or captured forty-four of the enemy’s remaining
eighty tanks. After this success the division
was ordered to press down the main road to
Fuka. The enemy rearguard attempted to hold
the Fuka escarpment and the New Zealand
Division was momentarily held up there south
of the road; but 4 Light Armoured Brigade
