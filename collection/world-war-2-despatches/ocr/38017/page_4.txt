embarkation staff or organisation a strong naval
party was required to form up and embark the
troops. Later, no difficulty was experienced
when troops of fighting formations were en-
countered. Difficulty was experienced in con+
trolling some French troops, whilst others were
so rigidly bound, by discipline and tradition that
they would not embark except by complete
“ormation under their own unit officers. In
either case the rate of embarkation was much
slower than with British troops.

12, INITIATIVE SHOWN BY COMMANDING
OFFICERS AND SUBORDINATE PERSONNEL.

A most satisfactory feature of the operation
was the high degree of imitiative shown by
Commanding and Subordinate Officers of units
operating off the coast, ranging from H.M.
Destroyers to commandeered motor boats. The
majority of officers and ratings in command
were in situations requiring independent action
in extremely difficult conditions. Often the
easiest course was to be satisfied with work
already achieved and to return to the United
Kingdom with a fimal load of troops. The
reverse action was invariably executed, namely,
continued operation off the coast as long as
there were both troops ashore to be evacuated
and vessels offshore to receive them. If the
craft in use was damaged or sunk the crew in-
variably seized some other boat to continue
their efforts.

Unaware of the military situation ashore and
often forced to move westward by bombard-
ment from German artillery or even by rifle
fire from advancing German forces, the majority
of these boats, commanded often by stokers or
“* hostility only ’’ seamen, had only one object
in view, to lift from the beach any, and all
troops, British or Allied, within sight of the
water’s edge.

On their return to the United Kingdom when
asked to report their proceedings it was only
in answer to direct enquiry that it would trans-
pire that these young men had been subjected
in many cases, to an unparalleled bombard-
ment from the air. They appeared to consider
that this was part of the day’s work requiring
no comment.

13. Losses OF TROOPS AFTER EMBARKATION.

It is a distressing fact that many ships were
sunk or damaged on the return voyage when
Jaden with troops. But it is fortunate that in
most of such cases the majority of troops were
saved owing to the large volume of traffic that
was coming and going between Dunkirk and
the United Kingdom. Exceptions to this were
due to the rapidity with which certain ships
sank after having been bombed or torpedoed.
Such cases are as follows: —

WAKEFUL. Torpedoed. Ship broke in
half and only those on the upper deck were
saved. About 600 troops were below.

CRESTED EAGLE. Was bombed and
then beached in a burning condition. Only
about 300 saved out of 600 on board.

SKIPJACK. 250-300 troops on board,
most of whom, unfortunately, went down
with the ship when she sank.

WAVERLEY. 600 troops were on board
before ship was abandoned in sinking condi-
tion, but only 200-300 were picked up.

In all it is regretted that about 2,000 troops
must have been lost through these and similar
disasters on the return voyages to England.

SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 17 JULY, 10947

14. CO-OPERATION OF THE FRENCH Navy.

French warships and other vessels were
employed evacuating French troops from
Dunkirk Harbour, and on the last three nights
from the beach 1} miles eastward from Dunkirk.
Details are given in Appendix IV.

15. Base ORGANISATION.

An operation of this magnitude involving the
Maintenance and movements of close on goo
vessels and boats could not have been conducted
without the wholehearted and unceasing efforts
of the base establishments at Dover and
Ramsgate, as well as those at Sheerness and
Harwich in the Nore Command. At all these
places officers and men, Naval and civilian,
laboured unceasingly throughout the Operation.

In particular I wish to acknowledge the great
assistance received from the Commander-in-
Chief, Nore, Admiral the Hon. Sir Reginald
A. RR. Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, K.C.B.,
D.S.O., who in many cases anticipated my re-
quests for assistance through his constant watch
on the progress of the Operation.

The prompt and unfailing assistance afforded
by the Chatham Depot in providing personnel
for the numerous small craft, working parties
and beach parties, was a feature essential to the
successful outcome of the Operation.

The Naval Officer-in-Charge, Ramsgate,
Captain W. R. Phillimore, R.N., by taking
over the servicing and control of the great
majority of the small craft of the inshore
flotillas relieved Dover of an immense volume
of work which it would otherwise have been
impossible to handle.

It was also brought to my notice that at
Harwich an exceptional Naval and Military

tem was in being for assisting those ships
which called there to make a quick turn round,
relieving the tired ships’ companies of the work
of cleaning and clearing their vessels.

16. SERVICES OF STAFF, INCLUDING OFFICERS
TEMPORARILY APPOINTED.

I was fortunate in having the services of
Rear Admiral W. F. Wake-Walker, C.B.,
O.B.E., as Flag Officer afloat off Dunkirk, and
Captain W. G. Tennant, C.B., M.V.O., as
Senior Naval Officer, Dunkirk on shore.
Admiral Wake-Walker was responsible for
supervising the embarkation afloat and Captain
Tennant for organising embarkation from the
shore, keeping touch with the French Naval
Authorities and the staff of the British
Commander-in-Chief.

I cannot conclude this despatch without
reference to the splendid work of my staff under
the guidance of my Chief Staff Officer, Captain
L. V. Morgan, C.B.E., M.V.O., D.S.C.

Augmented by additional officers, including
both Army and Royal Air Force, especially
appointed for the occasion, their task of
organising and operating the large and varied
collection of H.M. Ships continued without a
pause day and night throughout the 10 days
that the Operation lasted, and I can never
testify adequately to the excellence of their
work, upon the efficiency of which successful
results depended.

Finally I would like to pay tribute to the
valuable support and assistance which I received
throughout the whole course of the evacuation
from Vice Admiral Sir James Somerville,
K.C.B., D.S.0., who was appointed to H.M.S.
LYNX for special service in connection with
