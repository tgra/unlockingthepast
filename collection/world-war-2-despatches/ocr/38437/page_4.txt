Chiefs of Staff as to when the attacks were
likely to begin were also modified from time to
time, as our bombing offensive against the
“* ski sites ’’ got under way.

21. In devising measures to deal with pilot-
jess aircraft, my staff and I worked in close
touch with General Sir Frederick A. Pile, Bart.,
G.C.B., D.S.O., M.C., General Officer Com-
manding, Anti-Aircraft Command, and_ his
staff, who helped in the preparation of all
detailed plang which involved guns and search-
lights as well as fighters.

22. It was clear at the outset that to pre-
pare a detailed plan of defence would take
several weeks. I therefore decided to submit
a preliminary outline plan. I took as my
point of departure the fundamental proposi-
tion that a pilotless aircraft was still an aircraft,
and therefore vulnerable to the same basic
methods of attack. Of course, as there was
no crew, such an aircraft could not be made
to crash by killing the pilot; on the other hand,
it would be incapable of retreat or evasion,
except, perhaps, to a very limited extent.*
Nevertheless, if the missile should prove in
practice as fast as was believed at first, the
performance of the fighters on which we nor-
Mmally relied would be inadequate.

23. However, on balance, and considering
the uncertainty of our knowledge, it would
clearly have been unjustifiable to exclude any
of the normal methods of defence which we
were accustomed to use against piloted air-
craft. Accordingly, I recommended in my out-
line plan, which I submitted to the Air Com-
mander-in-Chief on the 16th December, that
aircraft, guns, searchlights, and balloons all
be deployed against pilotless aircraft in such
a manner as to avoid causing mutual inter-
ference. I pointed out, however, that the mis-
siles might well prove too fast for our fighters,
and in any case would make difficult targets
for A.A. gunners, I recommended, therefore,
that the bombing offensive against the instal-
lations in France be continued with the utmost
vigour. I also asked to be kept informed of
the progress made by two committees which
had been set up at the Air Ministry to investi-
gate the possibility of radio and electro-mag-
netic counter-measures. t

24. During the second half of December
General Pile and I completed our detailed plan
on these lines, On the 2nd January I sub-
mitted the plan to the Air Commander-in-Chief,
who approved it and submitted it in turn to
higher authority. Meanwhile, the Allied bom-
‘ber offensive against the ‘‘ski sites’’ was
achieving good results and the likelihood of
imminent attack seemed to be receding. On
22nd January the Chiefs of Staff came to the
conclusion that the date by which we must
be ready for attacks by pilotless aircraft to
begin could safely be put back until the Ist

* At that time we believed that the missile could
be made to tum in the air. In point of fact this
effect was limited to the first few moments of flight,
during which it had to be directed on to its calculated
course by an adjustment of the automatic control
mechanism made beforehand.

+ Later it was established that the missiles were
not controlled by radio. To divert them by means
of an electro-magnetic field was theoretically possible,
but would have needed so much copper and electric
power that it was quite impracticable. Thus neither
investigation produced any positive result.

March; later they postponed it still further,
until the middle of the month. Since intensive
preparations for the European operations were
due to begin on the xst April, we were thus
faced with the possibility that the first use of
pilotless aircraft by the Germans might coin-
cide with these preparations; or even with the
assault itself,

25. Hence, by the time the Chiefs of Staff
came to examine the detailed plan it had been
overtaken by events. Circumstances now called
for a modified plan which would provide simul-
taneously for defence against pilotless aircraft
and the needs of the offensive. Early in
February the Chiefs of Staff asked that such
a plan should be prepared. In the meantime,
General Pile and I received authority to pro-
ceed with the administrative arrangements
which would have to be made before any
deployment on the lines laid down in the exist-
ing plan could be ordered.

i .

26. ing the next few weeks, therefore, we
overhauled our plan and devised a modified
version of it which aimed at meeting the threat
from pilotless aircraft mainly with resources
not directly required for the European opera-
tions. We called this modified version the
“ Concurrent Air Defence Plan for ‘ Overlord’
and ‘ Diver’ ’’, or, more briefly, the ‘‘ ‘ Over-
lord ’’/‘ Diver’ Plan ’’*. I submitted it to the
Air Commander-in-Chief towards the end of
February. After receiving his approval, it was
approved in turn by the Supreme Commander
and the Chiefs of Staff. On ath March I gave
instructions for copies of the plan to be sent
to the Commands and Groups which would be
directly concerned if it were ever put into effect.

27. With minor amendments, this was the
plan on which we acted three months later,
when the attacks began. Some account of it,
and of ‘its relationship to the earlier detailed
plan out of which it grew, must therefore be
given at this stage. Such an account may pro-
vide, perhaps, an insight into the conditions
in which a major defensive operation of this
kind has to be contrived. For in such cases a
Commander must not only take into account a
number of factors, political as well as military
and logistic, which are governed by the cap-
abilities of his own side; he must also reckon,
first and last and all the time, with what the
enemy may have up his sleeve.

28. Both the ‘‘ Overlord/Diver ’’ Plan and
the earlier plan were based on the fundamental
principles postulated for the first outline plan
of the x6th December. But some of the
assumptions which had been made when the
original outline and detailed plans were made
were modified by altered circumstances or fresh
intelligence by the time the second plan was
made, For example, as I have already pointed
out, estimates of the performance of the weapon
which we had to counter differed from time to
time. Again, as the bombing offensive against
the ‘‘ ski sites ’’ began to achieve its purpose,
the Air Ministry revised their estimates of the
probable scale of attack. But the broad con-
cepts which determined the general nature of
our defensive measures remained substantially
unchanged.

* “ Overlord ” was the code-name for the European
operations and “‘ Diver” that for pilotless aircraft.
