SUPPLEMENT to tae LONDON GAZETTE: 36 FEBRUARY, 1348

New: Zealand: direét “froin Servicé Flying
Training’ Schools, and who’ theréfore lacked
operational training,

(2) To convert’ pérsonnel 6f No. 36 and
No. 100 (T.B.) Squadrons from Vildebeestes
to twin-engine aircraft in anticipation of their
re-equipment with Beauforts.

(c) To train pilots from New Zéaland on
“twin-engine aircraft to fill vacancies in
“Bomber Squadrons.

Training aircraft were provided. from
Wirraways thrown up by No. 2x (F) Squadron
when it ‘re-armed with Buffaloes, and by Blen-
heims ‘borrowed from No. 34 (B) Squadron.
The Wing Commander Training at A.H.Q.
(Wing Commander Wills-Sandford) . was
appointed Commanding Officer. The Unit had
to be disbanded on 8th December, on the out-
break of hostilities, but it had completed most
valuable work.

Lack of Armament Training Facilities, °

70. Up till October 1941, the only arma-
ment training facilities in the Command were
on Singapore Island, and at an improvised air
range near Penang. Maximum use was made
of the Singapore ranges, but they were very
insufficient to meet requirements. In October
1941, the new Command Armament Training
Station at Kuantan was opened, but there was
time for one squadron only to comple) a
coursé before ‘the outbreak of war.

qi. The air firing situation was * particularly
unsatisfactory. There was an acute shortage
of target towing aircraft, and the few available
were slow. ». an

Lack of Transport and Communication Aircraft.

72. The lack of transport and communication
aircraft was acutely felt during the pre-war
period when training’ was all important. G.H.Q.
and “H.Q:M.C, had, frequently to ask for com-
munication flights, aircraft’ for,, which had
necessarily ‘to be found, mainly by G.R.
Squadrons. Although such requests were
pruned- and co-ordinated, flights were never-
theless sufficiently frequent to interfere seriously
with the training of squadrons, many of whose
Vital flying ‘hours were thus expended. Further-
more, visits to subérdinate units by AHO:
staff had to be consspendingly curtailed,

F ighter Squadrons,

73. In’ June-July r94t a Fighter, Bron
Operational Cadre was formed to take-over
the training and operation of all fighter ‘air-
craft in Singapore: the Senior Officer (Group
Captain E.. B. Rice) at the same time being
appointed Air Defence Co-ordinator, Malaya. ,

- 94. The following -Fighter Squadrons, with
ah establishment “of -16 LE. and 8 IR.
Buffaloes, were formed on thé dates shown:—

“No. 243 ‘(®) a formed in April, :
194I. Personnel were found as in the case of
No. 67 Squadron, but a slightly higher pro-
portion were F.T.S. personnel,

No. 453 (F) Squadron, formed October

1941. The Squadron and two Flight Com-
manders were appointed from U.K. This was
an R.A.F. ‘‘ infiltration ’’ squadron* filled
from F.T.S’s in Australia. Some of the
personnel were not entirely suitable for a
Fighter Squadron, and the Squadron’ Com-
mander was in Australia selecting replace-
ments when war broke out.
_ No! 488 (F) Squadron, formed in October-
November 1941. The Squadron and two
Flight Commanders came from U.K. This
was-an R.N.Z.A.F. infiltration squadron and
was filled from F.T.S’s in New Zealand with
excellent material; but their standard of fly-
ing on arrival was backward. This squadron
had taken over the aircraft on which No.
67 (F) Squadron had trained, and many of
these were in poor condition.

No. 21 (F) Squadron, R.A.A.F., which
had formed as a General Purpose Squadron
in Australia and moved into the Command
in 1940, was in October 1941 re-equipped
with Buffaloes and converted into a Fighter
~ Squadron, with 12 I.E. and 6 LR. aircraft.
The Squadron had been ‘previously equipped
with 2-seater  Wirraways, some of which were
“returned to Australia, the remainder’ being
retained to assist in training Nos. 453 (F)
and 488 (F) Squadrons. ‘It will be observed,
therefore, that the pilots of this squadron
had not been selected originally for- fighter
aircraft, and some were not in fact entirely
“suitable for this roe. 2. *

75. The main role ‘of the Buffalo Squadrons
was “day defence’ only,. primarily of the
Singapore area, but night flying training was
instituted to ensure that pilots could, take off
before dawn and Jand after nightfall. ;

76. Except for No. 488 (F} Squadron all
the above squadrons were considered operation-
ally tramed.by the outbreak of war. No.
488 (F) Squadron was deficient in squadron
and flight training and was not passed as opera-
tionally ready until the latter-half of December
I94I. Training and assessment. of operational
readiness had, however, been- based on an
under-estiniation of the eriemy. The tactics thus
taught and practised provéd -unsuitablé and
costly, against the Japanege- Navy “ow
fighter, .which was greatly superior ‘to the
Buffalo. performance. Moréover, ..advanced
training hdd suffered because, prior, to the
formation of an O.T.U in’ September . 1941
(seé. para. 69), alk pilots had joined. 'their
squadrons ‘without having received individual

operational training. ut _- <3
