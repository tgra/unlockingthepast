the beaches without doing serious damage and
in Jess than an hour-and-a-half was virtually
neutralised by the Dutch gunboats SOEMBA
and FLORES.

At 0615 the slow assault convoy arrived at
the release position and a searching sweep by
M.MSS. (L.L.)* and fleet sweepers having re-
vealed no mines, at 0640 all ships were ordered
to the anchorage. It was reached by the lead-
ing ships about 0740. The ferry service then
started and all personnel were ashore by noon
with army baggage and light stores soon after.

By 1400 S.N.O.L. (N) had transferred to
H.M.S. ALYNBANK, and H.M.S. KEREN
and the personnel ships sailed for Malta.

The marking submarine was in the correct
position and no difficulty was experienced in
picking up her transmissions and the screened
signal lamp. Swell caused some difficulty in
embarking troops in L.C.I. (L), and wind and
sea made some formations late in getting under
way. . :

The assault waves touched down up to thirty
minutes late, but with one exception the cor-
réct beaches were all found. ~

Although the wind had considerably de-
creased the big ships were quickly set down to
leeward: ie. the south-eastward: and the
follow-up flights had considerably more than
the planned distance to cover.

There was little organised resistance to the
landings and after a short period of heavy
machine-gun fire the defenders withdrew. A
few casualties were caused by mines on one
beach before it was cleared. Success signals
were received from all beaches by 0500 and
ships were then ordered to close the shore
without waiting for the anchorage to be swept
for mines.

From first light onwards there was consider-
able shelling from batteries inshore, but these
were silenced by supporting destroyers and
gunboats by 0800.

The arrival of L.C.T. with supporting arms
was rather disorganised, and none beached be-
fore daylight. Two of the beaches at Acip
NorTH intended for use by L.C.T. were found
to be composed of large boulders instead of
the shingle indicated by the air photographs,
a fact which did not make easier the task of
beaching the craft and discharging them. The
slow assault convoy arrived an hour-and-a-half
Jate, but all had taken up their anchor berths
by 0700.

The first large personnel ship completed dis-
charging by 0900 and all, with one exception,
had disembarked personnel and baggage and
hoisted their craft by 1415. With four-ex-
cepaous they were on passage to Malta at

The rate of discharge of L.C.T. was slow,
but the unloading of the slow convoy pro-
ceeded satisfactorily in spite of being unable
to discharge L.S.T. and L.C.T. at most of the
beaches without pontoon bridging and difficul-
ties with wheeled vehicles due to heavy shingle
and soft sand.

Gun Support. teat

The following details of gun support are
available : —

A. Bark WEST.

Since the assaults met little opposition, fire
from the destroyers in support was confined to
a few rounds only and L.C.S. were able to
furnish all the support needed on the beaches.

Between 0415 and 0542, when the battery
was silenced, H.M.S. BL. 'Y at a range
of 6,000 yards fired 80 rounds at P.4 battery in
Rocer sector. At 0740 another 37 rounds
were fired at the same battery, fire ceasing:
when our troops were seen in the vicinity. -

H.M.S. ROBERTS carried out three shoo!
in the course of the day: : ;
(i) at 0510, Impromptu from anchor at a
range of 15,000 yards against the Casa’
Guiliano battery of five 149 mm. guns which
had fired about a dozen rounds haphazard
at landing craft without scoring a hit. After:
ten rounds from H.M.S§. ROBERTS the
battery was silenced. , :

Gi) 0540, another four rounds from 15,000
yards for the second time silenced the same’
battery which had again opened ineffective
fire at craft on and close to the beach.

Gii) 1556, at the request of the army, four::
teen rounds were fired at the southern out-
skirts of Spaccaforno and the area was
Sewell to be well covered by the fall of,

ot.

H.M.S. BRISSENDEN also carried out
several shoots:

@ at 0645, at a‘range of 3,800 yards, six
smoke shell to thicken the screen laid by
L.C.S. on Sucar Rep beach. Result was
good. .

Gi) 1550 to 1600 at anchor, range 11,000
yards, with H.M.S. ROBERTS, at southern
outskirts of Spaccaforno, 90 rounds in salvos
seen to be spread with effect over the area.

(iii) 1825, on call from Forward Observa-
tion Officer 84 rounds fired at infantry at
Casa Basile. Result very effective.

H.M.S. PUCKERIDGE.

(@ 0515, fire opened impromptu at flashes
from four guns of 149 mm. of the Casa
Chiusa battery which were firing irregularly
and without success at landing craft. From
anchor, range 9,200-8,800 yards, eight
rounds. Result—battery ceased fire and was
captured by troops soon after. .

Gi) 0532, at gun flashes from Casa
-Guiliano battery when it opened fire again
after H.M.S. ROBERTS?’ first shoot. Range
8,000 yards, eight rounds. Result—shot seen -
o fall in target area, and battery ceased

Gii) 0600, the last mentioned battery again
opened fire and HM.S. PUCKERIDGE
was ordered in to eliminate it. At ranges
6,000-4,200 yards, twenty rounds were fired
under way and the battery which had con-
‘stituted almost the only opposition to the
‘landing was finally silenced. ,
Three of the four L.C.G. (L) in Force “V”

engaged direct targets during the assault, and

fired ten rounds H-E. full charge each. An~

ammunition dump was blown up by L.C.G. (L)

9 with her seventh round at 500 yards range.
