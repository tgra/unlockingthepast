SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 29 MAY, 1046

they were covered by 1 K.O.Y.L.I. in position
South of Dombis.

Demolitions at Rost& and Dovre were blown
after the rear parties had crossed the bridges.

49. The breakaway was clean, and the fact
that the enemy made no immediate attempt to
follow it up was undoubtedly due to the
reverse he had suffered during the afternoon.

The value of the Norwegian Ski Troops
operating on the flanks should be mentioned.
They were the only means of flank protection,
and were of great value in guarding against
surprise,

During the night 28th/29th April, many
Norwegian troops were withdrawn from the
Lines of Communication and there was a possi-
bility of having no troops between Domb&s
and the base at Andalsnes, some 60 miles
away.

_The obvious danger was that enemy para-
chute detachments might land on the Lines
of Communication. Brigadier Morgan’s force
was therefore disposed in detachments at Lesja,
Lesjaverk, Lesjaskog and Verma, with a5
much transport for each detachment as he
could raise.

50. During the night 28th/2gth April,
General Paget’s headquarters moved to
Botheim. An early reconnaissance made of
the Domb&s position disclosed that the
K.O.Y.L.I, was well established there, with the
Green Howards and Y. and L, just assembling
in the woods after their train withdrawal.

During the morning, General Ruge pointed
out that he could not withdraw his Foldal de-
tachment until the night 2oth/3oth April.
There could thus be no question of the with-
drawal of British troops from Domb&s until
night 30th April/tst May. This meant the
enemy had 48 hours to follow up from Otta,
and that another battle might have to be
fought on the Domb&s position. General Ruge
offered the support of a Norwegian Field Bat-
tery of four guns, which was gratefully
accepted. These guns were later to prove
most useful.

The enemy was very active all day in the
air, bombing and machine gunning all move-
ment on the Lines of Communication. It was
the habit of his bombers to fly direct to their
objective, drop their bombs at the most con-
venient height, and then on their way home
to carry out low fiying machine gun attacks on
the road traffic.

51. About noon Lieut. Colonel Clarke
arrived from England to say that shipping
would be available as follows:—

Night 2gth/30th April for 1,000-1,500
personnel.

Night 30th April/rst May for 2,200 per-
sonnel.

Night 1st/and May for the remainder if
necessary.

The plan made as a result of this was to
withdraw 1 Y. and L. from Dombas and send
them with Base Details on the night 29th/ 30th
April.

On night 30th April/Ist May:—

(a) 15th Infantry Brigade and all troops
(less r Y. and L.) would withdraw from
present positions through the Royal Marines
(covering Andalsnes) and embark.

Details RE. & R.A.
This plan was communicated to Norwegian

G.H.Q. and the necessary details arranged.
During night 2gth/3oth April the Norwegian

detachments at Hjerkinn and Foldal withdrew

through the British force at Domb&s. These

were the last Norwegian troops in the area for

the covering of whose withdrawal General Paget

was responsible.

52. The train conveying the Y. and L. to
Andalsnes on the night 2oth/3oth April only
reached Lesjaskog, owing to a break in the
line. There was no train available to take
them on from the other side of the break to
Andalsnes, so they marched on.

Enemy reconnaissance aircraft and bombers
were active, but no other special incident
occurred during the day until 1530 hours when
x5th Infantry Brigade reported that the enemy
could be seen advancing up the valley from
Dovre. The early reports were conflicting, one
mentioned four battalions, another parachute
troops, a third transport. The force was pro-
bably the usual reconnaissance detachment,
possibly reinforced by machine gun and mortar
detachments landed by parachutes. This con-
tact, though not unexpected, was undesirably
early. There were some five to six hours of
daylight left amd it seemed possible for the
enemy to stage an attack on the K.O.Y.L.I.
fom which it might be difficult to extricate

em.

53- The K.O.Y.L.I. were extremely well
hidden; it is probable that the Germans were
surprised to find them there at all, and they
must have been even more surprised when the
Norwegian guns opened fire on their forward
positions. Lieutenant-Colonel Cass command-
ing r K.O.Y.L.I. had made a very wise deci-
sion earlier in the day to withdraw his right
company across the river, as the water level
had risen considerably, making the river un-
fordable for the withdrawal. When later the
Germans made contact, they were forced to use
rubber boats to attempt the crossing. These
were all destroyed and their crews knocked out.

The enemy’s forward troops were supported
by a close reconnaissance aircraft, which
