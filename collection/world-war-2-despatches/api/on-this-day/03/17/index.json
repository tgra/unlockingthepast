On 1gth March the New Zealand Corps, with twenty-seven thousand men and two hundred tanks, started on ils flanking move from south of Foum Tatahouine and by nightfall on 2oth March was only a few miles short of the gap between Gebel Tebaga and Gebel Melab; General Montgomery had decided not to attempt concealment, in the hope of drawing enemy attention from 30 Corps  attack, This was scheduled for the night of the zoth. Enemy dispositions at that time were as"

            "description": "As the enemy withdrew deeper into Gojjam his forces naturally increased and the British and Ethiopian.regular forces diminished, since it was necessary, if only for the protection of valuable stores, to garrison positions such as Emanuel and Dambacha, to reform 2 Ethiopian Battalion, and to protect the L. of C. used by the few lorries captured at Burye, on which supply now depended. At Debra Markos the disparity of the forces opposed had reached something fantastic; 12,000 Italians and Colonial troops were contained by two companies of the Frontier Battalion, supported by the mortar platoon (four mortars) of 2 Ethiopian Battalion, totalling 300 men. The enemy's illusions as to our regular strength were at last beginning to be dispelled; Natale was disgraced by General Nasi and replaced by Colonel Maraventano, and the enemy broke back on 17th March and re-occupied Fort Emanuel with some 1,500 troops."

Shortly after midday, orders were issued for the advance to be resumed during the night xr6th/17th March. 5th Indian Division was to start from the Fort at approximately 2200 hours. Unavoidable delays, caused by difficulties of communications, the delay in making a mule track up to the Fort, and unexpectedly serious casualties in the administrative staff of I Worcestets, compelled zero hour to be postponed until 0030 hours 17th March. This delay, though unavoidable, caused great anxiety, as it was expected that the thrust by 5th Indian Division would relieve the severe pressure on the tired and much reduced battalions nf 11th Indian Infantry Brigade."
