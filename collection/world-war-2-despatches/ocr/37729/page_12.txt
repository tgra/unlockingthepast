Officer on the Staff, who carried out many
special missions in his Q.6 aeroplane, some of
which were of an unusual and hazardous
nature.

Italian East African Campaign. ;

49. The successful land operations against
LE.A., which resulted in the complete
collapse of Italian resistance in that area except
for a small ‘‘ pocket ’’ in the region of Gondar,
were supported by Air forces from Sudan,
Aden and Kenya. In deciding on the actual
strength of the Air force required to give full
support to the Land forces operating from the
North and South, it was necessary to take
- into account the fact that:—

(i) It was still possible for the Italians, and
Germans if they so decided, to send rein-
forcements of aircraft direct by air from
‘Tripoli to LE.A.

(ii) To meet the commitments in Libya
and Greece the release of Air and Mechanised
forces from this front was important.
There was, therefore, need for speed if the
campaign was to be completely successful
before the rains started in April.

(iii) The majority of our aircraft were of
obsolete or obsolescent type which needed
the cover of a few modern fighters to enable
them to operate by day in face of the Italian
C.R.42 fighters which were still active until
towards the close of the campaign.

(iv) Patriot activities required constant
air support to maintain enthusiasm and
morale.

(v) The Red Sea shipping route still re-
mained potentially a very vulnerable line of
communication. Its security was the more
important since traffic through the Mediter-
ranean had virtually ceased.

50. In the Sudan, at the-beginning of the
year the R.A.F, under Air Commodore L. H.
Slatter, O.B.E., D.S.C., D.F.C., consisted of
five Squadrons and one Flight. No. x South
African Air Force (F) Squadron—Hurricanes
and Gladiators, No. 237 Rhodesian (A.C.)
Squadron—Hardys, No. 47 (B) Squadron—
Wellesleys,, No, 223 (B) Squadron—Wellesleys,
and No. 14 (B) Squadron—Blenheim IV’s.
In addition, ‘‘ K’’ Flight’s (Gladiators) move
to Egypt was cancelled pro tem. and they
were retained in the Sudan. These Squadrons
were mainly used during the whole period to
defeat the Italian Air Force and to support
the advance of the Army into Eritrea. Other
commitments which were met included the
Air defence of Port Sudan, occasional special
convoy escort work in the Red Sea, attacks
on the harbour of Massawa and support of
the increasing activities of the Abyssinian
Patriots further South, Haile Selassie having
entered Abyssinia on the, 20th January, 1941.

51. Pressure by General Platt’s force on the
Kassala area resulted in the fall of the town on

January 1gth and the retreat of the Italian ©

Forces into Eritrea. Steady progress by two
parallel columns continued, Agordat and
Barentu falling on the 1st and gnd February.
Early in March the advance was halted in front
of the formidable defences on the Keren

heights. Here the Italians made a determined
stand until March 27, when they were forced
to withdraw Southward.

In these operations at Keren the R.A-F.
played a prominent part in the close support of
the Army. Wellesleys, Vincents, Lysanders,
Gauntlets and Hardys were employed for con-
tinuous bombing of targets both in and
behind the enemy’s battle positions. With-
out doubt this heavy and continuous bombing,
combined with the effect of artillery fire,
seriously weakened Italian morale and con-
tributed very largely to the capture of this
formidable position.

Meanwhile, the offensive against enemy
aerodromes, lines of communication and air-
craft in the air was continued by Blenheims,
Hurricanes and Gladiators. Enemy fighters,
whose appearance became less frequent as time
went on, continued to ‘‘ shoot up ”’ our air-
craft on the’ ground, occasionally with success,
but their air effort gradually dwindled until
by the time Asmara was occupied on March
31st it had virtually ceased. ‘

The Hurricanes of No. r South African
Squadron were especially prominent in these .
operations. In two attacks on enemy aero-
dromes they destroyed 6 C.A.133’s, 4 C.R.42’s
and 6 S.79’s, besides damaging a further 3

.79’s.

During the attack on Keren a particularly
successful bombing attack on lines of communi-
cation resulted in the destruction of an
ammunition train reported to be carrying over
20,000 shells.

52. Further South bombing attacks were
made in support of the Patriots to help in
sustaining their morale; Gubba, Gondar, Asosa,
Burye and Debra Marcos being among the
places attacked. Blenheims of the Free French
Flight took part in these operations. Pilot
Officer R. A. Collis, D.F.C., of No. 47 (B)
Squadron (Wellesleys), made a series of 19
flights up to a distance of 200 miles into
Abyssinia, carrying at various times ammuni-
tion, money and supplies for the Patriot forces,
and on other occasions representatives of the
Emperor and Army Officers.

North of Lake Tana the Italians contrived to
maintain themselves in the Gondar area, but
South of the Lake the Patriots succeeded in
capturing Burye and Debra Marcos and in
teaching the Blue Nile.

53. After the occupation of Asmara on the
rst April, the advance continued on Massawa.
As our threat to that objective developed, five
Italian destroyers based at Massawa left har-
bour in a Northerly direction on 2nd April.
This force was located and attacked on 3rd
April by Swordfish of the F.A.A. (H.M.S.
Eagle) by No. 14 Squadron (Blenheims) and
No. 223 Squadron (Wellesleys). The Sword-
fish torpedoed two of the destroyers, sinking
one of them and leaving the second in a sinking
condition, the latter being subsequently bombed
and sunk by a Blenheim. A further two
destroyers were driven aground on the Hedjaz
Coast twelve miles South of Jedda, where they
were bombed and destroyed by Blenheims and
‘Wellesleys operating in conjunction with H.M.S,
Kingston. The surviving destroyer escaped
= ‘ee to Massawa, where she scuttled
