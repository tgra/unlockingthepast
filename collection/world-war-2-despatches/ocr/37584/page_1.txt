OPERATIONS IN CENTRAL NORWAY, 1940.

PREFACE BY THE WAR OFFICE.

Of the two expeditions which the United
Kingdom and France sent to Norway in April,
1940, one to Northern Norway and one to
Central Norway, the following despatch covers
the latter from the beginning of operations.

In Central Norway two main landings were
made, one in the Namsos area by a force under
the command of Major-General A, Carton de
Wiart, V.C., C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., and one
in the Andalsnes area by a force under the
command, first of Brigadier H. de R. Morgan,
D.S.O., and later of Major-General B. C. T.
Paget, D.S.O., M.C. On roth April, 1940,
Lieutenant-General H. R. S. Massy, D.S.O.,
M.C., was instructed to assume the appoint-
ment of Commander-in-Chief of the forces
operating in Central Norway. He exercised this
command from his Headquarters in the United
Kingdom as the course of events did not per-
mit the opening of a Headquarters in Norway.

When the decision to withdraw from Central
Norway was taken on 27th April, 1940, it was
ed to press on with operations against
Narvik, and the force in Northern Norway com-
prising British, French and Polish troops suc-
ceeded in capturing the town of Narvik before
it, in turn, had to be withdrawn at the begin-
ning of June, 1940.

The following despatch was submitted to the
Secretary of State for War on 13th May,
1940 by Liewtenant-General H. R. S.
MASSY, D.S.O., M.C., Commander-in-
Chief, North Western Expeditionary Force.

I have the honour to submit my report on
the operations in Central Norway, up to and

including 3rd May. This report is divided into
four Parts as under:—
Part 1.—General Summary of Events.
Part II.—Operations in the Namsos area.
Part III.—Operations in the Andalsnes
area.
Part IV.—Conclusions and lessons.

I am indebted for Part II of this report to
Major-General Carton de Wiart and for Part IIT
to Major-General B. C. T. Paget and Brigadier
H. de R. Morgan, who have provided me with
the necessary material for them.

PART I.
GENERAL SUMMARY OF EVENTS.

x. When the original plan for operations in
Southern Norway was made, the landings at
Andalsnes and Namsos were intended as diver-
sions to a main attack to be made on Trond-
heim. When the landings at Andalsnes and
Namsos were effected without loss, and our
troops advanced inland from these bases, it was
decided that Trondheim might be captured by
a converging movement instead of by a
hazardous direct attack from seaward.

It was-hoped too that sufficient troops could
be put into Andalsnes to stiffen Norwegian
resistance in the South, and thus put a limit to
the German advance from Oslo.

It was against this background that I was
instructed on 19th April to assume the appoint-
ment of Commander of the North-Western Ex-
peditionary Force and to form my Headquarters
with a view to taking command as soon as
possible of the operations in progress North
and South of Trondheim,
