SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JULY, 1948

explosion was much greater than the one pre-
vious; the flames leapt hundreds of feet into
the air and when the smoke cleared away
nothing could be seen.

13 All this time Raider No 2 was chasing us
and firing continuously. We received a direct
hit on the stern, luckily~again ‘just above the
waterline. A fire was started, but was promptly
brought under control.

14. We steamed on_under the cover of a
smoke screen. Raider No 2 continued to chase
and fire at us for about another 15 minutes, then
the finng ceased and after about another 15 to
20 minutes when the smoke screen was cleared,
the enemy was not in sight. It is presumed
that Raider No 2 went back to pick up any
survivors from the sunken raider.

15. The tanker was last seen disappearing
over the horizon, and information has since
been received which leads one to believe that
she was able to make her escape.

16. It is estmated that there were well over
200 shells fired at us, and considering that we
received a direct hit and innumerable near
misses, it is incredible that no one was even
slightly injured.

17. Those who took part in this action will
never cease to marvel at the result. To think
that a small ship, with only one 12-pdr. gun,
should engage two raiders, both more than ten
times her own size, and each with about 20

times her gun power, and so enable the tanker _

to escape, sink one raider, and then get away
herself, is almost miraculous.

18 The R I.N, should be justly proud of their
little ‘‘ Bengal Tiger ’’; she has’ had her tail
twisted and has a few scars but these will soon
sbe healed and the Tiger will be roaring again.
