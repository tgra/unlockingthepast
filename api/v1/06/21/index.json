            "description": "During the night, the headquarters of the Army were intermittently in touch with General Klopper, and early on the 21st June learned from him that all water and petrol had been destroyed. He also informed the Eighth Army that the whole of his transport had been captured and on that account he had been unable to break out. An order was circulated to all units in the garrison that a capitulation had taken place and that all vehicles, equipment and arms were to be destroyed.",

By that time the whole of the eastern part of the fortress was in enemy hands, and General Klopper asked General Ritchie’s permission to break out. Permission was accorded, but an hour later General Klopper said that it would be impossible as the greater part of his transport had been cut off in the harbour area. Early on the 21st June, General Klopper reported that all his transport had been captured, and that organised resistance was breaking down. Orders to destroy arms and equipment were circulated to the garrison. In spite of this, however, a number of troops fought on gallantly for a considerable time, and some broke out and rejoined the Eighth Army,",

The L.S.Ts. then sailed to Alexandria, where they embarked the remaining personnel and joined up with 9 L.S.Ts. which had been loaded there. The embarkation of the L.S.Ts. was completed by 21st June. In all, for the first two convoys a total of 65,000 personnel, 9,400 vehicles and 60,000 tons of stores was loaded.",

            "description": "77. With the balloon barrage the problem was largely the arithmetical one of achieving a sufficient density to give a reasonable chance of success. We found, however, that in practice the theoretically computed rate of success was not always attained: somehow more bombs slipped through the barrage than should have done so according to the laws of probability, if our assumptions were correct. One difficulty was that the “double parachute links ’’* used to arm the balloon cables in normal barrages had not been designed to cope with aircraft travelling much faster than 300 m.p.h. For this reason we did not arm the cables of the balloons deployed during the first few days of the attack. But we soon came to the conclusion that an imperfect arming device was better than none; and by the 21st June all cables were armed. I received a large number of suggestions for increasing the effectiveness of the barrage in other ways, such as by adding “* whiskers ’’, nets, kites, and other forms of drapery. Many devices of this kind were tried, and some were of value, but as most of them increased the physical difficulty of handling the balloons in one way or another, I had to adopt a somewhat cautious attitude lest the best should prove the enemy of the good.",

By the early hours of the 17th June the first A.A. regiment fo move had taken up its new positions and the deployment of the balloon barrage had also begun. When drawing up the plan we had calculated that deployment would take eighteen days to complete and that it would be wiser to allow twenty-five days; the Air Ministry had expected to be able to give us a month’s warning. In the event we had received no warning at all, apart fom that provided ‘by the Germans themselves on the 13th June. In the circumstances it was imperative that we should get the job done quickly. The original time-table went by the board. Thanks to the admini trative arrangements which had already been made and to remarkable feats by both AntiAircraft Command and Balloon Command, the whole of the planned deployment was virtually complete by the 21st June, only five days after. the issue of the order to deploy.",

Furthermore, the advance of the © Nigerian Brigade along the Lechemti road was progressing, the enemy rear-guard left east of the Didessa amounting to some 400 white troops had been all either killed or captured, and the attack on the Didessa ition would be carried out in a few days time. Also all indications showed that the enemy had given up hope of holding the Didessa and intended to withdraw all their troops to the DembidolloGore area. I therefore decided that no further advantage was to be gained by remaining out‘side Gimma, more particularly as it was now necessary to commence an advance northwards through Gimma in conjunction with the operations being carried out against Ghimbi, to prevent, as far as possible, the withdrawal of the enemy forces on the Bedelle-Dembi front. I therefore ordered the occupation of Gimma as part .of a general advance northwards through that town. It was occupied without incident by 2and.E.A. Brigade on 21st June.",
