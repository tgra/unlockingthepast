Simultaneously the Afrika Korps was to form up south of Bir Hacheim with 21st Panzer Division (less one battalion of tanks) on the left, 15th Panzer Division in the centre and the goth Light Division Battle Group on the right, These formations were then to advance northwards and, after destroying our armoured forces, were to reach Acroma and El] Adem before nightfall. Motorised columns were to seize Sidi Rezegh and Ed Buda. -On 28th May, the three armoured divisions were to attack our positions between Gazala and Alem Hamza from the east, while four Italian infantry divi- sions, stiffened by two regiments of the goth Light Division and one tank battalion of the zist Panzer Division, were to attack\u2019the same positions from the west."

            "description": "The loss of Bir Hacheim undoubtedly weakened the general position of the Eighth Army, and the enemy quickly took advantage of this to concentrate his forces against El Adem, a most important tactical locality cover- ing Tobruk from the south. Throughout the 12th and x3th June, the opposing armoured forces were heavily engaged round El Adem and Knightsbridge. This action proved to be the culmination of the armoured fighting, which had begun on the 27th May, and was decisive in its results. After it, we could muster only about fifty medium and twenty infantry tanks in the Acroma area while it seems probable that the enemy had twice that number. The enemy, moreover, was left in possession of the batile- field and could recover his damaged tanks and destroy ours. He also gained possession of the escarpment between El Adem and Knights- bridge, a feature of great tactical importance."

            "description": "66. Arrangements had been made for a con- tinuous patrol to be flown by our two squadrons of fighter aircraft over the area throughout the operation. This was carried out from 1915 hours on 27th May until 1615 hours on 2gth May with the one brief enforced interval mentioned below. No enemy aircraft appeared in the area until about 0500 hours, a circumstance which seems to show that the operation came as a surprise to the enemy. Unfortunately just about this time our own air- craft became fogbound on Bardu Foss aero- drome, 50 miles to the North and could no longer protect the ships and troops. From 0500 hours to 0700 hours numerous enemy air- craft, often flying in formation, made repeated bombing atacks upon H.M. Ships round Narvik and on the troops on shore. By this time, how- ever, the task of the ships had been substantially completed, and, by constant manoeuvring, they succeeded in avoiding serious damage, though the flagship, H.M.S. Cairo, was hit by two bombs and lost 30 men killed and wounded. The casualties to the landing forces from bomb- ing amounted to only one small craft loaded with ammunition,"

The operation was originally intended to take place on the night 24/25th May, but at a conference with General Bethouart on 23rd May I came to the conclusion that unless the weather was very propitious it would be an unjustifiable risk to undertake it with the support of only one fighter squadron of aircraft, in view of the strength and efficiency of the enemy bombers. I decided therefore that it should be postponed until after the arrival of the Hurricane fighter squadron which was due on 27th May. Lord Cork agreed with this decision."

The Naval bombardment on the Narvik Peninsula was on a wide front, the targets selected being the mouths of the tunnels of the railway and other suspected machine gun and artillery positions. The fire of the guns of the ships and the French field artillery was heavy and accurate, but close support of the attacking troops was hampered throughout by the broken nature of the terrain and the difficulty of accurate observation in the birch scrub which covered the lower slopes of the hills. :"

The \u2018\u2018 modified sites \u2019\u2019 made difficult bombing targets. _ When Typhoon bombers carried out an experimental attack on one of them on the 27th May the site proved hard to find and the results were poor. Besides being small and well concealed, the sites comprised few buildings at which bombs could be aimed. Unlike the \u2018\u2018ski sites\u2019\u2019, they seemed to be intended as launching points and nothing more. The conclusion was that any stocks of pilotless aircraft held locally would not be kept on the sites themselves, but stored elsewhere or dis- persed in the wooded country amongst which all the sites were placed."

I now pressed Middle East to give me the earliest date by which shipping could arrive, to which question 3rd June was given in reply. On a2rst and 2gth April respectively I therefore decided to place rst Natal Mounted Rifles and rst Field Force Battalion from this ~brigade under General Wetherall with instruc- tions that they would have to be released on 27th May."

For the next two days attack and counter-attack continued and it was not until late on the 28th that the Germans evacuated Arce and fell back behind the upper Lisi, which here cuts across Route 6 at right angles. Meanwhile the Canadians had made an assault boat crossing of the Liri south of Ceprano on 27th May. It was a difficult operation in face of heavy enemy artillery and small arms opposition but the town was cap- tured by midday. Our bridgehead was still only supported by ferries and it was not until the afternoon of the 28th that a hundred and twenty foot bridge was completed over which the armoured brigade was to pass to advance to Frosinone. It had to be used instead, however, by 78 Division which 13 Corps had sent round to the south to outflank the enemy defenders of the Arce defile. This delayed the pursuit by the Canadian armour."

The following night (27th/28th May), main bodies were to withdraw behind the Lys, leaving rearguards on the Deule canal up to its junction with the Lys at Deulemont: these rearguards were to stay there until the next night (28th/2gth May). The immediate effect of these dispositions would be to shorten the total perimeter by some 58 miles, but on the other hand I had to face the possibility of having to occupy the front from Ypres to the sea, some 25 miles long, which was still the responsibility of the Belgian Army."
