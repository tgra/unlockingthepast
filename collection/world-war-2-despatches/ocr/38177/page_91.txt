SUPPLEMENT to rHE LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 1048 ,

operations in Persia, without, as has hitherto
been the case, being distracted by the large
administrative responsibilities inseparable from
the control of the bases and lines of communi-
cation in Iraq and Southern Persia, and the
need for keeping in touch with the complicated
political situation in Iraq.

Briefly, the reorganisation consists in the set-
ting up of an L. of C. and base area in Southern
Iraq and South-western Persia under an
Inspector-General of Communications and a
local defence commander, and the transfer of
Northern Iraq to the control of the Ninth Army
thus ensuring unity of command along the
length of the Anatolian frontier, should ‘an
enemy threat to Syria and Iraq materialise
through Turkey. In this event such unity of
control is in my opinion essential, if only to
ensure efficient co-operation between the Army
and the Air Force, and the most economical
use of the available air forces. This reorganisa-
tion was decided upon after Jong and careful
examination by qualified staff officers of all
three services and has the full approval of the
three Commanders-in-Chief.

This reorganisation produces, in my opinion,
and I believe in that of the A. O. Cnc, a
workable system for the conduct of operations

in Persia and along the Anatolian frontier, and-

ensures the maximum of efficiency and the mini-
mum of friction which can be expected in view
of the admittedly complicated nature of the
problem, .

As Commander-in-Chief, Middle East Forces,
I was prepared to meet the threat to our
Northern Front once this reorganisation had
been effected, assuming that the requisite forces
were available.

3. Regarding the proposal to set up an in-
dependent army command in Iraq-Persia, I feel
that the main difficulty is in the provision and
control of the air forces which will have to work
with the army in this new command.

In my opinion it would be impossible to ex-
pect the new Commander-in-Chief to accept the
responsibility of the new command unless a
definite allotment of air forces is made to it.
This allotment must not be susceptible to reduc-
tion except with the consent of the Commander-
in-Chief, or by order of the Chiefs of Staff. Any
arrangement whereby the full control of all air
forces on the entire Caspian—Cyrenaican front
is vested in a single A. O. C.-in-C. located at
Cairo or elsewhere, while the land forces on the
same front are divided into two separate com-
mands, each under an independent Commander-
in-Chief directly responsible to the Chiefs of
Staff in London, must, in my opinion, result in
constant friction and consequent inefficiency,
and may well be disastrous in times of crisis. It
would be impossible, I think, to expect a
Commander-in-Chief in Baghdad to be depen-
dent on an A. O. C.-in-C. in Cairo for the pro-
vision of the air forces essential to the carrying
out of his plans, He would, presumably, have
an A.O.C, available as an adviser and local
air force commander, but this officer would not
be able to give any decision on important
matters of policy without the approval of the

. C.-in-C, The position of the C.-in-C.
would, I submit, be intolerable and is not one
which I could myself accept.

I fully realise that any arbitrary division of
air forces between the two commands is likely
to be uneconomical and to deprive the air of

that flexibility which it now possesses under the
existing organisation, whereby the C.-in-C. and
A.O. C.-in-C., Middle East, have the same ter-
titorial responsibilities so far as the Caspian—
Cyrenaican front is concerned. . This is one of
the chief objections I see in the new proposals.

4. At present the Tenth Army in Persia has a
full staff and is reasonably well off for signals.
The administrative staff of the newly constituted
Irag-Persia L. of C. area and base could, I
think, be transformed without great difficulty
or delay and be made into the administrative
staff of the new G. H. Q., Iraq-Persia, A new
General Staff will, however, have to be created
from nothing, as no such organisation exists at
present. This will entail a great deal of work
and the transfer of a mass of information and
accumulated knowledge from the present
G. H.Q., Middle East, to the new G. H. Q.
The new Commander-in-Chief can hardly be
expected to rely on any organization in Cairo
for information. He must control his own
machinery.

T estimate that it will take at least six weeks
to two months before the new G. H.Q. can
begin to function with adequate efficiency. Dur-
ing this interim period it is inevitable that
G. H. Q. Middle East should remain in con-
trol of Iraq and Persia otherwise the whole
system of operational control is liable to break
down. The result of such a breakdown at such
a time does not need to be stressed.

5. There are many other important adjust-
ments which must be made in the adminisira-
tive, training and operational fields before the
transfer of responsibility can be effectively com-
pleted. These will all take time, as it is phy-
sically impossible to conclude them in the course
of a few days. I have already had experience
of these difficulties in the comparatively recent
transfer of this sphere from G. H. Q. India: to
G. H. Q. Middle East, so I do not speak with-
out knowledge. The result may well be that
the process of changing over will not be com-
pleted before active operations start in Northern
Persia. This would produce a most unsatis-
factory and probably critical situation,

6. As regards the chances of successfully pre-
venting an enemy advance through Persia from
the Caucasus towards the head of the Persian
Gulf, I agree generally with the General Staff
estimate as to the minimum forces required. In
my opinion the following are needed : —

One Army H. Q. and Signals.

Two Corps H. Q. and Signals.

Two Armoured Divisions.

Seven Infantry Divisions (including two for
internal security duties and L. of C. protec-
tion in Iraq and Persia, but excluding any
garrison required in.the Persian Gulf itself).
It is essential that all these troops shall be

fully mobile including the divisions allotted for
L. of C. protection and internal security duties.

I estimate the minimum requirements in air
forces at some twenty-five squadrons which will
also need to have a high degree of mobility. This
full mobility is of prime importance as without
it there is no likelihood whatever of being able
to conduct a successful defence of Northern
Persia. -

It is well known that there is insufficient
transport available in the Middle East to give
these forces full mobility and at the same time
to enable an offensive to be conducted in the
