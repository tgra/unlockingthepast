SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

exterminated. Their 53 Division attempt-
ing to occupy its allotted defence zone
west of Pyawbwe was struck in the flank
and severely mauled before it ever got there.
During the fighting in and around the town
itself, 18 Japanese Division lost 2,200 killed,
and we captured 31 guns, eight tanks and much
transport. The tactical handling of 17 Indian
Division by Major-General D. T. Cowan in
this fighting was excellent. The enemy were
expecting an attack from the north and they
were attacked by infantry from this direction,
but what surprised and disrupted their defence
were the armoured columns operating from
the south. The whole battle was a massacre
by tanks, guns, infantry and aircraft. 33
Japanese Army was shattered.

237. The advance from Pyawbwe was
taken up by 5 Indian Division, which passed
through 17 Indian Division on the 11th April.
123 Brigade Group reached Yamethin on that
date and our armour contacted the enemy seven
miles to the south. During the night, an
enemy detachment some 400 strong, with an
anti-tank battery, entered the town from the
east and occupied buildings and trenches com-
manding the road. This detachment fought
to the last man and it took two days to elimi-
nate them, the process being considerably
hastened by accurate air strikes. In the mean-
time, a by-pass road was constructed west of
the town to allow our unarmoured vehicles to
get forward. On the 12th the Japanese
achieved a minor success in one of their rare
air attacks, 16 vehicles of a petrol and ammuni-
tion convoy being destroyed by them.

238. While Yamethin was being finally
cleared, an armoured column and 161 Brigade
Group had advanced and contacted the enemy
on the 15th, astride the road and railway on
the general line of the Sinthe Chaung, 27 miles
from Yamethin and three miles north of
Shwemyo. While this portion of the enemy
was being subjected to successful air strikes
which caused them heavy casualties, an
armoured column operating west of the road
and railway crossed the Sinthe Chaung and
broke into Shwemyo itself, which it completely
cleared the same day (16th April). Meanwhile
the engineers, though harassed by enemy
artillery fire from the Shwemyo Bluff, bridged
the Sinthe north of Shwemyo and bulldozed a
by-pass over difficult ground. This enabled
161 Brigade Group to outflank the Japanese
positions north of the town, and harbour south
of it for the night 16th-17th. In their efforts
to establish a bridgehead across the Sinthe
Chaung the next day, however, this Brigade
was held up.

239. 123 Brigade Group, ten miles north of
Shwemyo, were preparing for an attack on the
Shwemyo Bluff, while 9 Brigade Group con-
centrated in the Tatkon area, four miles north-
west of the entrance to the Shwemyo Bluff
defiles. This Bluff is a steep feature rising to
700 feet, dominating the road and rail-
way on the east side. It was expected that
the Japanese would hold this strong position,
and they did, but they did not anticipate an
attack from the jungle-covered hills east of
the Bluff, which was the line of advance
selected by 123 Brigade. This assault on the
18th caught the enemy in flank and rear and
was completely successful. 123 Brigade were

1923

then relieved in this area by 99 Brigade of 17
Indian Division, to free them for a further
advance.

240. Early on the 18th April, 161 Brigade
succeeded in forcing a crossing of the Sinthe
Chaung and repaired the bridge. They then,
in conjunction with 255 Indian Tank Brigade,
inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy over
a wide area well south of Shwemyo, destroying
three guns. By the evening of the 18th, the
armoured column was only twelve miles north
of Pyinmana, despite mined road blocks and
demolitions, which were covered by enemy
‘detachments concealed in the thick country on
either side of the road. The airstrip near
Shwemyo was taken over on the 18th April by
the air-transportable brigade which had moved
up by road, leaving the rest. of 5 Indian
Division free for their next bound forward.

241. Our tanks reached Pyinmana on the
19th April. Finding it held, they by-passed
it and captured the valuable Lewe airfield, just
to the south of the town, on the 20th. By
nightfall, they had reached Yeni, 43 miles from
Toungoo and 218 miles from Rangoon. 161
Brigade took over the defence of Lewe air-
field after its capture by the armoured column,
preparing it for the glider fly-in of aviation
engineers. They also cleared the northern part
of Pyinmana, the Japanese garrison still re-
sisting stubbornly in the southern sector. Mean-
while 123 Brigade passed rapidly through
161 Brigade and reached Thawatti, almost
catching up with our armour three miles further
south. Continuing their rush south, both our
tanks and our infantry reached a village 15
miles north of Toungoo on the 21st April. On
this date, the enemy in Pyinmana were finally
liquidated. .

242. The last lap of the race for Toungoo
was now being run. There were three com-
petitors. 5 Indian Division were driving
hard down the axis of the main road. The
enemy columns, which had been driven off the
main road were attempting by forced marches,
along jungle tracks on both sides of the main
road, to reach Toungoo ahead of us. These
columns were being looked after by our air-
craft, but, we too, had our difficulties in the
shape of mines, demolitions, and heavy rain-
storms—the first two delayed our tanks on the
road, while the third hindered their move-
ment off it. The third competitor was 15
Japanese Division, which was moving by motor
transport parallel to 5 Indian Division, and
some 60 miles to the east of it, down the
Taunggyi—Loikaw road, which turns west at
Kemapyo, via Mawchi, to Toungoo. We owe
it to the Karen guerillas, under their British
officers, and to the airstrikes by the R.A.F.
directed by these same British officers, that
this enemy division lost the race. Ambush
after ambush, demolition after demolition, air-
strike after airstrike, delayed its advance and,
although a forward element got within artillery
range of its objective, it was too late.

243. After a sharp action on the 22nd April
“by our tanks in a village eight miles to the
north, our troops swept into Toungoo itself.
The leading light tanks of 123 Brigade column
ignored the traffic signals of an indignant
Japanese policeman in the centre of the town,
and ran him down. Subsequent enemy re-
sistance in the western half of the town was
