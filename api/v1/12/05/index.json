The numerous moves taking place in the fron- tier area called for a nice adjustment of trans- port, and difficulties had arisen over the pro- vision of vehicles to lift the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade. But by the 5th December the 4th Indian Infantry Division was assembling, and General Norrie intended to start the operation on the evening of the 6th December. During the morning of the 6th, however, General Norrie heard that the two German Panzer Divisions were lying on the rising ground north-west of Bir el Gubi, astride the indian Division\u2019s in- tended line of advance."

Accordingly, on the 5th December the Second Tactical Air Force and the American Ninth Bomber Command began a series of bombing attacks on the \u201c\u2018 ski sites\u2019\u2019, The Strategic Air Forces, in the shape of our own Bomber Command and the American Eighth Bomber Command, also contributed their quota. By the end of the year, 3,216 tons of bombs had been dropped on the sites\u2014about the weight that fell on London in an average fortnight during the night \u201c Blitz \"\u2019 of 1940-41. So far as the Air Ministry could judge, the effect of these attacks was to \u2018\u2018 neutralize\u2019\u2019 twelve sites and seriously damage another nine. But since 88 \u2018\u2018 ski sites \u2019\u2019 had been located by this time, and the existence of another 50 was sus- pected, the neutralization of all the sites with the bombing resources that could be spared from other tasks seemed likely to prove a long- drawn business."

On 5th December he sent a mixed force of approximately sixty bombers and fighters in two waves which suc- ceeded in bombing Calcutta for the loss of 2 destroyed, 1 probably destroyed, and 4 dam- aged, while tthe three and a half Hurricane squadrons (the half being night fighters) suffered five destroyed and six damaged. That the enemy put-his maximum effort into the attack is evidenced by the fact that the second wave included Naval aircraft."
