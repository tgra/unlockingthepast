            "description": "Following a favourite enemy plan 10 Corps attacked in the late afternoon of 26th March. with the sun behind them. For two and a half hours previously the Royal Air Force had attacked the enemy’s positions with bombs and machine-gun fire, creating great destruction among his guns and transport and having a most serious effect on morale. The New Zealand Division began the attack with 8& Armoured Brigade leading and rapidly overran the enemy’s defences. 4x Armoured Division followed through and advanced nearly four miles before being halted by darkness. When the moon rose they pressed on again. It was a daring but successful move; in the bright moonhght they drove straight past the bulk of the enemy’s armour and at dawn were within a few miles of El] Hamma which is only fifteen miles from Gabes on a good road. A further advance at first light put them within two miles of E] Hamma, facing a strong enemy anti-tank gun screen. 164 Light Division was engaged here, with 15 Panzer Division to its south. ar Panzer Division was still cut off between rt Armoured Division and the New Zealanders and fought very fiercely to extricate itself. The efforts of the three German divisions were successful, in spite of heavy losses, in holding on to El] Hamma and keeping open the corridor through which the troops from the Mareth line were withdrawn to the next defensive position north of Gabes. 30 Corps mas hampered in following up by many mines and demolitions. ro Corps was also hindered in its operations. against El] Hamma on 28th March and the enemy evacuated the village that night. The New Zealanders entered Gabes at 1300 hours. on the agth and were shortly afterwards joined there by the advance elements of 51 Division. The enemy had lost seven thousand prisoners and many tanks and guns.",
