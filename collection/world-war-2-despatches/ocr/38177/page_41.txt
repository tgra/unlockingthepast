SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 1948

On the 21st January our forward troops were
under Major-General Messervy, commanding
the st Armoured Division. On the right was
the 2orst Guards Motor Brigade, organised in
four columns, each consisting of a company
of infantry, a field battery and:some anti-tank
and light anti-aircraft gums, watching a front
running south for ‘sore fifteen miles from the
coast near Marsa el Brega; the third battalion
of the brigade was in reserve at Agedabia. To
the south was the Support Group of the ist
Armoured Division also organised in four
mobile columns and a reserve, and responsible
for the front from the left of the Guards Brigade
to Maaten Burruei, south of the Wadi Faregh,
an extent of some twenty-five to thirty miles.
In reserve, twelve miles north of Saunnu, was
- the 2nd Armoured Brigade, whose training was

still unfinished, with three regiments of field
artillery and some anti-tank and light anti-
aircraft artillery. The residue of the original
Oases Force, now a battalion and one field
battery, was in the desert some forty miles east
of Agedabia and about to return to the Delta
to refit af.2r two strenuous months of unbroken
‘operations.

The 1st Armoured Division Support Group
had only just relieved that of the 7th Armoured
Division and was inexperienced in desert driv-
ing. Moreover- many of its vehicles were not
thoroughly desertworthy, chiefly owing to weak-
ness in the transmission and lack of spare parts.
Tyres, too, were unreliable and liable to burst
after a. short life. These weaknesses were
accentuated by the nature.of the ground in this
region: north of Antelat and Saunnu the going
fis good, but it becomes progressively worse
towards the south, where it is probably as bad
as anywhere in the desert. In consequence, in
many places tracked vehicles could outpace
wheeled

General Messervy realised that the enemy
might stage a local counter-attack and that his
advanced troops were weak and widely dis-
persed. He had asked General Godwin-Austen
that the 4th Indian Division might come for-
ward to consolidate a position about Agedabia
and E] Haseiat and that the 2nd Armoured
Brigade might be moved near to Giof el Matar,

‘where it would be better placed to support the
forward troops. Unfortunately these moves,
though sanctioned, could not be carried out
because of difficulties of supply caused by
shortage of transport vehicles. Even as it was,
the forward troops were on short rations, as
the maximum number of vehicles had to be
used for building up reserves to enable our
offensive to be resumed. Moreover, it had been
found. necessary to withdraw all the armoured
car regiments, with the exception of one
squadron, to enable their vehicles to be repaired
and refitted, because ‘of the damage they were
sustaining owing to the rough ground.

In the event of an enemy counter-attack.
General Messervy’s plan was for the forward
troops to withdraw if necessary, fighting a delay-
ing action, to the line Agedabia—El Haseiat
which was to be held to the last. The and

Armoured ‘Brigade were to be brought forward

to counter- attack the enemy’s right flank and
rear.

It is doubtful whether the enemy’s original
plan went further than a reconnaissance in force
to ascertain our dispositions and impede-our

preparations for a renewal of our offensive.
He does not appear to have used more than
about eighty.or ninety tanks throughout the
operations and his troops seemed to have started
the advance with only three days rations in
hand. As usual, however, he rapidly and skil-
fully made the most of his initial success, being
greatly helped by .the remarkable elasticity of
his supply organisation.

The Enemy Attacks.

The first warning of impending attack was
given early in the morning of the 21st January
by heavy shelling of our advanced troops. The
enemy advanced in. three columns. The left
column, which included about thirty German
tanks, moved up the main road; the centre and
southern columns, ihe latter containing about
thirty-five German tanks, moved to the south
of the road and along the north bank of the
Wadi Faregh. Initially things went well for
us, but the Support Group to the south then
tan into sand dunes and was overtaken by
enemy light tanks which caught some of its
infantry and artillery hampered by the difficult
going. To the north the Guards Brigade were
not in difficulty, and General Messervy told
both his subordinate commanders to continue
in their delaying role, but cancelled his orders
to hold the Agedabia—E]l Haseiat line to the
last, as the reserves of supplies which this line
was intended to cover had not yet been placed
in position. Enemy dive-bombers and fighter
aircraft attacked our troops ‘heavily and per-
sistently throughout the’ day. Unfortunately
our forward landirig grounds were marshy after
the recent heavy rains, and this hindered our
aircraft giving our troops during the initial
thrust the’ full protection and support which
they previously and subsequently received.

On the zand January, the 2nd Armoured
Brigade was ordered to move forward in sup-
port of our left flank. Meanwhile, however,
the enemy’s left column had mariaged to pass
through the Guards Brigade and moved swiftly -
up the main road to Agedabia, where ‘it was
engaged by our tanks. General Messervy
ordered the Guards Brigade to destroy this party
and to block the main road north-west of
Agedabia, as well as the track leading to
Antelat. But our columns appeared to be in-
capable of rapid movement in the rough ground
off the main road, along which the enemy moved
with great speed, easily outstripping our troops
struggling in the bad going to the east. The
3th Corps then ordered the rst Armoured Divi-
sion to interpose itself between the enemy and
Msus and the 4th Indian Division, which had
been reinforced. by a battalion of heavy tanks,
to oppose any attempt to advance on Bengasi.

On the morning of the 23rd January enemy
tanks were reported to be moving about round
Saunnu and Antelat, although Saunnu itself was
not yet occupied. Two regiments of the and
Armoured Brigade were ordered to clear this
area on their way northwards to cover Msus.
Each regiment became engaged in a separate
action with bodies of enemy tanks about fifty
strong and each with its attached artillery
suffered heavily. The third regiment reached
its appointed position north, of Antelat without
incident, but when the whole brigade was
finally assembled it numbered only eighty
tanks altogether. ‘By the evening the enemy
were in. occupation of Antelat and Saunnu.
