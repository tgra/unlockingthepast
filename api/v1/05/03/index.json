Plans for the evacuation of Andalsnes were for the evacuation to be carried out on two nights, Ist/2nd, and 2nd/3rd May, but the plan was made sufficiently elastic so that if nec the process of evacuation from this latter port could be put forward 24 hours. It had been planned when the force was evacuated from Namsos that a rearguard should fall back by land to Mosjoen retiring in the face of the enemy, and that in the meantime a party should be sent by sea to ensure holding the latter port against enemy troops landed by parachute from the air, and orders to this effect were issued.

            "title": "**Strategic Shift: Seventh Army's Bold Plan to Overhaul Sicily Assault**",
            "description": "I therefore decided to recast the whole plan. T took the decision on 3rd May, based on a conference on 2nd May which I had been prevented from attending by impossible flying weather, to cancel the American assault in the west and transfer the whole weight of Seventh Army to the south-east of the island, on the immediate left of Eighth Army. I decided, in fact, to take a risk on the administrative side rather than the operational risk of dispersion of effort. This was contrary to what had hitherto been regarded as one of the fundamental principles of the operation: that we must capture Palermo at the earliest possible opportunity if we were to have a hope of maintaining sufficient forces for the reduction of the . island. On my new plan the only ports we should be certain of capturing in the first stage would be Syracuse and Augusta, the latter more a naval anchorage than a port, and possibly Catania; the whole of Seventh Army would have to depend on beach maintenance except for such help as it might get from the small port of Licata which, as already stated, was only rated at a capacity of six hundred tons a day.* The risk was therefore grave, but there were two factors which brightened the prospect. The first was that there was a reasonable probability of suitable weather in July for beach maintenance. The second was the coming of the Duxw. I need not describe these ingenious amphibious vehicles, which are now familiar to everyone, but it is interesting to note, in view of the great part they later played, that I had never seen one up to that time. General Millert, my Major General, Administration, had received advance reports and had ordered large quantities from the United States on 22nd March. When they arrived it was discovered that the claims made for them were fully justified by their performance. It is not too much to say, indeed, that the Duxw revolutionised the problem of beach maintenance. Nevertheless I arranged that Eighth Army should meet the commitment of providing a thousand tons per day through Syracuse for Seventh Army from D plus 14 to supplement their maintenance over the beaches until they could capture and bring into use the port of Palermo.:",

In spite of all these . difficulties the attack was begun on 3rd May when the znd Gold Coast Regiment made a wide flanking march cutting their way through the belts of thick forest with their pangas. On 4th May xst Gold Coast Regiment supported by artillery attacked two prominent hills which were strongly held by the enemy. A.F.V.s were sent up an old Abyssinian track to support the flank attack by 2nd Gold Coast Régiment but could make little progress. Later in the afternoon 2nd Gold Coast Regiment came in.on the enemy’s left rear and by 5th May had cut the toad behind the position. The enemy however still held his main positions and it was not until roth May that he was finally driven from them on the two hills. In capturing this very formidable position the determination shown by the Gold Coast troops sustained the fighting teputation which they had gained in the first phase of the campaign.",

H.Q. Frontier Battalion reached the outskirts of Debra Tabor on 7th May and from then until arrival of 4 Company on 16th May, in spite of continual rain, inadequate clothing and cover, and much lameness caused by jigger sores, they maintained systematic nightly bombing attacks on the Debra Tabor garrison, which consisted of two Blackshirt and two Colonial battalions and a regular Banda group. 4 Company continued the work with mortar support until 2oth May, when the battalion was ordered to Dessie, much to the regret of the commander, who, after an exchange of correspondence with Colonel Angelini, commanding the Debra Tabor garrison, believed, that in spite of his instructions to hold out to the last man, Angelini would have surrendered with a little more pushing. Major Simonds was withdrawn at the same time. Debra Tabor did not fall until the beginning of July 1943, but it remained isolated throughout the intervening period as a result of the work of Beghemder Force and the Frontier Battalion.",

The tifle companies occupied in succession the hills to the west of the village, so timing their movements that the last thing the enemy saw before dark was a steady advance towards his position. After dark vigorous patrolling was carried out and one patrol succeeded in scaling the precipitous Bald Hill. This bluff was successful. The enemy believed he had repulsed a strong attack. Behind 3/18 Garhwal Rifles noise, activity and the display of lights, all carefully controlled, gave added realism to the deception. The enemy was deceived ‘by these manoeuvres, and placed his forces ‘to repel an attack astride the road and from the direction of Falaga Pass,",

I therefore instructed Commander r1ths (A) Division to undertake this task with Ist S.A.

This Brigade Group commenced: their advance from Addis Abeba on 13th April. I informed C.-in-C.
