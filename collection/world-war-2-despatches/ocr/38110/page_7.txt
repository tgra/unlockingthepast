minesweeping operation that had yet been
undertaken in war. The provision of the neces-
Sary minesweeping fiotillas had only been
achieved by drawing upon some which had
little opportunity for practice, and, when my
operation orders ‘were written, it was realised
that the successful completion of the mine-
sweeping tasks would demand a_ high
degree of skill from all concerned. “Sub-
sequently the late ,appearance of beach
obstacles on the assault beaches further
complicated the problem, as the alteration in the
time of H hour relative to high water that
resulted meant that it would now be.necessary
for all flotillas to change sweeps during passage
to avoid sweeping with an unfavourable tide.
Some flotillas had no opportunity to rehearse
this manoeuvre at all, as it was not decided on
until after exercise ‘‘ Fabius,’ and the fact
that all successfully achieved it is considered
most satisfactory.

35. Sweeping was carried out in all cases
according to plan, despite stronger tidal streams
than had been allowed for and the unfavourable
weatlier, which made very difficult the opera-
tion of the Mark 5 sweeps by M.L.s, and the
minesweepers approached. the French coast
without interference. The early arrival of the
Western Task Force flotillas had been a cause
of some anxiety during planning but, because
surprise was in the event achieved, it had no
unfortunate result. The senior officérs of the
fiotillas concerned expressed surprise in their
reports that although the enemy coast at Cape
Barfleur was sighted as early as 2000 on 5th
June no batteries opened fire at them and the
operation proceeded unopposed; in this con-
nection it may be noted that minesweepers

Naval Bombardment. , ;
36. It had been planned that ships should
be ready to open fire at their pre-arranged tar-

‘gets either from the time when the assault

convoys came within, range of them or from
the time when it-was light enough for the
enemy to spot his fall of shot visually, which-
ever was the later; but that, if possible, fire
should be withheld until it was light enough for
air observation, In the event, this proved
possible with the exception of one or two ships
in the Western Task Force, who found it neces-
sary to open blind fire against certain batteries
whose fire was more accurate than was the
general case.

37. As Bombarding Force D arrived in posi-
tion on the Eastern Flank at 0515, a half-
hearted attack was made by four enemy
E-Boats and some armed trawlers which had
come out of Havre. The enemy were seen
indistinctly against the land and were almost
immediately obscured by the pre-arranged
smoke screen Jaid- by our aircraft, from behind
which they fired torpedoes. The heavy ships
managed to comb the torpedo tracks but the
Norwegian destroyer SVENNER was hit and
sunk. One enemy trawler was sunk and one
damaged; and the attack was not renewed. The
danger to friendly forces of smoke laid to a
pre-arranged plan was plainly exemplified.

38. The fire from enemy batteries, which was
never severe, was directed initially against bom-
barding ships only, and was largely ineffective.

STIS

This .is considered to have been due to the
combined success of the pre-D day bombing
programme, the heavy air bombardment in the
early hours of D day, and the measures taken
to prevent the enemy from ranging and spot-
ting; and it demonstrates that duels between
ships and coastal batteries are in certain even-
tualities feasible provided such precautions are
taken. It must be remembered, however, that
the scale of coast defence in the assault area
was the lowest on this part of the coast and
the results: would have’ been very different, for
instance, in the Pas de Calais. -Much of the
success of naval bombardment must be attri-
buted to the work of the single-seater fighter
spotters, who carried out their tasks tirelessly
and gallantly. Communications between bom-
barding ships and spotting aircraft suffered a
number of failures at the start owing mainly to
the novel nature of the technique, but they
improved rapidly with successive waves of
aircraft.

39. Warships and gun support craft took
part in the drenching of beach defences imme-
diately prior to the assault. .This fire appeared
accurate, and was of sufficient weight to
neutralise and demoralise the defenders, except
on OMAHA Beach where the total failure of
the day heavy bombers, due to low cloud base,
contributed to the much stiffer opposition than
was found elsewhere. Of the support craft
the L.C.G.(L)* deserves special mention.
This craft, which achieved only partial
success in the Mediterranean due to lack of
training and shortcomings in its equipment,
was particularly effective and further demon-
strated the value in assault of high velocity
-guns at close range. Since D day it has con-
tinued to provide effective direct and indirect
. fire support.

The Assaults.

40. The choice of the ‘‘ lowering positions ”’
(U.S. ‘‘ transport areas ’’)t had been a matter
of considerable discussion, the conflicting
factors of being outside the range of the enemy’s

e batteries and south of the known mined
area having to be balanced. The Eastern Task
“Force (British) finally cKdsé their ‘‘ lowering
positions '’ about 7 to 8 miles off shore, whilst
the Western Task Force (U.S.A.) decided to
place them further to seaward, ro to 11} miles
out. In the rough weather that obtained when
the assault forces arrived in the ‘‘ lowering
positions,’’ the longer passage inshore, for the
assault craft from the Western” Task Force
appeared to add appreciably to their difficulties,

41. To mark the approaches to the beaches
for Forces S and J two X-craft were employed
as it was very important that Force S should
not be too far to the eastward, and the coast
in Force J’s sector was not distinctive in out-
line. These craft had sailed on the night of ,
and/3rd June, being towed for part of the
passage. Each submarine received at oroo 5th
June a message that the assault had been
postponed 24 hours, and, in spite of the diffi-
culties of navigation for a craft of very slow
