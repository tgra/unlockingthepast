By the middle of March, the move of 81 additional heavy A.A. guns to the West Coast ports had been ordered, and shortly afterwards further increases amounting to another 104 heavy A.A. guns were arranged. Actual increases exceeded what had been planned: 58 guns were withdrawn from the Midlands in March, and 24 guns came from the factories: by 1st June a further 106 new guns had been deployed.,"

On the evening of the 2gth, the first occasion on which a massed target of ships was presented in Dunkirk Harbour, the enemy seized the opportunity for air attack in ' great strength, and it was only by good fortune that the vital Dunkirk Harbour channel was not blocked by sinking ships at this early date. From then onwards the scale and vigour of the air attack increased, and during the 1st June all ships in Dunkirk, off the beaches, or in the approach channels, were subjected every two hours to an unprecedented scale of air attack by aircraft in such numbers, that the R.A.F. were unable to deal with the situation. The scale of enemy air attack on June ist, and the fact that the Germans could by now command the newly-swept central route at its exits into the Dunkirk Roads with gunfire from the shore, were responsible for the suspension of daylight evacuation on June 2nd,"

The northern Route Y was usable only by night when later the batteries near Nieuport brought fire to bear on the Zuydecoote Pass, which was too narrow to permit a reasonable chance of ships running the gauntlet of fire. By this time, however, Route X was available, and was free of gunfire until German batteries near Gravelines brought its exit into the Dunkirk Roads under gunfire. This occurred in the afternoon on Saturday, 1st June, and in conjunction with the result of enemy air attack, led to the suspension of daylight traffic altogether."

The embarkation during the last two nights was carried out under conditions of considerable difficulty, rations and water were limited and the troops, scattered in various hiding places during the day to shelter from enemy air attack, were difficult to collect for embarkation. I ordered General Freyberg to return to Egypt on the night of 30th-31st May, and he and his staff were taken off by flying boat. General Weston remained in command and was taken off on the following night. It is regretted that a considerable number of troops had to be left behind, including an Australian battalion and the bulk of Layforce, who had all fought most skilfully and gallantly to the end."

It seemed difficult to persuade the authorities to consider seriously the possibility of war with Ttaly; and even as late as April I was still being refused permission, as the result of the Government policy of avoiding the provocation of Italy, to send any Intelligence agents over the frontier to obtain information of Italian dispositions, on the grounds that our relations with the Italians might thereby be impaired."

Eighth Army were thereby directed further northwards in conformity with the movements of the enemy whose withdrawal was now much more northerly, up the ArceAvezzano and Frosinone-Arsoli roads. 10 Corps was pursuing up the former, with -the New Zealanders in the lead, and 13 Corps up the latter, with 8 Indian and 78 Divisions. The Canadian Corps was to move up Route 6 through Ferentino to the Army boundary and prepare to pass 6 South ican Armoured Division through in pursuit through Rome. Should the enemy succeed in stabilizing on the  Caesar? line 13 Corps would join in a concentrated attack to the north of the Canadians. Ferentino fell on 1st June and the Canadians pushed on to Anagni, which was captured on the 3rd. By this time the fall of Rome was clearly imminent and Eighth Army turned its best efforts to get forward 6 South African and 6 British Armoured Divisions to lead the pursuit. It was not an easy task, for the South Africans had to pass through the, whole Canadian Corps and then found Route 6 blocked by the French Expeditionary Corps and II Corps. In spite of these irksome difiiculties it was inspiring to have these two fresh armoured divisions with which to press the pursuit of a fleeing enemy.
