            "description": ". As the operations were sure to prove most hazardous the possible advantages to be gained had to be carefully balanced against the chances of success and the cost of failure. Accordingly I reviewed the project again on 3rd September with the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, Admiral Harwood*, and the Air Officer Com- manding-in-Chief, Air Chief Marshal Tedder. t The fighting at El Alamein was then 1n full swing Two weeks\u2019 reserve of supplies on operational scales were all that the enemy had been able to accumulate for his offensive and, although there was little hope of doing irrepar- able damage to the ports, a temporary disloca- tion of supplies following the failure of the offensive (which was now obvious), might well prove disastrous to Rommel\u2019s Army. Even if the operations were unsuccessful they would un- doubtedly have an effect on enemy morale and probably lead him to take precautions against a future repetition which would diminish the Strength available for the defence of his posi- tions in Egypt. Air Chief Marshal Tedder pointed out that no air support whatever could be provided except an attack by bombers to help in covering the approach. Fighter cover was impossible throughout owing to the dis- tance. Admiral Harwood realized that the whole seaborne force, including the two destroyers he proposed to use, might well be lost, but he accepted the risk. It was finally decided that the effects of success would be great enough to justify the risks involved; orders were accordingly given for the operations to be carried out as planned."

Accordingly at 0700 hours of 7th September the battle was called off and Rommel was left in possession of a thin strip of ground which had advanced his posi- tions on the southern flank to a line running from the eastern end of Deir el Munassib to include the peak of Himeimat. The latter was valuable for the excellent observation which it gave as far north as Ruweisat ridge."

My inten- tion for the coming battle was to destroy the enemy in his present position where he was furthest from his bases and nearest to ours; this was the best opportunity we should have of developing our full strength and it was vital to ensure that we forced a decision there at El Alamein. Eighth Army proposed to use all three Corps Headquarters in the battle, 13 and 30 as Infantry Corps (with some armour) and zo Corps as an armoured Corps de Chasse. It was to this that particular attention was given at the start of the training period; ro Corps was intended to include 1, 8 and 10 Armoured Divisions and possibly the New Zealand Division to provide the necessary motorized infantry. This powerful force would need a good deal of training before it could be fit for the decisive test of battle. First of all the tank crews had to get used to their new equipment. Three hundred \u2018\u2018 Sherman \u2019\u2019 tanks arrived at Suez on 3rd September from the United States and I proposed to equip three of my six armoured brigades with them. I must express at this point my profound appre- ciation of the statesmanlike vision shown by President Roosevelt when, on his personal initiative, he ordered these new tanks to be taken from the American armoured division for which they were intended and shipped round the Cape to us in the Middle East. At last we had for the first time a tank which was equal in armour, armament and performance to the best tank in the Africa Corps, *"

            "description": "15th August, a conference attended by Roatta, the Italian Chief of Staff, and three other Italian Generals on the one hand and by Rommel, Jodi and Rintelen on the other\u2019. After some ugly bickering between Roatta and Jodl over the question of German troops being used for the \u201c protection\u2019\u2019 of the Brenner route the two p for the defence of the country were produced. The Italians wished for twelve German divisions of which nine were to be in Southern and Central Italy, one in Corsica, and only two in Northern Italy and Liguria; this figure excluded the four divi- sions from Sicily. This plan might reasonably cepa ii is - a i re desire to ve the defence of the whole pensinsula pro- vided for; but after the capitulation it was Late by Hitler as the basis of a charge that Bado- glio had schemed to draw the German forces far down into Italy, as far as possible from their bases, and dispersed in small groups which could be easily dealt with by the Italian troops in the same areas. The German plan for the disposition of their sixteen divisions (ie. including the four from Sicily) put eight in Northern Italy under Rommel, two near Rome and six in Southern Italy; the latter two forces were to be under Kesselring. This plan was the one adopted in the event. Proposals for the employment of Kesselring\u2019s forces, as reported to us by General Castellano, were still fluid and would be based on the Germans\u2019 own strength when the invasion came and their appreciation of the Allies\u2019 strength. In prin- ciple they intended to defend the line of the Apennines from Massa Carrara to Pesaro, the later \u2018\u2018 Gothic \u201d\u2019 line, though if the Allies were to attack this in great strength they would with- draw to the Po. If, however, the Allies showed little strength the Germans would attempt to hold a line\u2018from Grosseto, through Monte Amiata to Perugia and thence to Ancona.j Finally, if the circumstances and relative strengths were particularly favourable, an attempt would be made to stand south of Rome on the line Gaeta, Isernia, Vasto. This was a line which the Italians had already surveyed, and defences were already being prepared at certain points.} There is no need to detail the various stages of the German reinforcement of Italy and I will pass on to the situation as it presented it- self on 3rd September.\u00a7 For the immediate pur- pose dispositions in South Italy are the most important, and they were the best known at the time. Four divisions had been evacuated from Sicily; of these 29 Panzer Grenadier Divi- sion remained in Calabria, 15 Panzer Grena- dier and Hermann Goering Divisions moved to the Naples area to refit and 1 Parachute Divi- sion, less certain elements, moved to Altamura in Apulia. In addition to these there were two newly formed armoured divisions south of Naples: 26 Panzer Division|| in Calabria, based on the isthmus of Catanzaro and 16 Panzer Division covering the Gulf of Salerno. * The minutes of the meeting were found among the -+ This was, roughly, the Trasimene line on which ey offered delaying resistance in June 1944 on their withdrawal from Rome to the \u201c\u2018 Gothic \u201d line. } It tormed the basis for the German \u201c\u2018 Winter \u201d\u2019 line"

            "description": "An unexpected difficulty now arose because Castellano claimed he had no authority to sign the armistice and must first consult his Govern- ment. He was told plainly that our terms, in- cluding the new offer, must be accepted or re- jected by the night of rst-2nd September and that, whatever their decision, we should proceed with our plan for carrying the war to the Tfalian mainland. I have wondered since whether we should have been able to make good those bold words if the Italian decision had been negative, but at the time I had no doubt they would accept. On the other hand the military situation had been changing to our disadvantage every day since the plan for Salerno had first been proposed, in view of the constant arrival of fresh German forces.{ How- ever, the bluff was not called; within our specified time on Ist September the King and Badoglio agreed to our terms and at a quarter past five on 3rd September General Smith, on behalf and in the presence of General Eisen- hower, and General Castellano, on behalf of Marshal Badoglio, signed the Military Terms of Surrender. The scene of the signature was a tent in an almond grove near Cassibile; thir- teen hours ibefore, to the thunder of six hundred guns in the Straits of Messina, the Eighth Army had begun the first invasion of the continent of Europe."
