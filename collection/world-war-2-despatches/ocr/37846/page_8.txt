25 miles of it consisted of field telephone wire,
and the utmost difficulty was experienced in
using this line. Tihe force line or Fullerphone
to the main exchange was used whenever pos-
sible. Similarly, communication to Almyros
was not possible from Elason. It was therefore
decided to establish a system of relaying opera-
tion orders in code by telephone from the wing
commander at Elason to Larissa, where they
were further transmitted as appropriate either
direct to the fighter squadron at Larissa or by
telephone to the bomber squadrons at Niamata
or Almyros. For this purpose, an officer was
permanently standing by at Larissa to relay
operation orders.

Communication from Larissa to Niamata
only twelve miles away was reliable, but to
Almyros it was médst unsatisfactory, largely due
to the fact that the Air Defence Centre used
the Almyros line for reporting enemy aircraft.
As the campaign proceeded, so the demands
both of the wing and of the Air Defence Centre
augmented until finally it took as much as five
to six hours to pass a priority telephone mes-
sage from Larissa to Almyros. Thus it was
decided to use the squadron at Niamata for
any fleeting targets which presented themselves,
while the squadron at Almyros carried out
direct support operations, the need for which
could be foreseen some hours previously.

Organisation of Fighter Defence.

37. The Greek observer system consisting of
posts with sub-posts radiating from each and
linked to air defence centres by telephone,
operated with a certain degree of success, and
various interceptions of Italian aircraft had
been made over the Larissa area.

A fighter operations room was established at
Larissa and was run by the squadron stationed
there. Depending on alternative duties, air-
craft were standing by throughout the hours of
daylight. It was, however, inevitable to leave
the L. of C. and base area unprotected when
the fighters were required for escort duty or
protective duties over the forward troops.

The system worked well, although there was
little enemy air activity during the first few
days of the campaign. When, thowever, the
withdrawal of our troops began, the personnel
manning the posts of the observer system had
to withdraw and consequently the system broke
down,

Liaison with Force H.Q. ; s

38. The wing commander visited the force
commander in his office each morning as a
routine, and daily discussions were held in the
force commander’s mess both with him and
his B.G.S. The force commander was fully
informed of the air situation and made no ex-
cessive demands upon our resources. ‘Without
exception, the utmost was done to meet the
Tequirements of the army and every request
for reconnaissance made by the force com-
mander or the B.G.S. was followed by a faith-
ful endeavour to carry out that task. At the
outset, however, weather was a serious hind-
rance, and in spite of the most frequent and
determined attempts, many failures had to be

every other aspect of the air situation were dis-
cussed, and complete agreement was expressed
with the direction and operations of the squad-
Tons supporting the army. Neither the force
commander nor the B.G.S. permitted them-
selves to indicate more than a general plan,
in view of the rapidly changing situation, and
they always expressed their agreement in the
suggested methods of meeting any particular
circumstances.

could be operated in closer co-operation with
the military forces than was in fact the case
during the opening days of the Balkan cam-
paign. ‘Whatever shortcomings there may have
been in the support given by the air forces,
they certainly cannot be attributed to lack of
oc-operation or to lack of the most faithful
endeavours of our pilots. At every available
opportunity, aircraft of this wing were doing
their utmost to carry out the multifarious tasks
which were required of them.

6th-gth April—The German Advance.

39. On the morning of the 6th April, the
German forces were on the march. e bulk
of the enemy moved west from the Strima
valley, filtering by all available roads into each
valley and gorge, inundating every plain with
their swiftly moving forces. The first air re-
ports indicated that an attack was being made
upon Mt. Beles and the Rupel Pass. Simul-
taneously, our reconnaissance aircraft reported
movement of M.T., on the road west from
Petrich.

It was certain that this movement would be
covered by fighter patrols, and the fighters
were sent off to carry out a sweep over the
road and over the Greeks on Mt. Beles and in
the Rupel Pass. Twelve Hurricanes met twenty
Me.zogs. and our fighters shot down five with-
wut loss to themselves. This disposed of any
anxiety or over cautiousness which the squad-
ron commander of the fighters had felt about
the change over from Italians to Germans.
Whereas, at the outset, the squadron com-
mander expressed the view that his aircraft
could not operate in formations of less than
twelve, he now agreed that. formations of six
would be able to escort Blenheim formations
across the line. This meant that the base area
only had to be left completely unprotected
when the Hurricanes went off m strength to
patrol over our forward troops. In the cir-
cumstances, the wing commander considered
it a reasonable division of fighter strength.

Meanwhile, reconnaissances of the Struma
valley were being carried out. During the
course of that night Sofia, Gorna Djumaya,
Simitli and Petrich were bombed by (Wellington
and Blenheim aircraft both from Athens and
from the Larissa plain. These raids were most
successful, and pilots on their return reported
good results. The weather was bad on the
following day and no reconnaissance was pos-
sible, but it was anticipated that considerable
concentrations of enemy M.T would be found
at Strumitsa. Late in the afterncon, in spite
of severe weather, some of our aircraft got
through and bombed the rich target presented
by the heavy congestion of German M.T. con-
fined to the road in this area by marshes and
