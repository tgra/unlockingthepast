5926 SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1941

at the time they had nothing available save
the 68th Division and the regional troops,
they did not demur. ,

However, so far as I am aware, no action was
ever taken in this respect.

Description of the Dunkirk Perimeter.

48. The British sector of the Dunkirk peri;
meter had its right at Bergues, and thence
followed the canals to Furnes and Nieuport.
These places were old-fashioned fortified towns,
easy to defend but affording good bombing
targets. The destruction of the bridges pre-

sented no difficulty, and all were in fact blown ~

in time by British or French troops except that
at Nieuport which was wide and solid, and could
not be demolished before the arrival of the enemy.
Two natural switch lines were available: the
canal from Bergues to Dunkirk and the Canal
des Moeres from Dunkirk south-east towards
Hondschoote.

Immediately north of this line came the
inundations, extending from Bergues over the
district of the Moeres to a width varying from
one to three miles. Except in a few places,
they did not cover the roads but were designed.
to leave them clear, while preventing deploy-
ment. They did, however, sometimes prevent
troops from digging themselves in. On the
Belgian side of the frontier the order to begin
the inundations was not given by Belgian G.Q.G.
till the morning of 26th May and they never
became effective.

To the north of the inundations was more
low-lying land ; then came the Bergues—Furnes
Canal, and the main lateral road from Furnes
to Dunkirk. Finally there was the narrow
strip of dunes giving way to a wide, open beach
running the whole length of the position and
shelving very slowly to the sea. There were no
quays or piers whatever except those at Dunkirk
itself. At intervals of about a mile along the
shore lay the seaside resorts of Coxyde, La
Panne, Bray Dunes and Malo-les-Bains.

Layout of the Sector and Problem of Trafic Control.

49. Sir Ronald Adam, on leaving Cassel,
went at once to the headquarters of the 48th
Division at Bergues to find out the latest situa-
tion and in particular what troops were imme-
diately available either to hold the perimeter
or to control the traffic. He learnt that the
enemy were advancing north eastwards from
the.Forest of Clairmarais: there could therefore
be no question of using any of the reserves of
48th Division, and the only troops immediately
available were certain engineer units. General
Thorne, however, lent his C.R.A. (Brigadier
Hon. E. F. Lawson) who was instructed to lay
out the defence of the perimeter, and to use for
the purpose such troops as were on the spot,
or were entering the perimeter.

The position was then divided into three
Corps areas, each including a collecting area
outside the perimeter, a sector of the canal line
and a sector of the beach.

Already it was seen that the traffic problem
was going to assume formidable proportions.
Ever since the roth May it had been a potential
source of trouble, but it had been kept in hand

in the early stages by strict adherence to pre- -

arranged plans and by the use of infantry for
traffic control. Once the withdrawal from the
Dyle began, the problem became acute in France
as well as in Belgium. Refugees began to leave

their homes in northern France before the French
Government put into operation the plans they
had made. The French organisations were not
available and no British troops could be spared
to control the traffic. The refugee problem had
therefore become incfeasingly acute, and the
tide which at first set westwards from Belgium
had now met the enemy again in the
Somme area and had begun to turn back on
itself. Scenes of misery were everywhere, and
the distress of women, children and aged people
was pitiable. Fortunately the fine weather
and warm nights mitigated their plight to some
degree and though the outbreak of famine was
expected at any moment it did not actually
occur in the area of the B.E.F. Little, un-
fortunately, could be done to help the refugees,
since supplies for the troops were still seriously
short. Moreover their presence on the roads
was often a grave menace to our movement.
It had been necessary to give Corps a free hand
in handling them: on occasions it had been
necessary to turn vehicles into the fields in
order to keep the roads clear.

During the 27th May, troops and their trans-
port began to withdraw into the perimeter on
the fronts of all three Corps; and where the
troops had received the necessary orders,

“vehicles were disabled and abandoned in the

assembly areas. The few troops who could be
spared for traffic control did not, however,
prove sufficient for the purpose, and conse-
quently a great number of British and French
vehicles entered the perimeter and the town
of Dunkirk when they should have remained
outside. There was inevitably a large number
of vehicles which had become detached from
their units, and a number of cases also occurred
that day in which units became separated from
their formations and arrived within the peri-
meter without sufficiently clear orders. These
were sent to reinforce the defence of the peri-
meter, or embarked, as seemed best to those in
control, :

Next day (28th May) when Corps started to

. take charge in their areas, the difficulties with

the British traffic were cleared up, only to be
replaced by difficulties with the French traffic.

The French 60th Division began to arrive
from Belgium, and at the same time rearward,
elements of their light mechanised divisions
appeared from the south-east and south. These
were soon followed by the transport of the
French 3rd Corps, mainly horsed. None of
these appeared to have received orders to leave
their transport outside the perimeter: seldom
did they do so unless compelled by British
traffic control posts.

By the 28th, Brigadier Lawson, using the
greatest energy, had succeeded in the urgent
task of manning the perimeter from Bergues to
Nieuport with troops from a number of units,
chiefly artillery.

50. The Admiralty had placed-the naval
arrangements for embarkation in the hands of
the Dover Command, A Senior Naval Officer
had been sent to Dunkirk to work out detailed
plans, and steps had been taken to collect a
large number of small ships, and of boats for
taking troops from the beach out to the ships.

On 27th May, however, these arrangements
had not had time to take effect, nor had it yet
been possible to provide sufficient naval ratings
to man the beaches. Yet a start was made;
