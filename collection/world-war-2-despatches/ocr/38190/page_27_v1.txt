NOTES 1 All figures are approximate as accurate information can only be obtained when the Casualty Bureau has all facts and figures 2 The wounded does not mclude lightly, or returned for duty, wounded The total wounded shown 1s 1,332 but ADMS states that 2,000 wounded men passed through our hospitals alone, and many of the wounded of the 5/7 Rayput Regt fell nto Japanese hands and have not been recorded The final figures will probably be approximately

4 Regardmg Japanese casualties

A local paper reported a Memorial Service held at Kai Tak Aerodrome to 1,995 Japanese who fell in the attack on Hong Kong That figure is certain to be an under rather than an over statement.

A Japanese Medical Major told me early in January 1942, when I was appealing for assistance for my sick and wounded, that he had g,o0o wounded on his hands m Kowloon and on the Island.

Taking the wounded figure to be correct, and remembermg that many must have been drowned on the assault on the Island, the averages of the last war should give about 3,000 and NOT 1,995 killed

The Japanese admitted in broadcasts and in conversation to me that they had suffered severe casualties,

The Chimese have stated that 10,000 were killed, but this 1s undoubtedly an oriental exaggeration.

True figures will never be known, but from the above a fair estimate can be made  

% Killed . on Pa 3,000 Wounded ans Or ss 9,000 . Total . a 5 12,000

And many of the latter died of thew wounds, for funeral pyres near their hospitals were observed regularly for some months,
