in view of the fact that the threat to our bases
in the Middle East and Iraq is likely to be more
serious from the north than from the west,
according to the information at present avail-
able to us. .

5. We are unlikely to be in sufficient strength
by next spring to prosecute an offensive in the
west and at the same time hold off a determined
attack from the north.

6. Apart from the possible need for with-
drawing forces from General Cunningham to
reinforce our Northern Front, it may still be
necessary to withdraw troops from him in order
to keep demands for maintenance within the
transport resources available. Every effort is
to be made, however, by all concerned to avoid
having recourse to this expedient, if it is likely
in any way to prejudice the full attainment of
his object by General Cunningham.

30th October, 1941.

I. Object.._To destroy enemy armoured
forces.

2. Implications of object.—(a) Must do some-
thing to bring enemy to battle on ground of
our choosing—not of his.

Q. What will make enemy move out to
meet us?
A. An obvious move to-raise siege of

Tobruk.

1st Deduction.—Therefore strong forces must
be directed on Tobruk.

(6) Enemy miust be brought to batile east of
Tobruk, otherwise he will fight delaying actions
and evade destruction.

Q. What must be done to effect this?

A. Surprise in time and direction of main
thrust is essential.

and Deduction—Long range plans for
deception as to intention to attack and date
of attack and possible direction of attack
must be thorough and continuous.

3rd Deduction.—Weight and nature of
main concentration must be concealed as long
as possible.

4th Deduction.—Preliminary movement
by feinting columns or detachments must not

take place prior to advance of main attacking -

force.

3. Our Action._-(a) To move strongest pos-
sible armoured and motorised force (30 Corps)
towards Tobruk. .

(6) Break-out to be made by tanks and
infantry of Tobruk garrison in conjunction with
this move.

(c) Vigorous feints and raids by light mobile
forces to west and north-west from the line
Maddalena—Giarabub.

4. Enemy reaction._Enemy may: (@) Keep
his two armoured divisions where they are,
north of escarpment beween Bardia and
Tobruk, hoping Jater to strike at maintenance
service of our 30 Corps and thus paralyse it,
while retaining free communication with his
own base in above-mentioned area.

SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 10948

5th Deduction.—If he does this we should
at once secure escarpment, picquet gaps, so
as to prevent tank movement; then relieve
Tobruk and invest or overrun Bardia—
Sollum—Capuzzo with 13 Corps.

(0) Keep his armoured force north of escarp-
ment, move west towards Tobruk and then
position himself south of it, with a view to
taking in flank attempts by us to raise siege.
This entails his abandoning forces in Bardia—
Sollum—Capuzzo.

6th Deduction.—In this event, we must be
ready to push on with all speed with 30
Corps, join hands with Tobruk sally force
and pinch his armoured force between the
escarpment and Tobruk.

(c) Allow our 30 Corps to move on towards
Tobruk and thrust with his armoured force
through his defences in the area Sidi Omar—
Halfaya, and attempt to destroy 13 Corps and
our advanced dumps, railhead, etc., south of
Sidi Barrani.

7th Deduction.—To guard against this, all
possible defensive measures, such as laying
minefields, positioning field and anti-tank
artillery and holding ‘‘I’’ tanks in readiness
must be taken.

(@) Abandon Bardia—Sollum, raise siege of
Tobruk and withdraw towards Derna, Bengasi
and El Agheila without giving battle.

8th Deduction—In this event, which is
possible but not likely, we must be ready to
improvise highly mobile columns comprising

illery and motorised units to pursue him
at once, and by outflanking his columns and
infiltrating between them delay him, and so
enable our armoured forces to bring him to
battle before he can consolidate in new posi-
tions to the westward.

(e) Move his armoured force south of escarp-
ment to a suitable area north of Trigh el Abd
and west of Capuzzo with object of striking at
our 30 Corps in flank and heading it off
Tobruk, his eastern flank being protected by
his Sidi Omar—Halfaya defences.

gth Deduction.—I£ the does this, which
seems to ‘be his most likely course, we must
accept battle and concentrate the strongest
possible armoured force against him in this
area

roth Deduction—Any subsidiary move-
ments, which might require the detachment
of tanks, other than ‘'I’’ tanks, for their
local protection against possible attack by
enemy armoured forces, must be foregone,
in the interests of ensuring the strongest
possible concentration of fast armoured units
for the decisive battle. This does not forbid
the movement of motorised forces mentioned
in para. 3 (c), as these depend on speed for
safety, but does preclude the movement of
large forces of infantry and artillery round
the southern flank of the Sidi Omar—Halfaya

—Bardia positions with the idea of isolating

the enemy holding these positions; the

forward-‘movement of highly mobile motorised
forces in this area, however, is not precluded.

If the armoured battle ends in a decisive

success, these enemy troops can be dealt

with at leisure, and the same applies to the
enemy investing Tobruk.

5. Summary.—(a) 30 Corps with all available
Cruiser and American tanks to be directed on
Tobruk with a view to bringing enemy main
