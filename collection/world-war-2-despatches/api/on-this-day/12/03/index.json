            "description": "While the Eighth Army was getting ready to attack El Adem, the enemy made a final thrust towards the frontier. On the 3rd December two strong fighting patrols set out for Bardia, one taking the coast road, and the other the Trigh Capuzzo. The 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade opposed the one north-east of Gambut and a detachment of the 5th Indian Infantry Brigade engaged the other near Sidi Azeiz. Both patrols were completely routed and suffered heavy losses. The next day a third and more powerful column, containing about tanks, left the main leaguer at Sidi Rezegh and set off down the Trigh Capuzzo. It was bombed by our aircraft and attacked by the Support Group; and, on encountering troops of the 2nd South African Division, which had just arrived, the column turned back without making any further effort to reach Bardia."

The infantry company took to the hills and did not rejoin 36 Brigade  until 21st November, having conducted a successful guerilla campaign against the enemy's rear. The brigade advanced slowly against slight opposition and many mines and booby traps to Jefna, where the enemy occupied a very strong position on commanding ground. Several attempts to dislodge him from these heights failed. Losses were heavy. x Commando landed 14 miles west of Bizerta and worked south in an endeavour to get behind and dislodge the enemy at Jefna.

            "description": "i Special Service Force and 36 Division attacked the northern third of the mountain mass to gain Monte La nen and bale Maggiore. Air support on that day was heavy and tae the rat time was not reduced by weather. Both Corps  attacks were successful. On 6th December 10 Corps captured the summit of Monte Camino, which they had almost secured on the 3rd but failed to hold against counter-attacks, and on the oth Rocca d Evandro was captured. This brought 10 Corps to the Garigliano all along its front. II Corps captured La Difensa on 3rd December and held it against strong counter-attacks, and on the 8th captured and mopped up Monte La  Remetanea. 36 Division's attack on Monte Maggiore, the northernmost and lowest peak, had succeeded by the night of the 3rd; counter-attacks were repulsed and by the 7th the position could be considered secured.   Between then and the xrth ro Corps took over the whole of the feature from II Corps. Between 29th November and gth December VI Corps on Fifth Army's right made diversionary attacks along the axes of the Colli Atina and Filignano Sant  Elia roads. Very little ground was gained in tangled and difficult country, with peaks rising to over twelve hundred metres. 2 Moroccan Division began to relieve 34 Division on the Corps  right on 8th December. Phase I of the Army Commander's plan was now, however, completed with the capture of the Camino massif and Phase II was ordered to start on 7th December. In this phase ro Corps had a minor defensive r le; the principal objective was the clearing of Monte Sammucro and this was assigned to II Corps. VI Corps was to continue to drive westwards along the roads to Atina and Sant  Elia but on a larger scale facilitated by the accession to its strength of the fresh and mountain trained Moroccan Division. It was hoped that by attacking on so wide a front the enemy would be sufficiently stretched to prevent him massing for the defence of Cassino. The bitterest fighting took place for Monte Sammucro and the village of San Pietro in Fine below it. The attack began on 7th December; the first two high points on Sammucro were seized without exceptional difficulty but after that our troops were held until the 13th by severe German counter-attacks and heavy mortar and artillery fire. On the 8th the Italian Motorised Group failed in an attack on Monte Lungo, in the throat of the gap. The second battle for San Pietro opened on the a5th and succeeded, though at heavy cost in casualties, by the 17th; Monte Lungo was also occupied and, north of the village, we forced our way further along the knife-edge of Monte Sammucro. This was bitter mountain fighting, with great use of artillery and gains in territory small compared with the time consumed and the losses suffered. There was still another enemy position, almost equally as strong as San Pietro, just a short distance ahead, based on the western end of Monte Sammucro and the lower hills covering the village of San Vittore. But 36 Division was exhausted and on 29th December had to be relieved by the 34th before San Vittore was taken. The VI Corps attack on the right had also made little progress against difficulties of ground and stubborn enemy defence; by the end of the year it could only be said to have kept level with the advance of II Corps with"

G.H.Q. stated that the Japanese had adequate forces to carry out such a move but placed no great credence in the report. They assumed that if such a convoy did leave Saigon it would travel at 15 knots or less and anchor off Nakwan or between Singora and Patani on the S.E. coast of Siam on the morning of either the. 30th November or rst December. G.H.Q. ordered: A.H.Q. to despatch air reconnaissances daily with a view to locating this Force, but in view of the danger that the Japanese might, by holding out a bait, induce us to strike the first blow and thus appear to be the aggressors, with consequent loss of American sympathy, stated that  a striking force will not be ordered to attack the convoy if found . From this day until 3rd December, reconnaissances proceeded without event except that on the 3rd December two large cargo boats were sighted."

The object of the operation was to establish an advanced naval and air base for the exploitation of our naval and air superiority, to assist operations in Burma and to prepare for an early advance on Malaya.

About midDecember, however, it became apparent that the enemy was not going to do so and was withdrawing his main forces southwards. It is therefore worth while reviewing the enemy's situation at this stage. _ 55, At the end of November, the enemy's alignment was as I have described in paragraph 22. By the 3rd December, however, we had cross the Chindwin at three points and held bridgeheads at Sittaung, Mawlaik and Kalewa. The Japanese, of necessity, had conformed to the advance of Fourteenth Army and Northern Combat Area Command by withdrawing southwards. The enemy situation on the 7th December was that 33 Japanese Division held from Gangaw to the north of Kalewa, with 15 Japanese Division on its right extended up to the railway above Wuntho. 31 Japanese Division remained in the Ye-U area, while 53 Japanese Division filled the  gap between Wuntho and the Irrawaddy, with 18 Japanese Division on. its right up to the Bhamo-Namhkam road. 56 Japanese Division held between Namhkam and _ the Salween River. 2 Japanese Division had been withdrawn from this front and was believed to be in reserve in Central Burma in. the vicinity of Pyinmana. Further south, 49 Japanese Division remained in the Pegu area."
