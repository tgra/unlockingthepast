Officer-inCharge, Suda at Sphakia saving Boe up to 1 000 troops would be available for evacuation atthe following night but another message was recsived from CREFORCE stating that it was unlikely that the, troops could hold out until the night goth/ 3ist May. CREFORCE thought that   an optimistic view   of the fighting troops which could be evacuated, was under 2,000 but.there would be a number of stragglers (CREFORCE 0.672 timed 1310 of 28th May). Tt was deduced from these two signals that the situation in Crete was very bad but that 10,000 troops remained to be evacuated. Of these, only 2,000 would be in organised bodies.- The night 2oth/30th May, would have to be the last night for evacuation."

Force B was about go miles from Scarpanto at 1700 and from then until dark was subjected to a series of air attacks, consisting of high level bombing, dive bombing and torpedo, attack, At 1920 IMPERIAL was-near missed but at the time appeared to be undamaged. At 2100 AJAX had a close miss which started a small fire, seriously wounded twenty men and caused slight damage to the ship's side. In view of the need for ships to be fully efficient to carry out the night evdcuation and to cope with the almost certain air attacks on the following day, C.S.7, after receiving a report of the damage from AJAX, decided that she should return to Alexandria. Shortly. after zioo, C.S.7 gave orders accordingly."

After taking this decision the news of the intention of His Majesty's Government to evacuate Northern Norway was received, and it became necessary to consider whether the operation was to be proceeded with or not. After consulting General Bethouart, I recommended to Lord Cork that it should be carried out as intended on the night of 27/28th May. In doing so I considered that, apart from the desirability of making sure whether the facilities for shipping ore from Narvik had in fact been destroyed as thoroughly as had been teported, the chances that a successful attack would do imuch to conceal our intention to evacuate the country in the immediate future would outweigh the possible disadvantages involved in extending our commitments by establishing troops in close contact with the enemy on the Narvik Peninsula, where his main force was thought to be located."
