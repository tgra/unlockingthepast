PEERATIONS IN THE INDIA COMMAND, FROM ist JANUARY, 1943, - TO zota JUNE, 1943.

PREFACE BY THE WAR OFFICE.

SINCE the conclusion of hostilities with Japan, certain Japanese documents, handed over to the Headquarters of the 12th Army in Burma  after the Japanese surrender have been exammed. It has [been established from these documents, that the Japanese plan of operations in Burma for the winter 1942-43, was to make an offensive into India against the oilfield at Tinsukia via the Hukawng Valley, and with another force to capture Imphal and then Dimapur, in order to out off any Allied Troops in the Tinsukia area and to occupy Northern Assam. A Japanese document gives as the reasons why these plans were not put into effect, first the Allied offensive in Arakan and secondly the penetration of Brigadier Wingate's 77th Brigade into Northern Burma. By Japanese admissions, Field Marshal Viscount Wavell's operations, described in this Despatch, accomplished their main purpose, which was by offensive action to keep the Japanese forces engaged and thereby prevent an offensive into India at a time when India was unprepared.

  The' following Despatch was submitted to the

Secretary of, State for War on 27th June,

1944, by FIELD-MARSHAL VISCOUNT

WAVELL, G.C.B., C.M.G., H.C , A.D.C.,

Commander-n-Chief, India,

PLANS FOR FIRST HALF OF 1943.

2. The objectives I had laid down for the Winter of 1942-43 were the capture of Akyab in Arakan; the strengthening of our position in the Chin Hills (1. ., about Tiddim and Fort White), and the establishment of forces on  the Chindwin river between Kalewa and Sittaung, whence the Japanese lines of communication further east were to be raided, and preparations were to be made for a further advance into Upper Burma should opportunity offer.

These British operations were to be combined as closely as possible with operations by Chinese troops directed by General Stilwell (who held the post of Chief of Staft to the Generalissimo, Marshal Chiang Kar-shek). These aimed at occupying North-East Burma as far as an approximate line Myitkyina  Bhamo Lashio, with the object of covering* the construction of a road from Ledo ito China, which was being made by American engineers A Chinese force from Ledo, with American direction but under my control, was to advance on Myitkyina to join hands with a Chinese force from Yunnan, which General Stilwell informed me would advance in strength on March Ist, 1943 I had a conference with General Stilwell on December roth, at -which I undertook to do all I could towards assisting a Chinese advance from Yunnan.and reoccupying Upper Burma in the spring of 1943; but I

 emphasized the seriousness of the .adminis-

trative problem, our limited resources, and the unlikelihood of any rapid progress owing to road-making difficulties, both from Ledo towards Myitkyina and eastwards from the Imphal plain towards the Chindwin. ~

The troops, actually available in India at the beginning of 1943 and the state of their training and equipment are shown in Appendix A.
