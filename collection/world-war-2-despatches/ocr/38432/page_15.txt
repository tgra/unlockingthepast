SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 18 OCTOBER, 1948

14. At 1730, a conference was held with the
local authorities and it was decided to repeat
the previous night’s patrol, with the addi-
tional proviso that if any shipping at all was
sighted near Ist, a pre-arranged pyrotechnic
signal would ‘be made from the Partisan look-
out post.

Having thus secured the rear, the unit pro-
ceeded to Vir at 1825.

15. It had been decided that the big demon-
stration put up by the enemy the previous
night (which included torpedoes fired by
E-boats at Mulat breakwater) was aimed at
eliminating some “‘tigers’’ and/or M.G.B.s
and that it was probable he would try and
run a big convoy north this night. Hence the
unit closed Vir Island and was disposed along
the coast to meet a northbound convoy.

16. Some flares were seen to the southwards,
and there were lights and flickerings in the sky
over Nin—all appeared to be set. At 2215 some
vertical tracer was seen off Zara.

At about 2220 H.M.M.T.B.63q’s starboard
outer engine pushed a conrod through the crank
case and most of the engine-room crew were
overcome by fumes.

At about 2245 all the boats started rolling, as
if a lot of ships had passed by to seawards, so
at 2300 the unit proceeded northwards, a guess
that eventually proved correct.

17. The visibility was now very low, due to
widely scattered low cloud, but I was not pre-
pared for the shock of suddenly seeing enemy
ships on the port bow, at about four hundred
yards’ range.

The unit was at once stopped and the boats
headed into the shore just north of Vir light.
The targets were now seen to be four
F-lighters, of which one was altering course
towards us: he appeared to be higher out of
the water ithan the others and was possibly an
escorting flak lighter: he had probably sighted
one or more of the unit and was closing to
drive us off.

18. H.M.M.T.B.634 was ordered to try and
carry out a snap torpedo attack on this target,
whilst H.M.M.G.B.662 ordered “‘ single line
ahead, speed 8 knots’’, and went ahead in
order to engage the remainder by gunfire.

The flak boat opened fire on H.M.M.G.B.662
at 2306, at once killing one of the pom-pom
loading numbers. Fire was returned from all
guns and H.M.M.T.B.638 illuminated with
starshell.

19. It is scarcely possible to describe the next
ten minutes. The visibility was such that the
leading boat in the line had a completely dif-
ferent picture from the fourth boat, and the
slight offshore breeze was blowing the smoke
from H.M.M.G.B.662’s gunfire across the line
of sight of our ships and the enemy convoy,
which was, of course, much more of an advan-
tage to us than them as we had the inshore
position and knew where to expect them, while
the only ship that they could see was
H.M.M.G.B.662. But it will, in fact, be
easier to give the impressions of each boat
during this phase of the action and try to paint
the picture that each one saw, than to give a
coherent account of what the unit did.

H.M.M.G.B.662’s Narrative.

20. H.M.M.G.B.662 had drawn ahead of
H.M.M.T.B.634, who had manceuvred for a
torpedo attack, and was engaging many tar-
gets on the port side, including F-lighters,
Pi-L Boats* and E-boats. Very heavy 88-m.m.
and 20-m.m. was coming our way, all high,
from a variety of enemy vessels and this fire
had a strong blinding effect on my bridge.
Nevertheless, I saw a Pi-L Boat hit by the
6-pounder and blow up, starting a petrol fire
on the surface of the water.

In the light of H.M.M.T.B.638’s starshell
ahead, I saw F-lighters being hit by my pom-
pom and Oerlikon. I saw an E-boat in the
light of the petrol fire hit, set alight and blow
up—a victory achieved by the bridge .303-inch
Vickers, and on the port quarter I witnessed
an inspiring display of 6-pounder gunnery.
An F-lighter, at about four hundred yards, was
steering away from us, unilluminated and
almost invisible, even through binoculars, yet
the 6-pounder fired nearly thirty rounds that
scored hits in about a minute. The 6-pounder
also hit and sank a Pi-L Boat with an inert
cargo.

Meanwhile, H.M.M.G.B.662 had crossed the
northern end of the convoys and was lying
stopped, waiting for the other boats to rejoin,
and trying to.ensure that no enemy got away.

It had been intended to work round to the
west of the enemy immediately and engage
them against the fires of their burning vessels,
but this was not possible until all the boats
had come round.

Everywhere on the port side there were
burning ships and explosions. There were
visible many more ships than the original four
F-lighters. The sight was fantastic.

H.M.M.T.B.634’s Narrative.

2x. H.M.M.T.B.634  says—‘‘ The Senior
Officer signalled single line ahead speed 8 knots
and opened fire on the enemy, which now
appeared clearly as four F-lighters, three of
which were stopped or proceeding slowly north-
wards in single port cruising line. One was
closing. I prepared to attack the flak-lighter
with torpedoes, but the range had closed to
one hundred yards by the time the sight was
on and I decided that it was too close, so I
altered back to starboard, and opened up with
all guns on the flak-lighter who was firing at
H.M.M.G.B.662. As I turned, less than fifty
Yards from the flak-lighter, H.M.M.T.B.634
was hit in the port pom-pom ready use locker
which exploded and went up in flames. The
fire was promptly extinguished. All our guns
continued to pour an intense fire into the flak-
lighter which burst into flames from stem to
stern, by the light of which every detail of her
could be discerned. She appeared to have an
88-m.m. amidships, a quadruple 20-m.m. aft
and many 20-m.m. in sponsons down the star-
board side. Her bridge collapsed and she
appeared to be breaking in two. I steered
parallel to the enemy who was turning slowly
to port, at less than forty yards. Then another
F-lighter, followed by two more, appeared very
close to seaward of the burning flak-lighter.
