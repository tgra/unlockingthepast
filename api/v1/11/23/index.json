The enemy was certainly taken by surprise: his forces were actually in process of taking up fresh dispositions for an attack on Tobruk due to take place on the 23rd November. On the igth what appeared to be the bulk of the Ger- man armoured divisions moved south from the coastal area, where they had been lying, and engaged the 4th and 22nd Armoured Brigades a few miles west of Sidi Omar."

            "description": "This shifting of the balance of strength between the opposing armoured forces pro- duced a most critical situation and led General Cunningham to represent to me that a con- tinuation of our offensive might result in the annihilation of our tank force, and so endanger the safety of Egypt. I visited General Cun- ningham at his advanced headquarters on the 23rd November and told him to continue to press the offensive against the enemy. He loyally gave effect to these orders; but on my return to Cairo on the 25th, I most reluctantly decided that I must relieve him of his com- mand, as I had come to the conclusion, after long. and anxious consideration, that he was unduly influenced by the threat of an enemy counterstroke against his communications. I therefore replaced him on the 26th November by Major-General N. M. Ritchie."
