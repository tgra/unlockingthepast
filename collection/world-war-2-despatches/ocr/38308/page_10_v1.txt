3298 that Formosa-based planes  were taking part. I'came to the'conclusion during the evening that

we must contrive to remain for a further period; .

" even if we could do little more'than occasionally

strike at the Sakishima Gunto we should any- -

how provide an alternative target to take some of the weight. A.C.r had evidently come to the same conclusion, for at 2113 he informed

me that, in view, of the very heavy air attacks - ,

being launched against American forces on and around Okinawa, he felt that our remaining aircraft and aircrews could manage a fifth operating period provided that our losses tomorrow should remain small. . In the event, and as.he points out in his report, the Formosa attack days acted as tonic. I therefore made the following signal:   :

COM 5th Fleet (R) CTG 52. I Guin, B.P.F. CINC PAC: CIF 112 From CIF 57 . . In view of current situation expect to be _ Teady further operations 16th-r7th April. If Formosa weather bad tomorrow intend deal with Ishigaki and significant intercepted _ traffic between Sakishima and Formosa both ways. ao

 13th April. Task Force 51 covered: Sakishima Gunio. 0530. -'A.C.1 assumed tactical command.

. At 0550 four fightets were flown off. A bogey originally detected at 0540 developed into an ineffective raid by four Vals accompanied by a radar-fitted search plane probably performing the .dual role of pilot plane and Gestapo, One Val dive bombed,. but missed, H.M.S: INDOMITABLE.". This aircraft switched on  navigation lights and fired an incorrect tecognition cartridge... If was engaged but probably not hit. A's cond was shot down  by gunfire of the Fleet.

" Unfortunately, gunfire  also shot cane one

Hellcat which failed to clear the Fleet during

- the attack, and the pilot was killed.

- At 0615 the CAP proper: was flown off in position 23  58.5  N 122  46  E.

At 0640 a small ee of bogeys was inter-"

cepted 25 miles to the north west. of the Fleet; two Zekes were splashed by Cotsairs aca the remainder retired to the, northward.

At 0645 Avenger strikes were flown to attack

- Matsuyama and Shinchiku airfields.  

_ The weather over Matsuyama was fair, runways, barracks and dispersal poirits were successfully bombed, and a petrol or ammunition

dump blown up. Few aircraft were seen on the  

airfield.   Fighters shot up about 12 aircraft on Giran airfield without apparent result. .

The other Avenger force bombed Shinchiku airfield through low cloud, hitting runway intersections and installations. No aircraft were lost in: either of these strikes and there was no airborne opposition.

The Firefly CAP for the Dumbo attacked:the,

suspected radar station on Yonakuni Shima with rockets and apparently destroyed it. When telieved, they: also shot up luggers and small craft in the- harbour close to Iriizaki.

After these bomber strikes were flown on, the Fleet disengaged to the south eastward to refuel.

At 1300 Hellcats'intercepted 3 Zekes  about 40 miles north of the Fleet, and Corsairs inter-

made accordingly :  



cepted a Dinah escorted by Tojos.* enemy aircraft escaped in cloud.  CTF assumed tactical command, at. 1945. Enemy losses: Destroyed airborne 3 Probably . destroyed odes ground: 5. Probably daraged on  alata I. * Own losses: In combat 1. ; It was with profound grief that Task Force 57   learned of the death of, the President of the - United States. A signal of sympathy was sent to CINCPOA on behalf of Task Forces 57 and Ir2. 5 *

At 1840 the following signal -was recdived and plans for a fifth operating period were

CIF 57 " From COM sth Fleet   Cover Sakishima 16th and r7th unless other orders received in interim. Affirmative your message of 12th. Appreciate your co-opera. tion and initiative.

14th April.

H.M. Ships FORMIDABLE, KEMPENFELT and WESSEX were also met and joined

Fuelling was commenced in fine weather and proceeded with less delays than usual. .

As from. today  the United States Fleet was . ordered to half mast colours, and I gave orders that British ships in harbour; or near thereto, should conform. Since United States ships do

- not, I understand, fly their colours in the-

operation areas and the half masting of our colours at sea in war is I believe only done when convoying or burying the deceased, the position  was not clear as  regards TF 57. I felt it fitting, however, and in keeping with what I knew to be.the feeling of the Fleet for this great leader and sincere friend. of the British Empire, to mark the occasion irrespective of precedent; therefore I ordered colours t   be half masted for the last bone before  sunset today.

The Fleet disengaged from. the Tanker Force for the. night. E 15th April. ,

0730. The Fleet -joined the Tanker Group, now consisting of three tankers; fuelling and general replenishing was completed by 1400, when. TF 57 disengaged and took departure to cover the Sakishima area again. No supply of aircraft  was available during this

 replenishment period.

16th April.

0530. A.C.x assumed tactical command.

 No picket cruiser was stationed owing to the shortage of fighter aircraft. . 0600. The Fleet. CAP was flown, off in position 23  28  N 125  18  E, 17 minutes before sunrise and in excellent operating weather.

At 0622 an enerhy snooper at 20,000 feet escaped before the CAP had time to gain See
