.

Dover, heavy engagements were frequent and
several enemy aircraft were destroyed. It was
at this time that Dover began to be “‘ Hell-fire
Corner ’’ for German pilots.

36. The second phase opened on August 12th,
1940, when the enemy began to attack the
coastal airfields. Reference has already been
made to the importance of anti-aircraft defence
for airfields and, though many raiders were
shot down in these attacks, considerable damage
to the airfields was in fact done and many
were temporarily put out of. commission.
Especially in the early attacks of this phase
the standard of training in the Light anti-
aircraft gun detachments was insufficiently
high and later, when frequent practice had led
to improvement, the limited number of guns
proved a handicap. The damage however,
to the airfields would generally have been
still more serious and of more permanent a
character without the presence of the few
guns which could be spared.

37.-The policy of filling the gaps in the
heavier equipment with Lewis light machine-
guns was’ amply justified during this second
On 18th August, 1940, ten aircraft
were destroyed by these weapons alone, and it
was a fortunate chance of war that German
aircraft were lightly armoured at the time when
equipment was short and that heavier armour
was only fitted when the defences had more
weapons capable of penetrating it.

38. The third phase of the battle, directed
against inland airfields, opened on 24th August,
1940. The Light anti-aircraft defences con-
tinued to show improved results and, because
many of the attacks were delivered against
the outskirts of the London area, the heavy
guns in the Thames Estuary were able to take
part in the battle. This was the densest con-
centration of Heavy guns which the Germans
had so far encountered and, though only a
limited number of planes was destroyed,
formations were consistently broken up before
they reached their objectives.

39. On 7th September, 1940, the fourth phase
of the battle began with a heavy raid on
London. During the preceding phases we had
received constant demands for guns to defend
other places, not only on the south coast but
in industrial areas which were beginning to
feel the weight of night attacks. We had,
therefore, reluctantly drained London of its
defences until no more than 92 Heavy guns
remained. As soon as it became apparent that
London was to be the target, I had to draw
back into the capital as many guns as I could
reasonably manage and within 48 hours the

_ total had increased to 203.

40. The attack on London was made both
by night and by day, and of the initial ineffi-
cacy of the night defences I shall have some-
thing to say later. By day, though it was
impossible for the R.A.F. to prevent the

Germans reaching the capital and though when .

they were there it was too late to prevent
them bombing the city, the gums destroyed a
considerable number in many of the formations.
It was significant too that the most spectacular
success which the enemy achieved by day,
namely the firing of the dock area on
7th September, 1940, occurred when the gun
defences were numerically at their lowest ebb.
The increase in the number of guns at once

5977

reduced the amount of damage which the
enemy was able to inflict; his formations were
more effectively broken and the successes of the
fighter aircraft continued to mount,

On.

15th September, 1940, due largely to the .

R.A.F., the enemy effort was so decisively
beaten that though attacks continued by day
until 30th September, 1940, it was undoubtedly
then that the turning-point of the battle against
the day raider had been reached.

41. I have dealt only briefly with this battle
because it was primarily a battle between air
forces. :

From roth July, 1940, the day which most
authorities have accepted as the opening day
of the battle, until 30th September, 1940, the
guns of Anti-Aircraft Command destroyed by
day 296 enemy aircraft and damaged or
probably destroyed a further 74.

42. During October, 1940, the enemy re-
served his bombers almost exclusively for night
operations but he continued for a time to attack

the country by day with fighter-bombers. For

the most part these attacks did not penetrate
far inland dnd were often delivered on un-
protected coastal towns. Militarily the attacks
had little significance, except in so far as they
were designed to wear down our fighter forces
and with the existing resources it was impos-
sible'to provide gun defences for these coastal
towns without denuding vital factories’ of
protection.

43. I come now to that form of air attack
which, in the early days, before a successful
night fighter technique had been developed,
was esseiitially a gun battle; I refer to the
night raids. “I have already mentioned that
practically all equipment had been designed for
visual shooting at seen targets, and this applied

day

44. The equipment which was available in
the first year of the war had been designed
some years previously at a time when the
possibility of targets taking violent evasive

to shooting by night as well as to shooting by

action at high speeds had been insufficiently .

realised. It had been hoped that if raiding
took place at night the searchlights would be
able by means of sound-locators to find their
targets, illuminate them and continue the
illumination without difficulty. This would
enable the guns to use their normal visual
methods of engagement and the fighters out-
side the Gun Defended Areas to make their
interceptions and attacks.

45. Even before the war it was obvious
however that the likelihood of night raiding
had been increased by the improvement in
navigational methods and the greater reli-
ability of aircraft engines and also that, even
without evasive action by the enemy, cloud
would seriously handicap all forms of night
defence. Visually controlled _searchlights
appeared to be of doubtful value to the guns.

46. There appeared to be no satisfactory
solution to this problem until the invention of
radar and, as the delivery of the first tadar
sets for guns was not due until 1940, some
alternative means of dealing with unseen
targets had to be found. The only available
equipment was the sound-locator.
