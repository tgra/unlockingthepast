            "description": "was to have operated in the same way as the other brigades of the Force. But before the operations actually started, it was decided to split up the brigade and attach one battalion to each of the 77, 111 and 14 Brigades, to act as a garrison for the stronghold which was to form the base of each of the three above-men- tioned brigades. 3 (West African) Brigade com- pleted its fly-in by the 12th April. These for- mations used airstrips established near Manhton (\u201c* Aberdeen \u201d), twenty-seven miles north-north- west of Indaw ; Mawlu (\u201cWhite City \u201d), twenty. miles north of Katha, and in the Hopin area. During this second phase some 6,000 troops, 850 animals and 550,000 Ibs. of stores were transported with the very slight casualties of 15 killed (all in one aircraft) and six injured."

This was a strong position provided that the Yugoslavs and the Greeks were able to close the roads by which the line could be turned. The withdrawal began on the night rrth/12th April and was com- pleted by dawn on the 13th. But during its course it became obvious that the 12th and 2oth Greek Divisions were disintegrating. They soon became thoroughly disorganized and only a few sub-units retained any fighting value. This was due in no way to lack of courage or fighting spirit, but to their lack of modern armament and their ox-drawn transport, which was too slow and unwieldy as soon as it became necessary to embark on a long move. The withdrawal of General Mackay\u2019s force from Amynteion had to be covered by the rst Armoured Brigade, who carried out successful counter-attacks on enemy armoured fighting vehicles. During this withdrawal the brigade experienced considerable mechanical trouble, similar to that of the 3rd Armoured Brigade in"

This town fell on the 12th April, after a strong enemy counter- attack had been repulsed just to the west of it. 33 Brigade then turned west and captured Chauk on the 18th April, the booty taken in- cluded five guns (including two medium), and much transport. On the 19th, 89 Brigade cleared Singu, four miles to the north-east. 33 Brigade, advancing south from Chauk, met fierce resistance at Yenangyaung. This exten- sive oilfield area was completely cleared by the 23rd April after three days\u2019 stiff fighting. On this date, 89 Brigade were concentrating seven miles north of Yenangyaung preparatory to crossing the river. West of the Irrawaddy, 114 Brigade had reached a point 17 miles south- west of Seikpyu without meeting any organized resistance. During its advance, 7 Indian Divi- sion had inflicted heavy casualties, captured more guns and much booty."

Enemy pressure on the Burma Division south of Magwe continued on the 13th and xr4th and this caused a wide gap to. be opened between the two Divisions. Moving across country the enemy pushed into this gap threatening the oilfields. Orders for the destruction of the Yenangyaung oilfields were issued on th\u00e9 night of the r4th April and the denial scheme was successfully carried out during the following 48 hours. It required two full daylights to complete the destruction end- ing with the blowing of the power house, which took place when the Japanese were already in the outskirts of Yenangyaung."

Contact was established on the morning of the 12th April and by 0800 hours the 48 Infantry Brigade was being heavily pressed and bitter fighting took place in which the Corps striking force more than held its own. Another enemy column on the east bank of the Irrawaddy was attacked by the 1 Burma Brigade. Owing to the non-arrival of the Chinese division which had been promised for the defence of Taungdwingyi, the Commander 1 Burcorps now felt that he could not continue to hold Taungdwingyi and also cover the direct approach to the oilfields, and he represented this opinion to me.
