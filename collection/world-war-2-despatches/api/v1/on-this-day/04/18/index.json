The dividend that has been paid definitely justified the effort involved. From a handful of informants supplying skimpy information at great risk, the organisations grew, by the end of the campaign, into a powerful force capable of exerting a considerable influence on the course of the battle, and the air effort to support them reached a total of 372 sorties in the lunar month 18th April to 17th May.

One enemy division moving north from the Tiddim area had, as its main line of supply, the motor road leading from Ye-u. Two other divisions attacking from the east across the Chindwin were largely dependent upon the road from Wuntho. Mitchells (B.25) and Wellingtons began on the 18th April an almost daily assault upon these vital arteries and the supplies moving along them. While the former carried out low-level daylight sweeps, the latter took up the r le of intruders by night, replacing Beaufighters which Third Tactical Air Force considered could not be usefully or economically employed on moonless nights. The sum of these attacks, other aspects of which I have described elsewhere in this Despatch, contributed greatly to the constant shortage and slow transit of men and supplies which dogged the enemy throughout his offensive."
