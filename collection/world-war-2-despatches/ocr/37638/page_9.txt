Cyrenaica, and had to leave many of their tanks
behind.

38. While the withdrawal was in progress the
news seaching General ‘Wilson was of such
gravity that he already began to consider the
necessity for further withdrawal, It was
reported that the Yugoslav army in the south
had capitulated and it became obvious that
the Greek armies in Albania were incapable of
withdrawing to take their place in the line west
of General ‘Wilson’s force and in fact that very
little reliance could be placed on the fighting
ability of the Greek army. The difficulties that
General Papagos had foreseen in any attempt
to withdraw from Albania and its effect on
Greek morale had been justified and were
increased by the collapse of the Yugoslavs.

General Wilson therefore decided to continue
the withdrawal to the Thermopylae Line, which
could be held at least temporarily by the
Imperial forces alone. At a meeting between
General ‘Wilson and General Papagos on 14th
April General Papagos approved this decision
and made for the first time a suggestion that
the British forces should evacuate Greece to
avoid further fighting and devastation of that
country.

39. Meanwhile, under circumstances of great
difficulty, the Anzac Corps had taken up its
new line and on it had had its first experience
of the intense aerial bombardment -by ‘ the
German Air Force against its positions and its
lines of communication. No great enemy
pressure was developed against its positions,
although on the morning of 15th April, deter-
mined small-scale attacks were made in both
the Servia and the Katerini Passes. An attack
on the positions of the 4th New Zealand Brigade
in the Servia Pass was repulsed with the loss to
the enemy of 180 prisoners and at least several
hundred killed and wounded. Our losses were
negligible. The Greek troops, which had been
under General Wilson, had reverted to Greek
command on the occupation of the new posi-
tion.

40. General Wilson was anxious for the
safety of his left flank during this new with-
drawal, the more so as the Germans were known
to have broken through the Greek troops at
Kleisoura. Consequently, a force had to be
found to block the roads leading southwards
from the Grevena and Matsova areas into the
Larissa Plain. Actually, no threat came from
this flank and the main danger to the with-
drawal arose from the speed with which the
enemy followed it up from the north and from
the heavy attack launched against a combined
New Zealand and Australian force in the
Peneios Gorge. This attack began late on
15th April and was pressed home by infantry
and tanks, which proved to be the leading
elements of one armoured and one mountain
division. The 16th Australian Infantry Bri-
gade which had been detailed to form a left
flank guard on the Larissa-Kalabaka road was
diverted, except for one battalion, to cover the
western exit of the Peneios:Gorge and to afford
support to the 21st New Zealand Battalion,
which was holding the gorge alone. The attack
was made in such strength as to necessitate the
transference of the weight of the defence from
west to east. The defence of the gorge was
carried out with such spirit that when at last
on the evening of 18th April the Germans were
masters of the gorge, the main body of- the

3431

Anzac Corps had successfully withdrawn past
its western exit. The 21st New Zealand
Battalion had been overrun and the whole of
the 2nd/2nd Australian Battalion had been
forced off their line of withdrawal into the hills
after a stubborn fight against greatly superior
forces. This action, together with other minor
ones, and the use of skilful demolitions, pre-
vented the enemy’s armoured and mechanized
units from following up closely. During the
first two vital days of the withdrawal, enemy air
action had fortunately been prevented by mist
and low clouds, but from Larissa onwards
columns on the road suffered air attack without
respite. Otherwise, thanks to the rear-guard
actions described above, the withdrawal was
successfully carried out under the orders of
General Blamey almost without interference,

41. By the morning of 2oth April, the with-
drawal to the Thermopylae line was practically
complete. This naturally strong position was
occupied by the New Zealand Division on the
tight from the sea to the summit of the moun-
tains, covering the coast road; while the oth
Australian Division occupied the Brailos posi-
tion covering the main road to Thebes and
Athens. The rst Armoured Brigade, which by
this time had lost the greater part of its tanks
from mechanical failure, was in reserve and
protected the right and rear of the Anzac Corps
against a threat from Euboea. The weakness
of the position lay in the fact that the disin-
tegration of the Greek forces made possible a
German penetration on the extreme left of the
line about Delphi.

42. Meanwhile in anticipation of the possible
necessity of the evacuation of Greece, a com-
mittee of the Joint Planning Staff had been
formed in the Middle East and was sent to
Athens on 7th April under Rear-Admiral
Baillie Grohman. The general situation in
Greece now betokened the near end of Greek
resistance. The Greek forces on the left of the
Imperial troops had already disintegrated and
it was obvious that little more could be expected *
from the Greek armies in Albania. The Piraeus
had been so heavily bombed that it was prac-
tically unusable as a port, so that to send
further reinforcements or supplies to Greece had
become a matter of extreme difficulty. I
cancelled the sailing of the Polish Brigade and
the 7th Australian Division and went to Athens
myself on 19th April. The Greek Prime Minister
had committed suicide on 18th April. I saw
General Wilson and General Blamey and had
audience with His Majesty the King, who was
now acting as head of his Government. It was
decided, with the full approval of His Majesty
the King and the Greek Government, that the
evacuation of the British forces was essential.
It was obviously impossible, in view of the
overwhelming superiority of the German air
force, to use the Piraeus or any other port for
the re-embarkation of the force, which would
have to take place from open beaches. I
instructed General Wilson that the embarkation
should take place on as wide a front as possible
and that any troops who were cut off or were
unable to embark on the beaches selected
should not surrender but should make for the
Peloponnesus, where there might be possibilities
of evacuating them later.

43. General Wilson originally selected 28th
April as the first night for embarkation, but
the capitulation of the Greek army in the Epirus
