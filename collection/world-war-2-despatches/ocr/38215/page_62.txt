been diverted off the East Coast of Africa to
India where it had spent a fortnight. It was a
war division which had not previously been
overseas. On arrival it was fit but soft. It
was accommodated on Singapore Island. I de-
cided to hold it initially in Command Reserve.
It was ordered to carry out reconnaissances of
(a) the northern area of Singapore Island in
detail (6) communications in the western area.

In the same convoy arrived a Light Tank
Squadron from India, the only tanks ever to
reach Malaya. The tanks, which were obsoles-
cent, had been collected from training estab-
lishments etc. in India. On arrival several of
them had to be taken into workshops for over-
haul before they could take the field.

Apart from the above no other early rein-
forcements were expected. It was, however,
forecast that an Armoured Brigade might
arrive in the Far East early in March. In reply
to am enquiry from the Supreme Commander,
South,West Pacific, I stated that ‘“‘ A Cruiser
Regt. might well be required to deal with tanks
landed on beaches, fbesides having a great moral
effect ’’ and suggested that the destination of
one cruiser regiment should be left for decision
at a later date when we should know the
situation more clearly.

408 Atw.—Towards the end of January 48
Hurricane Fighters were flown off an Aircraft
Carrier west of Java. Of these one squadron
was based on the Singapore aerodromes. The
remainder went to-the Netherlands East Indies.
These were modern aircraft with only a small
proportion of trained and experienced pilots.

SEcTION XLII.—IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
ScorcHED Eartu Poticy.

409. The measures decided on under the
Scorched Earth Policy have already been ex-
plained in Section XXVII. These measures
were carried out as far as circumstances would
permit but the rapidity of the withdrawal made
it impossible to ensure that all destruction was
executed as planned. It would be idle for me
to attempt to assess the success of the Scorched
Earth Policy other than in general terms, as
undoubtedly a great deal more information is
now in possession of those who have ‘returned
to Malaya than is known to me. It was known,
however, that the thoroughness with which
denial was carried out varied in different areas,
though it is probably true to say that, taken as
a whole, the work was carried out as efficiently
as might be expected in the prevailing
conditions.

‘410. As regards rice stocks, it was impossible
to burn them and there was not sufficient trans-
port to remove them. In many districts they
were thrown open to the people who, were in-
vited to take what they required.

41x. The attempts to remove or destroy
coastal craft were only very partially success-
ful. Some owners whose livelihood depended
on them preferred to hide them or to sink them
temporarily in the creeks and rivers.

412. As a means of transport the Japanese
troops made great use of bicycles which in peace
time are widely used throughout Malaya. The
removal or destruction of these presented an in-
surmountable problem except where ample
time was available as on the east coast of
Johore. Py us a

413. Both road and railway bridges were
systematically destroyed as the withdrawal con-
tinued. It is estimated that some 300 bridges
in all were destroyed in varying degree. The
rapidity with which the Japanese made tem-
porary repairs was remarkable, even allowing
for the fact that in most cases ample material
was available near the bridge site.

414. About the z2oth January [ received a
telegram from the War Office asking for a per-
sonal assurance that, if the worst came to the
worst, nothing of military value would be left
intact for the enemy on Singapore Island. This’
was a big problem in view of the military and
civil equipment and reserve stocks of all sorts
which existed on the island. After careful con-
sideration, it was clear to me that no guarantee
could be given. Some of the equipment, such
as coast defence guns, could in any case only
be destroyed at the last minute. One of the
main ammunition depots was within a short
distance of the mulitary hospital and nobody
could be certain what the effect of the demoli-
tion of such a depot would be. Civil equipment
and stocks would be required as long as
Singapore was being held. I therefore replied
to the effect that I would make all possible
arrangements to ensure that, in case of neces-
sity, the destruction of everything of military
value should be carried out, but that I could
not guarantee that this would in fact be done.

415. A Committee, comprising representa-
tives of the three Services, was then set up to
examine this subject in detail and to draw up
plans as far as the Services were concerned.
These plans clearly allocated the responsibility
for executing each demolition. This work, which
proved to be of some magnitude, placed a
further burden on the already over-worked staff
of Headquarters Malaya Command.

416. The Director General of Civil Defence
was made responsible for the organization of
civil demolitions on Singapore Island. The
planning of these demolitions proved to be a
difficult and delicate work. The plans were
made with the utmost secrecy. Nevertheless,
as was almost inevitable, information leaked
out, This gave rise to the wildest rumours,
including stories of immediate evacuation, which
were damaging to morale,

Section XLIII.—IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
Evacuation Poricy.

417 The policy as regards the evacuation of
women and children and the measures taken
to carry out this policy have already been ex-
plained in Section XXVIII. The arrangements
worked smoothly and by the end of January
only comparatively few European women and
children remained on Singapore Island. The
majority of those who did remain were engaged
on important war work, Practically all ships re-
turning from Singapore to destinations within
the British Empire had carried their comple-
ment of women and children. In some cases,
as had been foreseen, the departure of European
women, especially those engaged in the Civil
Defence Services, had given rise to adverse
comment on the part of the Eurasians and
Asiatics.

In the end some 300 European women were
interned in Singapore.

418. The difficulty as regards Asiatics was
to find a country willing to accept them. There
were no sailings to the China coast and ships
