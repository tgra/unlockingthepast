felt by Survey, who found the shortage of
photographic units a great handicap.

73. A further great difficulty was the distance
which separated Allied Force Headquarters
from Cairo. This necessarily made co-ordina-
tion and liaison difficult, and planning would
have been much easier had the staffs of the
forces involved been concentrated in one area
instead of being over 1,500 miles apart. My
chief administrative officers and those from the
War Office could then have made co-ordinated
visits and held combined administrative staff
conferences, at which problems could have
been considered and decided, instead of
examining these problems by signal, with
inevitable delay.

74. The role allotted to Middle East remained
unchanged, but its implications varied con-
siderably as planning went forward. The
operational plan for Eastern Task Force, which
controlled the detailed planning in Cairo,
originally contemplated an assault landing on
the South-east corner of Sicily, followed by an
assault landing at Catania. Both assaults were
to be prepared by Middle East and were to be
commanded by Eighth Army, under Allied
Force Headquarters. The initial assault in the
South-east was to be undertaken by the 13th
Corps, with the 5th and 56th Divisions, an
army tank battalion, an armoured regiment
and a commando, all mounted from Egypt;
the subsequent assault landing at Catania was
to be undertaken by the 3rd Division, a
brigade group and two commandos, all mounted
from the United Kingdom and later coming
under the command of the 13th Corps. There
was also to be a follow-up division (not assault-
trained) from North Africa.

75. This plan, however, was subjected to both
major and minor modifications as preparations
went forward. The assault-landing at Catania
was abandoned; the 56th Division was diverted
to Tunisia and later to the roth Corps, its place
in the 13th Corps being taken by the soth
Division, which was withdrawn from Tunisia
for re-forming and training. The 30th Corps
was nominated as the second corps of Eastern
Task Force, to carry out an assault on the
South coast of the island in the Modica area,
whilst Western Task Force concentrated its
initial assault just to the West, in the Gela area;
the 3rd Division was transferred to the 30th
Corps when the assault on Catania was aban-
doned. Later, the 3rd Division was withdrawn
and its place was taken by the rst Canadian
Division, with the 1st Canadian Army Tank
Brigade, to be mounted with a commando from
the United Kingdom. The 51st Division was
eventually nominated as the second division of
the 30th Corps, which was to include the 231st
Brigade. The 1st Airborne Division was also
given a role in Eastern Task Force, and the
78th Division was to be the follow-up division.
Both of these divisions were to be mounted
from North Africa, and Middle East only had
the responsibility of planning for them and of
providing the 4th Parachute Brigade for the st
Airborne Division.

76. These changes very considerably in-
creased the difficulties of planning, and of train-
ing and equipping the force; but preparations
were in fact completed to time although the
date of the assault was advanced and the period
ie Repanion was cut down as planning con-

ued.

SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 13 NOVEMBER, 1946

77. Experience showed that the planning of
combined operations requires far more detail
and consequently a larger and possibly more
specialised staff than normal operations.

78. The most important subject of detailed
planning, to which all other considerations were
preliminary and subordinate, was the ultimate
embarkation and shipment of the force.

79. By the end of February an outline plan
had been prepared. The force to be mounted
from Middle East required sixty M.T. ships
and twenty-five troopships in addition to a
large number of landing craft. To enable
vehicles and stores to be discharged in the
order of priority laid down by Twelfth Army
Headquarters, plans were made for stores-ships
to be tactically loaded. To implement this, in
mid-April a pre-stowage planning staff was set
up at Cairo: this included representatives of
the War Office and of the Ministry of War
Transport, who had had experience of plan-
ning stowage for the landing in Algeria.

80. Planning for anti-aircraft defence in-
volved a two-fold problem. It was necessary
to provide strong anti-aircraft cover for the
Suez Canal and for the Middle East ports of
concentration in addition to anti-aircraft pro-
tection for the assault. The Middle East Bases
would be valuable targets at any time during
the last five weeks of preparation, and strong
anti-aircraft reinforcements had to be deployed
for their defence. Units for this reinforcement
programme were provided by bringing back a
proportion of the Eighth Army anti-aircraft
units and by reinforcements from the United
Kingdom.

81. The planning for the anti-aircraft and
coast defences of ports and airfields in Sicily,
when they should be captured, with its com-
plicated problems of distribution and co-ordina-
tion, was carried out by an inter-services com-
mittee.

82: Signals planning had to deal with prob-
lems for implementing the inter-communications
plan, the provision of units and equipment, the
provision of special equipment for combined
operations for non-signals units, and the pro-
vision of communications in embarkation areas
during the loading of formations.

83. One of the main difficulties anticipated
was that of bridging the gap between the land-
ing craft and the water’s edge on the very
shallow beaches. To assist in the solution of
this problem considerable experimental work
had to be carried out.

84. Originally it was intended that Malta
should be used as a casualty clearing station
area, but this was vetoed by the Royal Navy.
Arrangements were accordingly made for the
evacuation of casualties from the beaches direct
to Tripoli, Sousse and Sfax; Middle East was
responsible only for Tripoli, where plans were
made to provide 9,000 hospital beds and accom-
modation for 4,550 convalescents. To imple-
ment the evacuation plan, eight hospital ships
and four carriers were required. Of these the
latter were provided from the United Kingdom
and the former from the Middle East, India
and South Africa. They were to rendezvous
at Tripoli fully equipped.

85. Large dumps of stretchers, blankets and
hospital linen were also established at base
ports,’ and extra’ medical supplies and equip-
ment were provided for the medical units in the
