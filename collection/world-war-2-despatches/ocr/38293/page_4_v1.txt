L left Cairo for Greece  by ait at 0930 ith  a small staff of four specially-selected officers. My orders were  to plan and arrange~ the evacu-  ation of our: troops from Greece in concert with

 the two-other Services.  I drrived at Athens at

 r700 and took up my Headquarters: in the. Hotel  Acropole, where G.H.Q., B.TiG:, was-already established. A Joint, Planning  Staff was at once formed: and a conference held at G-H.Q. at 2200, when a.general review  of the situation was given by the Army authorities. The point that at least four days notice was required

_ for the arrival of shipping in.Greek waters -was

emphasised. as, strongly as possible; also that

_between  22nd April and  2nd May  moonless

 nights would bbe in.our favour should evacuation be decided upon,  I, was informed that  the  withdrawal of our Army   to ithe  Thermopylae

3. I proceeded to. take stock  of the naval

situation in the Athens Piraeus area. . This:

 took's me  time. -I found that Rear  Admiral  the Naval Attach , whose offices were distant about two. miles from G.H.Q.,-in addi-

. tion to his political duties,, controlled all shipping

movements, the staff of Naval Control Service Officer and Divisional Sea Transport Officer being located in Bs athe together with the cypher staff,

He was also in ies touch with the harbour authorities in Piraeus.. Three British minesweepers -. - (AYACINTH, SALVIA |  and He was, in fact, performing: the duties of Senior British

Naval Officer; Greece, as well as: being Naval.

Attach . . It soon became obvious that to. con- .trol. the evacuation, .I would have to control the.local Greek and other shipping in Greek waters, and this could not be done in an office two miles away, whose staff was under the orders of another officer.

Sea Transport Officer whose small staff  had been greatly reduced by casualties and sickness, had been to a great extent carried out through the Greek harbour authorities, and the smooth working  pf the organisation, was almost entirely dependent upon their efforts. Owing to the exploding of an ammunition:ship i in the harbour a few nights previously, after an air raid, some twelve merchant ships in Piraeus harbour were lost. facilities, tugs and: small craft of all sorts were destroyed; the telephone system was put out of action, and only five betths out: of the total of twelve were left available for the use of

 and off Eleusis, who, owing to damage done .to Piraeus,.could  not obtain water or coal. .it was estimated that ten of these would have  to sail not Jater than Saturday night, Pky April,  otherwise they would run short of fu

4. About the time of my arrival the Greek  harboar authorities in Piraeus showed signs of ceasing to function, including the Greek pilots on whom we had depended to berth ships.  ath day the situation in this respect deteriorated, and the control  of shipping, loading and  so on became more and more di icult. Ships   Agents . also disappeared.  The arrangements

for  reporting the arrival of ships in the road- .

 stead  collapsed completely, and it'was a matter of the greatest  difficulty to discover what ships wer  in.the harbour, were sailing, or expected . to, arrive, or even their whereabouts.

 Great damage was done to the harbour.
