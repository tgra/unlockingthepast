/ of x8th April. Eighth Aimy was ‘to start its
attack on the night of Igth-zoth April with
50 Division on the coast, 2 New Zealand Divi-
sion just west of Enfidaville and 4 Indian Duvi-
sion, with ‘‘ L’”’ Force under command, west
of Takrouna. 7 Armoured Division guarded
the western flank, made contact with XIX
Corps and was available to exploit success.
XIX Corps was to attack three mountain posi-
tions commanding Pont du Fahs from the
south; no date was set for this attack and it
was not to be launched until First Army con-
sidered that the enemy in these strong posi-
tions had ibeen sufficiently weakened by the
attacks on either flank. First Army was to
attack on 22nd April. 9 Corps would begin
in the early morning with 46 Infantry and x
and 6 Armoured Divisions. The infantry were
to destroy the enemy positions west of the salt
marshes of Sebkret el Kourzia and the armour
was then to follow through as quickly as pos-
sible directed on Gebel Mengoub, an eight hun-
dred foot feature fifteen miles from the north
end of the marshes and the same distance from
Tunis, 5 Corps would attack in the evening
of 22nd April with 1 and 4 Divisions south of
the river, directed on Massicault, and 78 Divi-
sion in the mountains north of the river with
Gebel Ahmera (‘‘Longstop’’) as their first
objective. TH Corps’ attack was timed for the
next day, 23rd April, with 1 Division attack-
ing on the Sidi Nsir road with its final objec-
tive the pass above Chouigui, and 9 Drvision
on the axis Sedjenane-Mateur. In order to con-
trol the battle I had moved my Headquarters
to a wood near Le Kef, after a short period at
Haidra, between Tebessa and Thala.

‘When speaking of the plans for the final
battles of the campaign I must take the oppor-
tunity of recording my obligations to my Chief
of Staff, General McCreery. He had accom-
panied me from the Middle East where he had
filled the same appointment. Both as a per-
sonal friend and as a brilliant Staff Officer he
was invaluable to me in the whole course of
operations in Africa, and was later to show,
both as a Corps and an Army Commander that
he added to his intellectual qualities the highest
gifts of command.

General von Arnim still disposed of over two
hundred thousand troops for a front of a hun-
dred and twenty miles. Messe’s Army held the
southern front with German and Italian in-
fantry in line from the sea to west of Tak-
rouna: go Light Division was responsible for
the coast road and 164 Light Division was on
its inland flank; there were various Italian
remnants, organized mainly under command
of Headquarters Trieste Division, interspersed
with the German troops and continuing the line
westwards. The German Africa Corps, which
had now taken under command the Superga
Division, held the angle between the two fronts.
The order of battle of von Vaerst’s 5 Panzer
Army was relatively unchanged. The Man-
teuffel Division faced II Corps in the northern-
most sector, then 334 Division in the mountains
on the north bank of the Medjerda and 999
Africa Division, now almost complete, astride
the river. In the area of 5 and g Corps was
the Hermann Goering Division, reinforced with
additional infantry and tanks, including part
of a very recently arrived heavy tank batta-
lion. As soon as Messe was back on his Enfida-
ville line von Arnim removed ro Panzer Divi-

879

sion, still his strongest armoured formation, and
transferred it to the area between Sebkret
el Kourzia and the Medjerda, This was clearly
the most threatened point and it was vital to
have an armoured reserve to cover the plain of
Tunis. It was, however, the only reserve that
Army Group Africa had and it is a little sur-
prising that von Armim made no effort to create
a larger one by shortening his line at the less
important points. Nor did he attempt to con-
struct any defensive systems in rear of his pre-
sent line except for some not very impressive
perimeter defences round Tunis.

Eighth Army’s attack on the Enfidaville posi-
tion began at 2130 hours on roth April. 50
Division captured Enfidaville itself and pushed
forward patrols berond it. The New Zealanders
advanced to a punt three miles north-west of
the town. 4 Indian Division, further west, had
a very fierce struggle for Gebel Garci; the enemy
counter-attacked contirfuously and, at the cost
of very heavy casualties, succeeded in holding
the attack. It was noticed that the Italians
fought particularly well, outdoing the Germans
in line with them. The New Zealanders next
day had an equally bloody struggle for the hill
village of Takrouna. In spite of severe losses
from our massed artillery fire the enemy kept
up his policy of continuous counter-attacks and
it became clear that it would cost us heavily to
advance further to this tangled mass of moun-
tains. General Montgomery therefore decided
late on the 21st to abandon the thrust in the
centre and concentrate on forcing the coastal
defile.

This change of plan would involve fairly ex-
tensive regrouping and at the same time he
wished to send back to the Delta one of the
divisions which would be needed for the in-
vasion of Sicily. 50 Division was selected as

wit had been weakened by its losses in the Mareth

*

and Akarit battles. It was to be relieved by
56 Division, which had had no previous opera-
tional expenence. The plan was to relieve 4
Indian and New Zealand Divisions opposite
Gebel Garca and Takrouna with 51 Division
brought forward from rest; this division had
also had fairly heavy losses and was to be
restricted to a holding role. The two former
divisions, with the 56th, were to make the
assault on the right. The first stage was on the
night 24th/25th April when the New Zealanders
and 201 Guards Brigade captured Gebel
Terhouna, a strongly contested hill feature over-
looking the coast about five miles north of
Enfidaville. The main attack was planned for
2gth April and its Gbject was to establish all
three divisions in the area of Hammamet, at
the base of the Cape Bon peninsula. On the
2gth, however, I received a signal from General
Montgomery saying that, as a result of a failure
by 56 Division on that day when coming under
artillery fire as it was about to take up positions
for the attack, he now felt unhappy about the
possibilities of success. As this was not going
to interfere with the plans I was already form-
ing for finishing off. enemy resistance in the
Tunis plain I.authogized the abandonment of
the attack, 1 Fighting French Division was
brought forward on 6th May to relieve 51
Division and the Eighth Army front became a
holding front except for the western flank where
the New Zealanders carried out; local gpera-
tions to assist XIX Corps and attract enemy
attention.
