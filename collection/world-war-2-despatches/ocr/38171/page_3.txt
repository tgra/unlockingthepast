SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 8 JANUARY, 1948

(d) The provision of naval assistance for
the reduction of pockets of resistance on the
west coast of France. Most of these pockets
had only nuisance value to the immediate
war effort but importance was attached to the
early opening of the port of Bordeaux and
operations were in train to this end.

(e) The protection of the  Scheldt
Approaches. =, :

(f) Naval measures to bring speedy relief
to Holland.

(g) The planning of operations to occupy
the Channel Islands after surrender, and to
occupy Norway under a variety of cop-
ditions. -

Prospects of Opening a North German Port.
7. Of these widespread problems the first one
brought into prominence after the . Rhine

crossing was the opening of a North German
port. This project had long been discussed

and in the event of prolonged resistance the ©

opening of such a port might become a vital
need, though it was agreed that such an early
opening was not in the circumstances, as they
then were, an urgent necessity; nor in fact was it
a feasible project from the naval point of view
to open a port as quickly as Army requirements
would prefer, particularly the port most
required, Hamburg. It was established that
owing to’ the shortage of minesweepers and the
necessity for being prepared to open Dutch
ports concurrently for civil relief, only one

German port could be opened at a time. Apart.

from the limitations likely to be imposed by the
minesweeping conditions, particularly the
difficulties of sweeping our own mines, it was
necessary for all resistance to have ceased along
the Dutch, and North-West German coasts
before minesweeping could be started. The
reduction of Heligoland and neutralisation of
enemy batteries on Wangerooge* were also
essential before the Elbe Approaches could be
swept. .

8. Subject to these considerations naval plans
had always been based on the assumption that
Hamburg would be the port to be opened on
British account, though recent Army opinion
had considered Emden as an alternative if
enemy resistance was sustained. " The opening
of Bremen, with the exception of the mine-
sweeping, would be an American responsibility
as that port was to work on United States
account, and by now the landward and sea-
ward limits of the Bremen enclave had been
finally established.

g. Apart from the reduction of Heligoland,
which H.M.S. ROBERTS and H.M.S. ERE-
BUS were being held ready to bombard after
the major work of neutralisation had been
accomplished by Bomber (Command, plans were
in hand for assaults on the main Frisian Islands
on which it was! estimated that the German
naval personnel alone amounted to over
12,000. ‘With naval assistance, landward assaults
were planned as being the more economical
and the First Canadian Army was responsible
for those on Wangerooge and Alte Mellun,
while the Second Army was to be responsible
for the reduction of the two islands off the
Cuxhaven Peninsula (Neuwerk and Schar-

horn) which was considered necessary to enable

minesweeping operations to begin in the 'Weser-

and Elbe Estuaries.

Protection of Shipping.
xo. Throughout this period much atten-

tion and effort were given to reducing
the threats to shipping. caused by sub-
marines, E-Boats, midget submarines and

mines. Especially in the Scheldt Approaches
there were almost daily clashes with the enemy
either by the naval forces, which were working
under Commander-in-Chief, The Nore, or by
the local patrol craft operating under Rear-
Admiral F. E.‘P. Hutton, the Flag Officer,
Belgium. _

11. Despite efforts for their protection a cer-
tain number of merchant ships was damaged
and sunk by these attacks and due tribute
must be paid to the courage and steadfastness
of their crews ‘as well as to the efforts made
by the escorting warships to prevent casualties.

Operations on the West Coast of France
(Operation “‘ Venerable ’’).

12. Of the German pockets remaining on the
west coast of France, most had nuisance value
only, but it was considered essential to reduce
the pockets astride the Gironde Estuary so
that the port of Bordeaux could be opened.
Plans for this operation had originally been
made the previous November under the code-
name “‘ Independence,’’ but the operation had
to be postponed on account of the Ardennes
push. These were now brought up to date,
and it was decided to carry out the operation

with a target date of 15th April under the code..

name ‘‘ Venerable.’’

The naval tasks being :—

@ Bombardment, primarily in the Ponte
de Grave area, of enemy armament which
could bear on friendly ground and Air Force:

(0) To remove sunken blockships and

- scuttled shipping to clear the (Channel to
‘Bordeaux; preliminary work had been in
progress since October, 1944, by French con-
tractors with the assistance of the U.S. Navy:

(c) The minesweeping necessary to sweep
the entrance to the Gironde Estuary and
the river.

13. It was later decided that the reduction
of the Ile d’Oleron was also essential to the
opening of the Estuary and River. A supple-
mentary operation, code-name “‘ Jupiter,’’ was
therefore planned to achieve this. It included
bombardment of targets on the island and trans-
port of personnel and equipment for the
assault.

14. Bordeaux was to be opened by French
ground forces under General de l’Arminat. The
naval operations were under the command of
Commander Task Force 122 (Vice-Admiral
A. G. Kirk, U.S.N.) and Contre-Amiral Rue
was in command of the French Naval Task
Force which consisted of the French ships
LORRAINE and DUQUESNE with destroyer
and, minesweeper support.

15. The bombarding ships arrived in an area
to the south-west of Ponte de Grave which had
been previously swept for mines, and LOR-
RAINE, DUQUESNE and the destroyers car-
tied out shoots on pre-arranged targets on r5th

and r6th’ April, then withdrawing to Brest,
