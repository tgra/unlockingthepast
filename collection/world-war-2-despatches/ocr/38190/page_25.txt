SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 JANUARY, 10948

the East but enemy house to house infiltrations
continued to be reported even as far West as
the China Fleet (Club. This report I dis-
counted, but awkward fighting was developing,
for I was unable to employ suitably the avail-
able artillery in this street fightmg, apart from
the desire to escape causing inmumerable
civilian casualties mm such a congested area.
The Japanese on the other hand, with their
overwhelming supenority of artillery and noted
carelessness for loss of life, had no hesitation
in putting down in such areas heavy concentra-
tions, with mortars super-impesed, lasting half
an hour, and with a rate of fire comparable to
those of the Great War.

At o800 hours the enemy were on a front
from the South end of Canal Road to the West
arm of Causeway Bay, with snipers in houses
further forward.

At 0830 hours, 25th December, the Royal
Navy contributed a further small reinforcement
which was placed at the disposal of the Officer
Commanding 1 Middlesex Regt. (Lieut -Colonel
H. W. M. Stewart, O.B E., MC.) who there-
upon put in hand the building up of a second
line running North from the Mount Parish area
—Wanchai Market, O’Brien Street—to the

“ water front (‘‘ O’Brien Street Line ’’).

141. At daylight our troops were still holding
the eastern slopes of Bennets Hill.

142. At og00 hours Major C. M Manners
(q.v. paras. 84 and go) and Mr. A L. Shields
came across from the Japanese lines under a
white flag. They had been told that they could
talk freely. They informed me of their march
with civilians of both sexes from Repulse Bay
Hotel via Wong Nei Chong Gap to North
point, of the ‘‘ incredrble’’ number of guns
and troops seen during the last half of their
“trek ” and (in their opinion, zot put forward
by the Japanese) the uselessness of continuing
the struggle.

A special defence meeting was mmmediately
called, where it was decided that there could
be no talk of surrender

The Japanese Commander sent one message
—that their forces would not initiate active
hostilities for three hours I conformed, includ-
ing regretfully closing down on a promising
counter-attack by Canadian troops on a large
enemy “‘ pocket ’’ North-West of Bennets Hill.
This impromptu ‘‘ truce ’’ was difficult to stage,
for Japanese planes, operating from Canton,
did not conform and bombed Stanley, Aberdeen
and Mount Gough. Stanley was also shelled
A constant service of launches was maintained
over Kowloon Bay and Japanese artillery con-
tinued bombarding the Gaps.

143. At 1030 hours the Royal Marines patrol
(q.v. para. 132) reported having established
contact with 2 Royal Scots at Wanchai Gap.
This patrol had meanwhile been increased by
thirty all ranks of Fortress R.E. who were re-
served for a minor operation that night, i.e.,
the mopping up of an enemy post on Stubbs
Road. At mid-day Japanese artillery opened
up punctually on a large scale, and later hand
to hand fighting was reported by 5/7 Rajput
Regt. on Mount Parish, where a platoon was
surrounded. Shortly afterwards Mount Parish
fell into the enemy’s hands, and an advance
along Kennedy Road was threatened. This put

723

Fortress HQ area, which had a garrison of only
one platoon of 2/14 Punjab Regt., in jeopardy
More road blocks and anti-tank mines were
put out.

By 1300 hours, 25th December, the znd
(‘O’Brien Street ’’) line was established, held
by some 60-70 men of 1 Middles®x Regt., in-
chiding small parties of Royal Navy, Royal
Engineers, and 5/7 Rajput Regt The enemy
was now in the Wanchai A R.P. tunnels (q v
para. 135) but about noon an 18 pounder gun
had arrived there, which, mounted in the main
street, covered several of the exits. A number
of rounds were fired at these exits, more as a
deterrent than anything else. No casualties
were observed to have been caused, and no
enemy emerged.

144. Communications were increasingly diffi-
cult to maintain: between 1100 and 1200 hours
there were none to Stanley area, Wanchai Gap
and Magazine Gap, nor to the 2 Royal Scots.

145. There were, at noon, only six guns of
the mobile artillery left in action, with an
average of 160 rounds per gun available.

146. At 1430 hours two officers and fifty
other ranks of 2/14 Punjab Regt. reached the
Officer Commanding 1 Middlesex Regt., who
had given warnings several times that his men,
though in good heart, were being slowly but
surely overwhelmed. A further withdrawal
was enforced from the Canal Road area, and
the ‘‘ O’Brien Street line ’’ became the forward
active hne of defence HQ 1 Middlesex Regt
withdrew to Murray Barracks.

147. Very heavy dive-bombing attacks were
made in the Wanchai Gap area between 1400
and 1430 hours, and shortly afterwards this Gap
was reported lost.

Magazine Gap was similarly attacked and
icendiaries were dropped—most effectively,
for the hillside was set on fire and field cables
were burnt. A little later the Gap itself came
ander mortar and small arms fire, and Com-
mander, West Infantry Brigade, reported that
the area could not in his opinion be held for
more than 24 hours at the most against a deter-
mined attack.

148 At 1450 hours the Officer Commanding
1 Middlesex Regt. reported that his forward
positions were being shelled from both Kowloon
and North Point and that Captain C M Man,
the Officer Commanding ‘‘ Z ’’ Company, had
telephoned ‘‘ the line is breaking.’’ Lt.-Colonel
Stewart said he would try to form yet another
line East of the R.N. Yard if necessary, ie,
just below, and to the North of, Fortress HQ
The ‘O’Brien Street line,” if seriously
attacked, could not hold out long—perhaps
half an hour.

149 I had no communications with East
Infantry Brigade HQ at*Stanley and conse-
quently had no information.

As far as it was known, the force surrounded
in Little Hong Kong Magazine area, was still
holding out.

Bennets Hill had been heavily attacked,
had been completely surrounded and by 1500
hours had ‘been forced to surrender. The
Canadian line north of Bennets Hill had been
forced to give ground,
