and our relations with the Army and civilians
have grown closer and better every day. A
French Army, under General Juin, amounting
to a nominal thirty-two battalions of infantry
and some hundred and twenty guns (when all
was assembled), was ordered to mobilise. Its
mission in November 1942 was to cover the
tight flank of the Allied Forces while they de-
ployed. Later, the main body gradually moved
eastward, with only minor contact with Italian
patrols, to the line of the Eastern Dorsale by
carly J January 1943. ‘While six battalions re-
mained in
Medjez and several battalions continued to work
with the Americans in the south.

The French mobilisation plan was prepared
only for a campaign of 6-8 weeks. The equip-
ment of the Army was lamentable; no anti-
aircraft or anti-tank weapons, rifles and guns
dating back to the period 1880-1914, no signal
equipment or motor transport, no boots or
proper clothing, staffs inadequate and not up to
date, et cetera. Only in spirit was the Army
formidable, and this spirit was carefully fostered
by Generals Juin and Koeltz and a fine body
of junior commanders. Co-operation and
mutual trust between British and French
teached a high level by the end of the cam-
paign, but, even to the end, French units were
not capable of offensive action against German
troops, and could only operate safely in the
mountainous sectors of the front.

It must be remembered that the French
Army in Africa is largely a native army.

(@) The Line of Communication Adminis-
trative difficulties and the build-up of First
Army.—Administrative matters are dealt with
separately, but to understand correctly the
background of this campaign it is essential to
bear the following major facts in mind:—

(i) The huge distances. From Algiers to
Tunis by road is over 560 miles.

(ii) The extremely mountainous nature of
the country, and that at first only two roads
and an inefficient railway were available
eastwards.

(iii) That the Army was entirely dependent
on what it brought overseas with it, in the
way of transport, fuel, supplies, &. Nothing
whatever was available locally; indeed, we
had to supply the railway with coal, and
our Allies, out of our none too plentiful
stocks, with rations, petrol and other supplies.

First Army did not spring from the sea
full-formed like Aphrodite, but grew in
stature painfully slowly as convoys arrived at
fortnightly intervals. The initial rush on
Tunis was made by a force, at its strongest,
equivalent only to one infantry division and
one tank regiment on light scales. The lead~
ing infantry division (78th) was not complete
until ist December; ithe next division (6
Armoured) was not complete until 15th
December; 46 Division reached the front by
the first week of February 1943, I Division
by 22nd March and 4 Division was not fully
assembled until the end of the second week

of April 1943.

For me it was an exasperating period in which
I saw chance after chance disappear for lack
of sufficient strength to seize them, and when
reinforcements did arrive the enemy in his turn
had also increased his strength. Always the
need was for more infantry.

(e) Air Support—tIn the early stages this
was bad for obvious and I think mainly un-
avoidable reasons. All aircraft had to be flown
in from Gibraltar or the United Kingdom; all
stores, services, bombs, &c., came by convoy;
airfields were few and far between—the nearest
serviceable airfield to the forward troops at
Tebourba in December 1 x94 being at Bone, 114
miles away; the Air Officer Commanding had
to meet naval demands for protection and had
other calls, in addition to supporting the Army,
which tied him to Algiers while I was going
ever further eastwards. As the situation
stabilised so did our co-operation grow closer;
but it was a slow growth and did not reach
maturity until the reorganisation carried out in
March 1943.* Again, in the early days, the
great distances, poor means of intercommuni-
cation, and the inevitable early troubles which
arise when the forces of two nations are begin-
ning to work together all contributed to the
undoubted lack of efficient co-operation between
Army and Air Forces,

Goodwill there was in plenty, and with in-
creasing experience and, above all, improved
means of inter-communication the situation |
improved. By mid-March 1943, liaison was
excellent; we were working as one team and,
under Air Commodore Crogs, the air support
given to First Army in the last stages was in-
timate, immediate and intensely powerful.

(f) Weather and the country.—Before
arrival I had imagined North Africa was a dry
country. Although I knew that the winter was
the wet season in North Africa, none the less,
the extent of the rains in the Coastal belt and
their effect on the roads, on cross-country move-
ment, and on the airfields, came as a very
unpleasant surprise. In the northern zone,
in which First Army operated, the rains began
in early December and continued until early
April. March was the wettest month. Rain,
mist and a peculiarly glutinous mud formed
the background to all our operations during
this period.

Northern Tunisia is a country of high
mountains, narrow plains between the ranges,
and few roads, with very limited scope for
armoured action. In the south it becomes
much more open and desert-like, but rocky
hills occur ‘everywhere.

FIRST PHASE.—THE RACE FOR TUNIS.

As I have already stated, on 9th November
the first Germans landed at El Aouana airport,
Tunis. By 13th November I had occupied
Bougie and Djidjelli.

Every effort was mow directed towards
getting troops east as fast as possible, and an
earlier proposal (which was not put into effect)
was repeated for a landing at Sousse by a force
from Malta.

The first troops to occupy Bone were two
companies of 3 Parachute Battalion dropped
by air to hold the airfield and 6 Commando,
landed by sea on 12th November to seize the
port. On 11th November a small column of
all arms from 1x Infantry Brigade Group
(known as Hart Force and made mobile by

* Additional factors which reduced the efficiency
of air support were:—

(a) Lack of all-weather airfields, which could
not be constructed during the first few months of
the campaign; and

(8) Lack of line communications during 2 period
when headquarters were frequently moved.
