On 11th May the sth K.A.R. advancing west of the lakes captured Bubissa, taking some prisoners and guns, but were counter-attacked by six medium and three light tanks and a Banda group. The C.O. decided that he would be unable to hold the position and conducted an orderly withdrawal behind the Gidu. armoured cars covered the withdrawal and acted as a decoy to the enemy tanks. Unfortunately three armoured cars got bogged following the infantry over soft ground and had to be abandoned after all weapons, etc., had been removed. (In point of fact all these armoured cars were eventually recaptured.) Meanwhile on 13th May 1 N.M.R. attacked the positions covering Sciasciamanna. This energetic attack was completely successful and resulted in the capture of 800 prisoners, two batteries of artillery and nine tanks. The advance was continued to Sciasciamanna which was entered on 14th May, and to Dalle which was occupied on 17th May. A further 650 prisoners, some guns and armoured cars were captured.",

It was then realised that the German naval authorities could not issue instructions in plain language to their U-Boats in the Far Eastern waters to comply with the surrender terms because the U-Boats might not believe the authenticity of the message and the Japanese would probably prevent their leaving. Accordingly instructions were given that codes were to be used for this special purpose of giving orders to U-Boats in Far Eastern waters.",

            "description": "A final conference was held on 1st May, also in the War Room at Caserta, at which decisions were taken on the remaining outstanding points. D-day was fixed at 11th May and H-hour at 2300 hours; postponement would only be on account of bad weather and would be for periods of twenty-four hours, the decision to postpone being taken not later than 1600 hours on D-day. The breakout from Anzio, which it had already been agreed should be prepared for D plus 4, would take place when a penetration of the enemy's second line of defence on the main front (i.e. the   Hitler  line) had been achieved. It was hoped that there would be sufficient air resources to meet all the demands of both Armies but, if not, priority would go in the first phase of the attack to Eighth Army and in the second, the breakout from Anzio, to VI Corps. Until the attack was about to open the air forces would continue with their existing plan of attacks on enemy lines of communication. The effects of this were most valuable but, since this was the first time we had tried anything of this nature, there was a certain tendency to overestimate them. I felt it necessary to emphasize that our intelligence staff credited the Germans with at Jeast four weeks supplies at full operational rates and ventured the prophecy that we should have at least twenty-one days actual fighting, quite apart from days spent in movement, before the enemy could be defeated. It was actually twenty-four days from the opening of the offensive to the entry into Rome.",

            "description": "reorganisation for at the moment divisions were not only severely weakened by casualties but also in most cases split up into small groups, often under various different commands. It shows the efficiency of the German leadership and staff work that they were successful in bringing order out of this chaos and rallying so quickly a defeated and, in part, dispersed army. Since our offensive began on 11th May all the divisions which were at that date in Tenth and Fourteenth Armies, including the two originally on the Adriatic coast, had been drawn into the battle south of Rome and west of the  Apennines. Of the seventeen involved at that time three, the 71st, gqth and 715th, had temporarily ceased to exist as effective formations and the remainder had all been heavily mauled. Of the reinforcements brought in before the fall of Rome the Hermann Goering Division had suffered extremely heavy losses and 92 Infantry Division had been so battered that it was disbanded and never re-formed. However, in spite of the fact that the invasion of France had now begun, and the Russians were threatening East Prussia, Kesselring had been promised considerable reinforcements of few Seenaen aie apart om te aihoeat replacement ts. It is strikingly significant of the different value attached by the opposing sides to the Italian campaign that at the very same time as the Allies were withdrawing seven divisions from Italy to France the were despatching to Italy the equivalent of eight divisions, some of them actually from the threatened West. 19 and 20 Luftwaffe Field Divisions came from Denmark and Holland respectively, 16 S.S. Panzer Grenadier and 42 Jaeger Divisions from the Balkans and 34 Infantry Division from Russia. Three other \" infantry  divisions which were forming in Germany, one of which had already been equipped for the Russian front, were sent to Italy where they were given the numbers of divisions which had been destroyed in the battle for Rome and incorporated their survivors. In addition a battalion of Tiger tanks, 504 Heavy Tank Battalion, was taken from the G.H.Q. reserve in the great tank centre of Mailly-le-Camp in France. In view of the general German shortage of armour and the desperate need for heavy tanks to employ against General Eisenhower's gradually widening bridgehead, this transfer seems to me to be particularly significant.*",
