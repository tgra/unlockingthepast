SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

the whole of its operations over Malaya, esti-
mated that 183 Japanese aircraft were
destroyed, exclusive of others lost by them
dunng our attacks on their aerodromes.

391. It is felt that this claim may be
excessive, though not by much. Reports which
have been received from all sources appear to
establish that the Buffalo Squadrons shot down
a total of 30 Japanese aircraft: others were
damaged and a proportion of them probably
crashed ‘during their return to base.

It is probable that the Hurricane force
destroyed, or so seriously damaged that they
failed to returm to base, a total of 100 Japanese
aucraft For this total, 45 Hurricanes were
lost from all causes, including flying accidents
and enemy air bombardment. In view of the
odds which were faced these figures speak for
themselves.

Final transfer of R.A.F. to Sumatra.

392. On 8th February the Japanese launched
thew attack on Singapore Island and rapidly
obtained a firm foothold. It now became
essential to transfer A.H.Q. to Sumatra in order
to take control of the Command, whose com-
batant units were already there, for the purpose
of carrying on the fight in the N E.I.

A nucleus staff, cluding the S.A.S.O. (Air
Commodore Staton) proceeded by air to
ees on Ioth February by order of the

AG

Sur Archibald Wavell again visited Singapore
the same day, roth February He ordered the
immediate evacuation to the NEI. of all
remaining R.A.F. personnel, which was com-
menced the following day. At the same time
he instructed Air Vice Marshal Maltby, hitherto
Assistant AO.C at AH Q., to take charge in
the N.E.I. as soon as possible, that officer
proceeding there by air the same afternoon
accompanied by an addition to the nucleus
staff which had preceded him. He was appointed
by Abdair A.O.C, Westgroup in the N E.1. with
effect from 11th February.

393. Aerodrome surfaces were ploughed up.
Bomb components, large stocks of petrol and
much equipment which could not be got away
was destroyed or rendered ineffective, But the
volume of the whole was so great that neither
time nor circumstances permitted its transfer
or destruction, particularly a large quantity
salved. from Malaya which was housed in the
town of Singapore where its destruction by fire
was impossible. Special action was taken to
destroy secret equipment e g radar apparatus,
signals installations etc. It is believed that
little of unmediate value to the enemy was left
to him.

304. On 13th February Air Vice Marshal
Pulford, who had declined to leave until all
R.A.F. personnel, who could be, had been
evacuated, lefl Singapore. He did so at General
Percival’s instigation. He accompanied a party
under the orders of Admiral Spooner, R.A.
Malaya. When they sailed they were unaware
that the Japanese fleet had interposed itself
between Singapore and their destination, which
was probably Batavia in Java They were
detected, attacked from the air and their boat
was stranded on an island of the Tuyu or Seven
Islands Group some 30 miles north of Banka
Island. There the whole party, some 4o in
number, lived as best they could, the fishermen

inhabitants having deserted it. It was malarial,
unhealthy and contained little food. The party
had few’ stores, practically no medicines and no
doctor After remaining at large for more than
two months the survivors were compelled to
surrender. By then 18 had died, including Air
Vice Marshal Pulford and Rear Admiral
Spooner. The remainder were in a bad way.
Thus it was that these gallant officers lost their
lives and that the former was unable to rejoin
‘his Command in the N.E.I.

Fall of Singapore.

395. On the 15th February Singapore
Fortress was compelled to surrender.

Section III.

SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS BASED ON
SUMATRA.

INTRODUCTION.

396. As has already been narrated in Sec-
tion II of this Report, by the 16th January,
1942, all Air Force units in Malaya had been
driven back to Singapore Island. Even with
the existing strength, aerodromes on the island
were already congested, they would become
more congested when reinforcements, now well
on their way, arrived. The scale of Japanese
air attack against these aerodromes was increas-
ing. It had become imperative to disperse
more widely Extra elbow room was par-
ticularly desirable because H.M.S. ‘‘ Indomit-
able,”’ with 48 Hurricanes on board, was due
to arrive at the end of January. If bomber
units could be transferred to Sumatra, not only
would they be dispersed more safely, but fighter
squadrons could then be distributed to all the
aerodromes in Singapore. It was not realised
at the time how soon three of those aerodromes
—Tengah, Sembawang and Seletar—would be-
come untenable (para. 360).

General Conditions in Sumatra.

397 Sumatra, an island nearly 1,000 miles
long, lies west of and runs parallel to the west
coast of Malaya, but extends far to the south-
ward Its main features are a mountain range
running down the west coast throughout the
whole length of the island, and a relatively
low-lying belt of country eastward of it, con-
sisting mainly of jungle and swamp, which is
intersected by many rivers with a west to east
trend. It is developed in scattered areas only.

Roads are few, and although there are rail-
way systems in the north and south, they are
not connected, and communications are con-
sequently poor From the Allied point of view
the chief economic importance of Sumatra was
the oil field and refinery near Palembang, of
which the normal outlet is to the east via
Palembang river to the sea, though there is a
single track railway running to the Port of
Oesthaven in the extreme south. There was a
radio telephone system inter-connecting the
principal towns in Sumatra with an external
connection to Java. This telephone system
was open and insecure.

398. At the time this Section of the Report
opens, the monsoon was still in progress over
Sumatra. A feature of this monsoon was the
prevalence of torrential thunderstorms, both by
day and night. These thunderstorms are very
violent indeed, and they completely black out
