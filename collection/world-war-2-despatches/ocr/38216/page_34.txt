1380 SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

with the Hurricanes, in the defence , of $inga-
pore. By the 30th January, the ‘number of
Buffaloes had so dwindled that all (6)’ were
concentrated in No. 453 (F) Squadron, Nos.
at R.A.A.F. and 243 (F) Squadron personnel
were evacuated, whilst No. 488 (F) Squadron
was retained to service the Hurricanes, together
with a few of the pilots of all these squadrons
to replace casualties.

Effect of Japanese Advance on R.A.F. dispost-
hons.

Decision to Transfer Units to N.E.I.

355- The advance of the Japanese into Johore
meant that our aircraft had to operate from
the four aerodromes on Singapore Island, Thus
a dangerous congestion of aircraft on the
ground had come about. The dangers of con-
gestion increased as enemy air attacks steadily
grew in violence during January. ‘When ex-
pected aircraft reinforcements should begin to
arrive from the United Kingdom and the Middle
East during January there were prospects of
still greater congestion Dispersal beyond the
confines of Singapore Island would then become
imperative.

356. During December, the first preparations
had been made for operating R.A.F. Units in
the N.E.I. (paras. 256-258). On qth January
No, 153 M.U. was moved to Java, and on 16th
January No. 225 (B) Group Heaciquarters
was formed in Singapore and moved to Sumatra
two days later in order to make preliminary
arrangements for operating bombers from ae1o-
dromes in that island.

357. By mid-January it was clear to A.H.Q

’ that the transfer of Units must ‘be accelerated

even though facilities for their operation and
maintenance in Sumatra were not yet ready.
In accordance with a prior agreement made with
the Dutch Army Air Force, that Dutch Units
should ‘be moved first, a progressive with-
drawal now took place from Singapo1e:—
19th January—Dutch Buffalo Squadron at
Kallang was withdrawn... On arrival in the
N.E.I. it reverted to Dutch control. Its main
function was to maintain, as requisite, fighter
cover required for future convoys through
Banka Straits.
22nd Januwary—2 Dutch Glenn Martin
Squadrons withdrew to Java and reverted to
Dutch control,
23rd-27th January—Nos. 27 (NF), 34 (B)
and 62 (B) Squadrons, except for small air-
craft handling parties, were transferred to
Sumatra, as were also the main parties of
Nos. r and: 8 (GR) Squadrons, R.A.A.F.

358. Concurrently with the above moves:—

(a) No. 151 M.U. was ordered to prepare
to move to Java, less a party approximately
100 strong who were to remain and salvage
and pack equipment.

(b) Base Accounts and Record Offices
were ordered to Java.

(c) Station H.Q. Sembawang was ordered
to Sumatra.

359. Each Unit was instructed to proceed
with 30 days’ rations, certain barrack stores
and 28 days’ pack-up of aircraft equipiment.
All ground personnel proceeded ‘oy sea. It
will be seen later that, owing to confusion at
the Singapore docks caused pnmarily by bomb-
ing, and owing to enemy attacks on shipping

en route, the arrangements made for the trans-
fer of our units to the N.E.I. were badly
disorgamsed. Dutch Lodestars helped in these
moves. Their assistance was invaluable.

360. When the decision was taken on 27th
January that it would be necessary for the
army to withdraw to Singapore Island, it be-
came evident at once that one aerodrome only,
Kallang, would shortly ibe available for use.
The other three on the Island, Tengah, Sem-
bawang and Seletar, were sited on its northern
coastline and would soon be exposed to ob-
served artillery fire from Johore at ranges as
close aS 1,500-2,000 yards: it would not be
practicable to operate aircraft from them for
long Unfortunately Kallang itself was rapidly
becoming of limited use. Its surface, a crust
of mari laid on a salt marsh, was pock-marked
with bomb craters which were most difficult to
fill. Extension was impracticable, huddled as
it was between the sea and the built-up area
of Singapore Town, Consequently, further
transfer of squadrons to the N.E.I. now became
inevitable.

361. On the 27th January No. 8 (GR) Squad-
ron, R.A.A.F., was sent to Sumatra, and No.
205 (FB) Squadron on the 28th to Java The
latter on arrival in Java, was placed by Abdair
under Dutch control as part of Recgroup. No,
205 Squadron left 1 Catalina at Seletar until
the 30th January in connection with the arrival
of a further convoy. On the 2gth and 30th
January the remaimng G.R. Squadron (No. 1,
R.A.A F.) was transferred also to Sumatra

362. Thus by the end of the month the
whole of the bomber force had ‘been compelled
to withdraw to air bases in Southern Sumatra,
where they were now organising with the in-
tention of providing air support from that
quarter to the army invested in Singapore

363. On the 31st January, apart from
fighters, there were left in Singapore only 3
Swordfish, They were still under Army con-
trol for coast defence spotting purposes, as
HQ M.C. at this stage stil] did not rule out the
possibility of a landing from the sea on Singa-
pore Island itself.

Changes in appointments in the Command.

To digress for a moment from the narrative:—

364. With the arrival of reinforcements a
reorganisation of senior appointments became
practicable in the second half of January.

365. About 17th January Group Captain
G. E. Nicholetis replaced Group Captain A. G.
Bishop as Group Captain, Operations, at
A.H.Q., the,laiter having been appointed to
command the Bomber’Group (No. 225) in
Sumatra.

366. About igth January Air Commodore
W.E. Staton arrived and began taking the
duties of S.A.S O. from Air Commodore B J.
Silly. His recent and personal experience of
air operations over Europe was to prove of
great value to the Command

367. On the 2gth January Air Commodores
S. F. Vincent and H. J. F. Hunter arrived
from the U.K. They had been sent by the Air
Ministry as Commanders designate of Fighter
and Bomber Groups respectively Air Commo-
dore Hunter was sent to Sumatra on Ist Febru-
ary, to command No. 225 Group which had al-
teady formed at Palembang.
