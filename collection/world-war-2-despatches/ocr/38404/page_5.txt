SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 16 SEPTEMBER, 1948

brought a revival, and in April and May the
Germans increased their scale of attack still
further in an attempt to conceal their intentions
with respect to Russia.

42. Early in 1941, the Germans began to
show an increasing tendency to concentrate on
ports and shipping. There were other signs
that an attempt to strangle our sea communica-
tions was contemplated, and at the end of
February, I was instructed by the Air Ministry
to provide additional ‘‘ watch and ward ’’ for
coastwise shipping, and warned, that the Ger-
man bomber force might be expected to pay
special attention in future to ports on the West
Coast.

43. Early in March this was followed by a
formal directive which “required me to give
priority to the defence of the Clyde, the Mersey
and the Bristol Channel, which were now to
rank above the aircraft industry. 1n this respect.

44. I immediately took steps to strengthen
the A.A. defences of these areas, partly by
moving guns from other parts of the country
and partly by pledging a substantial part of
the anticipated production in March and April.
By the middle of March, the move of 81 ad-
ditional heavy A.A. guns to the West Coast
ports had been ordered, and shortly after-
wards further increases amounting to another
104 heavy A.A. guns were arranged. Actual
increases exceeded what had been planned: 58
guns were withdrawn from the Midlands in
March, and 24 guns came from the factories:
by 1st June a further 106 new guns had been
deployed.,

45. I also modified the deployment of the
night-fighter force in order to give increased
protection to the Clyde and the Mersey. I con-
sidered that the Bristol Channel was already
adequately defended by the squadrons
deployed to cover the Southern approaches to
the Midlands. ‘

46. In spite of the enemy’s growing tendency
to attack ports and shipping, his attention at
this stage was by no means exclusively de-
voted to such objectives. Many attacks were
made on London arid provincial towns, and the
operations of German long-range fighters
against our bombers and their bases caused
some concem,

47. On the night of roth May the enemy
made the most ambitious attack on London
that he had attempted up to that time, or
indeed was ever to attempt. Although con-
temporary estimates were lower, it is now
known that the German bomber force flew
more than 500 sorties on this night. Visibility
was good and the results were eminently satis-
factory. A total of 60 single-engined fighters
were sent to patrol at various heights over
London, twenty over Beachy Head, and smaller
numbers over the other approaches to the
Capital, while twin-engined fighters were used
to intercept the bombers as they came and went
These defensive fighters claimed between them
the destruction of 23 enemy aircraft, of which

the single-engined fighters claimed nineteen. A.

Defiant onan ‘“‘Intruder”’ patrol over
Northern France claimed one more, making
24. The AA. gunners, although their fire was
restricted by the presence of our fighters,
claimed another four, making a grand total of
28 enemy aircraft, or roughly five per cent. of
the enemy effort.

48. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of
this night’s operations was the success of the
Hurricane and Spitfire flying in the Bomber
Stream. On various other nights in April
and May, aircraft on ‘‘ Fighter Night ’’ patrols
claimed the destruction of twenty enemy aircraft
in the aggregate. The impression that
“Fighter Nights’? was an unprofitable
operation is widespread, but these figures show
that,. given good weather, moonlight, and a
substantial concentration of enemy aircraft,
these patrols could achieve satisfactory results.
It was, however, only at periods when the
moon was above the horizon that any success
was achieved.

49. Operation ‘‘ Fighter Night ’’ was, of
course, always regarded with disfavour by the
A.A. gunners, whose chances of success it
diminished When it was first put into effect,
the guns in the target area were forbidden to
fire; but it was argued that their silence might
cause apprehension amongst the public, and
later they were allowed to fire up to heights
safely below that of the lowest fighters. Such
a restriction of A.A. fire was only justified,
of course, when the conditions were particularly
favourable to fighters, but the figures just
quoted show that in these conditions its justifi-
cation was beyond dispute It is interesting
to note that, despite the limitation imposed on
them, the guns in the target area were not
always barren of success on these occasions.
While generally the guns kept the German
bombers up to the heights at which the fighters
could most conveniently engage them, it would
seem that on occasions the fighters must have
- freed individual bombers down into the A.A.

50. A night of scattered raiding on 11th May
brought to an end the intensive phase which
had begun eight months before. Thereafter,
until the end of the year, the scale of attack
was much smaller. Although a few more
raids were made on London and the Midlands,
the Germans devoted most of their attention
for the rest of the year to targets near the
coast or at sea, and to minelaying

51. Undoubtedly the main reason for this
change was a new strategic conception by the
Germans. Having decided to attack the
Russians, they withdrew most of their bombers
from the West, leaving behind only a small
force to second the German Navy's attempt to
blockade the British Isles. To what extent
this decision was due to the realisation by the
enemy that his night offensive was failing as
surely (though not so spectacularly) as his day
offensive had failed in the previous Autumn,
I do not know. But that the “ Blitz.’ did fail
to achieve any strategic purpose is clear enough.
In eight months of intensive night raiding, the
German bomber force did not succeed in break-
ing the spirit of the British people or preventing
the expansion of our means of production and
supply. Moreover, the cumulative effect of the
ever-increasing losses which the Germans in-
curred as the defences got under way cannot
have been a negligible factor, even though
these losses were not sufficient in themselves
to have brought the offensive to a standstill.
To the country as a whole, and everyone in it,
the end of the night battle was a great relief;
nevertheless there was a sense in which 1t came
to those under my command, and indeed to my-
‘self, as something of a disappointment. An
