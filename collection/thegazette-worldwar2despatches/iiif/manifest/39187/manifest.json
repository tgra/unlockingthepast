Od. net. This set of\nmaps also covers the operations described in the other Army and Air Despatches of the\nBurma Campaign from 16th November, 1943 to 12th September, 1945.\n\nThe following Despatch was submitted to the\nSecretary of State for War on the 14th\nAugust, 1945, by GENERAL SIR GEORGE\nJ. GIFFARD, G.C.B., D.S.0., A.D.C., Com-\nmander-in-Chief, 11 Army Group, South-\nEast Asia Command.\n\nPart I—OPERATIONS.\nIntroduction.\n\n1. My first Despatch* covered the period\nfrom the formation of 11 Army Group, 16th\nNovember, 1943, to the re-opening of the\nKohima - Imphal road on the 22nd June, 1944,\nwhen at 1245 hours, at Milestone 109, the lead-\ning troops of the 2 British Division (33 Corps)\nmet the forward troops of 5 Indian Division\n(4 Corps), and thus shattered the Japanese\ndream of conquering India. This Despatch\ndescribes the operations from the 23rd June,\n1944, to the 12th November, 1944, when I\nhanddd over command of 11 Army Group to\nLieuti-General Sir Oliver Leese.\n\n2. The re-establishment of our communica-\n‘tions with Imphal opened a new phase in the\ncampaign. The Japanese invasion of India had\nbeen stopped ; it remained to throw the enemy\nback whence he had come. In the words of\nthe Prime Minister, the defence of the Imphal\nPlain and our subsequent successful offensive\n“constituted the greatest collision which had\nyet taken place on land with Japan and has\nresulted in the slaughter of between 50,000 and\n60,000 Japanese. The climax was the final\neviction of the Japanese from India with the\n‘almost total loss of five of his best divisions.”\nMy earlier Despatch dealt with “The defence\n\n* Operations in Burma and North-East India from\nth November, 1943 to 22nd June, 1944.\n\nof the Imphal Plain”; this Despatch deals\nwith “Our subsequent successful offensive”\nwhich drove the enemy back, not merely across\nthe Indo-Burmese frontier, but across the\nChindwin River, and opened the way for the\nre-conquest of Central Burma.\n\n3. In the operations I am about to describe,\nthe Japanese retreat began as a well-planned\nand orderly withdrawal. Gradually, as our\npressure grew, the pace of the withdrawal in-\ncreased until the enemy forces were split up\ninto small, disorganised parties. Hungry,\nharassed, beaten; abandoning their wounded,\ntheir guns and their transport, and even desert-\ning in small, but increasing numbers; the\nJapanese were -driven in defeat over the\nborder, down the far side of the mountain\nwall, and back over the Chindwin, which they\nhad crossed in triumph and with such high\nhopes less than five months earlier.\n\nTopography and Climate\n\n4. The formidable nature of the terrain was\none of the features of this campaign. Battles\nwere fought at 5,000 feet and over, often in\nalmost impenetrable jungle ; and troops, loaded\nwith full equipment, struggled up from nullahs\n2,000 feet below in the face of heavy small\narms, grenade and mortar fire. Yet, hazar-\ndous and difficult as the nature of the country\nmade every movement or operation, tanks often\nproved the decisive factor in the fighting up\nand down these mountain ranges, where they\nclimbed almost precipitous slopes to blast\nJapanese bunkers at a range of ten yards.\n\n5. As if still further to test the magnificent\nfighting spirit of the troops, another enemy was\nadvancing steadily upon us: the torfential\nmonsoon rain that turned tracks into leech-\n",

Slim*,\nfor operations during the monsoon and the\nmove of 36 British Division which was to go\nby road and rail to Ledo and thence by road\nto the Myitkyina area.\n\nTo complete the picture, the rdle allotted\nby the Supreme Allied Commander to General\nStilwell’s forces in North Burma (Northern\nCombat Area Command) was to protect the\nMogaung - Myitkyina area by establishing an\noutpost line ; Lonkin —- Talawgyi - Kazu — Fort\nHarrison — Seniku.\n\nThe Chinese Expeditionary Force (C-EF.)\nhad: orders from the Generalissimo to cross\nthe Salween River and join General Stilwell’s\nforces in the Myitkyina area.\n\n8. Such were our tasks : but before continu-\ning the narrative, a word about communica-\ntion and roads is necessary. I shall give an\naccount of road construction in a later section,\nwhen discussing engineering work, but the\ntracks which did duty for roads in the forward\narea may conveniently be described here, as\nthey will be frequently referred to in subse-\nquent paragraphs:\n\n@ A road from Palel to Tamu existed,\nbut it rapidly deteriorated when the monsoon\nstarted, and to quote from my Chief\nEngineer’s report “The mud had to be seen\nto be believed”. In these conditions, only\n4 x 4 lorries} were permitted to run south\nof Palel, though the rule had to be relaxed\noccasionally for specialist vehicles.\n\n(6) The road south from Tamu down the\nKabaw Valley can only euphemistically be\ncalled a road—it was a sea of mud varying\nin depth from six to eighteen inches. In\nthe worst places corduroy roads, over which\n\n. jeeps and 30-cwt. 6 x 6 lorriesf could pass,\nhad to be built.\n\n* Now Field-Marshal Sir William J. Slim, G.B.E.,\nK.C.B., D.S.0., M.C,\n\nt A 4.x 4 lorry is a four-wheeled vehicle, all four\nwheels of which can be driven by the engine. Similarly,\na 6 X 6 lorry is one in which the power can be trans-\nmitted to all of its six wheels, . .\n",

Although the picture at the end of June\n\nwas one of Japanese retreat on all sectors\n\nof the Imphal front, I must emphasize that\nour success had only been achieved after hard:\nfighting and severe losses on both sides.\n\nIndeed, the Army Commander described it as.\n\nthe bitterest fighting he had seen in this or.\n\nany other war.

The opening of the\nKohima - Imphal road on the 22nd June com-\npleted the first task set by the Supreme Allied\nCommander in his instructions of the 8th June.\n\n14. Though the opening of the road solved\nmany of our administrative difficulties, it also\ncreated a new set of problems. 2 British Divi-\nsion, though its morale was high, had suffered\nsevere casualties and was tired. It was clear\nthat the Division could not continue to fight\nwithout reinforcements and the necessary time\nand facilities to train them. All expedients to\nbring units up to strength were temporarily\nexhausted. The Corps Commander considered\nthat the Division should be withdrawn from\nactive operations until the Autumn. A rest\narea was therefore prepared but, as will be seen,\n4 Brigade had to be used temporarily to relieve\n20 Indian Division and, later, 5 Brigade was\ncalled upon to support 23 Indian Division.\n\n5 and 7 Indian Divisions had to resume their\nproper compositions, which had been upset\n‘when reinforcements had to be flown in during\nthe early stages of the battle. 161 Brigade,\nwhich belonged to 5 Indian Division, had been\nunder command of 7 Indian Division, and 89\nBrigade of 7 Indian Division had worked with\n5 Indian Division. These two Brigades had to\nreturn to their own Divisions.\n\n15. The operations against Ukhrul consisted\nof cross-country advances eastwards by 33 and\n89 Brigades of 7 Indian Division, from the\nKohima - Imphal road, in co-operation with an\nadvance north-east by 20 Indian Division along\nthe main Imphal ~ Ukhrul road. This was com-\nplicated initially because 20 Indian Division\nand 89 Brigade were under command of 4\nCorps, while 33 Brigade was under 33 Corps.\nHowever, as soon as the advance got under\nway, the Commander, 33 Corps assumed con-\ntrol of the whole operation.\n\n16. By the end of June, 20 Indian Division\nhad reached a point eight miles west of Ukhrul\nand 7 Indian‘ Division, further north, were\nclearing the area four miles south-east of\n\n‘Karong. | 1 .\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 1951\n\n23 L.R.P.

On the 30th June, the institution of a\nnew boundary between 4 and 33 Corps, and\nthe consequent transfer of 20 Indian Division\ndess 32 Brigade) from 4 Corps to 33 Corps,\nmarked the beginning of a new phase of opera-\ntions. This boundary gave the area between\nImphal and Ukhrul inclusive to 33 Corps, and\nleft 4 Corps with Imphal and the areas of 5\nIndian Division (Imphal-Bishenpur), 17\nIndian Light Division (Bishenpur) and 23 Indian\nDivision (Palel).\n\nThe Situation in early July.\n\n18. Chin Hills and Chindwin. As a result\nof our continuous pressure in the Imphal Plain,\nthere were signs at the beginning of July that\nthe Japanese forces in Manipur were giving up\ntheir plan for a final attack on Imphal.\n\n19. On the 3rd July a brigade of 7 Indian\nDivision captured Ukhrul from the west, while\na column of 23 L.R.P. Brigade entered the\nvillage almost simultaneously from the east.\nThe fall of Ukhrul was important since it was\nthe focal point of all communications in that\narea ; its capture removed all threats to Imphal\nfrom the north and north-east. 7\n\n20. On the 29th June, I had wired to General\nSlim that 31 Japanese Division would probably\nbe withdrawn to the south of Ukhrul, but that\nthe enemy might make a final desperate attempt\nto capture Imphal from the general direction\nof the Tiddim and Tamu roads. Although we\nhad sufficient strength to defeat any such\nattempt, our task of clearing the enemy west\nof the Chindwin would be facilitated if we\ncould develop a real threat to his communica-\ntions. I therefore directed him to consider\nwhether the advance on Ukhrul could be con-\ntinued south-south-east to Humine and Myothit\nat the head of the Kabaw Valley. This would\ngive 31 Japanese Division no chance to recover\nand would threaten the communications of 15\nJapanese Division at Thaungdut and Tamu.\n\n21. On the fall of Ukhrul, General Slim\nissued an Operation Instruction, dated the Sth\nJuly, directing 4 and 33 Corps to destroy the\nJapanese forces west of the Chindwin River.\n4 Corps, with 5 and 17 Indian Divisions and\none brigade of 20 Indian Division under com-\nmand, were to clear the area west of the general\nline Imphal-Shuganu. 33 Corps, with 2\nBritish, 7, 20 and 23 Indian Divisions, 268\nIndian Lorried Infantry Brigade, 23 L.R.P.\nBrigade and 50 Indian Parachute Brigade under\ncommand, were to clear the area east of this\n\n22. By the 10th July, it had become clear\nthat the Japanese had begun a general with-\ndrawal from their three main concentration\nareas about Bishenpur, Palel, and Ukhrul. They\nhad not captured Bishenpur or Palel.\n\n23. North Burma. Although General Stilwell\nwas now no longer under General Slim’s com-\nmand, I must review the operations as a whole,\nas they had, of course, to be co-ordinated. I\n",

Early in July, after the successful clearing\nof the Kamaing—Mogaung road, there were\nsigns that the enemy intended to fight succes-\nsive delaying actions in Taungni and Pinbaw,\nand then make a determined stand at Hopin.\nThe Myitkyina garrison seemed likely to fight\nit out, but no major reinforcements were being\nsent to its assistance. As I have already said,\nthe task allotted to Northern Combat Area\nCommand was to capturé the Mogaung-\nMyitkyina area and to establish an outpost line\nto cover it.\n\n25. Concurrently with General Slim’s Opera-\ntion Instruction, General Stilwell issued orders\nto the Mogaung and Myitkyina Task Forces.\nThe former, composed of 22 and 38 Chinese\nDivisions, with parts of 50 Chinese Division\nand Special Force, subsequently joined by 36\nBritish Division, was to capture the area from\nLonkin to Taungni. The latter, comprising\nparts of 30 and 14 Chinese Divisions, a United\nStates regiment, and a small detachment of\nSpecial Force, was to capture the area from\nTalawgyi to Seniku.\nOperations in July. .\n\n26. 15 Indian Corps. Operations in Arakan\nduring the month were confined to active\npatrolling in which several very successful small\nactions were fought. Some idea of the difficult\nconditions on this front can be gathered from\nthe fact that the weekly rainfall sometimes\nexceeded 20 inches.\n\n27. 4 Corps—-Bishenpur Area. By the end\nof June, 5 Indian Division had finished\nmopping up on both sides of the southern\nsector of the Kohima-Imphal road and\nhad concentrated at Imphal, except for one\nbrigade which had been sent to join 17\nIndian Light Division in its operations in the\nBishenpur area. During the first week in July\nthese two Divisions cleared the area north of\nthe Silchar-Bishenpur track. To the south,\nenemy resistance showed signs of weakening\n—many positions being evacuated in the face\nof our continued frontal pressure and attacks\nagainst his flanks. 33 Japanese Division was,\nhowever, reinforced by tanks and a composite\nregiment drawn from their 53 and 54\nDivisions and made a determined stand\nbetween the 12th and the 16th July on hills\noverlooking the track from the south. After\nsharp fighting, 5 Indian Division pressed south-\nwards through these hills and reached an area\nthree miles west of Ningthoukhong. By the\n18th, one brigade had established itself three\nmiles west of Milestone 24 on the Tiddim\nToad.\n\n28. In the meantime, 17 Indian Light\nDivision was attacking strongly held Japanese\npositions about Ningthoukhong. The enemy\nheld these till the 16th, when, assisted by the\noperations of 5 Indian Division, 17 Indian Light\nDivision captured the village. The enemy\nwere closely pursued and we captured much\nequipment, including 12 tanks. By the 18th,\nwe were following a retreating enemy, having\ntegained four miles of the Tiddim road. On\nthis date, 5 Indian Division assumed responsi-\nbility for operations on the Tiddim road with\none brigade of 17 Indian Light Division under\ncommand. The remainder of 17 Indian\nDivision was withdrawn into reserve.\n\n1715\n\n29. The Japanese withdrawal down the\nTiddim road was steadily and successfully\npressed. By the 25th July the enemy had\nbeen driven out of the Imphal Plain and, by\nthe Ist August, a flanking movement to the\nwest reached the road at Milestone 44.\n\nThus, by the end of July, 20 miles of the\nTiddim road had been recovered, with con-\nsiderable loss to the enemy in men and\nmaterial: captured equipment included 21\ntanks. The advance had been made in spite\nof the destruction of bridges and the laying\nof minefields and booby traps. The enemy was\nmuch .helped by continual heavy rain, which\nturned every stream into a serious obstacle\nand greatly increased the difficulties of move-\nment off the road.\n\n30. 33 Corps—Ukhrul Sector. During the\nfirst few days of July responsibilities for\nthe protection of the line of communi-\ncation, the defence of Imphal, the mopping\nup of enemy parties and operations for\nthe capture of Ukhrul were redistributed\nbetween 4 and 33 Corps. 33 Corps had\nalready taken over from 4 Corps the respon-\nsibility for operations against Ukhbrul on the\n30th June, and 20 Indian Division came under\nits command, |\n\n31. Until the 4th July 2 British Division\ncontinued to mop up the remaining parties of\nthe enemy who were still resisting fiercely\nin certain areas to the east and west of the\nmain road. With the eastward advance on\n\nin full swing, however, operations on\nthe Kohima-Imphal road ceased, and 2\nBritish Division, less one brigade which was\noperating in the Palel- Tamu sector under 23\nIndian Division, was disposed for the protec-\ntion of the main road.\n\n32. At the beginning of July, the two\nbrigades of 7 Indian Division, which were\nadvancing towards Ukhrul from the west,\nmade good progress in spite of bad weather,\nwhich greatly handicapped not only the march-\ning men but also the air supply on which they\ndepended. It was said at the time that for\nevery two feet a man climbed up the muddy\nslippery tracks he slid back one. On the 2nd\nJuly, they made contact with 23 L.R.P.\nBrigade, which was advancing from the north\nto attack Ukhrul and block the enemy’s\nescape to the east. The third brigade of\n7 Indian Division moved back to Kohima,\nwhich was to be its rest area.\n\n33, Ukhrul was captured on the 3rd July,\nbut opposition in the area was by no means at\nan end, as the Japanese continued to hold out\nin strongly entrenched positions, north, south\nand west of the village. On the 6th one\nbrigade of 7 Indian Division captured the\nhighest hill feature north of Ukhrul while the\nother moved south and south-east to block\nall exits. . The other enemy positions were\nassaulted successively and, by the 10th July,\nall resistance had been overcome.\n\n34. 7 Indian Division continued its advance\nalong the Ukhrul - Humine track, enemy road\nblocks being passed and left for troops in rear\nto remove. By the 17th, our leading troops\nhad reached Milestone 22, four miles south\nof Maoku. The Division was then withdrawn\nto rest at Kohima and was relieved by 4\nBrigade of 2 British Division.\n",

The second phase of these operations,\nwhich took place concurrently with the first\nphase which I have already described, was\nthe advance of 20 Indian Division along the\nImphal - Ukhrul road to join the forces about\nUkhrul and sever all possible lines of escape\nof the enemy. Like the first phase, the period\nwas one of great activity, and much fierce\nfighting. A Japanese force some 2,000 strong\nhad been isolated and was trying to escape to\nthe south-west. Bitter fighting developed\nbetween a desperate enemy trying to fight his\nway out of the net thrown round him and\ntroops equally determined to hold him. Very\nheavy casualties were inflicted, but our losses\nwere not light. The enemy’s forces were\ngradually compressed into a small area and\n20 Indian Division made contact with 7 Indian\nDivision on the 11th July.\n\n36. On the 17th July, 20 Indian Division\nwas withdrawn from the Ukhrul sector after\ndestroying the remnant, about 300 strong, of\nthis Japanese force and capturing all its guns\n-and transport. The Division was now con-\ncentrated to rest and refit about Wanjing, 16\nmiles south-east of Imphal, where it could, if\nnecessary, easily move in either direction and\nact as a reserve to 23 Indian Division on the\nTamu road or to 5 and 17 Indian Divisions\nabout Bishenpur. 50 Indian Parachute Brigade\n(two battalions) which had been operating\nmost successfully on the flank of 20 Indian\nDivision across the tracks running south from\nthe Imphal - Ukhrul road, was similarly with-\ndrawn for rest and re-organization in India.\n\n37. The operations of 23 L.R.P. Brigade,\nwhich belonged to Special Force (Long-Range\nPenetration troops), but which had not been\nflown into North Burma with that formation\nin March, deserve special mention. In their\nadvance south from Kharasom to the Ukhrul\narea, they operated in eight small columns\nacross exceptionally difficult country and\ninflicted severe casualties on 31 Japanese\nDivision retreating from Kohima. Four of\nthese columns, advancing from the north, co-\nordinated their movements with those of 7\nIndian Division on Ukhrul from the west.\nThe other four columns moved to the east\nand south-east of Ukhrul to cut the enemy’s\ncommunications.\n\nBy the 11th July, all tracks leading east\ntowards Homalin on the Chindwin had been\nblocked and many enemy destroyed, our own\ncasualties being negligible. In the third week\nin July, 23 L.R.P. Brigade was concentrated\nat Ukhrul before being withdrawn to India.\n\n38. 23 Indian Division—Tamu Sector. By\nthe middle of July, the enemy had been\ndriven from the area, and the\noperations ended with the complete rout of\nthe Japanese, who retreated down the tracks\nto Humaine and Tamu abandoning guns and\nlorries and leaving many dead. With the\nwithdrawal of 20 Indian Division and 23\nLRP. Brigade, interest switched to the Tamu\nsector where 23 Indian Division was engaged\nin driving the enemy from his strongly pre-\npared positions east and south-east of Palel.\n\nFor some time past, the enemy had been\nactive in this sector, but his counter-attack\nfailed to make any headway. His only success\nwas early -in the month when a small raiding\nparty reached the Palel airstrip at night and\ndamaged three aircraft. By the middle of\n\nSUPPLEMENT To tas LONDON GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 1951\n\nJuly, however, he had lost the initiative and\nwas being driven back. The fact that over\n100 Japanese were taken prisoner in one week\nwas some evidence of decreasing morale.\n\n39. The opening of 23 Indian Division’s\noffensive down the Tamu road in the middle\nof July began another phase of the campaign\nto drive the Japanese forces across the\nChindwin. The situation on the 24th July\nwas that one brigade, after making a wide\nturning movement via the Sibong track, had\noutflanked the enemy’s positions, established\nblocks on the Tamu road south of Sibong and\nin the Lokchao bridge area, and achieved com-\nplete surprise. The enemy was thus caught\nbetween these blocks and the two brigades\nadvancing on them from the north which, on\nthat date, had captured the strong Japanese\npositions at Tengnoupal after severe fighting.\nThe enemy’s defence in this area disintegrated\nand they withdrew, abandoning much heavy\nequipment, including some guns. By the 25th,\nwe had cleared an enemy block at Milestone\n49 and were exploiting to the south-east.\n\n40. 23 Indian Division continued its\nadvance down the Palel-Tamu road sup-\nported by tanks, over-running successive enemy\npositions and capturing nine guns. 268 Indian\nLorried Infantry Brigade, an independent\nformation, operating north of the road, pro-\ntected the left flank of 23 Indian Division.\nEnemy casualties in the last week of July had\nbeen heavy and his stubborn resistance had\nbeen fruitless.\n\n41. On the 31st July, 33 Corps assumed com-\nmand of 5 and 17 Indian Divisions and took\nover responsibility for the Tiddim road sector.\nOn the Ist August, Headquarters, 4 Corps,\nwas withdrawn to India for rest and training\nin mobile operations.\n\nSummary of Operations in July.\n\n42. Arakan. Apart from local patrolling in\ntypical monsoon weather, there was no activity\non either side.\n\n43. Chin Hills and Chindwin. Our troops\ncontinued to press the Japanese withdrawal :—\n\nIn the Ukhrul sector, the enemy were\ndriven back to a point 18 miles south of\n\nUkahrul.\n\nIn the Palel area, 23 Indian Division\nreached a point five miles north-west of\nTamu.\n\nOn the Imphal-Tiddim road, 5 Indian\nDivision reached the area 21 miles south\nof Bishenpur, capturing a number of guns,\ntanks and armoured cars in this advance.\n44. The general situation at the end of July\n\nwas that the Japanese were still retiring and\nit seemed likely they might decide to hold\nthe line Tiddim-Kalewa and northwards,\nalong the Chindwin River, for the rest of the\nmonsoon. Rain continued to hamper our\noperations, floods and continual landslides\nimpeding our progress and breaking our\ncommunications.\n\n45. North Burma. Operations against\nMyitkyina had continued. 77 L.R.P. Brigade\n(Special Force) which had been operating\nunder General Stilwell’s command in the\nMogaung area, and some columns of\n111 LR.P. Brigade, had been withdrawn\nto India by air. On the 19th July, 14 L.R.P.\nBrigade captured Ngusharaung, an important\n",

In accordance with instructions received\nfrom the Supreme Allied Commander, I issued\nan Operation Instruction on the 29th July to\nthe Commander, Fourteenth Army, directing\nthat plans be made for the following post-\nmonsoon operations : —\n\n(@) Arakan: An _ offensive/defence to\nsecute with minimum forces our present for-\nward positions in the Maungdaw — Tunnels\nArea and to prevent enemy penetration in\nthe Kaladan Valley, which might endanger\nthe operations of our Air Forces and our\nline of communication west of the Mayu\nRange.\n\n(6) Imphal Front: A phased plan (which\ncontemplated certain airborne operations)\nwith the following objectives:—\n\n@ Seizure of Kalemyo - Kalewa.\nGi) An airborne assault against the\n\nYe-U area, to gain a quick exit into the\n\nMandalay Plain, to be followed by ground\n\noperations to open the Kalewa- Ye-U\n\nroad so that heavy equipment, including\ntanks, could be brought forward for an\nadvance on Mandalay.\nGii) Capture of Mandalay - Pakokku.\n(iv) Consolidation along the general\nline Pakokku - Mandalay - Maymyo -\n\nKyaukme-Lashio (in conjunction with\n\nNorthern Combat Area Command).\n\n(©) I informed the Commander, Four-\nteenth Army, that the Northern Combat\nArea Command forces would advance to\ncapture the Katha~Bhamo area and later\nLashio, and that the Chinese Yunnan Force\nwould advance along the old Burma Road\nto capture Hsenwi and Lashio.\n\n(d) South Burma. A plan which did not\naffect the operations covered by this\nDespatch.\n\nOperation Instructions affecting Operations in\n\nAugust.\n\n47. On the 6th August, the Commander,\nFourteenth Army, gave 33 Corps the follow-\ning tasks :—\n\n(a) To pursue the enemy on the lines:\nImphal — Tiddim —- Kalemyo - Kalewa.\nTamu - Indainggyi - Kalewa.\n\nTamu — Sittaung.\n\n(b) To occupy Sittaung in order to deny\n\nthe use of the Chindwin River to the enemy.\n\n(©) If opportunity offered, to capture\n\nKalewa and establish a bridgehead in that\n\narea.\n\nHe was told that air supply could be pro-\nvided for a maximum of five brigades.\n\nOperations in August.\n\n48. Tiddim Road Sector. 5 Indian Divi-\nsion maintained the impetus of its advance\ndown the Tiddim road during the month,\nin spite of stubborn resistance by Japanese\n\ns; the 75th milestone, which marks\nthe _Indo-Burmese frontier, was passed ;\nand successive enemy positions—many of\n\n1717\n\nthem of great natural strength—were over-\ncome by a combination of frontal assaults,\nand wide turning movements through the\njungle-clad mountains. By the 4th August, the\nnumber of captured tanks had risen to 32, and\nby the end of the month a further 10 tanks,\n200 M.T. and 12 guns had fallen into our hands,\nOn the 31st August, our troops were engaged\nwith the enemy about Milestone 96.\n\nThese operations were distinguished by the\nhighly successful co-operation of air, tanks,\nartillery and infantry, which inflicted severe\ncasualties on the enemy and maintained the\nspeed of the advance.\n\n49. Lushai Brigade. This independent\nBrigade of three battalions had been given\nthe task of raiding the Japanese flanks and\nrear during their withdrawal down the\nTiddim road. It had been ordered by\n33 Corps at the end of July to intensify\nits operations southwards from Milestone 60\nalmost to Tiddim. The operation was most\narduous as the Brigade had to advance\neastwards by bad tracks across steep hills and\ndeep valleys in the height of the monsoon.\nDuring August, assisted by detachments of\nChin Levies, it was actively engaged with the\nenemy and caused him much damage.\n\nSome idea of the damage inflicted can be\ngauged from the fact that, in one week alone,\none battalion killed 92 of the enemy, wounded\nmany more, and destroyed a large number of\nlorries. The operations undoubtedly assisted\nthe advance of 5 Indian Division.\n\nTo facilitate co-operation, the Lushai\nBrigade was placed under 5 Indian Division\nfor operations from the 15th July. It\ncontinued to be dependent on air supply.\n\n50. Tamu —Sittaung Track and Kabaw\nValley. Operations to clear the enemy from\nthe Palel - Tamu road were very successful, and\nour forces occupied Tamu on the 4th August.\nThis village fell to 5 Brigade, of 2 British\nDivision, which had been placed under com-\nmand of 23 Indian Division and held in reserve\nin the Palel area. The village was found in\nan indescribable state as wounded, sick, dying\nand unburied dead Japanese officers and men\nabandoned by the enemy were lying in con-\nfusion in the houses and the streets. The\nlarge quantity of abandoned equipment in-\ncluded six guns and seventeen 3-ton lorries\nin good condition. The capture of Tamu was\nimportant as it is at the entrance of the Kabaw\nValley and lies at the junction of the tracks\nleading east to Sittaung on the Chindwin, and\nsouth to Kalemyo.\n\n51. On the 7th August, 11 (East African)\nDivision, which had been concentrating in the\nPalel area since the end of July, took over\nfrom 23 Indian Division, which was gradually\npulled out to rest in Shillong. 25 (East\nAfrican) Brigade advanced along the track to\nSittaung meeting little resistance to start with ;\n26 (East African) Brigade started down the\nKabaw Valiey.\n\nThe advance continued and, by the end of\nthe month, 25 (East African) Brigade had\nreached Milestone 28 on the Sittaung track\nhaving destroyed the enemy. 26 (East African)\nBrigade also made good progress, and suc-\ncessfully overcame many difficultjes, particu-\nlarly at the crossing of the Yu River which\nwas in full flood.

Heavy rainfull, with consequent\ndeterioration of the roads, delayed the arrival\nof bridging equipment, but ferrying began on\nthe 18th. The enemy’s opposition was reduced\nto the shelling of the main crossings.\n\n64. By the 20th September, we were attack-\ning strong enemy positions about Tonzang, the\nfirst town of any size after leaving the Imphal\nPlain. By the 22nd, a double advance from\nthe north and south made the Japanese\nevacuate this place without opposition, but\nsevere punishment was inflicted on their re-\ntreating columns. Tonzang was full of enemy\ndead and much equipment was captured.\n\n65. By the end of the month, the leading\nbrigade of 5 Indian Division was south of Mile-\nstone 147, after overcoming hostile rearguards.\n\n66. 33 Corps : (b) 11 (East African) Division\n(Kabaw Valley). During the first three weeks of\nSeptember, this Division (less one brigade)\nadvanced down the Kabaw Valley, in very bad\nweather.\n\n67. One brigade, capturing successive enemy\npositions, fought its way down the Tamu —‘Sit-\ntaung track, and reached Sittaung on the 4th\nSeptember. Bases from which extensive patrol-\nling was carried out were established across the\nflooded Chindwin River. At the end of the\nmonth, this brigade was relieved by units of\n268 Indian Lorried Infantry Brigade and con-\ncentrated in readiness for future operations.\n\n68. By the end of September, 11 (East\nAfrican) Division (less one brigade) had suc-\ncessfully attacked and captured strongly con-\nstructed and well stocked enemy positions three\nmiles north of Yazagyo and was engaged in\nclearing the area.\n\nThe progress made during the month was\nremarkable in view of the destruction of com-\nmunications by the continuous rain which\nstrained our administration to the utmost. It\nwas found necessary to employ the infantry\nand other combatant troops on roadmaking\nand similar works.\n\n69. The situation at the end of September\nwas:—\n\nOne brigade had captured an enemy posi-\ntion one mile north of Yazagyo, and was\nengaged in clearing the area.\n\nOne brigade, some 25 miles to the north-\neast, was pushing forward against opposi-\ntion three miles west-north-west of Mawlaik\non the Chindwin side of the Mawku Range\n\n1719\n\nwhich separates the Kabaw and Chindwin\nValleys.\n\nOne brigade, concentrated in the Sittaung\narea.\n\n70. Lushai Brigade. Throughout the month,\nthe Brigade continued its successful raids and\nambushes on the Japanese line of communica-\ntion, and in one week one battalion killed 111\nJapanese, wounded 56, destroyed 29 vehicles\nand damaged 20 others; during the same\nperiod, a detachment of Levies destroyed\n30,000 gallons of petrol.\n\n71. On the 17th September, Japanese posi-\ntions west of Haka were attacked, but there\nwas strong opposition and the arrival of enemy\nreinforcements forced us to withdraw; not,\nhowever, before an enemy supply column had\nbeen successfully ambushed and a bridge over\nthe Manipur River, near Falam, destroyed.\n\n72. 268 Indian Lorried Infantry Brigade.\nThis Independent Brigade, consisting of four\n—later five—battalions, was reorganized early\nin September to provide a screen west of the\nChindwin to protect divisions which were rest-\ning in the Imphal area. Its réle also included\nthe protection of the rear and flank of our\nformations operating south and south-east of\nImphal. :\n\nIt operated under command of 33 Corps in\nthe general area Tamanthi — Sittaung - Ukhrul,\nbut confined its operations across the Chind-\nwin to patrolling. A battalion of this force\nrelieved 25 (East African) Brigade in the Sit-\ntaung area at the end of September.\n\n73. Tarcol. This small composite force, to\nwhich I have already referred, was withdrawn\nduring the month. The Homalin - Thaungdut\narea had been cleared of the enemy and 4\nbattalion left in Thaungdut. A conservative\nestimate of the Japanese/J.IF, (Japanese-\ninspired Indian Fifth Column) dead found in\nthe area in which “Tarcol” had been operat-\ning was over 1,000—mainly from starvation.\nMany abandoned lorries also were discovered\nnear Humine.\n\nSummary of Operations in September.\n\n74. Arakan. Certain moves were carried\nout directly the monsoon slackened to secure\nareas of tactical importance, and small but\ndetermined enemy counter-attacks were\nrepulsed.\n\nPart of 55 Japanese Division, formerly op-\nposed to our forces in the Maungdaw area,\nwas withdrawn during the month. ; :\n\n75. Chin Hills and Chindwin. The advance\nof our troops down the Imphal -Tiddim road\nand, further east, down the Kabaw Valley con-\ntinued. 5 Indian Division after crossing the\nManipur River was entirely, and 11 (East\nAfrican) Division in the Kabaw Valley was\npartly, dependent on air supply.\n\nOn the Tiddim road, the village of Tuitum\nwas occupied on the 17th September, and by\nthe end of the month our leading troops were\nonly seven miles from Tiddim. Thus a dis-\ntance of 62 miles had been covered in one\nmonth against determined opposition and\nunder severe weather conditions. The Japanese\nsuffered heavy casualties during their retreat,\nand the withdrawal of the Headquarters of\n33 Japanese Division across the Chindwin in-\ndicated that they were not likely to put up a\nvery serious resistance, though it was expected\n",

If they did so, their forces would\nbe threatened by the advance of our troops\ndown the Kabaw Valley.\n\n76. The East Africans had advanced a\nfurther 15 miles down the Kabaw Valley\ntowards Kalemyo, and had reached a point\n26 miles south of Htinzin. Bad weather was\na greater obstacle to their advance than the\nenemy,\n\nOther East African troops had occupied\nSittaung ‘on the Chindwin on the 4th September\nand established a bridgehead on the eastern\nbank of the river. They were relieved in this\narea by an Indian formation at the end of the\nmonth. .\n\n71. North Burma. 36 British Division,\nmoving down the Myitkyina -Mandalay rail-\nway, had entered Hopin unopposed on the 7th\nSeptember. They found 500 Japanese bodies\nin the precincts of the village. By the end of\nSeptember, patrols had reached Mohnyin.\n\nChinese troops in the Kazu area had\nadvanced eleven miles south of the village.\n\n78. Order of Battle (Moves). The last of the\nLong-Range Penetration Brigades of Special\nForce was withdrawn from Burma into India\nduring the month.\n\n17 Indian Light Division left 33 Corps for\nIndia.\n\n2 British Division and 20 Indian Division\nwere resting at Imphal; 7 Indian Division\nwas at Kohima and 23 Indian Division at\nShillong.\n\n79. Record of 33 Corps. In the six months\nending September, 33 Corps, which first took\nthe field at Dimapur in April, had done sterling\nwork. During an advance of nearly 300 miles\nto the Tiddim area and about 270 to Yazago\nin the Kabaw Valley, 9,746 of the enemy were\nkilled and 459 Japanese and 331 J.LF.\nprisoners taken. 81 guns and 1,284 vehicles\nhad been captured.\n\n80. Revised Task for 15 Indian Corps.\nOn the 28th September, the Commander,\nFourteenth Army, in view of the re-grouping\nof the Japanese forces in Arakan, issued a\nfresh Operation Instruction to 15 Indian Corps.\nThe bulk of 55 Japanese Division had been\ntransferred from North Arakan into the lower\nIrrawaddy Valley, leaving a force of approxi-\nmately four battalions in the forward area.\nThree more enemy battalions belonging to 54\nJapanese Division were on Akyab Island and\nin the lower Kaladan Delta, and five battalions\nwere in the coastal area between the Barongas\nand Cheduba Island. Thus the enemy was in\nno position to launch a serious attack. The\ntasks allotted to 15 Indian Corps on the 4th\nSeptember were, therefore, changed and the\nCommander was ordered—\n\n(a) To secure the area Chittagong—Cox’s\nBazaar to prevent the enemy’s interference\nwith our preparations for a future airborne\noffensive.\n\n(6) To secure the estuary of the Naf as\na Base for light coastal forces and landing\ncraft.\n\n(c) To carry out reconnaissance, bombard-\nments and raids from the sea along the\nwhole Arakan coast to force the enemy to\nlock up troops in this area.\n\n@) To exploit any withdrawal or thinning\nout of the Japanese forces in Arakan.\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THe LONDON GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 1951\n\nOperation Instructions issued during October.\n\n81. On the Ist October, the Army Com-\nmander issued an Instruction 1o +33 Corps\nwhich stated that :—\n\n{a) His intention was to concentrate\nFourteenth Army eastwards in the Shwebo -\nMandalay Plain, to bring the enemy to battle\nand destroy him.\n\n(b) The tasks of 33 Corps were:—\n\n(@) To capture the area Kalemyo-\n\nalewa.\n\nGi) To establish a bridgehead over the\nChindwin at Kalewa.\n\nGi) To advance eastwards as quickly\nas possible and capture the Ye-U area\nwith the object of establishing air strips.\n(c) 4 Corps was concentrating in the\n\nImphal area and would be flown into the\n\nYe-U -Shwebo area at a later date.\n\nThe troops allotted to 33 Corps were 2\nBritish Division, 5 and 20 Indian Divisions,\nil (Bast African) Division, and the Lushai\nBrigade, but 5 Indian Division would be with-\ndrawn into Army reserve when Kalemyo had\nbeen captured.\n\n221 Group R.A.F. would be responsible for\nair support, and air supply would increase\nprogressively from 244 tons per day on the\nist October to 364 tons from the 1st November\nonwards,\n\n82. On the 6th October, I told the Com-\nmander, Fourteenth Army, that 3 Commando\nBrigade (four Commandos) would be placed\nunder his command from mid-October, and\nthat they were to be employed to encourage\nthe enemy to believe that amphibious opera-\ntions were imminent on the Arakan coast.\n\n83. I issued an important Instruction to the\nCommander, Fourteenth Army, on the Ilth\nOctober, regarding Allied operations in Burma,\n1944-45. In this, I repeated a Directive\nteceived from the Supreme Allied Commander,\nwhich stated that:— :\n\n“ Allied Forces in South-East Asia Com-\nmand will conduct concerted offensive opera-\ntions with the object of destroying or\nexpelling all Japanese forces in Burma at the\nearliest date. Operations to achieve this\nobject must not, however, prejudice the\nsecurity of the existing air supply route to\nChina, including the air staging port at\nMyitkyina, and the opening of overland\ncommunications.”\n\nI confirmed in more detail the objectives\nfor which I had ordered plans to be prepared\nin my Instruction of the 29th July.\n\nThe Fourteenth Army Order of Battle\nwas:—\n\n33 Corps—2 British Division, 5 Indian\nDivision initially, 11 (East African) Division,\n20 Indian Division, 254 Indian Tank\nBrigade, Lushai Brigade, 268 Indian Lorried\nInfantry Brigade (subsequently transferred to\n4 Corps). 4 Corps—7 and 19 Indian Divi-\nsions, 50 Indian Parachute Brigade for a\nspecific airborne operation. 255 Indian\nTank Brigade, which was to move to Imphal\nin October. 28 (East African) Brigade, due\nto move to Imphal in November.\n\nI have given the composition of each Corps,\nbut the allotment of divisions to Corps was,\nof course, left to the Commander, Fourteenth\n\nYy-\n",

On the front\nof 25 Indian Division, there was no renewal of\nthe fighting which occurred at the end of\nSeptember, and activity in the coastal sector\n-and east of the Mayu Range was reduced to\nvigorous patrolling and artillery fire.\n\nOn 26 Indian Division’s front, however, the\nJapanese attempted a reconnaissance in force of\nour left flank. A raiding force drawn from all\nthree regiments of 55 Japanese Division pene-\ntrated into the Goppe Bazaar area and be-\ntween the 6th and the 8th October we repelled\nattacks at Panzai and in the vicinity of Goppe.\nOur counter-attack was quick and strong and\nby the end of the week the enemy had been\ndispersed into the hills, losing two-thirds of his\nstrength killed and much equipment.\n\nOur patrols were active in the area during\nthe rest of the month.\n\n86. 3 Commando Brigade arrived at the end\nof October and assumed responsibility for the\nTeknaf Peninsula south of 26 Indian Division’s\nboundary.\n\n87. 81 (West African) Division. Early in the\nmonth, the Japanese based on Daletme and\nPaletwa showed considerable activity, but\n81 (West African) Division continued its ad-\nvance eastward to the Kaladan. They occupied\nMowdok and drove the enemy out of Labawa,\n‘six miles to the north-east. After this, resist-\nance became sporadic and by. the 25th October\nunits of both brigades had reached and crossed\nthe Kaladan and were in contact with the enemy\non the east bank. At the end of the month one\nbrigade had begun to advance down the Kala-\ndan River, while the other was moving south\ndown the Pi Chaung.\n\n88. Situation in Arakan at the End of the\nMonsoon. Although the monsoon prevented\nmajor operations by either side, we had before\nit ended seized the initiative and occupied\nseveral important positions beyond our front\nline in the May# Peninsula. At the same time,\n81 (West African) Division had moved across\nto the Kaladan Valley and captured Mowdok,\n\n(when\n\n1721\n\nthereby controlling the routes from the Kaladan\ninto the Sangu Valley, and removing a threat\nto our airfields and base.\n\n89.

Enemy\nresistance in scattered pockets both east\nand west of the road continued, and by\nthe 4th October the battle for Tiddim was\ndeveloping. Tiddim lies some 5,600 feet\nabove sea-level, 162 miles from Imphal. At\nabout Milestone 149, the road leaves the Mani-\n\n- pur River and climbs 3,700 feet in the next\n\nten miles, the first six of which consist of a\nseries of steep hairpin bends. The Japanese\nwere holding strongly dug-in positions about\nMilestone 158, with a forward position at Mile-\nstone 152. They were also entrenched at\nValvum (6,000 feet) and Sialam Vum (8,000\nfeet), which are strong natural features about\nthree miles and seven miles east of Tiddim\nTespectively.\n\n90. By the 10th October enemy resistance at\nMilestone 152 had been broken and operations,\nwhich, in spite of bad weather, were receiving\nstrong air support, were in progress against\nstubborn and fierce opposition in the Mile-\nstone 158, Valvum and Sialam Vum areas. A\nwide turning movement, by an infantry brigade,\nfound the enemy also strongly entrenched at\nTuibal, thirteen miles east of Tiddim.\n\n91. We pressed our attack with great vigour\nthroughout the following week. The final\nassault on the positions at Milestone 158 cover-\ning Tiddim was supported by a co-ordinated\nattack by tanks and Hurribombers. A thick\nmist hid the advancing tanks, while the noise\nof their engines was drowned by the roar of\nlow-flying aircraft. Complete surprise was\nachieved and the position was captured.\nTiddim was occupied on the 18th October, by\nwhich date the Valvum, Sialam Vum and\nTuibal positions had also been captured.\n\n92. After the occupation of Tiddim, one\nbrigade continued the advance along the\nTiddim -Kalemyo road, strong resistance at\nMilestone 7 being turned by a detachment from\nValvum. The Japanese, however, again made\na determined stand at Milestone 11 and to the’\nnorth of it.\n\n93. Meanwhile another brigade, west of\nTuibal, was attacking positions on the\nDolluang - Kennedy Peak track, in conjunction\nwith detachments of the Lushai Brigade which\nhad come up behind the enemy from the south-\nwest. Successful air strikes were a feature of\nthese operations.\n\n94, By the end of the month, good progress\nhad been made against the main enemy posi-\ntions in the Vital Corner- Fort White area,\n“Vital Comer” being the name given to the\nbend, about Milestone 13, where the road, after\n\ndue east and west, turns sharp south.\nOne brigade had successively captured enemy\npositions from Sialam Vum, through Milestone\n11, to Khum Vum, a 7,000 foot mountain about\nfour miles south of the road, and had estab-\nlished a block at Milestone 14. A second\nbrigade was making a shallow right hook to the\nsouth of the road, while the remaining brigade\nof the Division was engaged in a deeper turn-\ning movement farther south to cut off the\nenemy:in the Fort White area. Vital Comer\nwas thus virtually surrounded and the reduc-\ntion of its defences with maximum air and\nartillery support was in progress.\n",

During the\nfirst fortnight of October, the brigade which\nhad been operating in the Sittaung area\non the east of the Chindwin was moving\ninto and down the Kabaw Valley. The\nbrigade already in the valley entered Yazagyo\non the 4th October and then cleared the\ntracks, which lead from the Tamu -Kalemyo\nroad across to the Chindwin, of small enemy\ndetachments. To the north-east, the third\nbrigade of 11 (East African) Division had\nunsuccessfully attacked strong enemy positions\nnorth-west of Mawku, on the Chindwin River\nsix miles north of Mawlaik.\n\n96. In the third week of October, two\nbrigades were moving forward against opposi-\ntion, one brigade south of Yazagyo and one\nto the north-east of it. The third brigade\nhad launched an attack against the enemy posi-\ntions on the ridge north-west of Mawku and,\nafter confused fighting, had captured all but\none position, which was subsequently sur-\nrounded and the enemy in it destroyed. The\nstores and ammunition captured indicated that\nthe Japanese had intended a prolonged stand in\n\nis area.\n\n97. At the end of October, two brigades were\ncontinuing their advance south to Inbaung,\nafter destroying enemy positions on the hills\nto the east of the road. The third brigade\nwas fighting in and around Mawku Village.\n\n98. Lushai Brigade. [arly in October,\nthe brigade regrouped in order to stop\nthe southern exits from the Tiddim and\nKennedy Peak areas, and at the same\ntime continued its operations against the\nenemy’s Falam and Haka lines of communi-\ncation. These operations ended in the occupa-\n‘tion of Falam on the 18th October, Haka falling\nfour days later. These two places had been\ncaptured by the Japanese just a year before.\n\nSummary of Operations in October.\n\n99. Arakan—15 Indian Corps. During the\nearly part of the month, there was con-\nsiderable fighting in the Taung Bazaar and\nGoppe Bazaar areas with a strong hostile\ndetachment of all arms. It was severely de-\nfeated by 26 Indian Division. The Japanese\nobject had probably been either to cross the\nGoppe Pass to Bawli and thus prevent our\ntanks from entering the Mayu Valley, or else\nto establish a firm base at Goppe from which\ntaiding parties could operate.\n\n100. The enemy in Paletwa and Daletme had\nalso displayed increased activity in the Mowdok\narea, probably in an attempt to mislead us as\nto their strength in the Kaladan. They had\nnot, however, succeeded in delaying the ad-\nvance of 81 (West African) Division which,.by\nthe end of the month, had occupied Daletme\nand was pushing southwards down the Kaladan\nValley towards Paletwa.\n\n101. Activity in the coastal sector was con-\nfined during October to extensive patrolling by\nboth sides.\n\n102. Chindwin Front—33 Corps. The ad-\nvance of 5 Indian Division down the Tiddim\ntoad ended with their entry into Tiddim\non the 18th October, after strong’ enemy\npositions had been captured north and\neast of the village. The advance then con-\ntinued in a south-easterly direction towards\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 1951\n\nFort White and Kalemyo. By the end of the\nmonth, strong defences in the Kennedy Peak\narea were attacked and a turning movement to\ncut off Fort White was in progress.\n\n103. Falam and Haka had been occupied\nduring the month by elements of the Lushai.\nBrigade, the small Japanese garrisons with-\ndrawing southwards under pressure.\n\n104. In the Kabaw Valley, troops of 11 (East.\nAfrican) Division entered Yazagyo on the 4th\nOctober. The advance southwards was held\nup during the middle of the month by heavy\ntains, but subsequently continued. By the end\nof October, the Division, less one brigade, was.\nfighting in the area thirteen miles north of\nKalemyo. The brigade operating down the\nChindwin Valley, after capturing strong enemy\npositions north-west of Mawku, was engaged in.\nthe vicinity of the village itself. The situation\nat the end of October was that the Japanese\nhad withdrawn from the Chindwin River,\nnorth of Paungbyin, and were occupying posi-\ntions in the Atwin Yomas, north-west of\nMawlaik. It appeared possible that, when\ndriven from these, they might try to hold\nthe escarpment which divides the Chindwin\nfrom the Mu River.\n\n105. North Burma. Rapid progress was\nmade during the month in our southward\nadvance down the railway. On the 2ist\nOctober, 36 British Division occupied\nMohnyin, the Japanese apparently being\ntaken by surprise as large quantities of\nstores, ammunition and supplies fell into\nour hands. After overcoming slight oppo-\nsition at Mawhun, Mawlu was captured\non the 31st October. The enemy abandoned\nlarge trenched areas in Mawhun without fight-\ning, but put up a stiffer resistance at Mawlu,\nwhich incidentally had been the stronghold of\none of our Long-Range Penetration Brigades\nduring ‘the Spring.\n\n38 Chinese Division, advancing down the\nroad towards Bhamo from the Kazu area, was\nonly twenty-four miles north-north-east of\nBhamo by the 31st October.\n\nOperation Instructions issued prior to the 12th\nNovember. : :\n\n106. On the 6th November, the Commander,\nFourteenth Army, instructed 4 Corps to em-\nploy one brigade group with the object of:—\n\n(a) Capturing Pinlebu by an overland\n\nadvanice.\n\n(b) Patrolling in the direction of Indaw —\nKatha and establishing contact with\nNorthern Combat Area Command.\n\n(c) Patrolling to the rail/road in the area\nwo G: - Indaw. | th\n\nining information as to the prac-\n\nticability of routes from the Chindwin River\n\nto the line of the rail/road for the passage\n\nof large forces, including medium tanks.\n\nLeading units of this brigade group were\nto cross the Chindwin not later than the 20th\nNovember and the roads Tamu-Tonhe and\nTamu -—Sittaung were to be improved to the\nstandard of “ Fair-weather class 5, one-way ”\nby the 15th December and the 15th January\nrespectively. : ;\n\n107.

(Provision of\n\na third brigade under consideration.)\n\n82 (West African) Division. (On arrival\n’ in Arakan.)\n50 Indian Tank Brigade.\n3 Commando Brigade.\nCorps Troops.\n\nThe reason for this change was to free the\n‘Commander, Fourteenth Army, from respon-\nsibility for Arakan, in view of the important\ngperations he was about to undertake in\n\nura.\n\n108. On the 9th November, I issued orders\nfor the formation of a command and staff for\nthe lines of communication, to centralise the\nlines ‘of communication under a separate\n‘Commander and thus relieve the Commander,\nFourteenth Army, and Commander, 15 Indian\nCorps, of responsibilities for their rear areas.\nThe new Line of Communication Command\n‘was to comprise the existing 202 and 404 Lines\nof Communication Areas and the Fort Hertz\nArea. The rear boundaries of. Fourteenth\nArmy and 15 Indian Corps were to be adjusted\nas the progress of operations dictated, in order\nto relieve the forward Commander of adminis-\ntrative responsibilities.\n\n109. My third Operation Instruction dated\nthe 9th November, was addressed to the Com-\nmander of 15 Indian Corps.\n\nThe general objects I gave to him were :—\n\n(a) To clear Arakan to the line (inclusive)\nAkyab-Minbya as early as possible, in\norder to release troops for other purposes.\n\n(b) To secure the area Chittagong - Cox’s\nBazaar.\n\nThe specific tasks were :— :\nue. 4 land advance cin Arakan down the\nlayu Peninsula, the Kalapanzin ley an\nthe Kaladan Valley, to destroy or expel the\nJapanese within the area north of the general\nTine Foul Point -Kudaung Island —Minbya.\nThis advance was to start as soon as possible.\n(6) An amphibious assault on Akyab\nIsland about the 15th January, supported by\nthe maximum sea and air bombardment.\n(© Consolidation to secure firmly the area\nnorth of the general line Akyab - Minbya.\n\n110. My object in issuing the above Instruc-\ntion was twofold :—\n\n(@ To ‘tie down and destroy in Arakan\nJapanese forces which might otherwise be\nused against Fourteenth Army.\n\n(b) By destroying the Japanese forces in\nArakan it would be possible to release forces\nfor other operations which the Supreme\nAllied Commander was anxious to under-\n\nOperations from the 1st to the 12th November.\n\n111. Arakan—15 Indian Corps. 25 and 26\nIndian Divisions continued their active patrol-\nling and other minor operations with steady\nsuccess. The leading brigade of 82 (West\nAfrican) Division arrived to relieve troops in\nthe Kalapanzin area.\n\n1723\n\n81 (West African) Division continued its\nadvance down the Kaladan in spite of consider-\nable enemy resistance and reached the out-\nskirts of Paletwa.\n\n112. Chindwin Front—33 Corps: (a) 5\nIndian Division (Tiddim - Kalemyo Road). It\nwill be recalled that, at the end of\nOctober, 5 Indian Division having cut in be-\nhind the Japanese and launched a converging\nattack, was assaulting their positions at Vital\nCorner, while one brigade was carrying out a\nwide turning movement against Fort White.\nThe beginning of November saw the capture\nof Vital Corner and the final breakdown of all\nenemy resistance northwards from Milestone\n14 to Sialam Vum inclusive, the enemy suffer-\ning heavy casualties. We resumed our advance\ndown the road and finally stormed Kennedy\nPeak, the 9,000 foot mountain just south of\nMilestone 15, on the 4th November after two\nattacks had failed. A sharp action was then\nfought for the positions dominating the road\nbetween Milestones 22 and 23. Point 8225 was\nsuccessfully assaulted on the 7th November\nand Fort White occupied without further\nopposition. In spite of the mountainous\ncountry, tanks were able to play an important\npart in the fighting.\n\n113. The brigade moving to outflank Fort\nWhite had, in the meantime, cleared the enemy\nfrom a 7,000 foot feature three miles down the\nFort White -Falam track (Point 7480). Then,\nafter an initial failure, they gained the main\nroad and established a road-block near Mile-\nstone 25, where later they gained touch with\nthe brigade advancing along the road itself.\nStiff resistance was met at Vownalu Mual\n(Milestone 29), and again at Milestone 31 where\nwe were held up for two days. However, on\nthe 11th November the advance was resumed,\nNumbers 2 and 3 Stockades falling without\nopposition. Forward elements pressed on to\nMilestone 40, but the main body was delayed\nby stiff resistance east of Number 2 Stockade.\n\nThe third brigade of the Division was en-\ngaged during this period in blocking tracks,\nand a heavy toll was taken of the Japanese try-\ning to escape by these routes.\n\n114. 33. Corps: (6) 11 (East African)\nDivision (Kabaw Valley and Chindwin). Early\nin the month, the leading brigade, with\ntank support, cleared the enemy from all\nhis positions south of Yazagyo and then in-\nflicted further heavy casualties as he was\nsuccessively driven out of positions further to\nsouth. The enemy next stood three miles\nnorth of Indainggyi (six miles north-east of\nKalemyo) where his positions were only cap-\ntured after all the defenders had been killed.\n\nThe brigade in support was following up\nclosely, having sent detachments (a) to clear\nthe track leading from the Kabaw Valley to\nMawlaik and (b) to block the tracks from the\nwest and thus destroy enemy parties escaping\nfrom 5 Indian Division in the Dolluang area.\n\nMeanwhile the brigade pushing down’ the\nChindwin had overcome strong resistance in\nthe vicinity of Mawku and, on the 11th Novem-\nber, occupied Mawlaik. It then advanced\nastride the river.\n\n11 (Bast African) Division reached Kalemyo\non the 15th November, and thus ended this\nphase of the operations.\n",

The leading division (19\nIndian) of 4 Corps entered the forward zone\nearly in November, and concentrated in the\narea of the Tamu - Sittaung track..\n\n268 Indian Lorried Infantry Brigade was\ntransferred from 33 to 4 Corps. The order not-to\noperate east of the Chindwin was cancelled\nand part of the Brigade was disposed on the\neast bank of the river.\n\nSummary of Operations,\n\nNovember,\n\n116. Arakan—15 Indian Corps. There was\nno fighting on an important scale. 81 (West\nAfrican) Division reached the outskirts of\nPaletwa in its advance down the Kaladan.\nThe leading brigade of 82 (West African)\nDivision had arrived in Arakan.\n\n117. Chin Hills and Chindwin—33 Corps.\nOn the 4th November, a brigade of 5 Indian\nDivision had captured Kennedy Peak, much\nequipment falling into our hands. Troops\nof this Division had then encircled Fort White,\nand forced the enemy to evacuate his positions\non the 8th November. No. 2 and 3 Stockades\nwere taken without opposition on 11th, Novem-\n\nr.\n\n118.

North Burma. After consolidating\ntheir positions at Mawlu, 36 British Division\nhad almost reached Pinwe, six miles north\nof the important junction of Naba, by the\n12th November. Meanwhile, 38 Chinese\nDivision had occupied Myothit, sixteen miles\nnorth-east of Bhamo, meeting only slight\nopposition.\n\n120. On the 3rd November, Lungling fell to\ntroops of the Chinese Expeditionary Force,\nhaving changed hands at least four times during\nprolonged fighting over many months. It is im-\nportant to note that, when the Bhamo area was\nfinally cleared, we should have a potential fair-\nweather route from Burma to China, through\nMyothit, Tengchung and Lungling, although an\nall-weather road would not be open to us until\nNamhkam was taken. Thus we were already\nwithin measurable distance of achieving one of\nour objects—the re-opening of land communi-\ncations with China.\n\nNaval and Air Co-operation.\n\n121. @) Light coastal forces, comprising for\nthe most part heavy draught motor launches,\nTesumed operations off the Arakan coast in\nOctober, in support of 15 Indian Corps. The\nmain operational base was Chittagong, but an\nadvanced base was also established in the Naf\nRiver, 115 miles south of Chittagong. There\nwere several successful guerilla operations, and\nseveral enemy aircraft which attempted to\nintervene were destroyed.\n\nThese small craft harassed the Japanese\nlines, of communication and made successful\nattacks on the enemy’s supply ships.\n\nFlotillas of landing craft, whose crews had\nbeen trained by the Royal Indian Navy, were\nemployed off the Arakan coast early in\nNovember in landing small raiding parties.\n\n(b) As air operations have been described\nin detail in the Despatches of the Air Com-\nmander-in-Chief, I have said little of what was\n\nIst to the 12th\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THs LONDON GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 1951\n\ndone by the Air Forces during the period\ncovered by this Despatch. This Despatch\nwould, however, be incomplete without some\nspecial remarks on the co-operation between\nthe Army and the R.AF.\n\nThe outstanding feature of the operations\nhas been the closeness of the co-operation\n\n‘between the Army and the R.AF., and the\n\nbattle may well be described as a true com-\nbined operation in which neither Service could\nhave succeeded without the other.\n\nThese combined operations may be con-\n\nsidered under the following headings: —\n(@ Strategical.\n(6) Tactical.\n(c) Administrative.\n\nStrategically the sustained and very\nsuccessful attacks on the enemy’s air forces,\naerodromes and communications combined to\ndestroy his air forces and to restrict the power\nof his ground forces. These successes gave\nour own forces freedom of manoeuvré and\nhampered those of the Japanese so severely\nthat he was short of ammunition, stores and\nequipment during the battle. The long flights\nin bad weather over difficult country were\nsplendid achievements by all ranks of the\nRAF.\n\nTactically, co-operation grew ever closer as:\nthe battle continued and the R.A.F. assumed\nthe réle of mobile heavy artillery which could\nnot be got forward over the roads of Burma.\nThere is no doubt that the low-level attacks with\nbombs and machine guns on the hostile de-\nfences were decisive in enabling the infantry\nto close with the Japanese. As time went on\ncommunication between the forces on the\nground and the supporting aircraft improved\nuntil it was possible for commanders on the\nground to direct them on to small targets\nentirely concealed by the jungle from the air.\n\nFinally, the Army did not feel happy in\nattacking Japanese defensive positions unless\nthey had the co-operation of the fighter-\nbomber. :\n\nClose as was the co-operation in the actual\nfighting, success could not have been achieved\nwithout the transport of troops, the continued\nsupply from the air and the evacuation of\ncasualties,\n\nApart from the fly-in of Special Force there\nwere many noteworthy movements of troops,\nespecially those of 5 and 7 Indian Divisions\nand 2 British Division, large parts of which\nwere flown to Imphal and Dimapur.\n\nThese large-scale movements by air defeated\nthe Japanese plan which counted on contain-\ning our troops in Arakan when they began\ntheir offensive across the Chindwin.\n\nI have written in my earlier Despatch of the\nmagnificent work done in supplying 4 Corps by\nair. The pursuit of the Japanese by 11 (East\nAfrican) Division down the Kabaw Valley was\nlikewise made possible by air supply. There\nwere numerous other smaller supply operations.\n\nThe greatly increased evacuation of\ncasualties by air gave a great fillip to the morale\nof the troops. The figures of 56,800 sick and\nwounded casualties flown back during the year\nNovember 1943-November 1944 speak for\nthemselves.\n\nThe Army, as can be seen, has great cause\nto be grateful to the R.A-F., and once again\nI want on behalf of 11 Army Group to thank\n\n,\n",

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 1951\n\nall ranks of the R.A.F. from the Commander-\nin-Chief, Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Peirse,\nto the latest joined airman for their magnificent\nsupport and co-operation.\n\nLessons of the Campaign.\n\n122. (@) The operations which I have de-\nscribed in this Despatch have emphasised the\nlessons which I mentioned in my first\nDespatch, particularly the need for first-class\nbasic training of the junior leaders and the\nrank and file, physical fitness and good\ndiscipline.\n\n(6) They have also shown that it is possible\nfor troops to operate in the monsoon if air\nsupply is possible.\n\nI should like, however, to add a word of\nwarning about the possibility of campaigning\nat full scale in the monsoon. In the operations\nfor which I was responsible, we were compelled\nby the Japanese offensive to fight in the\nmonsoon.* We did so successfully, and drove\nthe Japanese back from the positions they\nreached in and about Imphal. The cost was high,\nall ‘divisions, especially 2 British Division,\nwere much reduced in strength by sickness and\nboth officers and men were much exhausted.\n\nThe pursuit which continued until the end of\nNovember was, with the exception of 5 Indian\nDivision, made by fresh: troops, who then had\nto be withdrawn to rest.\n\nThe time limit for troops operating in the\nmonsoon in the Burmese jungle appears to be\nabout three months, after which they need rest\nin a rear area. The conditions under which\ntroops operate in the dry weather are so in-\nfinitely better and the communications both\nair and ground so much more reliable that it is\nin my opinion uneconomical to use more\ntroops than are absolutely necessary under\nmonsoon conditions. It may be vital to fight\nin the monsoon, but a high wastage rate must\nthen be expected and operations in the dry\nweather will be reduced or delayed by the need\nfor resting and reinforcing those formations\nwhich operated during the monsoon, unless\nthere are available very large reserves to take\ntheir places.\n\n(c) The increasing accuracy of air bombard-\nment of tactical targets in jungle. This was\nof the greatest help as divisions which were\nwholly supplied by air had frequently a very\nlimited supply of artillery ammunition. wu\n\n(@ The increased ability of brigades and\nlarger formations to leave the road and move\nby tracks through the jungle to attack the\nenemy’s flanks and rear.\n\nIntelligence.\n\n123. Enemy Strengths and Dispositions.\nAs mentioned in my first Despatch,\nthe Japanese strength in Burma had increased\nfrom four divisions to nine in the twelve months\nending June, 1944. One additional div‘sion\n(the 49th) arrived in this Theatre in October.\n\n124. Enemy Casualties and Morale, The\ntotal number of enemy killed (actually\ncounted) between July and October amounted\nto 8,859 on the Fourteenth Army front and\n3,724 on the Northern Combat Area Com-\nmand front. No captured documentary\n\n* War Office footnote: See also the Supreme Allied\n\nCommander's Report, South-East Asia, 1943-1945, Part\nA,, para. 59; Part B., paras. 185-186 and 201~203.\n\n1725\n\nevidence is available regarding the number of\nenn and sick, but it was undoubtedly\n\nThese severe losses added to those of the\nearlier months, coupled with the steady and\nincreasing pressure which we maintained on\nhis retreating divisions, must have weakened\nhis morale. Though the individual officer and\nman will doubtless continue, in accordance\nwith Japanese tradition, to resist fanatically\nwhen occupying defensive positions, I have no\ndoubt that the standard of training and will to\nbattle will deteriorate and that we shall not\nagain meet Japanese forces of their former\nstandard.\n\nParT II. RE-ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMAND\nARRANGEMENTS.\nAvailability of Infantry Formations.\n\n125. (a) I mentioned in my first Despatch*\nthe acute shortage of infantry, especially British,\nreinforcements, and I of course discussed the\nsituation with the Supreme Allied Commander\non many occasions. On the 24th June, I wrote\nto him that I had been examining -his instruc-\ntions of the 8th June, to exact the maximum\neffort during the monsoon season. I pointed\nout that there were two major difficulties to\novercome :—\n\n(i) The need to withdraw certain divisions,\nwhich had been engaged for long periods in\nactive operations, for rest, re-organization\nand training.\n\n(ii) The general shortage of reinforce-\nments.\n\n(>) My examination showed that we had two\nalternatives, each bound to affect operations.\nHither we had to—\n\n@ Accept the necessity for resting forma-\ntions, and thereby reduce the number avail-\nable for operations, or\n\nGi) Decide against any rest, and thereby so\nreduce the efficiency of formations that, by\nthe end of the Winter, they would be unfit\nfor further fighting.\n\n(©) The general reinforcement sifuation was\nsuch that—\n\nGi) It appeared that we could not maintain\n2 British Division at war strength.\n\n(ii) Special Force must be substantially\nreduced.\n\n(iii) We should have the greatest difficulty\nin finding a formation to replace 36 British\nDivision, about to relieve Special Force,\nwhen its replacement became necessary.\n\n(a) I, therefore, recommended that—\n\n(i) We must accept the fact that some\ndivisions would have to be rested during\nthe coming Winter.\n\nGi) The programme of rest should be\nplanned on the basis of using nine divisions ;\nthree in the Arakan, with one in reserve,\nand four in Assam, with one in reserve.\n\nI added that I should leave no stone un-\nturned to discover ways and means for im-\nproving: the supply of reinforcements.\n\n126. This letter was followed by a discus-\nsion with the Supreme Allied Commander and\nthe Commander-in-Chief, India. In conse-\nquence,, I decided that in future we should try\n\n* Operations in Burma and North-East India from\nthe 16th November, 1943 to the 22nd June, 1944.\n",

Initially,\none of the nine active divisions would be in\nArmy Group reserve.\n\nI also decided that only one division (17\nIndian) would leave the Fourteenth ly area\nfor rest and re-organization and that the\nothers would remain in the Shillong—Imphal\narea. The following formations would move\nback into India Command: H.Q. 4 Corps,\n50 Parachute Brigade, 23 L.R.P. Brigade, 268\nIndian Lorried Infantry Brigade, and three\nArmoured Corps units.\n\n127. By this time our air supremacy, and\nour improved strategical situation, justified the\ndisbandment of a considerable number of light\n_ AA. batteries, The officers and men thrown\n\nup in consequence were available to train as\ninfantry and, added to increased reinforce-\nments from England, enabled me to bring 2\nBritish Division up to strength.\n\nThe relief of 36 British Division did not arise\n\nduring the period covered by this Despatch.\n- 128. As a result of the experience gained\nfrom the operations of Special Force, I had\ndecided that the future réle of such a force be\neither—\n\n(a) To provide mobile infantry brigades\nspecially equipped to make turning move-\nments away from roads and tracks or protect\nflanks in exceptionally difficult country.\n\n(6) Deeper penetration as a Special Force\ncapable of continuous mobile operations for\nlong periods.\n\nI also considered that a change of name,\nto conform with these réles, was desirable and\nthe term “Penetration Brigade” was substi-\ntuted for “ Long-Range Penetration Group ”.\n\n129. Taking into consideration our available\nmanpower and the desirability of providing at\nleast one Penetration Brigade by the end of the\nyear, I asked the Commander-in-Chief, India,\nearly in August—\n\n(@) To re-form initially four brigades, of\nwhich one would be entirely British.\n\n(b) To re-form two more British brigades\nlater, if reinforcements became available.\n\nI estimated that one brigade would thus be\nready for operations by mid-December and the\nother three a month later. The period of re-\norganization and training of Special Force had\nto allow for the re-formation of its ancillary\nservices, as these brigades had to be self-con-\ntained.\n\n130. A month later, after consultations with\nthe War Office and the Commander-in-Chief,\nIndia, it became clear that we should have to\nreduce Special Force to four brigades, and this\nI recommended to the Supreme Allied Com-\nmander.\n\nDuring October the decision to form an Air\nLanding Brigade and to provide a third brigade\nfor 36 British Division further reduced the\npossibility of forming Penetration Brigades,\nbecause reinforcements for the two former for-\nmations could only come from Special Force.\nI agreed, therefore, that this Force should con-\nsist only of three Brigades.\n\nFormation of an Indian Airborne Division.\n131. In August, the Supreme Allied Com-\nmander asked the Commander-in-Chief, India,\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 1951\n\nto examine the problem of forming an airborne\ndivision, the raising of which was supported\nby the War Office. The main points in the\nCommander-in-Chief’s reply were—\n\n(a) The division could be formed and\ntrained by the 15th February, 1945, subject\nto the conditions given in (5) to (e) below.\n\n(6) A British parachute brigade from out-\nside India must arrive fully trained by the\n15th November.\n\n({c) 26 Indian Infantry Brigade to be made\navailable as an air landing brigade at\nthe expense of making up 36 British Divi-\nsion to three brigades. (A brigade from\nSpecial Force was later substituted for 26\nBrigade as an air landing brigade and the\nJatter remained allotted to 36 British Divi-\nsion).\n\n(@) 875 glider pilots to be available by\nthe Ist December.\n\n(@) Transport aircraft equivalent to\ntwenty squadrons to be made available by\nthe 15th January. *\n\nDuring the prolonged discussions regarding\nthe formation of an Indian airborne division\nI had provided India Command with my pro-\nposals for the re-organization of 50 Indian\nParachute Brigade which I assumed would pro-\nvide the nucleus of such a division.\n\n44 Indian Airborne Division was finally\nformed by India Command on the Ist Novem-\nber.\n\nConversions of Divisions to a Standard Divi-\nsional Basis.\n\n132. As I wrote in my first Despatch, our\nearlier operations had shown that divisions\norganized and equipped for special réles were\nuneconomical and wasteful. Later we had had\nexperience of the unsuitability of a division,\nsuch as the 2nd British or 25th Indian, equipped\nsolely with mechanical transport, for warfare\nin mountainous jungle country and of the tac-\ntical disadvantages inherent in a Light Division\nof two brigades such as the 17th Indian.\n\nTo overcome this, the organization of a\nStandard Division—details of which are con-\ntained in my first Despatch—was produced, and\nthe Commander-in-Chief, India, had accepted\nmy recommendations.\n\nArmy and Corps Commanders were given a\nfree hand to select the most suitable time for\nthe re-organization of their divisions.\n\nWhen I relinquished command all divisions,\nexcept Special Force of which I have alréady\nwritten, had either re-organized or were re-\norganizing.\n\n17 Indian Light Division.\n\n133. 17 Indian Light Division was the only\nlarge formation to be rested and re-organized\noutside the area of Fourteenth Army. I had\ndecided that this Division should be rested in\nIndia because it had been in the forward zone\nfor 3} years and had to be completely re-\norganized.\n\nAmong other changes it had to absorb a\nthird brigade and to change the composition\nof its brigades from three Gurkha battalions\nto brigades of one British, one Indian and one\nGurkha battalion. The Division was to be\nready for service again by February.\n",

As we advanced into Burma, we had to\n‘find troops for internal security in re-occupied\nterritory, until such time as the police force\ncould be re-created.\n\nI had of course no intention of detaching\nbattalions from infantry divisions on such duty.\nThe most suitable type of unit was one com-\nposed of officers and men who had had ex-\nperience in the Burma Frontier Force or\nBurma Military Police. [, therefore, arranged\nwith the Commander-in-Chief, India, for 2 and\n4 Burma Regiments to be trained for'this duty\nand earmarked for Fourteenth Army. I said\nthat I should probably need more battalions.\n\nI also asked the Commander-in-Chief, India,\nto obtain the agreement of the Government of\nBurma to disband the Northern Kachin Levies\nand to re-form them into two Kachin battalions\nfor use later for internal security.\n\nRe-organization of the Chain of Command.\n\n135. I had come to the conclusion in August\nthat future operations would make continued\ncontrol of the Arakan operations by Head-\nquarters, Fourteenth Army, impossible. I there-\nfore ordered that a re-organization of command\nshould be examined on the following basis :—\n\n(a) That the command of 15 Indian Corps\nshould pass from Headquarters, Fourteenth\nArmy, to H.Q., 11 Army Group.\n\n(6) That H.Q., Fourteenth Army, should\nbe reconstituted as a mobile Field Army\nH.Q., for the command of two Corps, and\nbe relieved of the responsibility for the lines\nof communication.\n\nI was also examining the formation of a new\nheadquarters to be known as H.Q., L. of C.\nCommand, to be located at Comilla. I in-\ntended that the Commander of the Lines of\nCommunication should command both the\nexisting Areas (202 and 404) of the L. of C.\nand thus free the Commander, Fourteenth\nArmy, and Commander, 15 Indian Corps, from\nthe work which the control of the lines of\ncommunication involved.\n\n136. As a result of this examination, I gave\nthe following orders:— —\n(@) H.Q., Fourteenth Army, to be re-\norganized.\n\n{b) H.Q., L. of C. Command, to be set\nup, the commander of which would assume\ncontrol directly under H.Q., 11 Army Group,\nof the existing 202 and 404 L. of C. Areas.\n\n(c) Establishments of H.Q., Sub-Areas, to\nbe standardised to simplify the future adjust-\nment of boundaries of sub-areas.\n\n(dq) Two Advanced Echelons, 11 Army\nGroup, one of which already existed, to be\nformed to assist H.Q., 11 Army Group to\ncontrol general administration on the L. of C.\nThe date selected for the transfer of 15 Indian\n\nCorps to command of 11 Army Group and the\nformation of H.Q., L. of C. Command, was the\n15th November. H.Q., Fourteenth Army,\nmoved to Imphal at the same time.\n\n137. In re-organizing Command and Admini-\nstration I was looking ahead. I foresaw that\nwhen the re-occupation of Burma was com-\nplete, the commander of these Ls. of C. would\nprobably extend his command to include the\nwhole of Burma and that 202 and 404 Areas\n\n(4487)\n\n1727\n\nwould then be transferred to the command of\nthe Commander-in-Chief, India. The ‘flexi-\nbility of the organization should admit of future\nadjustments and extensions.\n\n138. This examination of the organization of\nthe L. of C. confirmed my opinion that some\nre-organization of the establishments of recep-\ntion camps, reinforcement camps, feeding and\nwelfare arrangements generally on the L. of C.\nwas overdue.\n\nIt was not, however, possible to start this\nre-organization for lack of men, as all British\npersonnel likely to be available were to be\nabsorbed in the formation of H.Q., L. of C.\nCommand, and the re-organization of Head-\nquarters, L. of C. Areas and Sub Areas. I had,\ntherefore, to defer these measures until the\nmanpower situation had improved.\n\nChanges affecting East African Forces.\n\n139. (a) It was necessary to re-organize 11\n(East African) Division to bring it as far as\npossible into line with an Indian Standard\nDivision.\n\n(6) 22 and 28 (East African) Brigades, which\nformed part of the garrison of Ceylon, were\non a different establishment from the brigades\nof 11 (Bast African) Division. It was always\nmy intention to re-organize these two Brigades\nso that they should be inter-changeable with\nthose of 11 Division. It has not, however, been\npracticable to make this change.\n\nI foresaw, however, that additional brigades\nwould be needed both in Fourteenth Army and\n15 Indian Corps. I therefore arranged to\nwithdraw 22 and 28 (East African) Brigades\nfrom Ceylon. This left Ceylon with three\nlocally enlisted battalions only.\n\nRe-organization of Armoured Formations.\n\n140. I mentioned in my first Despatch that\nmajor changes in the organization of tank\nbrigades were necessary and that—\n\n@) all regiments should be re-equipped\nwith medium tanks,\n\n(6) a troop of flame-throwers should be\nincluded in each squadron, and\n\n(©) an infantry battalion should be in-\ncluded in each brigade.\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief, India, has agreed\nto this re-organization and an_ infan\nbattalion has been provided for each brigade,\nbut we are still short of medium and flame-\nthrowing tanks.\n\nCommand Changes.\n\n141. There are two other important changes,\nthe policy in regard to which was decided while\nI was Commander-in-Chief, 11 Army Group,\nalthough it was not put into effect until after\nI had left. Since, however, I was closely\nassociated with this policy, I should, I consider,\nmention these two changes in this Despatch.\nThe first was the appointment of an Allied\nLand Commander-in-Chief. The sécond was\nthe transfer of Headquarters, Allied Land\nForces to the vicinity of Calcutta.\n\n142. As long as General Stilwell operated\nunder the command of General Slim no diffi-\nculties regarding command arose. When, how-\never, General Stilwell came under the direct\ncommand of the Supreme Allied Commander,\nthere was a duplicate chain of command as\nGeneral Slim operated under my orders and\nGeneral Stilwell under the Supreme Allied\n",

I pointed out the grave disad-\nvantages of such a system and urged the\nSupreme Allied Commander to arrange for the\nappointment of a commander of the Allied\nLand Forces. He eventually agreed to my\nrecommendation and put forward his proposals\nto the Chiefs of Staff in September.*\n\n143. It had originally been intended that the\nheadquarters of 11 Army Group which, under\nthe new organization was to become H.Q.,\nAllied Land Forces, should go to Kandy. I\npointed out in my first Despatch the grave dis-\nadvantages of placing this headquarters at a\nplace so far distant from the area of operations\nto which both signal and other communications\nwere so bad.j 1 continued therefore, to press\nduring the summer for the move of H.Q. 11\nArmy Group, to the neighbourhood of Cal-\ncutta. The Supreme Allied Commander\nfinally approved this proposal and arrange-\nments were made to move my Headquarters\nto Barrackpore. The Commainder-in-Chief,\nIndia, with that readiness to help which always\ndistinguishes him, moved H.Q., Eastern Com-\nmand, to provide my staff with the necessary\naccommodation and offices.\n\n144. The need for the closest co-operation\nbetween the Army and the Air Forces at all\nlevels of command had led the Supreme Allied\nCommander to set up a committee to examine\nand report upon the best method of improving\nco-operation.\n\nIts principal recommendation was that army\nand air headquarters should be alongside each\nother at all levels down to and including com-\nposite group level. I strongly supported this\nproposal, which involved the following. re-\norganization of air commands :—\n\n(@ Eastern Air Command absorbed Third\nTactical Air Force and was to work in con-\njunction with Advance Headquarters, Alli\nLand Forces.\n\n(6) 221 Group became a Composite Group\nfor co-operation with Fourteenth Army.\n\n(©) 224 Group was to provide support for\n15 Indian Corps in the Arakan.\n\n(@ 10 US.A.AF. was to continue to\noperaté with Northern Combat Area Com-\nmand.\n\nIn each case, the army\nquarters were to be located together.

The general\nposition has, except that of certain highly\ntechnical trades, however, improved since the\nsituation described in my first Despatch.\n\n* War O, tnote: Additional particulars regard-\ning ee ee tion of the command of the Allied\nLand Forces in South-East Asia are set out in the\nSupreme Allied Commander’s Report, South-East Asia,\n1943-45, at Part A., para. 43; Part B., paras. 17¢-172;\n226-227; 231 and 268-269.\n\n+ War Office footnote: The views of the Supreme\nAllied Commander and his reasons for the move to\nCeyion are set out in Part A., paragtaphs 12-14 of his\nReport, South-East Asia, 1943-45.\n\nand air head-°\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 1951\n\nShortages, although a very severe handicap,\nhave not made it necessary to withdraw units\nbut it has been necessary to send some British\ninfantry drafts to reinforcement camps with-\nout previous jungle training in order to main-\nmain battalions at minimum fighting strength.\nThis does not mean that drafts are, sent for-\nward wholly untrained since they are given\nsome training by the camp training staffs.\n\n146. Releases. As a result of the announce-\nment of the scheme for the “Re-allocation of\nBritish Manpower” on the cessation of hostili-\nties in Europe, instructions were issued to\nunits early in November, together with pro-\nvisional Class A release rolls. Personnel fell\ninto three categories :-— :\n\n(a) Surplus to manpower requirements.\n\n(b) Those called out for vital post-war\nreconstruction.\n\n{c) Compassionate cases.\n\n147, Repatriation. The reduction, in Sep-\ntember, of the period of overseas service to\n3 years and 8 months caused widespread satis-\nfaction. The numbers affected, however, were\nlarge and their despatch had to be spread over\nthe following four months, except in the case\nof the officers and men of the Royal Corps of\nSignals. The repatriation of Signal personnel\nhad unfortunately to be delayed and spread\nover the period January to March 1945, whilst\nofficers had to wait longer and were to be sent\nhome .between February and April as the\nteplacements had to arrive before repatriates\nleft their units.\n\n148. Leave. (a) The opening, in August, of\nthe Indian Army leave scheme for officers filled\na long felt want. All British officers and British\nother ranks who had completed 5 years’ ser-\nvice abroad were eligible, but the number was\nso large that leave could only be granted to\nthose with 8 years’ overseas service. Even so,\nit is likely that it will take over 12 moriths to -\nsend these officers home, owing to the limited\nnumber of passages.\n\n(6) A special war leave programme was\narranged between July and October. This\nenabled Indian other ranks, whose leave was\noverdue, to go to their homes.\n\nMedical.\n\n149. Evacuation of Casualties. While\nImphal was still surrounded, all casualties\nhad to be flown to the base hospitals\nas described in my ffirst Despatch, I\nhad always pressed for the movement of sick\nand wounded to hospital by air, but until\noperations in Arakan and Imphal this year\nthere had never been enough aircraft. Their\nincreasing use on this important duty reduced\nthe number of men who had to travel by the\nold types of transport. As we advanced down\nthe Tiddim and Tamu roads, airstrips were\nconstructed for use by light aircraft in the first\nplace, and, later, by cargo aircraft as the strips\nwere enlarged and their surfaces improved.\nCasualties were sent to a central air mainten-\nance area in Imphal and thence by returning\nsupply aircraft to the base hospitals. All\ncasualties from the Tiddim road were flown\nback. From Tamu, sick and wounded\ntravelled both by air and road.\n\nOn the Arakan front, the movement of\ncasualties by air was limited almost entirely\nto those of 81 (West African) Division in the\nKaladan Valley, since water transport was\navailable for other formations.\n",

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT To tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 1951\n\nOur casualties from North Burma (36 British\nDivision) were also flown back, at first by light\naircraft and later by returning heavy transport\nplanes, to our forward base hospitals in the\nLedo area.\n\n150. The organization needed when large\nnumbers of casualties are moved by air was\nbeing studied during the past six months. A\nstart was made to reduce the wasteful\n“ribbon” distribution of hospitals, which had\nhitherto had to be maintained along the L.\nef C. solely for transit purposes, and to con-\ncentrate beds in large hospital centres. This\npolicy, as it develops, will allow a much larger\nnumber of cases to be retained in the Four-\nteenth Army area until they are fit to return\nto their units, and thereby avoid the many\ndrawbacks in their evacuation to base hospitals\nin India.\n\n151..The following is a summary in round\nfigures of casualties moved between the 25th\nJune and the 12th November :—\n\nWithin Ex-\nFourteenth Fourteenth\n\nArmy Army TOTAL\nBy Road 26,300 _ 26,300\nBy Rail ... w. 22,300 _— 22,300,\nBy Air .-. 29,800 3,000 32,800\nBy Sea ... 9,500 15,100 24,600\nBy River 3,900 12,800 16,700\n\n91,800 30,900 122,700\n\nNote.—All casualties are sent by river to the\nrailheads of the India Command. :\n\n152. Incidence of Disease. The period\nJune to November has witnessed a steady\nfall in the sick rate. The daily rate per\n\n1729\n\nthousand of 4.2, at the peak period in\nJune, compares favourably with the peak\nfigure of 6.0 in 1943. In November, the in-\ncidence was only 3.0 compared wita 5.0 per\nthousand in the same month last year. This\nreduction was mainly due to the fall in the\nmalaria rate, which is due to a steady im-\nprovement in malaria discipline.\n\n153, D.D.T. had not been used on a scale\nadequate to show its capabilities, but experi-\nments were being made. ,\n\n154, Apart from malaria, there were two\nother somewhat serious outbreaks of disease ;\ndysentery, which reached its peak in June\nand July, and scrub typhus, which caused\nmuch sickness between August and October.\nThe dysentery died down in October, but em-\nphasised once more the necessity for maintain-\ning a high standard of sanitation. Effective\npreventive measures against scrub typhus have\nbeen discovered by the medical officer who\nwas lent to South-East Asia Command by the\nColonial Office and attached to my head-\nquarters.\n\n155. Since my first Despatch, the consulting\nphysician, surgeon, malariologist and psychia-\ntrist have arrived at, this Headquarters and\ntheir advice has proved most valuable.\n\n156. Casualties. The following table gives\na summary of our battle casualties from the\n1st July to the 1st November and, for compari-\nson,:a statement showing the Japanese\ncasualties during the same period. The\nnumbers of enemy killed are those whose\nbodies were actually counted and they do not\ninclude the casualties inflicted by our air\naction:\n\nCASUALTIES IsT JuLY, 1944 To IsT NOVEMBER, 1944,\n\nFourteenth Army fronts.\nBritish\nJapanese\nNorthern Combat Area Command\nBritish*\nJapaneset\n\nKilled Wounded Missing\n“583 2,001 110\n8,859 _— 234\nprisoner\n513 1,389 47\n3,724 _ 246\nprisoners\n\n* Special Force and 36 British Division. .\nt Figures include casualties inflicted by American and Chinese forces.\n\nThe Japanese losses in killed alone exceeded\nour total losses in killed, wounded and missing.\n\nWelfare and Morale.\n\n157. British Troops. The morale of the\ntroops has reached a high level, for they have\nshown their superiority over the Japanese.\n\nThe main interest of the British troops is\ncentred in repatriation. Service in a distant\nEastern Theatre is unpopular and the British\nsoldier looks forward to going Home. The\nhandling of this important question by the\nGovernment appeared in the eyes of the men\nunsympathetic, but the reduction in the period\nof service overseas has convinced the men of\nthe sincerity of the Government. .\n\nThe grant of Japanese Campaign Pay and\nWar Service Increment and the White Paper\non Release were generally welcomed.\n\n158. “Mail” and “Rations” improved\ngreatly ; the film situation also improved and\nadditional Kinema Sections were allotted to\n\nSouth-East Asia Command. “ Live Entertain-\nment” remained inadequate, for there were\ntoo few E.N.S.A. shows and Indian Concert\nParties. Radio entertainment was increased to\nthirty hours per week. The newspaper\n“S.E.A.C.” grew in popularity, its circulation\nby November having reached some 30,000\ncopies daily. Travelling facilities for men going\non leave continued, however, to be bad, in spite\nof strenuous efforts that were made to improve\nthem. Shortage of railway equipment and\nrolling stock caused many of the difficulties.\n\n159. I wish to mention three institutions m\nImphal which did much to alleviate conditions\nin the forward area: —\n\n(a) An Officers’ Club was opened, the\npopularity of which proved that it filled a\nlong felt want.\n\n(6) Toc H Canteen, known as “The\nElephant Arms”, had an average nightly\nattendance of 1,000 British soldiers. The\nattached leave hostel was also popular.\n",

J\nwish to pay tribute to the Reverend Walter\nCorbett and his wife for the devoted service\nthey rendered to the troops.\n\n@ I also wish to mention the splendid\nwork of the Women’s Auxiliary Service\n(Burma). This Service operated mobile and\nstatic canteens in the forward areas and on\nmany occasions worked right up with the\nleading formations. The value to morale\nof a women’s service operating canteens in\nthe interests of the troops in forward areas\nand under monsoon conditions was in-\nestimable.\n\n160. Indian Troops. The discipline and\nfighting spirit of Indian troops has been\nthroughout of the highest quality.\n\nThe re-opening of leave on a large scale, and\nthe improvement in economic conditions in\nthe villages, did much to relieve the Indian\nsoldier's mind, but there are still complaints\nof the irregularities of the postal services, the\nfailings of the family allotment system and\ngraft and exploitation by petty local officials.\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief, India, has taken\nall possible steps to put these matters right.\n\n161. African Troops. The morale of both\nEast and West African troops has been satis-\nfactory. They require more training. i\nto the shortage of formations, they had to be\ncommitted to action before they were entirely\nready for war.\n\nSupplies, Transport and Maintenance.\n\n162. Movements and Transportation. A full\ndescription of the lines of communication was\ngiven in my first Despatch. The main tasks\nof the Movements and Transportation Direc-\ntorates during the period of this Despatch\nwere: —\n\n(@) The maintenance of Fourteenth Army\nin Assam and\n(6) The building up of stocks on both the\n\nImphal and Arakan fronts for the post-\n\nmonsoon offensive.\n\n(c} The movement of formations under\nthe relief programme.\n\n163. Tonnages Handled. (a) Assam Line\nof Communication. The average monthly\ntonnage of stores for Fourteenth Army,\nexcluding P.O.L., carried between June and\nNovember was 31,200, an increase of some\n3,000 tons over the monthly average for\nthe previous six months. This increase was\ncreditable in view of the difficulties caused by\nthe monsoon. The completion in August of\nthe American 6-inch pipeline from Calcutta to\nDibrugarh has released wagons needed\nformerly for aviation spirit. I hope that the\nAssam line of communication will now be able\nto carry all the traffic, and that the tonnage\nwhich can be handled in railheads and depots\nwill be the limiting factor, rather than the\ncapacity of the river, rail and road systems of\nthe lines of communication.\n\n(8) Chittagong Port.\n\nThe average monthly import of stores, ex-\ncluding bulk P.O.L., was 51,000 tons. This\nfigure is lower by 10,000 tons than the\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 3951\n\naverage of the previous three months, and is.\nexplained by the smaller number of ships using.\nthe port. On the other hand, the average.\ntonnage discharged per ship per day increased.\n(c) Arakan Ports.\n\nThe average monthly imports into Cox’s.\nBazaar, Ultaklali and Maungdaw totalled\n23,600 tons, which was an increase of 4,500:\ntons over the average of the previous three.\nmonths. This increase in tonnage, m spite of\nthe difficulties of working in the monsoon at.\nthese small ports, is noteworthy.\n\n164. Opening of Maungdaw Port. A new\nchannel into the mouth of the Naf River was.\ndiscovered, and it was found possible to bring.\nocean-going ships for the first time to\nMaungdaw. This saved much overland trans-\nport.\n\n165. Monsoon Reliefs. The following is a\nsummary of the major moves completed, or in\nprocess during the monsoon:—\n\n(a) Divisions.\n\n{i) One division from Assam to India.\n(i) One division from Ceylon to Assam.\n(iii) One division from India to Assam.\n(iv) One division from India to Arakan.\n\n(b) Brigades.\n\nG) Six brigades from Assam to India.\nGi) One brigade from Arakan to India.\nGii) One brigade from India to Assam.\n(iv) Two brigades from India to Arakan.\n(v) One brigade from Ceylon to Assam.\n(vi) One brigade from Ceylon to Arakan.\n\nThe details of these moves are given in\nAppendix “A”, as the times and methods are\ninteresting and instructive.\n\n166. An interesting experiment in transpor-\ntation was the use made of “jeep trains” by\n36 British Division in their advance down the\nrailway.\n\nThis new method of haulage was first tried\nin July on the Myitkyina -Mogaung section of\nthe line, as no locomotives were available. It\nwas found that a jeep, fitted with flanged\nwheels, could draw some 40 tons of freight\nand “jeep trains” have since formed part of\nthe transportation organization in that area.\n\n167. Air Supply. When discussing “ Organi-\nzation” in my first Despatch, I stated the\nneed for a permanent organization to handle\nthe movement by air of troops and supplies,\nand I mentioned that my proposals were,\nat that time, being considered by the\nAir Commander-in-Chief, South-East Asia\nCommand, and the Commander-in-Chief,\nIndia. The last six months has seen the\nbirth of the Army Air Transport Organi-\nzation, with headquarters at Comilla along-\nside the recently formed Headquarters, Combat\nCargo Task Force. These two Head-\nquarters, the one Military and the other\nRAF, and US.A.AF., worked as a whole,\nthe Army staff being under command of 11\nArmy Group and the Air staff under Eastern\nAir Command. The main duties of the Com-\nmander of this new organization were :—\n\n(a) To control ail the Rear Airfield Main-\ntenance Organizations in South-East Asia\nCommand.\n\n(6) To ensure that the requirements of\nforward formations for air supply or air\n",

Rear Airfield Maintenance Units were\nformed and the existing Air Supply Companies,\nrenamed Air Despatch Companies, were re-\norganized to handle daily, 80 tons of stores for\nair dropping. The duties of these companies\nincluded the collection of stores from the\nnearest depot, packing, loading and the provi-\nsion of crews for dropping stores. Each Rear\nAirfield Maintenance Organization also in-\ncluded an Air Despatch and Reception Unit\nwhich was a combined passenger and freight\nsection to control the loading of aircraft and\nto exercise general flying control on the\nairstrip.\n\n169. I emphasised in my first Despatch the\nvital part played by air supply in Arakan and\nat Imphal during the first half of the year.\nAs it was obvious that the success of our future\noperations would be equally, if not more, de-\npendent on air transport, I was determined\nthat the system of control which I have briefly\noutlined should be introduced as soon as pos-\nsible. In spite of the shortage of manpower\nand other difficulties, it was introduced on the\n18th October. As our operations expand\nchanges may become necessary, but the organi-\nzation is sufficiently flexible to allow this.\n\n170. The extent to which formations were\nsupplied by air is best illustrated by the.total\nmonthly tonnages dropped or, when airstrips\n\nwere available, landed. In June, the figure was’\n\n5,854 tons ; this fell to 4,019 tons in August,\nwhen only two divisions were operating on the\nChindwin front and only two brigades of\nSpecial Force were in North Burma; it then\nrose steadily, and by November, when 81\n(West African) Division in the Kaladan Valley,\ncertain brigades of 33 and 4 Corps on the\nChindwin, and 36 British Division in North\nBurma were being supplied by air, reached\n10,573 tons.\n\nThe airfields upon which transport aircraft\nwere based were:—\n\nAirfield. Formations Served.\nDinjan Fort Hertz.\nMoran 36 British Division.\nSylhet ... Special Force, 4 and 33 Corps.\nAgartala... Lushai Brigade, 4 and 33 Corps\nComilla ... 81 (West African) Division.\n\nChittagong Corps Troops, 4 Corps.\n\n171. P.O.L. In the early part of the year\nthe supply of petrol and lubricants had been\ndifficult, but by decreasing consumption and by\nincreasing our bulk storage and methods of\ndistribution this had improved.\n\nImperial requirements increased during the\nlast six months from 11} million gallons to\nnearly 144 million per month, but decreased\nconsumption during the monsoon enabled us\nnot only to meet the increase, but to build\nup our reserve stocks to 30 million gallons\nby the Ist November. To make this possible\nwe had to:— .\n\n(a) Increase the storage of P.O.L. in bulk\n\nat Chittagong port from 11 million to 20\n\nmillion gallons.\n\n(64487)\n\n1731\n\n(4) Increase the capacity of tanks at air-\nfields and army depots by 33 million\ngallons.\n\n(c) Increase the capacity of our rail cars\nby 485,000 gallons.\n\n(d) Greatly extend our pipelines.\n\n172. Situation as regards Rations. The\nsupply of fresh meat for Indian troops is\nstill difficult. In October, the supply of\nsheep and goats only permitted the issue\nof meat on three days with another half day\nin Assam and on two days in Arakan during’\nthe month. There is little hope of improve-\nment, but I hope to compensate for the loss\nof protein in the ration by issuing dehydrated\n\nsh.\n\nThe production of dehydrated goat meat\nhas improved, but is still insufficient. The\nCommander-in-Chief, India has been asked to\nincrease production and to arrange to import\ndehydrated meat, if the religious objections of\nHindus and Mohammedans can be satis-\nfactorily met.\n\nDuring October, there were larger stocks of\nfrozen meat in India and frozen meat was\nflown in to British and African troops of\nFourteenth Army. Cold storage plants in for-\nward areas are being built.\n\n_173. A new Field Service scale of rations\nfor Indian troops was introduced on the Ist\nNovember. The new scale is not only more\nlavish than the old, but it is designed to give\na higher calorific value to meet arduous con-\nditions in this Theatre.\n\n174. Various projects to increase local\nsupplies of fresh food to reduce the tonnage on\nthe lines of communication are being de-\nveloped. In spite of the shortage of labour\nand agricultural equipment, much progress has\nbeen made .and I expect that we shall produce\nvegetables, livestock and salted fish in suffi-\ncient quantities for our needs in 1945.\n\nMaintenance.\n\n_ 175. @ The supply of vehicles, particularly\njeeps and load carriers, is unsatisfactory. Fight-\ning units are not yet fully equipped and only\nby strict economy and careful control of issues\nis it possible to maintain formations engaged\nin operations, Administrative units in rear\nareas inevitably go short, with a consequent\nloss in efficiency.\n\n(6) The design and provision of equipment\nwhich can be carried by air has been thoroughly\nexamined. R.E.M.E. are making machine\ntrailers which can be carried by air for their\nworkshops in forward areas. These are im-\nprovised from existing equipment until those\ndesigned in the U.K. arrive. The Wireless\nTesting Trailer is reported as being up to the\nstandard of the Home pattern. The selection\nand preliminary trials of vehicles, other than\nthese, for air transport are made by the staff\nof G.H.Q., India, to specifications supplied by\nmy staff.\n\n(c) I have set up a committee to examine\nand if possible reduce the number of modifica-\ntions which are demanded in equipment.\n\nThe Engineering Effort. A. Road Com-\n\nmunications. .\n\n176. The Arakan Road. At the begin-\nning of July the policy in Arakan was\nto provide a new single-way brick road along-\nside the existing one-way road, the latter to\n\n(4\n",

In view\nof the probable future operations, this was\neventually not done.\n_ Between July and November, therefore, no\nmajor road work was done in Arakan other\nthan the widening of the coast road, and the\nbulk of the engineers were employed in main-\ntenance. 22,000 local labourers, excluding\nmilitary supervisors, were employed.\n\n177. Imphal Front. Before the Japanese\noffensive in March caused a stoppage of\nwork, the following all weather two-way roads\nwere being built :—\n\nImphal - Tiddim.\nPalel - Tamu.\nTamu — Witok — ‘Mau.\n\n178. Imphal—Tiddim (164 miles). It was\noriginally intended to improve this road to\nan all-weather standard and as we advanced\nmuch work was done on it.\n\nBy September, half the distance had been\nfinished, but the difficulties in maintaining an\nall-weather standard were out of proportion to\nthe value of the road. I, therefore, decided\nto concentrate all road building resources in\nlabour and material on the Tamu - Witok -\nKalewa route to the Chindwin; though some\nhad to be left to maintain the Tiddim road at\na standard adequate to support the force on\nthat line.\n\n179. Palel- Tamu (43 miles). As soon as\noperations permitted, the construction of this\nroad to a two-way, all-weather Class 30\nstandard was restarted and it was hoped to\nfinish it by the end of the year. This was\n. later altered to Class 70 to permit of the\npassage of loaded tank-transporters, and the.\ndate of completion was extended to April\n1945. By November 1944, satisfactory pro-\ngress had been made, 2,500 military and 2,000\nlocal labour being employed.\n\n180.

The Bongaigaon— Amingaon railway\nhas been cut during the monsoon every year\nexcept one during the past thirty-two years,\nand communications in Assam have been\ninterrupted for many months on each occasion.\n\nTo provide an alternative route for traffic\nit was decided to improve to two-way, all-\nweather standard the road from Bongaigaon to\nJogighopa (21 miles) on the north bank of\nthe Brahmaputra River and from Goalpara on\nthe south bank to Pandu (93 miles).\n\nThese roads, which were virtually finished\nby November, should provide a good alterna-\ntive route if the railway should be breached in\nfuture. .\n\nSUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON: GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 1951\n\n182.

Airfields.\n\n183. Few new airfields have been built, but\nthe demands for the expansion of existing\nairfields,. and their conversion for use by\nheavier types of aircraft, strained my engineer\nresources to the utmost, in spite of the arrival\nof new mechanical equipment.\n\nThe principal changes have been:—\n\nCox's Bazaar. Enlarged to accommodate\nan additional heavy bomber squadron and\na fighter squadron.\n\nChittagong. Enlarged to take two heavy\nbomber squadrons, a U.S.A.A.F. Lightning\nsquadron, a R.A.F, Wing and an Air Staging\nPost.\n\nHathazari. Some twenty miles north of\nChittagong. Constructed for one transport\nsquadron.\n\nFenny. Doubled in size to accept four\nU.S.A.A.F, Medium Bomber squadrons and\none long-range Fighter squadron.\n\nShamshernagar. Fifty miles south of\n\n. Syhlhet, previously known as Tilagaon.\n\nCompletely re-designed from a bomber base\n\nto an Air Transport and Air Service Centre.\n\nThe U.S.A.A.F. lent me an airborne avia-\n\ntion engineer company and a group of\n\nengineers to help in building this airfield.\n\nTheir assistance was valuable and the co-\n\noperation between the American, British\n\nand Indian engineer units engaged, exem-\nplary. I have mentioned this project in\nsome detail because, not only is it the largest\n- airfield in India, but it was the model of\nthe new airfields which we subsequently\n\nSylhet, was expanded for the U.S.A.A.F.\nfrom a two squadron Heavy Bomber to a\nfour squadron Transport field.\n\nTulihal, near Imphal, has been enlarged\nfrom a fair-weather Fighter to an all-weather\nfour squadron Transport field. Constructed\nentirely with “‘ Bithess””, it is now regarded\nas the best airfield in the Fourteenth Army\narea.\n\nI have referred only to major construction in\nthe rear areas. There was, of course, much\nother less important work, and work on main-\ntenance during the monsoon was heavy.\n\n184. The construction of forward airfields\ncontinued in co-operation with Headquarters,\nThird Tactical Air Force. An important fact\nwhich saved much work was our ascendancy in\nthe air. Dispersal areas were no longer needed\nand this reduced the mileage of taxi tracks\nand roads, labour. and material.\n\n185. Airfields in North-East Assam.

Although no new airfields were\nmade, the size of the task can be measured\nfrom the following figures which shows the\nmajor works finished by mid-November at the\neleven main airfields in Assam :—\nRunways and taxi tracks, 38 miles.\nNumber of aircraft standings, 506.\nAircraft parking aprons, 60 acres.\nRoads, 111 miles.\nAccommodation, for 33,000 officers and\nmen.\nCovered storage, 67 acres.\n\n186. It will be remembered that I am writing\nof the monsoon and of an area where the\nrainfall is the heaviest in the world. The\namount of new construction, involving the\nclearance of thick jungle, and of maintenance\nunder severe climatic conditions, both in\nAssam and Arakan, reflects the greatest credit\non our airfield engineers.\n\n187. Airfields in Ceylon. The improvement\nand extension of the nine main airfields on\nthe Island continued.\n\nAs a matter of convenience, it was decided\nthat, from August, the Engineer-in-Chief,\nSouth-East Asia Command, who is at Kandy,\nshould relieve my Chief Engineer of the techni-\ncal responsibility for the works in Ceylon,\nthe latter’s duties being henceforth limited to\nstores and personnel. The responsibilities of\nthe Chief Engineer, Ceylon Army Command,\nand of the Air Ministry Works Department,\nwere unaffected by this change.\n\n188. Airfields in North Burma. As I have\nmentioned the operations under General\nStilwell, this section of my Despatch\nwould be incomplete without reference\nto the airfield construction undertaken by the\nUnited States Army Air Engineers in North\nBurma.\n\nAs General Stilwell’s forces ‘advanced his\nengineers built three airfields in the Hukawng\nValley. On the afternoon of the capture of\nMyitkyina airfield, 10 U.S.A.A.F., on whom\nrested the responsibility of building forward\nairfields, landed by glider the first company\nof a battalion of airborne aviation engineers.\nThe rest of the battalion followed in transport\naircraft within a week. The airfield was in\nfull use two days after its capture and has\nsince been completely reconstructed ‘and\ngreatly expanded.\n\nThe concentration of aircraft on Myitkyina\nairfield was very heavy, nearly 2,000 landings\nand take-offs being made daily by heavy trans-\nport aircraft. More airfields in this area were\nclearly necessary and three more Engineer\nAviation battalions were flown in with their\nfull equipment. By November, three all-\nweather Transport airfields had been built and\ntwo others were nearly finished.\n\nThe movement and supply of the engineers\nat work on these airfields was airborne\nthroughout, as no suitable communications\nexisted overland. To construct five large air-\nfields under monsoon conditions was _a note-\nworthy feat. of engineering work. To have\ndone it as an airborne operation was out-\nstanding:\n\nThe Engineering Effort. C. Oil Pipelines.\n189. The 4-inch pipeline joining Chittagong\nand Chandranathpur, mentioned in my first\n\n1733\n\nDespatch, was finished as far as Comilla by\nNovember. Construction of the final link\nbetween Comilla and Chandranathpur was in\nprogress, This will give an unbroken line\nfrom Chittagong to Manipur Road. The ex-\ntension of this line to Imphal was begun at the\nend of September.\n\n190. The American so-called “ Infinity\nLine” from Calcutta to Kunming reached\nMyitkyina in October. From Ledo there are\ntwo 4-inch lines for aviation and motor spirit\nrespectively.\n\nThe construction of the second American\n6-inch pipeline from Chittagong to Tinsukia,\nforecast in my first Despatch, was also started.\nThis line will follow the British 4-inch line\nand the operation of both will be under one\ncontrol and for the mutual benefit of ourselves\nand our Allies.\n\n191. The elaborate, pipeline system in the\nNorth-East Assam airfields area was handed\nover to the Americans at the end of July. ,\n\nCivil Affairs Burma.\n\n192. On the 23rd June, the British Military\nAdministration in Burma had under its con-\ntrol the Fort Hertz and Sumprabum areas,\nthe {he Hukawng Valley, the western fringe of the\n\nChin Hills District and the northern fringe of\nthe Arakan Division.\n, On the 12th November, the area included\nthe whole of the Myitkyina District, the\nnorthern part of the Bhamo and, Katha area\nof the Upper Chindwin District and all but the\nsouthern area of the Chin Hills District. The\narea under administration in Atakan remained\nunchanged.\n\n193. The principal centre of activity in Civil\nAffairs was the Myitkyina District, where the\nadvance of the forces of Northern Combat\nArea Command brought important new tracts\nunder British control. The main tasks were\nthe restoration of law and order, the care\nof refugees, the feeding and clothing of desti-\ntutes, the organization of medical services, the\nprovision of labour for the Armed Forces and,\nlast but not least, the restoration of confidence\namong the local inhabitants. Althouch a great\ndeal was done. the British Military Administra-\ntion was handicapped by the restriction on the\nnumber of Civil Affairs officers allowed to\nwork in the area. The civil population\nsuffered in consequence: had more staff been\nallowed, action to relieve hardship could have\nbeen faken more rapidly and effectively.\n\n“194. The chief problem in. the Hukawng\nValley was the shortage of food, and relief\ncamos had to he organised on a large scale.\nSeed and agricultural tools were imnorted, but\nimmediate relief was given by develoning the\nIncal salt production to the maximum, and\nthus setting free much air transport for other\nsupplies.\n\n‘195. During the earlier part of our re-occu:\npation of North Burma, the British Military\nAdministration was handicapned by - the\nMovement southwards of large sections of the\nShan and Burmese inhabitants. This was due\nin nart to Jananese pronacanda and in part\nto the fear of Chinese troops and the Kachir\nLevies. Thev gradually returned as confidence\nwas restored. but, in the interval. there was\na, shortage of potential subordinate: officials,\n",

Nevertheless,\na police force was organized, order restored,\ncrops sown, and “collaborators” brought to\ntrial\n\n196. In the Kabaw Valley and the Naga and\nChin Hills, .the work of the Military Admin-\nistration was largely confined to the organiza-\ntion of Intelligence, the provision of labour,\nand general liaison betwen the Army and the\nlocal population.\n\nIn Arakan, the British Military Administra-\ntion continued to administer the northern\narea.\n\n197. The Civil Affairs Service depots for re-\nfief supplies and stores were at Chittagong\nfor Arakan, at Manipur Road and Imphal for\nthe Chin and Naga Hills and Upper Chindwin,\nand at Ledo and Moran (seventy miles south-\nwest of Ledo) for the Northern Combat Area\nCommand area. The difficulty, of course, lay\nin moving these supplies forward to distribution\ncentres ; and Army air and road transport had\nto be borrowed, until such time as Civil Affairs\nService transport companies could be formed.\n\n198. In spite of the shortage of transport, the\npaucity of communications and bad weather,\nthe whole of the relief supplies for the popula-\ntion of the re-occupied areas were successfully\ndistributed, including some 6,000 tons of rice,\n1,500 tons of salt, and large quantities of milk,\ncloth, etc.\n\nThe chiefs, headmen and local inhabitants of\nthe areas released from Japanese occupation\nwere found for the most part to have behaved\nloyally during our absence and, with a few\nexcentions, our return was greeted with satis-\n‘action.\n\nMain Administrative Lessons.\n\n199. Air Supply. The need of foresight, of\nstandardising drops, of giving the Air Supply\nDepots ample warning of any change of plan.\nand of economising resources, were all of\nparamount importance. As operations went\non, formations became more skilful in choos-\ning dropping zones, and pilots more efficient\nat dropping on them. The necessity for\nalternative dropping zones was clearly brought\n\nout. Finally, the importance’ of salvaging all\nparachute material and containers was\nemphasised.\n\n200. To meet the uncertainties of supply-\ndropping in the monsoon, orders were given\nthat, as soon as there was a failure to drop\nsupplies, all ranks and mules were to be put\non half rations until dropping could be re-\nsumed. All troops carried three days’ reserves\nand they could therefore carry on for six days:\nin: addition they had their emergency rations.\nThese precautionary measures turned out to be\nwise. It so happened that the maximum num-\n\nber of days on which supply-dropping was:\n\nimpossible consecutively was five, but on one\noccasion the margin was narrow. In a final\nattempt on the sixth day, the aircraft found\nonly one gap in the cloud over the whole area.\nUnder this gap was the dropping zone.\n\n201. Vehicles. The value of the 30 cwt.\n6 x 6 vehicles has been shown. It had the\néross-country performance of a jeep, except on\nnarrow tracks, and nearly the capacity of a\n3-tonner.\n\nAs regards specialist vehicles, experience\nhas shown that they should either all be 4 x 4\nor that their equipment should be capable of\n\n‘SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 1951\n\nbeing fitted on to a standard chassis. The\nlatter is preferable as, should the specialist\nvehicle be damaged, its equipment can be\nquickly transferred\n\nThe highest standards of maintenance and\ntraffic discipline are essential to maintain effi-\nciency under the conditions I have described.\n\n202. Salvage. Owing to the length and com-\nplexity of the lines of communication, it was\nfound unprofitable to send back many types of\nsalvage. Instead, workshops were set up\nwhich manufactured from this salvage a large\nassortment of articles, and thereby saved\ntransport.\n\n203. Welfare. Good administration in units\nin the provision of food, recreation, etc., was\nvitally important in the monsoon for the quick\nrestoration of morale after battle. Cinemas are\npossibly better than E.N.S.A. parties in this\nTheatre and I hope that before long each\nbrigade will have its own. Corps “ Welfare\nShops ” proved very popular.\n\nUnder monsoon conditions, arrangements for\nthe periodical withdrawal of troops from the\nline in order to have hot baths and a change\nof clothing aré essential and have a high moral\nvalue.\n\n204. Conclusion. The administrative\nmachine stood up well to the strain of fighting a\nwar and administering a great expanse of terri-\ntory with inadequate resources and under diffi-\ncult conditions. Much improvisation has been\nnecessary and all Services have shown great\nresource and ingenuity in doing their many\nduties. Their success reflects the greatest credit\non all concerned.\n\nPart IV. CONCLUSION.\n\n205. “ This Army has by its aggressive opera-\ntions guarded the base of the American air\nline to China and protected India against the\nhorrors of Japanese invasion.” With these\nwords Mr. Churchill put in clear perspective\nthe vital part that Fourteenth Army has\nplayed during the last six months in the\nstruggle against Japan. The crushing of the\nJapanese offensive against Kohima and Imphal\nand our pursuit of his retreating columns to\nthe Chindwin were, of course, one battle. We\nhave inflicted upon the enemy a major defeat.\nIt is the first time the Japanese have been\ndriven back so far—and they will go further.\nThe facts speak for themselves and they will\ngive encouragement and assurance to those who\nfought against a ruthless and cunning enemy,\nagainst disease and in rain and heat through\nthe jungles and mountains of Assam and\nBurma, to inflict the first great land defeat on\nJapan.\n\nI have quoted the words of the Prime\nMinister. I also quote a few sentences from\nan address delivered by His Excellency the\nViceroy, Field-Marshal Lord Wavell, when\nhe visited the troops during the course of the\ncampaign: “You will find that, when the\nhistory of the war comes to be written, the\nrecent fighting will be put down as one of the\nturning points of the war, when the Japanese\nwere routed and their downfall really began.\nNot only have you inflicted a tremendous defeat\non the enemy but, even more, you have dealt\na damaging blow to their morale—and it is\nthe breaking of the wom morale that\nfinishes wars in the en\n",

This Despatch brings to an end the\naccount of my command of 11 Army Group,\nand I cannot finish it without paying tribute\nto the magnificent team of officers and men\nwho made up the forces under my command.\n\nThough it is outside the period covered by\nmy two Despatches I must refer briefly to the\nsix months in 1943 in which I commanded\nEastern Army out of which Fourteenth Army\nwas born. |\n\nIn those early days, deficiencies in equip-\nment ; shortage of trained reinforcements ; lack\nof welfare arrangements; long service over-\nseas ; inadequate leave due to lack of accom-\nmodation and transport; indifferent rations ;\nmuch sickness; slow mails; an apparent lack\nof interest at home in what was being done and\nendured on the Burma Front; and an exag-\ngerated opinion of the efficiency of the Japanese\nhad combined to lower the morale and destroy\nthe confidence of the Army.\n\nWithout confidence and high morale, equip-\nment and weapons, however good, are useless,\nand the re-creation of these two qualities was\nthe first task to which we all had to address\nourselves during the monsoon of 1943. Con-\nfidence could be created by training and im-\nproved equipment, morale by confidence and\ncare for the spiritual and physical well being\nof the troops.\n\nAll through that monsoon, the Commander-\nin-Chief, India, did all that was possible to\nimprove the training and, with his limited re-\nsources, the welfare of the troops.\n\nMuch was accomplished, and by October,\n1943—when direction of the operations was\nabout to pass to the Supreme Allied Com-\nmander; Fourteenth Army was about to be\nformed, and the weather moderated suffi-\n\nciently to allow us to move—the work done”\n\nduring the monsoon began to bear fruit. Opera-\ntions started, slowly at first, but with gathering\nmomentum as their first encounters with the\nenemy showed the troops that the Japanese\nsoldier, though tough and prepared to die\nrather than surrender, was not so skilful as\nthemselves nor so well equipped.\n\nThe Army must have contained almost more\ndiverse races than any other, even in this war,\nwhen so many nations have fought as Allies.\n\nThere were’ battalions from British county\nregiments distinguished in our history, and\nofficers and men from every county in\nEngland, Scotland, Ireland and Wales serving\nin other arms or with units of the Indian and\nAfrican forces.\n\nThe Indian units of which the bulk of Four-\nteenth Army was composed, came from many\nfamous regiments, recruited from races whose\nnames have been household words since first\nwe went to India: Rajputs, Dogras, Sikhs,\nJats, Mahommedans from the Punjab, Gurkhas,\n\n1735\n\nGarhwalis and Madrassis to mention but a few\nof those who volunteered to fight for the King\nEmperor.\n\nTo the Army were added later divisions from\nour West and East African Colonies, composed\nof Hausas, Yorubas and Ibos from Nigeria ;\nKanjarga, Dagartis and Ashantis from the Gold\nCoast ; Mendis and Timinis from Sierra Leone ;\nMandingos from Gambia; Nyasas and Yaos\nfrom Nyasaland ; Manyamwezi and Manyema\nfrom Tanganyika; Akamba, Nandi and\nKavirondo from Kenya ; Baganda and Achole\nfrom Uganda; Somalis from Somaliland ;\nAwemba and Angoni from Northern Rhodesia\nand many others too numerous to mention.\nAll these men had volunteered to fight for\nthe King.\n\nThe success of Fourteenth Army is the\nbest testimonial to its officers and men and I\ncannot add anything to it. Victory was\nachieved by fine leading by all commanders\nfrom the highest to the most junior section\nleader ; by the skill of the men in the ranks ;\nby high courage in battle; by steady endur-\nance under conditions of climate and health\nworse than almost anywhere in the world; by\na determination to defeat the enemy, and by\nthat spirit, which alone enables an army to\nexert its maximum strength, of co-operation\namong all ranks and arms.\n\nIt has been an immense source of pride to\nme to watch the growth of confidence and\nskill which enabled the officers and men of\nFourteenth Army to inflict the first major\ndefeat upon the Japanese and by unrelenting\npursuit to drive them with crippling losses in\nmen and material in disorder across the\nChindwin.\n\n207. Once again I should like to thank\nGeneral Sir Claude Auchinleck* and the staff\nat his Headquarters for their generous and un-\nfailing help, without which 11 Army Group\ncould not have driven the Japanese back from\nthe frontiers of India. .\n\nI also wish to give a final word of thanks to\nmy own staff for their hard work and fine\nteam spirit, upon which I was able always\nconfidently to rely however acute the crisis or\nhard the work.\n\nI want especially to mention my two prin-\ncipal Staff Officers, Major-General I. S. O.\nPlayfair, M.G.G.S., and Major-General E. N.\nGoddard, M.G.A.. whose wise advice, good\njudgment and unfailing loyalty were a great\nsupport to me.\n\nFinally, I have no doubt that the defeat\nof the Japanese forces in Burma is due to the\nbalanced judgment, determination and skill of\nLieut.-General Sir William Slim, upon whom\nfell the burden of the fighting.\n\n* Now Field-Marshal Sir Claude J. E. Auchinleck,\nG.C.B., G.C.LE., C.S.I., D.S.O., O.B.E.\n\n",
