The A.T.S., particularly in the Mixed

  batteries, set a standard of bearing and conduct which in my opinion was not equalled by any other women's service.

The administrative services were not only efficient they were outstanding. Our sick rate was always small though we never had anything like our quota of doctors. .  

The R.A.O.C. performed herculean tasks with al] the new and complicated equipments.

The R.A.S.C. set a higher standard of driving than in any other Command. The Signals have



been mentioned more than once for they were superb and were the one pssential requis in all our schemes. .~  

R.E.M.E. produced an inventiveness, coupled with general engineering skill and enthusiasm, which gave us an answer to every . difficulty.

The Chaplains department wete the first to introduce the   Padre's Hour   into the Army. Much of the excellent discipline was due to them.

Finally, the Commanders and Staffs serving under me were worthy of the troops they led.
