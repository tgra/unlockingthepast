7. It was upon this point that the initial
planning of “Husky” broke down. It may
be that the earlier plans would have suc-
ceeded equally well ; but the fact remains that
these plans in the end proved unacceptable to
the army leaders called upon to fight the tac-
tical battle for the object, and that, had it been
possible for those leaders fully to study the
tactical aspect at the outset, the undesirable
last minute changes would have been saved.

8. A further point is that in the initial plan-
ning great weight was lent to the value of air-
borne troops for the softening of beach de-
fences. The conditions of light required for
the employment of paratroops were inimical
to the secure and undetected approach of naval
forces. As the result of much discussion and
in view of the importance attached to the air-
borne attack, the date selected for the assault
was one which was not favourable from the
naval point of view. In fact the airborne troops
were never used in the manner projected, but
that they were not to be so used did not
emerge until it was too late to change the
date. In consequence, the navies, for no
advantage, had to accept a disadvantageous
light for approach, and a subsequent period of
moonlit nights off the beaches which could
have been avoided.

9. The Naval Commander Western Task
Force comments at length and stringently on
this subject in his report.* While I do not in
all respects agree with his estimate of the effec-
tiveness of naval gunfire, I concur generally in
his remarks, and, in particular, in questioning
the wisdom of attaching a high degree of im-
portance in the plan to the employment of
airborne troops. A seaborne assault is unalter-
ably committed to a date for some days in
advance of D day. In tidal waters it is even
more inflexibly bound by time and tide. It may
well be that, on the selected date, airborne
troops are weatherbound and cannot operates
It does, therefore, appear most necessary that
airborne troops should be considered as a use-
ful auxiliary rather than as a governing fac-
tor which may react to the disadvantage of
other services involved.

10. Apart from the use of airborne troops,
many other factors affect the selection of D
day and H hourf: but a dominating factor
must always be the high casualty rate inflicted
by aimed machine-gun fire. Unless it can be
guaranteed to the army that the enemy beach
defences can be neutralised by naval
or air attack or both—or by smoke—it is felt
that darkness will always be chosen for the
first waves to reach the beach. “ Husky ” gave
but poor opportunity for judging the soundness
of our choice since surprise was unexpectedly
attained ; but it is felt that, had the enemy
been resolute and alert, it would have required
more than the gun support actually available
if the soldiers were to be landed in daylight
without heavy casualties. Bomber forces were
not available since they were occupied in
neutralising the enemy air forces.

Preparation, Training and Mounting.

11. The training and mounting of “ Husky ”
proceeded under difficulties, particularly in the
case of Force “ B ”* of the Eastern Task Force,
and to a lesser extent of the Western Task
Force. Both these forces had to establish their
base facilities in captured ports which had been
considerably demolished, namely Sfax and
Sousse for Force “B”, and Bizerta and Tunis
for the Western Task Force. Great credit is
due to all concerned that these difficulties were
ably surmounted in the time available. Force
“B”, in addition to other difficulties, was faced.
at short notice with the task of capturing
Pantellaria but the task was taken in its stride
and successfully accomplished without preju-
dice to “Husky”, of which operation indeed
it was an essential preliminary.

12. The reception and absorption in the
station of the great number of landing ships
and craft, and the establishment of their bases,
presented a heavy problem to both navies. The
probable performance of these craft, manned
as they were by new and inexperienced officers
and men but recently enrolled in their respec-
tive services, gave cause for some anxiety, and
in the early stages of training they caused some
slight wavering of confidence among the troops
they were to land. The manner in which they
buckled to and met and overcame their in-
experience can best be measured by what they
achieved, and deserves the highest praise.

13. Another cause of anxiety at this stage
was the large demand for movement of troops,.
airmen and vehicles to their staging points or
bases for the attack. This involved heavy and
continuous running by the landing craft at
times when they should have been training, and
fear was felt, not only that their training would
be inadequate, but that their engines would
not stand the strain. These fears were happily
disproved, and in fact the sea training provided
by these voyages must have stood them in good
stead. That the craft themselves withstood
the extra wear and tear is a tribute to those
who designed and built them.

14. Additional difficulties in the way of train-
ing and mounting arose from late arrival of
craft and material. This was particularly so
in the case of Force “A”} of the Eastern
Task Force which received its L.S.T.st
extremely late and had little or no opportunity
of trying and practising with pontoons. This.
portion of the force was also separated by 900
miles from the L.C.T.s§ which were to form
a part of its assault. A high standard of
staff work was required to knit these scattered
components into an operational whole.

15. The Western Task Force was more for-
tunate in that opportunities for training and
mounting were undisturbed, and all ships were
concentrated. Although this force also
suffered to some extent from late arrivals and
rushed planning, as compared with the Eastern
Task Force the Western Task Force was much
better placed sirice the U.S. warships came into
the Mediterranean for the specific purpose of
the operation, and only very slight calls were
ge ee
