On roth October information was re- ceived from His Majesty\u2019s Government to the effect that a proposal had ibeen made to the Russian Government for the withdrawal of both Russian and British troops from Teheran and its neighbourhood and that plans should imme- diately be made with the Russian Commander for joint withdrawal to take place as soon as possible. The withdrawal was carried out on 18th October after a combined British-Russian parade on 17th October. The Russians with- drew to Kazvin and Pahlevi and our troops to Sultanabad and Hamadan."

            "description": "207. Nevertheless, in spite of all we could do, the enemy continued methodically to con- solidate his position in the smaller islands. Naxos and Paros were occupied on 12th October, and on 15th October Simi, which we had evacuated two days before after heavy dive-bombing raids had made the position un- tenable, was occupied by the enemy. The German Air Force was well dispersed; its heavy bombers were concentrated at Eleusis, its fighters at Kalamaki and Argos, its dive- bombers at Megara and Marizza, and from these bases constant attacks were made on Leros. Delayed-action bombs put Portolago Bay, on Leros, temporarily out of action on 16th October, and on 17th and 18th October, Castelrosso was bombed for the first time since our occupation."

            "description": "23. The supply of the garrison at Leros had by this time (18th October) become unsatis- factory. An organisation was being set up for supply by caique through Casteloriso and through Samos, but owing to various difficulties, only very small quantities of supplies had so far reached Leros by either of these methods, though supplies to Samos were going well. Some supplies were being put into Leros by air, but this was falling off owing to shortage of transport aircraft. Supply by submarine could not start for a week and these would only provide a proportion of the tonnage needed to maintain the garrison, much less build up a reserve. The situation was complicated by the fact that the reinforcement of the garrison of Leros, which then consisted of one battalion and one company of infantry plus various details mnaking about 1,200 in all, was dependent to a considerable extent on the creation of a regular supply service. :"

At dawn on 19th October these two battalions, with perfect timing and good execution, attacked, supported by fire from 2oth Field Battery R.A. of oth Field Regiment, and by 56th (Uganda) Field Battery, East African Artillery, the whole under command of Brigadier W. A. Dimoline, O.B.E., M.C. Seven hundred prisoners, two 75 mm. guns, one zo mm. A.A. gun, 7 mortars and 16 heavy machine-guns were captured. Such was the effect of the artillery fire, and the attack from unexpected directions, that we suffered no casualties."

            "description": "August and September, the \u201cHurribomber\u201d again proving itself a most effective weapon for close support in jungle country, as the wreckage along the Tiddim Road testified. Tiddim itself fell on 18th October, and the way was now open for a double thrust towards Kalemyo from the west and north. Japanese resistance in the Kennedy Peak area, albeit grim, proved no match for the experienced Allied troops and the accompanying air bombardment, and Kalemyo fell on 15th November. With the capture of Kalewa on 2nd December the chapter of moun- tain warfare was closed and the Fourteenth Army was ready to debouch upon \u2018the plains of Central Burma."

The final assault on the positions at Milestone 158 cover- ing Tiddim was supported by a co-ordinated attack by tanks and Hurribombers. A thick mist hid the advancing tanks, while the noise of their engines was drowned by the roar of low-flying aircraft. Complete surprise was achieved and the position was captured. Tiddim was occupied on the 18th October, by which date the Valvum, Sialam Vum and Tuibal positions had also been captured."

As it was obvious that the success of our future operations would be equally, if not more, de- pendent on air transport, I was determined that the system of control which I have briefly outlined should be introduced as soon as pos- sible. In spite of the shortage of manpower and other difficulties, it was introduced on the 18th October. As our operations expand changes may become necessary, but the organi- zation is sufficiently flexible to allow this."
