While the M.T./Stores ships for the 5th and goth Divisions and the 231st Brigade were being loaded at Beirut, Haifa and Alexandria, other formations were being moved to Malta in teadiness for the assault or follow-up. The assault troops of the 51st Division were moved in Janding craft from Sousse and Sfax, and Main Army Headquarters and the 30th Corps Headquarters with air formations, also in landing craft, from Tripoli to Malta. The ferrying of these troops with their vehicles, equipment and maintenance stores, involved the most careful planning in conjunction with the Royal Navy for the use of the landing craft available. Before the attack was launched the Tripoli-Malta ferry had convoyed 7,000 personnel and 1,400 vehicles. In all some 32,000 personnel and 6,000 vehicles, as well as guns and tanks, were embarked at Tripoli for Sicily. Other headquarters and units with equipment, stores and vehicles were moved from Egypt to Malta in personnel and M.T./Stores ships. From 3rd to roth June, 7,000 personnel and 600 vehicles were des- patched from \u2018Alexandria to Malta."

The only incidents which occurred to mar the precision of this remarkable concen- tration were the loss by submarine attack of four ships in convoy, the CITY OF VENICE and ST. ESSYLT in K.M'S. 18B on the 4th July, the DEVIS in K.M.S. 18B on 5th July, and the SHAHJEHAN in M.W.S. 36 on the 6th July. The passage of the convoys was covered most effectively by the operations of the North-West African Coastal Air Force, of No. 201 (Naval Co-operation) Group, of squadrons operating under Air Headquarters Air Defence, Eastern Mediteranean, and, on D-1 day, ofthe North-West African Tactical Air Force Squadrons based on Malta. Their problem was one of a complexity equal to our own. It was solved with conspicuous success, since no bomb was dropped on any convoy\u2014the majority were not sighted by enemy aircraft\u2014and all reports showed that the fighter cover was excellent."

In the centre, the sector of 30 Corps, we had made steady progress, but the nature of the country and the exiguous road-net meant that that progress had been slow. Vizzini was captured on the r4th, after strong resistance, by 51 Division assisted by 45 (United States). The Canadians then went into the lead captur- ing Grammichele and Caltagirone on the 15th and Piazza Armerina on the 16th.f Their next objective was Enna, the centre of the island and meeting point of a network of main roads against which the bomber effort of the air forces had been focussed during the first five days of the invasion. Seventh Army was now re- organising in order to meet the needs of its changed directive. On 5th July General Patton created a Provisional Corps Head- quarters to command the left flank of the Army, consisting of 3 Infantry Division, with under command 4 Tabor of Goums,{ old friends from Tunisian days, and 82 Airborne Division. II Corps continued to command the right flank with z and 45 Divisions, while 2 Armoured Division was under Army command. II Corps had made good progress northwards and 45 Division \u2018on its right had co-operated with 30 Corps in the capture of Vizzini and Calta- girone; on the 16th, however, the Division reached the new inter-Army boundary and started to transfer to the left wing of the Corps, behind 1 Division. 3 Division in the Provisional Corps made ground west- wards along the coast and inland beyond Cani- catti, which it had captured on the 12th.

            "description": "It will be noted that no decision had been taken, at the time this directive was issued, whether ANVIL should be mounted or not; on the other hand the forces to be provided for it from Italy had now risen to seven divisions. This uncertainty was a very great handicap to our planning, and its psychological effect on the troops expecting to be withdrawn, especially on the French, was undoubtedly serious. It is hard to expect troops to give of their best when they are continuously \u2018' looking over their shoulder \u2019\u2019 to a new objective, particularly when it is so attractive an objective as the liberation of their own country. This situation lasted throughout June. On the 14th I was instructed that VI Corps Headquarters was to be withdrawn at once, 3 Division on 17th June and the 36th on 27th June. On the 24th a French division was to be withdrawn to the Naples area, followed by a second in the first week of July. On the same day \u2018the Com- bined Chiefs of Staff signalled \u2018\u2018 the destruction of the German armed forces in Italy, south of the Pisa-Rimini line, must be completed. There should be no withdrawal from the battle of any Allied forces that are necessary for this purpose \u2019\u2019. Nevertheless I was informed on the 16th that, in order to preserve the possibility of mounting ANVIL, it was necessary to pro- ceed with the programme of withdrawal of forces already laid down. We could still hope that we might get these troops back again later but this became more unlikely after it was known that General Eisenhower had strongly recommended the operation in a signal of 23rd June. The final decision in its favour was communicated to me on 5th July. ANVIL* was eventually launched on 15th August."
