SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

oppose this force I had in Italy seventeen divi-
sions, four Italian Combat Groups and six
armoured and four infantry brigades.*

The spring offensive began with Eighth
Army’s attack on gth April on the enemy's
left. It was a resumption of the battle of
the previous winter, for the enemy were still
on the same defence line and had been for-
bidden, by Hitler, to make even the smallest
withdrawal. Bui the weather was now dry
and favourable and our troops, though dimi-
nished in numbers, were thorough'y rested;
the speed and weight of their blows were such
that the enemy was unable to occupy any of
his prepared alternative positions. The Senio
and Santerno lines were’ breached and by the
17th Argenta had been captured and we were
about to debouch through the Gap on to Fer-
Tara. Meanwhile on the x4th Fifth Army had
begun its drive on Bologna, after a two day
postponement due to weather. By contrast
with Eighth Anny, which in the plain had been
able to maintain a steady rate of progress,
Fifth Army had first to burst out of the moun-
tains. For a week the German defenders con-
tested every height with the greatest stubborn-
ness until the battered survivors were pushed
off the last ridge of the Apennines down into
the plain. Then the cost of this stubborn resist-
ance was seen; unable to form any coherent
line of defence the troops of Fourteenth Army
were swept back to the Po in full flight and
Fifth Army, after its slow and painfu! struggle
in the mountains, was able to race ahead in
wide sweeping thrusts. Bologna fell on the
aist, entered simultaneously by the Poles of
Eighth Army and II Corps of Fifth Army. On
the evening of the 22nd 10 United States Moun-
tain Division reached the Po at San Benedetto
and next day 5 Corps reached the river in
strength either side of Ferrara. Between them
these two thrusts had trapped and immobilized
thousands of German troops and the number
of prisoners was mounting to embarrassing pro-
portions. From the Po northwards it was a
pursuit, pressed with the utmost vigour against
an enemy who had received a mortal blow and
lost almost all his heavy weapons, but who still
resisted, where he could, with the same: deter-
mination and skill.

Indeed the last battle in Italy was as hard
fought as the first. I was not faced with a
broken and disintegrating army, nor was the
outcome influenced in any degree by demorali-
zation or lack of suvplies on the German side. t
It was a straightforward military operation
which, by first enveloping the enemy's left
wing in a classical outflanking manoeuvre and
then breaking through with a sudden blow his
weakened centre, drove him against the Po

We did, however, achieve our usual success in
deceiving the enemy as to our plans. By simulating
an intention to make an amphibious landing on the
Venetian coast (which my naval advisers assured me
was in fact quite impossible) we persuaded him to
divert 29 Panzer Grenadier Division, his principal
mobile reserve, north of the Po. Not only did this
reduce his ability to resist Eighth Army’s attack but
also it was a great strain on enemy resources to carry
out this lengthy move, eating into the meagre fuel
stocks available, and then to bring the division, when
the deception was discovered, back again over the
Po crossings under the hammering of our air attack
to be thrown too late into a losing battle.

and annihilated him there. The capitulation
of 2nd May only sealed a fate which had already
been decided. An army of half a million men
had been destroyed and all forces remaining
in Italy and Austria laid down their arms in
unconditional surrender .

For just under two years, since the invasion
of Sicily in 1943, Allied troops had been fight-
ing on Italian soil. In this period of twenty-
two months the troops under my command had
four times carried out an assault landing, the
most difficult operation in war. Three great
offensives with the full force of an Army
Group had been launched, in May and August,
1944, and in April, 1945. From Cape Passero
to the Brenner is eleven hundred and forty
miles by road; except for the plains of Lom-
bardy, reached only at the end of the long
struggle, that road led almost everywhere
through mountains. In the course of the
fighting we inflicted on the enemy casualties in
killed, wounded and missing which have been
estimated, largely from German figures, at five
hundred and thirty-six thousand;* Allied
casualties were three hundred and twelve
thousand. But statistics, however strikingt,
are barren materials for an evaluation of the
tesults of a campaign which must rather
be considered aga‘nst the background of

*the whole strategy of the war. In an
attempt to set ihe campaign against that
background I feel it would be least invidious
to change the point of view and to consider the
importance of the struggle in Italy from the
German side.

From the beginning both Germans and Allies
regarded Italy as a secondary theatre and
looked for the main decision to be given on
either the Eastern or the Western front. Both
sides were therefore bound above all to con-
sider whether this admitted ‘‘ side-show ’’ was
making a positive contribution to the main
object of strategy and whether it was making
it at the cheapest possible cost. The Allies’
avowed intention, laid down in May, 1943,
and never varied, was not to occupy any par-
ticular territory but to bring to battle the maxi-
mum number of German troops; it was also
the main German object (but not their only
object) to contain as many Allied troops as
possible and weaken by that amount the
strength which could be brought to the assault
of the ‘West Wall and the Rhine. At every
minute of the campaign, therefore, I had to
pose to myself the question, who was contain-
ing whom in Italy? This was the vital ques-
tion for the Germans also, and to them the
answer can never have been satisfactory.{ In
all forty-five German divisions were employed
in Italy, together with four Italian regular divi-
sions, one Cossack division and miscellaneous
formations of Czechs, Slovaks and Russians.

* This does not include casualcies inflicted on the
Italians, when they were still at war with us, or the
Germans who surrendered after the capitulation. The
German figures referred to cover the period from 3
September 1943 to 20 April 1945. .

+ Another interesting figure is the total of national-
ities under my command—twenty-six. A full list is
given in Appendix “A.” . .

{ That is to say, the real answer had they known it,
Since their faulty Intelligence continually overrated
our strength they undoubtedly believed themselves to
be containing forces superior to their own almost all
the time. The chief advantage of our own Intelligence
was that it enabled us to achieve our object with the
greatest economy of force.
