The total Japanese casualties on this front, after they crossed the Chindwin in March up till the middle of June, may safely be put at not less than 30,000. Against this, our own losses in killed, wounded and missing, from the 4th March to the -17th June totalled 12,525, of whom only 2,669 were killed.

            "description": "While the weather held up our renewed attack at Cassino it was already clear that the enemy was preparing another offensive at Anzio. He no doubt calculated that he had time enough before our threat to the \u2018\u2018 Gustav '\u201d line became serious and experience had given him a justified confidence in the strength of his defences there. His renewed attack could not be made in the same force as the first; there were large gaps in his divisions and morale had suffered the inevitable depression that follows the failure of an offensive of which much had been hoped. Mackensen therefore planned an attack on a smaller scale, using LXXVI Corps only; it was designed to narrow down the bridgehead by driving a wedge into the eastern flank to cut off the troops defend- ing the Mussolini canal. If this were success- ful a further process of attrition might reduce the bridgehead to dimensions too small for safety, Four divisions, including two panzer divisions, were to make the assault, with a mobile division in reserve: it was to be com~- bined with diversionary attacks on both flanks, VI Corps was prepared for the attack on 2oth February and it was a complete failure: artillery fire and the firm defence of 3 Division broke up most of the attacks, a small penetration was made but was soon ironed out and by the afternoon of ist March the enemy had acknowledged defeat.t He never again resumed the offensive and I now could consider the Anzio bridgehead secure, especially after we had captured Fourteenth Army\u2019s order of 4th March directing the assumption of the"

On the 4th March, with the aid of tanks, they over- Tan several enemy positions, the enemy\u2019s anti- tank artillery making no impression on our Shermans. After a sharp \u2018but successful en- gagement in the vicinity of the road junction south of Tamandu they exploited northwards to the village, which they found derelict and deserted and which was proudly handed over to them by a naval party which had landed a few hours earlier. Severe fighting, however, continued east and north of Tamandu for some days until the enemy\u2019s fierce resistance -was broken by the combined efforts of 74 Brigade and the West Africans advancing from the north. On the 7th March 1 Brigade crossed the Dalet Chaung and occupied Dalet Village. Simultaneously, 4 (West African) Brigade crossed the Chaung further south and estab- lished itself in the hills five miles north-north- east of Tamandu. 2 (West African) Brigade had reached the Tamandu\u2014An road and estab- lished a block at the Me Chaung crossing."

            "description": "On 3/4th March the enemy had occupied Kyaikhla (south-west of Waw) and Payagyi 12 miles north of Pegu on the Toungoo road. An attack by tanks and infantry was launched in the late afternoon of the 4th against the latter. Considerable casualties were inflicted and a gun and mortar were captured, but the force available was insufficient to prevent further penetration in this area. Meanwhile the enemy had occupied Tandawgyi close to Payagyi."
