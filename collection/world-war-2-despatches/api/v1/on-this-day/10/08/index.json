At this time the Automatic Fuze-setter was just coming in, so were new marks of radar, the 4.5-inch guns were about to be converted into 3.7-inch Mark 6 and 5.25-inch guns were also beginning to be deployed. . 58. The new radar sets were very sensitive to interference and on 7th/8th October, 1943, the Germans began to drop strips of metallised paper similar to those which our own bombers had for some time been using over Germany. These had the effect of producing spurious breaks in radar cathode ray tubes which could either be mistaken for aircraft or else appeared in such profusion that an aircraft break could not be identified and. followed. It was a,move which had  been anticipated but to which no satisfactory answer had been found."

The final assault on the positions at Milestone 158 covering Tiddim was supported by a co-ordinated attack by tanks and Hurribombers. A thick mist hid the advancing tanks, while the noise of their engines was drowned by the roar of low-flying aircraft. Complete surprise was achieved and the position was captured. Tiddim was occupied on the 18th October, by which date the Valvum, Sialam Vum and Tuibal positions had also been captured."
