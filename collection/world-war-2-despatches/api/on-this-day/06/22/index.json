It was at first hoped that the French Colonies and Oversea territories would continue the struggle; but General Nogues in North Africa, after a little hesitation, decided to obey the orders to capituJate, and his example was followed shortly afterwards by General Mittelhauser in Syria, who only a few days earlier had declared to me at Beirut his unalterable determination to continue the struggle. General Legentilhomme at Jibuti held out for nearly a month longer.",

On the 22nd June it was decided that the New Zealand Division was more suitable for a mobile role than the roth Indian Division, and orders were issued for it to pass to the command of the 13th Corps as soon as the roth Indian Division arrived from the frontier. There was a great shortage of field artillery, and, as a disproportionate amount of infantry were likely to prove an encumbrance, instructions were-given for the infantry divisions, or what remained of them,  to be organised  into battle groups. These battle groups had as their foundation the maximum number of field guns that could be provided for each, and only just as many infantry as were needed to protect them.  The idea was that in this way the defence could be kept mobile, the battle groups being moved rapidly to that part of the front where the danger was greatest. Moreover, these groups, being comparatively weak in infantry, were not encumbered with large numbers of vehicles and could therefore .be. used in the closest co-operation with the armour. I visited Eighth Army: Headquarters on the 22nd June and confirmed these arrangements,",
