            "description": "I flew to Diego Suarez on 23rd September to discuss the possibility of landing with RearAdmiral Tennant. After an exhaustive examination, we reluctantly came to the conclusion that such an operation was not feasible. The swell and surf prevalent at that time of the year, and poor beaches, offered no chance of getting ashore, undamaged, even the minimum of mechanical transport. The same conditions obtained at Fort Dauphin. At Tulear in the South-West the situation was slightly better, but it was still not possible, in a reasonable time, to land sufficient mechanical transport. The port had some facilities which, together with the airfield and possibilities of establishing a sea-plane base, would make it of use for patrolling the Mozambique Channel. It was decided to establish a small garrison there. This was effected by H.M.S.   Birmingham,  H.M.S.   Inconstant,  H.M.A.S.   Napier   and H.M.N.S.   Vangalen   landing two companies of the Pretoria Regiment and a few armoured cars from Diego Suarez on 29th September.",
