3684 SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 23 JUNE, 1948

4. Itis thought that future operations of this
nature will not only need equally efficient and
careful, preparation and execution, but also
adequate air support, if the geographical
position 1s not so favourable to us.

OPERATION ‘‘ CLAYMORE ”--REPORT
OF PROCEEDINGS
I have the honour to forward the following
report of the proceedings of Force “‘ Rebel ’”
in Operation ‘‘ Claymore ’’.
2. Force “ Rebel ’’ consisted of the scowing
ships : —
Destroyers .
SOMALI—Captain C. Caslon (Captain
(D), 6th D.F.).
BEDOUIN~—Comdr. J. A. McCoy, D.S.O.
TARTAR—Comdr. L. P Skipwith.
LEGION—Comdr. R. F. Jessel.
ESKIMO—Comadr. E. G. Le Geyt.

Troop Carriers
QUEEN EMMA—Comdr. C. A. Kershaw.

PRINCESS BEATRIX—Comdr. T. B.
Brunton.

3. During the afternoon of Friday, 28th Feb-
ruary, Bngadier C. Haydon, D.S.O.,
O.B.E., embarked in SOMALI with his head-
quarters staff which consisted of Major A. R.
Aslett (Brigade Major), 2nd Lieutenant L. M.
Harper-Gow (interpreter in Norwegian), and
four other ranks .

4. Force ‘‘ Rebel ’’ sailed from Scapa at ooor
on 1st March, 1941, and proceeded to Skaale-
fjord, Faroes, arriving there at 1900 on the
same day. Destroyers refuelled from WAR
PINDARI and the force sailed at coor on 2nd
March. Course was set for position L (64° 00°
N. 3° 00’ W.) and thence for position P (67°

12’ N. 02° 00’ W.).

5. After clearing the Faroes a speed of 20
knots was maintained until 1100 on 2nd March
in order to be as tar to the northward as possible
by that time. It was hoped that, by so doing,
the force would evade detection by the Zenit
flight.* No aircraft was in fact sighted.

6. After passing through position P at 0130
on 3rd March course was shaped for position Q
(67° 09’ N. 11° 55’ E) which was reached as
planned at ooor on 4th March, speed having
been adjusted as necessary. _

7. Up to this time the passage had been un-
eventful and the weather conditions very
favourable. These were particularly so while
making the approach to position Q from the
westward. The sky was, for the most part,,
overcast with low cloud and frequent snow
showers were expetienced which tended to re-
duce the chances of detection, The weather
cleared sufficiently at intervals, however, for
navigational observations to be taken to fix the
position of the force.

8. During the passage from P to Q the wind

3s from E.N E., force 3, and the state of the

Admuyalty footnote —
* Zenit flight—a daily meteorological flight flown by
the Germans,

sea 24.* It was unnecessary, therefore, even to
consider postponing the operation as conditions
promised to be excellent. Special weather re-

-ports made by Admiralty were received, also

reports of air reconnaissance patrols from the
Commander-in-Chief, Rosyth.

g. During the approach to position Q, D/F
bearings were obtained of SUNFISH at the
expected times and these bearings confirmed the
position obtained by astronomical observations.
it is estimated that the force passed 2 miles
south of SUNFISH at 2335. This method of
checking the position was most valuable in
making the landfall. Had no sights been ob-
tained, it would have been the only means of
fixing the position of the force at this critical
stage of the approach.

ro. From position Q the force moved up
Vestfjord towards position C (68° 05’ N. 14° 29°
E.), continuing in night cruising order until
0300 when ships formed into single line ahead.
Position C was reached without incident at
0430 when the force split, SOMALI,
BEDOUIN, TAKsAR and QUEEN EMMA
proceeding to position D (68° 74’ N. 14° 42’ E.)
and LEGION, ESKIMO and PRINCESS BEA-
TRIX to position E (68° 08’ N. 14° or’ E.). It
is believed that the force was observed by coast-
watchers during this passage, but that no re-
porting message got through to the mainland.
This point may be mentioned by the military
who gave me the information after our return
to Scapa.

11. Passage up the Vestfjord was much sim-
plified by the fact that all lights were burning
at full brilliancy and with normal characteris-
tics, with the following exceptions : _Skomvaer,
Tennholm, Grytoy. By 0445 the outline of the
coast could be distinguished.

12. After the splitting of the force, SOMALI,
with BEDOUIN, TARTAR and QUEEN
EMMA in company, moved towards position D
where the landing craft for X landing were
lowered by 0508. These were taken in charge
by TARTAR while SOMALI, BEDOUIN and
QUEEN EMMA proceeded to position F (68°
12’ N. 14° 52’ E.).

13. The weather conditions now were—wind
ENE, force 3, sea 10 to 20.f It was intensely
cold, the temperature being between 20° and
25° F. The weather continued to be fine and
very clear throughout the day, with brilliant
sunshine. ‘

14. By this time it had become apparent that,
in view of the lightness of the dawn and the
perfect visibility, the landing of troops could,
with advantage, have been made earlier than
at 0645, the projected time. No alteration, ex-
cept in the case of X landing, was however
possible owing to the distances to be covered
by landing craft after having been lowered.

15. Craft for X landing, covered by
TARTAR, were comparatively close to their
objective on being lowered and must have been
clearly visible to those ashore. To avoid the loss
of the element of surprise, therefore, they
moved off to Port Xt at 0530 and arrived
there approximately half an hour before the
planned time.
