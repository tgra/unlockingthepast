SUPPLEMENT to tat LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

tended to decrease the effectiveness of our anti-
aircraft fire. Nevertheless, casualties were in-
flicted on the air formations, though these were
difficult to assess, and some of the formations
were broken up.

As regards Passive Air Defence, some modi-
fications in the system were introduced to avoid
the waste of valuable tme which took place
during periods of Air Raid Warnings.

4or. On our side, great hopes had been
placed in the Hurricane Fighters which reached
Singapore on the 13th January. (See Section
XXXVI). It was hoped that the superior
quality of these machines might enable us to
regain at least some measure of air superiority
over the Japanese. Such, however, did not
prove to be the case. In the first place the
machines, which were not of the most modern
type, did not prove to be superior to the
Japanese Navy Zero Fighters. Secondly, the
pilots lacked knowledge of the Malayan climatic
and geographical conditions. As with the Army
reinforcements, there was no time to accustom
them to the local conditions. As a result,
several of these Hurricanes were lost daily,
some being brought down in battle, some acci-
dentally lost, while a few were destroyed or
damaged on the ground,

402. Our Bomber and Reconnaissance
machines also continued to be a wasting asset.
All available aircraft, including the torpedo-
bombers, were used for daily East and West
Coast reconnaissances, for reconnaissance of
the roads behind the enemy lines and for attacks
on enemy aerodromes and troop concentrations.
These attacks, however, were so weak that
comparatively little damage could be done. By
the 26th January our Air Striking Force in
Malaya had, as recorded in Section XXXVIII,
to all intents and purposes ceased to exist. A
few attacks were made late in January on
enemy aerodromes by Blenheims from Sumatra
and Flying Fortresses from Java, but they were
not heavy enough to affect the scale of the
Japanese air effort. ;

403. 1 wish here to pay tribute to the gallant
air crews who throughout the later stages of
the Malayan campaign went unflinchingly to
almost certain death in obsolete aircraft which
should have been replaced many years before,
and also to those members of the Malayan
Volunteer Air Force who, with no protection
of any sort, continued to carry out reconnais-
sances in Moths and other light aircraft with
complete disregard for their own safety.

404. On the 26th January I telegraphed to
the Supreme Commander South-West Pacific as
under:—

‘* With our depleted strength it is difficult to
withstand the enemy’s ground pressure com-
bined with continuous and practically unop-
posed air activity. We are fighting all the
way but may be driven back into the island
within a week. We shall then be subjected
to a very heavy scale of air attack unless we
can maintain sufficient fighters on the island
and drive enemy from Southern Malaya
aerodromes. I know that you are doing
everything possible to reduce enemy air
strength which is at present the dominating
factor.”’

405. On the 30th January, 1942, it was de-
cided to withdraw the whole of our Air Force,
except one fighter squadron, to bases in the

1305

Netherlands East Indies. This decision was
made by the Supreme Commander South-West

. Pacific after consultation with the Air Officer

Commanding Far East. At my urgent request,
one fighter squadron was left at Singapore.
Some heavy and light anti-aircraft artillery was
also despatched from Singapore to Sumatra.

Certain preliminary steps had already been
taken in anticipation of these moves. Unfor-
tunately several ships carrying Air Force
equipment were sunk before reaching their
destination,

Section XLI.—FurtTHER REINFORCEMENTS.

406. Royal Navy.—It was now known that it
was not intended to send any additional naval
forces to Malayan waters. It was also known
that a small British fleet was assembling at
Ceylon for operations in the eastern waters
of the Indian Ocean, that a strong American
fleet was assembling in the South Pacific with a
view to keeping open communications with
Australia, and that some British (including
Australian) and American ships were concen-
trating with the Dutch Fleet for the defence of
Java, which was already being threatened by
a Japanese thrust south of Borneo. Detach-
ments of Royal Marine survivors from
H.M.Ss. ‘‘ Prince of Wales ’’ and ‘‘ Repulse *’
had joined up with the Argyll and Sutherland
Highlanders.

407. Army.—The following reinforcements
reached Singapore during the latter half of
January.

On or about the 2and January.—The 44
Indian Infantry Brigade with attached troops
and 7,000 Indian reinforcements. The 44
Brigade was a sister brigade to the 45 Brigade
which had fought at Muar. It was equally raw
and only semi-trained. It was commanded by
Brigadier Ballantine. With a view to giving
it an opportunity for further training, I decided
to retain it on Singapore Island and allotted it
accommodation in the south-western area.

The 7,000 Indian reinforcements were ex-
tremely raw and untrained and included very
few non-commissioned officers or even poten-
tial leaders which were so badly needed in our
Indian wafits. After consultation with the Com-
mander 3 Indian Corps I decided that it would
be unwise to draft more than a proportion of
these to the Indian units. The remainder were
retained at the reinforcement camps for further
training.

24th January.—An Australian Machine-Gun
Battalion and about 2,000 Australian Rein-
forcements. As the terrain on the mainland
was not suitable for machine-guns, the Machine-
Gun Battalion was allotted accommodation in
the Naval Base area and ordered to prepare
machine-gfin positions on the north coast of
the island.

Many of the 2,000 Australian reinforcements
had only had a few weeks’ training. They had
not been in the Army long enough to learn true
discipline.

2gth January —The 18 British Division
(Major-General M. Beckwith-Smith) less 53
Infantry Brigade Group and Machine-Gun,
Reconnaissance, Anti-Tank and other units.
These, with exception of the 53 Brigade Group
already arrived, were due in a later convoy.
This division had left the United Kingdom the
previous October for the Middle East. It had
