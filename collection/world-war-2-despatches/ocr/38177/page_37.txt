SUPPLEMENT to taz LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 1948

late on the starting line as a result. But when
the attack did begin, it was executed with great
spirit and between them the New Zealanders
and Poles captured half the position and took
many prisoners. The Indian Division was by
no means so fortunate. The 5th Brigade con-
tinued to be held up in its frontal attack on
Alem Hamza, so the 7th Brigade was ordered

. to work round to the west of the enemy locality.
It had begun to move forward when a battalion
of the 5th Brigade, which had occupied a
position to the south-west of Alem Hamza two
days before and was somewhat isolated there,
was heavily attacked and finally overrun.
Although only a hundred of the infantry and one
battery of the supporting field regiment sur-
vived, the defenders offered a sturdy resistance,
for the German regiment which had carried out
the assault was heard to report that it was
unable to exploit its success.

Extremely bad going over the last twenty-
five miles of its sixty-mile march retarded the
4th Armoured Brigade which reached its objec-
tive four hours late. But it is doubtful whether

‘the brigade would have assisted the progress
of the 4th Indian Division, even if it had
arrived punctually, since it was not until after
daybreak on the 16th that the enemy seems
to have become aware of its presence. Decisive
results were hoped for from the action of the
4th Armoured Brigade on the 16th December,
but these hopes were frustrated by the extreme
roughness of the country it had to traverse.
As its supply vehicles could scarcely move in
the soft sand, the brigade had to go south to
replenish, and this operation was not completed
until about midday. Brigadier Gatehouse then
took his brigade further east than his original
objective, towards Sidi Breghisc and Bir
Temrad where enemy concentrations were re-
ported to be lying. Although they were still
hampered by bad going, our tanks caused con-
siderable damage and much confusion among
the enemy in the heavy fighting which followed.

The 4th Indian Division had to reorganise
before it could resume its attack and con-
sequently made no progress.on the 16th
December. The New Zealanders and the Poles,
on the other hand, continued to exploit their
success taking numerous prisoners.

Rommel now decided not to risk destruction
by staying and ordered a further retreat. The
withdrawal began, apparently, at about midday
on the 16th December and was continued
throughout the night. Fearing this develop-.
ment, General Ritchie had already ordered a
column of the Support Group to be sent to hold
the cross roads at Carmusa which would make
it difficult, if’ not impossible, for the enemy
to-hold Derma. This column ‘left in. the early
hours of the 17th December and occupied
Carmusa at about midday on the 18th. A far
more substantial success might have been scored,
however, if we had been able to cut the main
road further east. The 7th Anmoured Division
seemed to be in a position to do this with
armoured cars, mobile columns and even the
4th Armoured Brigade, all of which were
operating to the west of Gazala. But the diffi-
cult country to the south, which made the
movement of, supply columns slow and on
occasion impossible, prevented it. The Eighth
Army now devoted all its energies to carrying
out a relentless pursuit. .

The pursuit to Agedabia.

The enemy divided in his retreat, the rem-
nants of the armoured divisions and the Italian
Mobile Corps going by the desert through
Mechili and Msus, and the Italian 2rst Corps
in a very shattered state, by the main roads
through the Gebel Akhdar. ‘The troops of the
13th Corps were likewise divided, the 4th
Indian Division being sent by the Gebel Akhdar
and the 7th Armoured Division by the desert.

The 4th Indian Division set out at once on
the morning of the 17th December. The 7th
Infantry Brigade on the southern flank travelled
at great speed, and within twenty-four hours
reached Carmusa where one of its battalions
relieved the Support Group column which had
been sent on ahead. Another battalion cap-
tured Martuba landing ground, and the third
the aerodrome at Derna, where a number of
aircraft were destroyed and much transport
and many prisoners taken. The 5th Infantry
Brigade, originally directed to advance on
Martuba by a more northerly route, traversed
very rough country all the way and fell behind
considerably. As the country round Derna
appeared to be falling into our hands without
great trouble, the objective of the 5th Brigade
was altered, and it was instructed to secure
the cross-roads at Giovanni Berta and at
Lamluda, so as to cut off any enemy remaining
in the Derna region. By making a wide turning
moverhent over country the enemy had believed
impassable, the 5th Brigade reached Lamluda
on the r9th December and took many prisoners
there. Giovanni Berta proved more difficult
to capture as the enemy had left a detachment
to cover it, but by the evening of the zoth
that place, too, was in our hands. Derna was
occupied on the 19th December, and by the 2st
the 4th Indian Division had overrun the whole
of the country east of Appollonia, Cirene, and
El Faidia. After offering some resistance,
Barce was taken during the afternoon of the
23rd. Bengasi itself was taken by a detach-
ment from the 7th Armoured Division. By
December 26th all organised resistance in the
Gebel Akhdar had ceased, and the 4th Indian
Division became responsible for restoring law
and order in the hill country up to Bengasi.

The 7th Indian Infantry Brigade then moved
forward to take over the region round Barce
and Bengasi with instructions to defend it
against attack from the south. The r1th
Infantry Brigade having been left behind in
Tobruk to make good its losses, only the 5th
Infantry Brigade remained to ocoupy the area
betwen Barce and Martuba. The Indian
Division then had to give up all but a bare
minimum of its transport in order to provide
as much as ‘possible for the desert sector, where
supply difficulties were already becoming acute.
The. greater part of its divisional artillery had
also to be taken in order to reinforce the rest
of the 13th Corps round Agedabia.

The 7th Armoured Division gave chase across
the desert and moved with a speed which was
remarkable ‘considering the difficulties they en-
countered. The 17th December had to be
spent round Gazala while transport and supplies
were assembled for the advance, but the
armoured brigade improved the occasion by
hharrying the enemy’s departure?- On the 18th
thé Support Group moved swiftly to Mechili
and engaged enemy concentrations to the west
of that place. By nightfall practically all the
