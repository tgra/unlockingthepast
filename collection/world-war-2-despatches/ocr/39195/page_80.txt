APPRECIATION

.2. The battle for Mandalay is approaching
its climax and large forces of the Soemy: are
now concentrated in that area.

Fourteenth Army are attacking them from
the north and are also encircling them from
the west.

The Japanese intention is clearly to fight it
out. This is borne out by the movements west-
wards of certain forces now east of the
Irrawaddy.

The battle for Mandalay will therefore be
slow ; it will probably be grim; its Sutzame
will nevertheless be certain.

3. To achieve our object it is first necessary
to destroy the Japanese forces now in the
Mandalay area.

This requires a concentrated effort by
Fourteenth Army and N.C.A.C., both directed
towards this common aim.

Only by this means shall we be able to
capture Rangoon before the monsoon.

4. The withdrawal of formations of 15
Indian Corps must continue as planned.
