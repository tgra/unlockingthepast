SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 4 MARCH, 10948

bombing runs. Later two Albacores and
Hurricanes joined in and the: Walrus returned
at 1219. Nothing had been seen of the enemy
on the top of the mountain though subsequent

events proved them to’ have been there~all the

time.

36. At 1054 F.0.0. 2 asked that DEVON-
SHIRE should close in m order to extend her
command of the area to the South of Antsirane
and ensure the continuation of W/T com-
munication, This request was complied with
and a new berth 1n position 134° Q.1 2.1 miles
was taken up at 1146 and F OO. 2 informed
that it would be impossible to move the ship
any closer. Unfortunately this position shut
DEVONSHIRE out from direct -visual com-
munication with KEREN, and the dis-
advantages of this break in communications
soon began to tbe felt. | Eventually, when
F.0.0. 2 had advanced beyond our extreme
gun range, it was decided that the mainten-
ance of good communication outweighed other
considerations and at 1420 the ship again shifted
berth 2 cables to the (Westward from which
Position KEREN could be seen.

37. At 1149 the Senior Officer, Minesweepers,
reported that AURICULA had struck a mine
and asked for assistance for her wounded. It
could be seen that she had not sunk and that
a number of boats were in attendance. Later
she drifted out of sight behind a merchant
ship. At 1239, having heard nothing further,
I asked the Senior Naval Officer (L) if he re-
quired any assistance, and at 1248 asked the
Senior . Officer, Minesweepers, to report the
position regarding AURICULA. No news was
received until 1530 when a staff officer from
the Senior Naval Officer (L) arrived on board
to see me. “He séemed in some doubt as to
who should hhave been in charge of the opera-
tion of salvaging AURICULA, which was stull
afloat. I explained to him that DEVONSHIRE
would provide any assistance asked for but
that the Senior Naval Officer (L) was in charge
of the anchorage and would have to make
the arrangements for towing AURICULA
inshore. Hearing that the ship had a shaky
bulkhead I sent a boat at 1545 with a Ship?
wright Officer, three Shipwrights and a load of

.wood to undertake the necessary shoring. This

officer returned and reported to me about 1830
that the ship would undoubtedly sink before
the morning, and should be beached as soon
as possible. This was reported to the Flag
‘Officer Commanding, Force ‘‘ F,’’ the Senior
Naval Officer ('L) and the Senior Officer, Mine-
sweepers.

38. At 1300 three Potez aircraft were sighted
over the target area. The air raid warning
“Red ’’ was hoisted and passed by W/T.
At 1326 the hostile aircraft had disappeared
and orders were given to revert to 15 minutes
notice.

39. At 0758 the Senior Naval Officer (L) in-
formed me that Captain (D), 12th Destroyer
Flotilla had been asked to send EASEDALE
to oil DEVONSHIRE as soon as PAKENHAM
had fuelled. At 0852 Captain (D), 12th
Destroyer Flotilla informed me that DER-
WENTDALE, alongside whom he was lying,
considered the weather unsuitable for berthing
alongside. I replied to the effect that I did
not wish to oil iri any case until my role as
bombarding ship had come to anend. During
the afternoon EASEDALE anchored in my

1597

vicimty and I asked her whether she could
come’ alongside in the weather conditions then
prevailing and was informed that she could.
Arrangements were therefore made to get her
alongside with the last of the light so that I

- could complete with oil before the moom rose.

These arrangements unfortunately clashed with
Captain (D), 12th Destroyer Flotilla’s organisa-
tion, and subsequently led to EASEDALE being
emptied of oil at a time when she was required
for fuelling destroyers. EASEDALE is more
handy than DERWENTDALE and can come
alongside under worse weather conditions.

40. About 1630 your signal timed 1533 was
received which suggested that the anchorage
could not be considered safe from submarine
attack and that I should proceed to join your
flag before dark. To comply meant proceed-
ing mmediately and the sudden removal of the
ship would have broken an important line
of army communication without adequate warn-
ing. I also considered 1t important to complete
with fuel, for which arrangements were already
in train, and proposed in my. signal timed
1657 to Jom you in the morning. This signal
was repeated to the Senior Naval Officer (L)
and cleared to KEREN at 1738. It was subse-°
quently apprpved by your signal timed 2057.

41. Before proceeding, arrangements were
made for PAKENHAM to take over the line
of communication with F.0.0. 2 who had not
been heard since 1622 and she was subsequently
told to confirm that she had made touch (my
signal timed o610/6th May and PAKENHAM’s
signal timed 0743 /6th May which reported that
communications had not been re-established
with F.O.O. 2 until 0733/6th May).

42 The LINDZ, a small black yacht, wear-
ing the Red Ensign entered harbour at 1510
and proceeded into Ambararata Bay. After
enquiries, FREESIA reported that she had
been examined by GENISTA.

43 ANTHONY arrived at 1512 proceeding
up the anchorage at high speed. I thought it
advisable to warn her that the anchorage was
mined. . :

44. Three French Morane fighters were
sighted at 1707 machine gunning Blue Beach.
Air raid warning ‘‘ Red ’’ was initiated imme-
miately afterwards and repeated by the Flag
Officer Commanding, Force “F’’, at 1728.
No attacks on the fleet developed and the
fighters were seen to disappear in a South
Easterly direction and the air raid warning
‘* White ’’ was passed at 1731

45. The moon rose at 2213, oiling was com-
pleted by 2300. EASEDALE was anchored
and DEVONSHIRE slipped from her and pro-
ceeded to sea, passing Nosi Hara at 2341. It
was assumed that my departure would be re-
ported to the Senior Naval Officer (L) and as
V/S signalling in the anchorage was undesir-
able no further signal reporting my movements
was made. This was regretted later when the
Senior Naval Officer (L)’s signal timed 0705
was received off Cape Amber asking me tu
engage the French warship that was making a
nuisance of herself m English Bay.

Bombardment of the Oranjia Peninsula.

46. At 0553 the Flag Officer Commanding,
Force ‘“‘ F ”’ ’s signal timed 0350 was received
ordering DEVONSHIRE to be ready to bom-
bard the Oranjia Peninsula by 1200. Course
was altered for Cape Amber which was passed
