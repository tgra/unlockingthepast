In the Tripoli area, units and formations were supplied from three signal parks and an advanced ordnance depot, and in the Delta direct from base ordnance depots. Owing to the fact that the ship conveying certain of the special combined operations  signal stores from the United Kingdom broke down, many of them did not arrive until the expedition was due to sail. This involved a considerable amount of improvisation. As a consequence none of the special stores were issued until 24th May, one week before the last day on which units could accept delivery, which severely handicapped the training of operators in these new types of equipment. A certain amount of difficulty was also caused by the arrival of battle  batteries in unserviceable condition. Fortunately a second consignment arrived, which eased the situation."

Brigade of the rath (A) Division could concentrate in the Dalle-Soddu area soon and could relieve rrth (A) Division of all ison duties, and protect its rear, This would release the two South African battalions to proceed to Berbera for embarkation, and would free the whole of gand E.A. Brigade for the further advance. In order to enable an advance also to be made on the Addis Abeba-Gimma road, where the enemy were holding a position at Abalti southwest of the Omo, I arranged to transfer the Nigerian Brigade to this front. To do this I relieved the 1st Nigeria Regiment in Addis Abeba by garrison troops and moved up 1/1 K.A.R. which had in the meantime been similarly relieved. As time was all important so"
