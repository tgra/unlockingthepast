346. Our Own Course of Actwon.—In order
to attain our object it was necessary that we
should continue to fight the enemy on the main-
land. In view of the disparity in strength
between the Japanese and ourselves the safe
arrival of our expected reinforcements remained
of'primary importance, ‘We estimated that the
most important formation, the 18 British
Division, could not be disembarked and
deployed on the mainland before the end of the
first week in February at the earliest, i.e., more
than three weeks ahead.

Our, problem was greatly influenced by the
fact that the road Jemaluang—Kluang—Batu
Pahat is the only direct lateral communication
in Johore and also by the fact that the newly
constructed aerodromes of Kahang and Kluang
were situated on this road. It was obviously
necessary to fight as long as we could north of
this vitally important road.

It was therefore decided to deny to the enemy
the line Mersing—Segamat—Muar. An outline
of the plan to put this decision into effect has
already been given in Section XXXIV.

Section XXXVIII.—Tue Jouore
OPERATIONS, I4TH-26TH JANUARY, 1942.

347. The Gemas Ambush.—North of Segamat
the Commander Westforce had disposed the
27 Australian Brigade Group and the 8 Indian
Brigade Group astride the main road and rail-
way with one battalion (the 2/30 Australian
Bn.) forward in an ambush position west of
Gemas. The 22 Indian Brigade Group was
similarly disposed in depth astride the Malacca-
Segamat road with the forward battalion about
the Jementah cross roads. The 2 Loyals, with-
drawn from the Singapore garrison, was in
reserve and responsible for the local defence of
Segamat. Major-General Barstow, the Com-
mander 9 Indian Division, was senior officer
‘on the Segamat front and, under his influence,
an excellent spirit of co-operation quickly grew
up between British, Australian and Indian
troops. ‘

The ambush laid by the 2/30 Bn. (Lieut.-
Colonel Gallaghan) was very carefully prepared.
The forward company covered 7oo yards of
road immediately east of the River Gemencheh
and was 3 miles in front of the main battalion
position. The troops were concealed*in thick
jungle bordering the road. At 1600 hrs on
the 14th January the leading enemy troops
appeared. By 1620 hrs. about 250 cyclists
had passed through towards the main position,
500 cyclists were in the ambush and another
500 were seen approaching. At this moment
the bridge was blown and fire opened. Some
400/500 of the enemy were killed before the
company withdrew More would have been
killed had not the enemy cut the artiliery tele-
phone line.

By 1000 hrs. the following morning the
enemy were in contact with the main battalion
position Attack and counter-attack went on
throughout the day in the course of which more
of the enemy troops were killed and 8 or 9
tanks destroyed. Our own losses were under
7o. During the night the battalion fell back
on to the main position.

The R.AF. co-operated gallantly in this
action. A scratch force—all that was available
—of Glen Martins, Wirraways, Vildebeeste
and Buffalos attacked enemy columns
‘approaching Gemas and headquarters at
Tampin and did some damage.

SUPPLEMENT 10 tHe LONDON’ GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

The ambush of Gemas provides an excellent
example of the success that will often attend
such tactics in jungle country. But fresh and
reasonably well trained troops are required and
these in the Malayan campaign were seldom
available.

348. The Battle of Muar.—The town of Muar
(Bandar Maharani on some maps) is situated
on the south bank of the Muar River a short
distance from its mouth. The River Muar is
here about 600 yards wide and 1s unbridged
below the main North/South trunk road. In
its long course between the main road and the
sea the river is extremely tortuous, especially
in its lower reaches in which it winds through
low-lying and swampy country. Along the
south bank of the river for some 20 miles inland
from Muar there stretches a belt of estates with
fairly numerous roads and tracks.

The defence of this sector was entrusted to
the newly arrived 45 Indian Infantry Bngade,
to which was attached a battery of Australian
field artillery. The Brigade was disposed with
two battalions forward on the line of the river,
one between the sea and Jorak and the other
between Jorak and Lenga, and one battalion
in reserve in the Bakri area with patrols watch-
ing the coast at Parit Jawa. The plan en-
visaged a mobile defence using fighting patrols
to attack the enemy. Unfortunately each of
the forward battalions was ordered to push for-
ward two companies north of the river to harass
and delay the enemy. In view of the weakness
of the force available this was undoubtedly a
tactical error which resulted in a great dis-
persion of force.

349. The enemy’s air offensive against Muar
started on the 11th January. The bombing of
the town, as in other places, started a general
exodus and among those who left were the
ferrymen, Nearly all the Asiatic employees of
the waterworks and power station also deserted.

350. By the morning of the 15th the enemy
had reached the north bank of the river, though
no information of their approach had ‘been re-
ceived from the forward troops. In the after-
noon a number of boats were seen off the mouth
of the River Muar and a small party landed
on the coast between Muar and Batu Pahat
Early the following morning another small force
landed at the lighthouse west of Batu Pahat
where it was engaged by our troops.

35x. In order to meet this threat to Westforce
communications the boundary between West-
force and 3 Indian Corps was amended to read
as follows:—

“all inclusive 3 Indian Corps Road
Kluang—Ayer Hitam—Yong Peng—Batu
Pahat ’’ “

thus making the task of protecting Westforce
communications the responsibility of the Com-
mander 3 Indian Corps.

At 1655 hrs. on the 16th January after visiting
commanders in the forward area, I placed the
53 British Infantry Brigade under orders of
the Commander 3 Indian! Corpstand ordered
it to move during the following."hight to the
Ayer Hitam area. The Commander 3 Indian
Corps placed this brigade under the 11 Indian
Division. One battalion (6 R. Norfolk) was
immediately sent to hold the defile East of
Bukit Payong, a dominating feature some I
miles west 6f Yong*Peng, with a detachment at
Parit Sulong Bridge some 5 miles further on.
