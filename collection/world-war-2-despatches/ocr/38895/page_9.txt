SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 28 APRIL, 1950

20. The immunity from air attack was as
surprising as it was satisfactory and consider-
ably greater than I had been led to expect. Our
ships were not attacked until 1015/10th July,
when a raid was made on the ships at Acm.
On subsequent days there were intermittent air
attacks, principally on the east coast, and an
increasing number at night. It was fortunate
that more damage was not done by these
attacks ; only three M.T. ships and one hospital
ship were sunk by them. The hospital ship
TALAMBA was deliberately attacked and
sunk and the ABA and DORSETSHIRE were
also attacked whilst lying over five miles to
seaward fully illuminated. It is regretted that
the orders regarding ‘the conduct of hospital
ships were not sufficiently clear; it had always
been my intention that if hospital ships had
to remain off the beaches at night they should
remain darkened and in the fleet anchorage,
and that normally full illumination would only
be switched on when five miles clear of the
beaches and on passage to or from the assault
area. It is clear that the illumination of
hospital ships stopped offshore provides the
enemy with a temptation to. attack that is
too great to resist and, in consequence, after
the TALAMBA incident hospital ships were
kept in the arichorages all night without lights.
This procedure is recommended for future
occasions.

21. Syracuse was occupied at 2100/10th
July, the port peey entered during the fore-
noon of 11th July and the D+3 personnel con-
voy arrived there according to plan on 13th
July : unloading all twelve ships and sailing
them again at 1800 the same day was a notable
achievement. Attempts were made to enter
Augusta which was reported as having been
evacuated at 0500 on 12th July but on her way
to do so ESKIMO with Naval Commander
Force “A” onboard was damaged in an air
attack. Later in the day other ships of Force
“A” again entered Augusta, and I myself
went in in the evening in BROCKLESBY with
Naval Commander Force “A”. At this time
the enemy on the outskirts of the town com-
menced to shell our ships intermittently with
field guns and we had to clear out. I strongly
support the recommendation of Naval Com-
mander Force “ A” that the foremost elements
of the army should have some means of notify-
ing their positions to supporting warships, as
on this occasion we saw a large amount of
M.T. which we thought belonged to the Eighth
Army but which in fact belonged to the enemy.
In consequence we missed an excellent and
easy target.

22. In accordance with my instructions
Naval Commander Force “V” took over the
Barx sectors on 13th July in order that Naval
Commander Force “B” could proceed to
Syracuse to take over the duties of Flag Officer
Sicily. On visiting that port on 15th July
I found a certain amount of confusion existing
in the naval organisation which was absorbing
the attention of Rear-Admiral McGrigor, to
the detriment of the performance of his
functions as Flag Officer Sicily. As I was
anxious that he should proceed to and carry
out these functions in Augusta without further

delay, and as I deemed it advisable that a

naval officer of standing should be temporarily
present in Syracuse to supervise, the Naval
Officer-in-Charge and put matters right, I

directed Naval Commander Force “A” to
proceed there forthwith and Flag Officer Sicily
to carry on to Augusta.

23. A larger number of L.S.T. and major

landing craft was found to be serviceable on
D-1 than had been anticipated, and as a
result it was possible to commence loading
the first flight of the ferry service before ships
and craft which had been engaged in the
assaults had returned. The Eighth Army plan
was to clear the high priority vehicles and
stores from Malta before working craft in any
numbers from Sousse and ipo and in the
first seven days 56 L.S.T., 36 L.C.T. and 33
L.CI.(L) cleared loaded from Malta. Some
initial difficulty was experienced over the con-
trol of the Ferry Service, as the Military Move-
ments organisation set up in Malta did not
appear adequate to meet the demands made
upon it, but after'a shaky start things went
much better, and the planned programme was
finally completed earlier than anticipated.
*. 24. It was decided, both to reduce signalling
and to avoid delays to sailings, that the short
passage between Malta and Sicily should be
made by L.S.T. and major landing craft en-
gaged in the ferry service without making
any sailing signals. The organisation of a
convoy was often only completed immediately
before it sailed, and I am satisfied that this
apparently casual method was fully justified
in order to continue the build-up of the army
as fast as possible. As far as I know there
was only one mishap; WALLACE engaged
an L.C.L(L) on the night of 12th/13th July,
but happily only one rating was wounded. It
would not have been possible to continue to
sail these landing craft convoys in this manner,
unescorted or only lightly escorted as they
were, had the weather not remained calm after
D day, and had there not been an increasing
period of moonlight. Although the first
quarter of the moon at first sight appeared
unfavourable for landing operations from the
naval aspect, in the event it proved greatly
to our advantage against a weak enemy and
with our possession of great air superiority.

25. Major landing craft seemed to keep run-
ning very well during the first few days of
the operation, but my flag was struck at about
the time when I imagine that defects were
beginning to accumulate. It must always
remain a difficult decision in future operations
as to when to withdraw a proportion of land-
ing craft for essential maintenance as the need
for this must be balanced against the vital
requirement of following up the initial blow
as expeditiously as possible.

26. It is greatly regretted that a number of
our troop-carrying aircraft were shot down
by our ships off the east coast on 13th July.
The question of the rules for the engagement
of aircraft off the beaches was always a vexed
one during planning, and the orders were twice
altered by agreement with the RAF. As
finally framed, ships were free to open fire at
night at aircraft whose approach indicated
hostile intent, and it was stated that if friendly
airoraft had to fly over our convoys they
would do so above 6,000 feet. All troop-
carrying aircraft were routed in Janes to avoid
our convoys on the night of D-1/D, but for
the second airborne attack on D+3, they flew
low over the Gulf of Noto. It is understood
that Mediterranean Air Command had
