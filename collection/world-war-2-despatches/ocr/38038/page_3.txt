SUPPLEMENT 1o raz LONDON GAZETTE,-7 AUGUST, 1047

support, as I wished C.S.10 to have destroyers
with him. C.S.1o altered course to 270 at
0712, in order to approach the convoy from the
southward and avoid, in the event of action,
steaming into the strong south westerly wind
and heavy seas. At 0815 after receiving the
position, course and speed of the convoy from
D.17, the course of Force 1 was adjusted to
305 and speed increased to 24 knots.

First Contact WITH THE ENEMY BY
Force 1.

23. At 0840 BELFAST’S radar picked up
the enemy at 35,000 yards, bearing 295, when
in an estimated position 73° 35’ N. 23° 21’E.;
at this time C.S.10 expected the convoy to bear
287, 48 miles. At the same time D.17 esti-
mated that the enemy’s position was about
36 miles bearing 125 from the convoy.

24. In BELFAST the range of the main
echo shortened rapidly and at ogoo a second
echo was obtained bearing 299 at 24,500 yards.
This second echo remained on a steady bearing
and was held until 0930 when, from its esti-
mated speed of 8-10 knots, C.S.10 considered
that it was probably a merchant ship from
the convoy and disregarded it. It may well,
however, have been one of the enemy
destroyers, detached to shadow the convoy,
which are mentioned in paragraph 30 below.

25. At 0915, by which time Force 1 was
formed on a line of bearing 180 the main echo
bore 250 at 13,000 yards, speed approximately
18 knots. Force 1 altered to a line of bearing
160 and at 0921 SHEFEIELD reported enemy
in sight bearing 222, range 13,000 yards.

26, At 0924 BELFAST opened fire with star-
shell and five minutes later Force 1 was ordered
to engage with main armament. At 0930 Force
1 altered to 265 and NORFOLK opened fire at
a range of 9,800 yards but had to drop back
to clear BELFAST’S range. At 0938 Force 1
altered to 105 and at 0946 to 170 by which
time the range had opened to 24,000 yards and
the enemy had altered course, to 150 steaming
at about 30 knots.

27. NORFOLK alone of Force 1 continued
firing until about 0940. She claimed one hit
with her second or third salvo and this has
since been confirmed by prisoners as a hit either
in the crow’s nest or the bridge port director
which caused several casualties. Other
observers consider that she scored a further hit
on the forecastle without doing very much
damage but prisoners have not yet confirmed
this. The 6-inch cruisers did not open fire
during this phase of the action and the enemy
may at this time have been deceived as to the
number of cruisers in Force 1 and thus made
a second attempt to attack the convoy. From
prisoners’ statements, however, it seems that
SCHARNHORST had been expecting to engage
two or three cruisers.

28. After NORFOLK ceased firing Force 1
pursued the enemy to the southward but the
Tange continued to open with the enemy’s
speed at 30 knots. At 0955 the enemy altered
course to the north east and C.S.ro0 at once
appreciated that he was trying to work round
to the northward of the convoy and attack
again. Possibly this was the result of an exhor-
tation from Admiral Doenitz which appears to

3705

have been received and read to the ship’s
company at about this time. In the prevailing
weather conditons, with wind force 7-8 from
the south west, Force 1’s maximum speed was
24 knots and as that of the enemy was esti-
mated at 28 to 30 knots C.S.10 decided that
Force 1 must get between SCHARNHORST
and the convoy. Force 1 therefore altered
course to 305 at 1000 and to 325 at 1014. Six
minutes later contact with the enemy was lost
when he was bearing 078 at 36,000 yards and
steering to the north east at about 28 knots.

29. During this engagement the convoy was
turned to the northward by D.17 on my instruc-
tions at 0930; it remained on that course until
1030 when, realising that C.S.ro had lost touch
with the enemy and was closing the convoy, I
ordered D.17 to turn it back to 045. C.S.10
had previously asked for six destroyers to be
detached to Force 1 but D.17 received my signal
timed 0937 (ordering only four to join Force 1)
before th were detached and_ so
MUSKETEER, MATCHLESS, OPPORTUNE
and VIRAGO (36th Division) left the convoy to
join C.S.r0 at 0951.

*30. Throughout this first engagement I had
appreciated that enemy destroyers might be in
company with SCHARNHORST. In fact no
visual contact with them was reported by any
of our forces throughout the whole operation,
though many unidentified destroyer radar
echoes persisted during the day. From
prisoners’ reports, however, there seems little-
doubt that SCHARNHORST had _ three
destroyers in company with her and that before
Force 1 first made contact these destroyers had
been sent ahead to shadow, report and if possi-
ble attack J.W.55B. Prisoners also state that
the destroyers did-make contact with the convoy
and signalled that they had done so by Very
lights before Force x engaged. If this is so
neither the destroyers nor the Very lights
were seen by the convoy escorts who reported
nothing unusual until they sighted BELFAST’S
starshell at 0925. It may well be that when
SCHARNHORST was engaged these destroyers
withdrew from the convoy either to assist her
or to make good their escape.

SECOND ENGAGEMENT WITH THE ENEMY BY
Force I.

31. Force 1 closed the convoy and was
joined at 1024 by the 36th Division. At 1045
Force 1 passed through position 73° 49’ N.
ar° 58’ E. and five minutes later made radar
contact with the convoy bearing 324 at 28,000
yards. The cruisers commenced zig-zagging
Io miles ahead of it with the 36th Division
disposed ahead of Force x as a screen.

32. At this time I appreciated that Force 2
would have little chance of finding the enemy
unless some unit regained touch with him and
shadowed. I informed C.S.1o of this at 1058
but as weather conditions gave the enemy an
advantage of 4-6 knots in speed he rightly con-
sidered it undesirable to split his force by
detaching one or more ships to search, feeling
confident that the enemy would return to the
convoy from the north or north east.

* Admiralty footnote:—It is known that the three
destroyers at sea with SCHARNHORST were detached
early on the day of the action to seek and attack
the J.W. Convoy and that thereafter they did tut
rejoin her,
