the withdrawal of R.A.F. fighter protection for
the air transports—a protection which had been
maintained consistently from the beginning of
the Allied advance through Burma after
Imphal in 1944, and had involved fighter cover
over a front extending many hundreds of miles.

81. When Fourteenth Army marched a
thousand miles through Burma in six months
they achieved a great military feat in a country
which had been deemed hitherto to be almost
physically impassable and medically disastrous
for the mass movement of men. ‘With that
Army, the Air Forces went every mile of the
way—scouting, supporting, reinforcing, supply-
ing, evacuating wounded and striking ahead
of the advancing troops, to disrupt Japanese
lines of communication and supply bases.

82. The same air-ground co-operation which
brought about the fall of Rangoon and the
re-conquest of Burma would have been re-
peated on a grand scale for the assault planned
on Malaya—forestalled only by Japanese
surrender. Even then the flexibility of Air
Power was such that, in the emergency which
followed the cessation of hostilities, it was able
to re-direct its energies in one of the greatest
relief and liberation operations of World
War IL,

South East Asia, air superiority is of para-
mount importance, and an indispensable factor
upon which maintenance and supply of all
our Forces in the Theatre depended.

TacricaL AIR OPERATIONS.
After Rangoon.

84, When the Japanese pulled out of Ran-
goon, and the remnants of the main army
succeeded in reaching Moulmein after the dis-
astrous retreat down the Central Corridor in
April, hostilities in Burma were by no means
over, -

85. There was no question of the enemy’s
capacity to stage a serious comeback ; his sup-

lines were no longer reliable and the
Japanese Air Force was out of the race.

86. But there was one aspect of the cam-
ipaign which was not yet complete and one
which began to assume greater importance now
that the Allied Forces had established them-
selves firmly in Southern Burma and Rangoon.
It was the presence of the large isolated
forces of Japanese troops in Central and North
Burma, estimated at over 50,000 men. While
the Allied advance down the Central Corridor
during March and April had driven a
wedge through a crumbling enemy defence, it
had, at the same time, forced a considerable
strength of Japanese troops into the hill
regions of Eastern and ‘Western Burma, iso-
lating them from the main Japanese army as
it retreated on Moulmein.

87. The Air Forces, principally those of No.
221 Group, and the Allied ground forces
deployed in Southern Burma, swung round to
face these large concentrations of Japanese
troops in the north between the Irrawaddy and
‘the Mandalay railway corridor in Central
Burma and the railway corridor and the
Sittang and Salween Rivers to the east. Their
object was to close the principal escape routes
which these Japanese forces must pass through
to get out of Burma.

_ 88. Few factors sustain the morale of fight-
ing men more than the knowledge that supplies
of provisions and equipment are assured. The
isolated Japanese forces in Burma, however,
as the result of disruption and disorganisation
of their rear lines of communication, were ill-
equipped, and certainly denied any possibility
of supply by air. They suffered considerably
through shortages of food, also medical sup-
plies, and took to eating attractive looking
but dangerous fruits.

89. So long as these trapped Japanese
forces remained on Burmese soil, however,
they required considerable effort from the air
to watch their movement and to destroy them
as opportunity arose,

The Competitive Spirit of Squadrons.

90. The task of hunting and destroying these
isolated, pockets of Japanese forces, in co-
operation with the Allied ground troops, fell
largely upon the squadrons of No. 221 Group,
since No. 224 Group, after its fine record of
achievement in Burma, was now in the pro-
cess of pulling out for training and re-equip-
ment in Southern India prior to the assault on
Malaya.

91. The competitive spirit among squadrons
soon produced keen offensive patrols in seek-
ing out the enemy with Mosquitos, Beau-
fighters, Hurricanes, Spitfires and Thunderbolts
covering wide areas of country—in spite of
Monsoon weather—and succeeding in driving
parties of Japanese troops off the main escape
routes and forcing them to seek the cover of
jungle or scrub.

92. In this offensive drive by the squadrons
during May and June, a total of 4,813 sorties
was flown by our aircraft in monsoon weather
to bomb and strafe the enemy.

93. It was during this period that a return |
was made to jungle warfare in Burma, as grim
and fierce as anything experienced by the air
and ground forces during previous months.
The air forces faced the considerable hazards
of monsoon flying conditions as they attacked
enemy troop. concentrations attempting to re-
group and reach appointed regrouping areas.

‘94, The effectiveness of these R.A.F. jungle
strikes was not only substantiated in apprecia-
tive messages by the Army, but also by
Japanese officer prisoners-of-war captured at
this period. Of the air forces operating
against them, a Japanese officer, a L/Cpl., and
a Superior Private had said during interroga-
tion: —

“Dawn found us heading towards a village
on the opposite shore. Later, we found that
it was near Mumbu. We cooked some rice
and afterwards all went to sleep in a bamboo
clump on the bend of the river. Sleep, how-
ever, was not so easy, for the enemy "planes
were roaring overhead, and we would awake
in a cold sweat in the midst of a horrible
nightmare.”

95. There could be no doubt that the enemy
had a healthy respect for our British Air Force
and sought the cover of undergrowth when
surprised by our fighters, which strafed them
incessantly. A Japanese Private of the 82nd
Air Field Battalion, captured in Burma, when
shown a collection of silhouettes of Allied
aircraft, picked out the Spitfire as the aircraft
most feared by the Japanese.
