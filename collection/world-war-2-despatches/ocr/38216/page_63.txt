SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

Reserves.

667. Reserves of aircrews and aircraft were
inadequate; even the first casualties cou:d not
be fully replaced. Spare parts, for engines, air-
frames, armament, and M.T. in particular were
short. Squadron strengths consequently ‘be-
came abnormally low at the outset and re-
mained so.

The need for adequate reserves in a theatre
of war cannot be over-emphasised. Unfor-
tunately it had been impossible to build up
reserves in Malaya because supplies had been
absorbed in supplying critical theatres im
Europe, particular.y in the Middle East and
Russia.

“Morale.

668. As perhaps is liable to happen when a
force 1s confronted by an unexpectedly superior
enemy, there was a loss of morale by a small
section of the Command in the early days of
the war. Trials had been severe, and had
come before those concerned had had time to
adjust themselves to their unpleasant and un-
foreseen circumstances. Lack of sufficient ex-
perienced officers undoubtedly contributed to
the trouble, many of whom were newly com-
missioned and were not versed in ‘their respon-
sibitities.

Such incidents| were few, and should not be
exaggerated. But they serve to emphasise the
need for giving all ranks that vital training
which alone enables inexperienced troops to
withstand their first novel shock of war. Such
incidents also serve to enhance the credit of
those who did maintain their morale, and who
did their duty as was expected of them, and
they comprised the great bulk of the force.

Mobility.

669. Few units were properly organised for
mobile warfare. M.T. was very scarce and
there were no transport aircraft. Each move
involved appreciable interruption in operations,
caused loss of valuable equipment and subse-
quent reduction of efficiency. The lack of
transport aircraft was particularly felt when
squadrons had to be transferred from Malaya to
Sumatra, and thence later to Java: they suf-
fered considerable loss and disorganisation
during the enforced sea passage in the face of
the enemy and without naval cover, the pro-
vision of which was quite impossible at the
time.

670. Thelesson was demonstrated that ability
to take part in mobile operations, without loss
of operational efficiency, is dependent on cor-
rect organisation and provision of suitable
transport. A liberal scale of air transport is
essential in those cases where long distances,
sea crossings or other natural obstacles are
involved.

INCIDENTS DURING THE CAMPAIGN.

Air Reconnaissance of approaching Japanese
Convoy, 7th/8th December.

671. Contact with the Japanese expedition
at sea was lost on 6th December and was not
regained, except for a few ships sighted on the
afternoon of 7th December. Admittedly
weather conditions were bad in the Gulf of
Siam during this vital period. Nevertheless
only a small air reconnaissance effort was made
for re-establishing contact. No. 8 (R.A.A.F.)

1409

Squadron at Kuantan had to be directed to con-
tinue its initial réle of searching in an area far
to the south and eastward of the probable posi-
tion of the lost Japanese expedition for fear
of a still more dangerous but possible attack,
namely one directed against southern Malaya
where a successful landing, particu:arly on the
Endau/Mersing beaches, woud have been very
dangerous indeed. It is impossible to resist
the inference that reconnaissance dispositions
were strongly influenced by a conclusion at the
time that the lost Japanese expedition might
be proceeding against the Bangkok area of
Siam. It is easy to be wise after the event,
but ithe reconnaissance effort which was
directed into the Gulf of Siam appears to have
been small, bearing in mind its great area and
the possrble courses open to the Japanese con-
voys which were known to be in it.

Initial Action at Kota Bahru.

672. Only those who have given insufficient
thought to the matter could venture to criticise
the station commander at Kota Bahru for not
having launched his aircraft to the attack on
receipt of the news, at 0030 hours on 8th
December, 194r, that ships were lying off the
coast. It is equally easy to criticise the A.O.C.
for ordering away only a reconnaissance to
clear up the situation. But that both were
correct in doing as they did, in the circum-
stances which existed at that particular
moment, is beyond doubt. War had not broken
out: Pearl Harbour had not been attacked and
the U.S.A. was still neutral: there was grave
risk that the Japanese might stage a bait in
order to induce us to strike the first blow, and
by doing so reinforce that section of the
American Public which was then strongly op-
posed to America entering the war, a danger
against which all in Malaya had been warned
emphatically by G.H.Q. Admittedly 45
minutes were lost before the first air action was
taken, but it is merely academic to conjecture
what might have happened if it had been taken
at once.

Main Japanese
attacked.

673. It may fairly be asked why the initial
Japanese landing at Singora was not atiacked
on 8th December, as this was the best target
for our air striking force. The answer is that
it was not realised, until too late, that it was
in fact the enemy’s main effort, although
Singora had long been recognised as the arca
in which a Japanese expedition against Malaya
was likely to be landed. The enemy, moreover,
achieved a tactical-surprise because our air
reconnaissance failed to maintain contact with
the main Japanese convoy, which was not
found again until landings at Singora were well
under way. By the time that tthe situation was
fully realised, all our available aircraft had
been launched against the Kota Bahru sub-
sidiary attack. Before their objective could be
changed to Singora, our own aerodromes in
Northern Malaya were undergoing so heavy a5
scale of air attack that another effective force
for opposing the Singora landing could not be
Jaunched from them.

Attempt to Neutralise Enemy Air Bases.

674. As soon as our Squadrons had been
driven out of the aerodromes in Northern
Malaya, our army was in tum subjected to
