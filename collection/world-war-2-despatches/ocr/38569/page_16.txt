46. I went into Oran for an unofficial look
at the port, which was now in charge of Rear-
Admiral Bennett, U.S. Navy. The Americans
had already cleared a passage through the
blocked entrance sufficient to admit a freighter
of average size, and a part of the follow-up
convoy, which had been sent round under es-
cort from Arzeu, was already in harbour or
waiting off the entrance to berth.

47. A number of personnel ships and supply
ships of the original convoy which had com-
pleted unloading at Arzeu were sailed es-
corted for Gibraltar in the evening. AURORA
also sailed.

Friday, 13th November.

48. Further ships of the follow-up convoy
went round to Oran and JAMAICA sailed ‘for
Gibraltar. §.S. BROWNING was sunk on her
way to Oran, presumably by torpedo, though
no track was seen and the escorts gained no
contact. The ship was laden with T.N.T. and
motor transport and it is not impossible that
the explosion was internal. Witnesses saw no
column of water usually associated with an

external explosion. The ship was sunk well
outside the 100 fathom line.

Saturday, 14th November.

49. All ships, save one which had a broken:
derrick, having now completed unloading at
Arzeu, I collected them into three convoys and
picking up the ships off X and Y Beaches and
escorted by all available craft, sailed for
Gibraltar, where they arrived safely the next
and following days.

The ZEBULON B. VANCE with the broken
derrick was sent round with the four last re-
maining ships of the follow-up convoy to Oran
to unload.

50. Thus the forty-seven ships which had
taken the resources of a number of British
ports and three weeks to load were unloaded
for the most part over beaches inside a week.
Under the weather conditions prevailing, I
much doubt whether the work could have been
greatly bettered.

51. On Monday, the Centre Naval Task
Force ceased to exist. At sunset I struck my
broad pendant in LARGS. - 2
