            "description": "On 18th October what appeared to be serious opposition was encotrtered at Andriamanalina. 1/6 (Tanganyika) King’s African Rifles made a twenty-four hour march, all on foot without any form of transport, to the rear of the enemy. sth (Kenya) King’s African Rifles moved similarly, but a shorter distance, to one flank. At dawn on 19th October these two battalions, with perfect timing and good execution, attacked, supported by fire from 2oth Field Battery R.A. of oth Field Regiment, and by 56th (Uganda) Field Battery, East African Artillery, the whole under command of Brigadier W. A. Dimoline, O.B.E., M.C. Seven hundred prisoners, two 75 mm. guns, one zo mm. A.A. gun, 7 mortars and 16 heavy machine-guns were captured. Such was the effect of the artillery fire, and the attack from unexpected directions, that we suffered no casualties.",

            "title": "\"Strategic Bombing Plans Unveiled: Five Targets Near The Hague Identified for Precision Strikes\"",
            "description": "202. -In the meantime my staff had been making a close study of the intelligence bearing on the disposition of the rocket-firing complex, and had selected five objectives at or near the Hague which seemed worth bombing. Three—the goods station and the railway yard of the main station at Leiden, and the suspected store near the Hotel Promenade at the Hague —were small targets situated close to built-up areas in places whose inhabitants were welldisposed to us and were, indeed, our Allies. On the information I had at the time, these targets seemed eminently suited to the kind of precise attack in which the Mosquito bombers of No. 2 Group specialised. Accordingly we asked that Group to attack them.* ‘The other’ two—the first consisting of living quarters and storage areas at Bloemendaal, and the second of the storage site at Raaphorst, which was credibly reported to be in use again—were larger and stood in more open situations. We therefore suggested them to Bomber Command as targets for a less precise form of attack. Further enquiry cast some doubt on the validity of our most recent information about Raaphorst, and on the 19th October we withdrew that target from Bomber Command’s list, thus leaving them with Bloemendaal as their sole “‘ Big Ben ’’ objective.t .",

Possession of Route 67 would be of the greatest importance for improving communications between the two Armies. The Poles made good progress in the mountains. Galeata, commanding the upper Bidente valley, fell on 19th October and Strada, in the valley of the Rabbi, on the 2zst; here the enemy showed signs of an intention to resist more strongly.
