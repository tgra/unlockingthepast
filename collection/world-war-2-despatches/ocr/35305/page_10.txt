5908 SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1941

There were also deficiencies in technical
apparatus for light anti-aircraft requirements,
such as Kerrison Predictors, signal lights,
technical and specialised vehicles of many
types and a number of smaller items. The same
difficulties in provision of equipment were no
doubt the cause of delays in the despatch of new
units to the B.E.F., particularly armoured and
anti-aircraft units, and while it is to some extent
true that the shortness of the campaign pre-
vented the full effect of the shortages being felt,
it is I think, justifiable to assume that the
presence of the Armoured Division and of a
complete Army Tank Brigade would have been
an invaluable aid in the difficulties with which
we were faced in meeting enemy armoured
formations.

The Administrative Situation.

11. The development of the rearward installa-
tions had been proceeding systematically.

The medical base installations had been
extended and a hospital area was in course of
rapid development near Boulogne in addition
to the original medical base sub-area at Dieppe.

The British Army requirements in the port of
Brest, a French naval base, had been sub-
stantially reduced by the use of other ports
such as St. Malo and Caen; by May, seventeen
ports in all were being operated and 2,500 tons
of stores were being despatched to railheads
daily.

At the same time, the construction of semi-
permanent depéts of all kinds in the neighbour-
hood of Nantes, Rennes and Rouen was in
progress ; this would later on have led to more
efficient and economical working than was
possible in the temporary accommodation
taken up in September, 1939. By roth May,
seven ammunition depéts were open, in addition
to railhead dumps; all these were intended, in
time, to be rail served ; while the construction of
the regulating station at Abancourt, by French
railway troops on behalf of the B.E.F., was well
advanced. It opened on a limited scale in the
first week of May. A supply depét was being
constructed close by so as to relieve the
dangerous congestion at the ports of Rouen
and Havre.

The progress of all these undertakings was
adversely affected by the shortage of labour, to
which I referred in my first despatch, and it
was decided, in March, to send three Divisions
to France to undertake labour duties and
at the same time continue their training, albeit
slowly. The Divisions selected were 12th
iaifsr General R. L. Petre), 23rd (Major-

eral W. N. Herbert) and 46th (Major-
General H. O. Curtis). These arrived in April ;
23rd Division was allotted for work on aero-
dromes in the forward area, and the remaining
two to the Lines of Communication area.

Organisation.

12. The absence of actual operations up to
toth May gave opportunities to make a number
of changes in organisation.

Divisional cavairy regiments were grouped
into Armoured Reconnaissance Brigades and the
Lines of Communication area was re-organised
into two districts.

Infantry battalions were filled up to the new
and higher establishments, and action was
initiated to raise the establishment of artillery

units, including anti-aircraft. My Adjutant-
General’s branch, in conjunction with the
Adjutant-General’s branch at the War Office,
had in hand plans for the more economical use
of man-power, the elimination of fit men from
sedentary or base duties and the reduction of
tradesmen in War Establishments. Investiga-
tions made by the War Office, which had my
full co-operation, were directed towards a more
economical and more flexible system of replace-
ment and repair of vehicles and equipment in
the Force. :

The Royal Air Force.

13. On 15th January, 1940, Air Marshal A. S.
Barratt had assumed command of the British
Air Force in France, including the Air Com-
ponent which, however, was to remain under my
operational control. Under this arrangement,
in my opinion, the control of available air forces
was better allocated to meet the needs not only
of the British but also of the French Army for
whom considerable aerial reconnaissance was
being carried out. The development of the
Allied Central Air Bureau and of its communica-
tions to the headquarters of higher formations
in France and to the Royal Air Force at home,
was likewise to prove its worth in the days to
come as an organisation for co-ordinating
information and requests for air action.

At the same time I felt that the resources of
the Air Component would prove insufficient for
the requirements of the Force during operations ;
so long, therefore, as this state of affairs existed
it was of prime importance that the machinery
for obtaining the allotment of additional bomber
and fighter support should be as simple and as
swift in operation as it could be made.

Throughout the period, construction of new
aerodromes, landing grounds and communica-
tions for the British Air Force in France was
proceeding as fast as resources would permit,
concrete runways being constructed in the
early part of the year until the season allowed
for the sowing of grass. Upwards of 10,000 men
were employed on this work, and forty-seven
aerodromes and satellites (including 19 new
aerodromes} were under development or con-
struction. By 15th May eight of the nineteen
new aerodromes were capable of use, and at
least 50,000 tons of concrete had been laid.
Constructional work was also undertaken on
behalf of the Air Ministry at other R.A.F.
installations in central France.

The Dyle and Escaut Plans.

14. Very shortly after the arrival of the B.E.F.
in their positions on the Belgian frontier I had
been, invited by General Georges, commanding
the French Front of the North East, under
whose Command I was, to study the part to be
played by the B.E.F, in the event of an advance
into Holland and Belgium, or into Belgium
alone. The question of such an advance was
one of high policy with a political as well as a
military aspect ; it was therefore not for me to
comment on it. My responsibilities were con-
fined to ensuring that the orders issued by the
French for the employment of the British
Expeditionary Force were capable of being
carried out ; and indeed events proved that the
orders issued for this operation were well within
the capacity of the Force.

The subject presented difficulties greatly
eorepinated by the policy of neutrality to which
