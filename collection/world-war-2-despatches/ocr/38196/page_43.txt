SUPPLEMENT ro tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 5 FEBRUARY, 1948

Further east 1 Division advanced along the
long range overlooking the Oued et Tine valley
on the northern side.

On 27th Apml General Bradley relieved
General Patton in command of II Corps and
the latter went to take command of the Seventh
Army which he was to lead in the invasion of
Sicily. General Patton had produced, during
his period of command, what I might almost
call a transformation in the troops of II Corps
By his influence they had recovered from the
natural depression caused by the early set-
backs, they had absorbed with great rapidity
the benefits of the intensive training to which
they had been subjected and were now showing
in hard mountain fighting that they had added
the skill of the trained soldier to those excel-
lent natural qualities which had been previously
in part obscured by inexperience. General
Patton was to score other triumphs in the
Mediterranean and in North-west Europe but
I think this not the least of his achievements.
General Bradley had been attached to IT Corps
Headquarters and General Eisenhower now
thought that this would be a good time to give
him experience of actual command in opera-
tions before commanding a Corps in Sicily.

The attack by 9 Division on the northern-
most road progressed rather more slowly. The
enemy positions at Jefna were particularly
strong and ‘before they could be grappled with
there were many outlying positions, on the
hills either side of the road, which had to be
cleared. Manteuffel’s parachutists fought as
well as usual and by 2nd May we were still
held up at the immediate approaches to Jefna,
though to the north we had outflanked it by
some three miles. Heavy fighting continued
on 1 Infantry Division front both on Gebel
Sidi Meftah and to the north of it but in anti-
cipation of its fall IE Corps were now bringing
up x Armoured Division to operate on the ex-
treme right of the Corps in the valley of the
Qued et Tine. This valley leads direct to
Mateur; no road follows it but it is practicable
for armour once the left flank is freed by secur-
ing Gebel Sidi Meftah. 78 Division to the
east of the Oued had gained ground north of
Gebel Ahmera and north-east of Heidous. On
30th April 34 Division scored its most note-
worthy success with the capture of Gebel
Tahent (Point 609). This commanding dome-
shaped hill, east-north-east of Sidi Nsir, was
defended by parachutists from the Barenthin
Regiment, perhaps the best German troops in
Africa. :

The Final Offensive.

‘By 29th April I had decided that it was
necessary to reinforce First Army again and
change the point of attack further to the north.
The heavy pressure which we had been bring-
ing to -bear since the 22nd had gained us a
foothold at the entrance to the plain of Tunis
and had stretched the enemy’s powers of resis-
tance almost to breaking point, but if I was to
finish the campaign quickly, to fit in with the
time-table for Sicily, a sudden powerful stroke
was necessary. The events of the past week
had shown that Eighth Army was unable to
make any vital contribution by attacks on
their front; indeed, in spite of the pressure they
had kept up, the enemy had found himself
able to withdraw ali his armour from the
southern front. I therefore ordered General
Montgomery on 30th April to despatch at
once to First Army the best formations he
could spare to reinforce the main blow from

88x

Medjez. He nominated 7 Armoured Division,
4 Indian Division and 2o0r Guards Brigade.
These were both the freshest and the most ex-
perienced formations in Eighth Army. They
were, indeed, the nucleus around which Eighth
Army had grown up, for in 1940 they made
up the whole of the Western Desert Force*.
It was particularly appropriate that the two
divisions which had won our first victory in
Africa, at Sidi Barrani, should be chosen for
the main role in our last victory, the battle of
Tunis.

I informéd General Anderson on the same
day of these proposed reinforcements and of
my pian for their employment. The operations
of 9 Corps, though falling short of their original
objective, had attracted enemy attention to the
southern part of the Goubellat plain. I in-
tended to keep his attention fixed there by re-
taining there x Armoured Division, reinforced
with a large concentration of dummy tanks and
transport, and to make my main blow straight
at Tunis along the Medjez-Massicault road.
For this I intended to employ, under command
of 9 Corps, two infantry and two armoured
divisions. They would be assisted in the initial
assault by the greatest weight of artillery that
could be made available and by a very heavy
air attack in the “‘ blitzkrieg’ style. I laid
all the emphasis in planning on speed and the
maintenance of the objective. The armoured
divisions were to move off behind the infantry
divisions simultaneously with them so that
there would be no delay or hesitation in push-
ing them through the infantry the moment a
break through was achieved. I insisted that
none of the divisions of 9 Corps should turn
aside to mop up isolated areas of resistance or
to attempt to roll up the enemy’s exposed
flanks but were to continue straight for Tunis,
ignoring any enemy to left or right. By this
means they would forestall the enemy on his
defences round Tunis and split his whole front
in half. If these instructions could be strictly
followed I felt confident of turning the German
“blitzkrieg ’’ technique on its inventors and
preventing an African “‘ Dunkirk ”’

This question of an enemy evacuation of
Tunisia naturally occupied a great deal of our
thoughts at the time and although our success
was in the event so rapid as to prevent any
attempt being made it is worth while giving a
brief study to the subject. From our point of
view it was vital to prevent any substantial
evacuation, both because of the psychological
value of complete annihilation and because a
reinforcement of Sicily by large numbers of
German troops would make our next task rftuch
more difficult. I was uncertain whether the
well-known German reluctance to abandon any
position, however : untenable, would work
against an evacuation; it now seems likely that
they would have attempied it had they been
given a chance. We were, however, by then
in a position to throw a naval and air blockade
round the Tunisian coast which, in spite of the
extensive minefields at sea, could be relied on to
let very little pass. In the worst case, assuming
the enemy was able to stabilize a firm bridge-
head position, it was calculated that it would
be theoretically possible to remove up to a
maximum of seventy thousand men; in the
event only just over six hundred got away and
these were nearly all sailors or dockworkers.

* 201 Guards Brigade was at that time num-
bered 22.
