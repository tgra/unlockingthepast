SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON

59: ist T.S. then continued the advance on
to Dessie and found 46 lorries and 6 medium
guns abandoned on the road; these evidently
having been cut off by enemy demolitions
which had been blown prematurely.

While work on the demolitions was proceed-
ing, enemy artillery fire opened from Dessie.
‘Our own artillery was brought into action and
the infantry were deployed into the hills to
engage enemy infantry now appearing on the
mountain tops.

60. However, soon after our medium artil-
lery opened fire, a deputation came from Dessie

* to discuss terms. Unconditional surrender was
demanded and given, and 1st T.S. moved for-
ward into the town in enemy transport, as its
own transport was stopped by a destroyed
bridge, the passage over which was not made
good until 30th April.

The garrison of Dessie consisted of 5,000
Italians and 3,000 native troops; the area was
full of guns, M.G., ammunition and war
material of all sorts, Altogether in the Com-
bolcia-Dessie engagement 52 guns were
captured.

The battle of the Combolcia Pass and the
capture of Dessie was a considerable victory.
It was evident from the defensive positions and
the number of guns captured that the Italians
were determined to make a strong resistance.
At Combolcia the positions were well ‘dug and
heavily wired, and Dessie itself was prepared
for all round defence, there being seventeen
localities, supported by seven forts and
rlumerous strong points. :

6r. On 30th April rst R.N.C. with supporting
arms continued the advance to the north, while
the remainder of the brigade continued to clear
up Dessie and patrol along the roads to Gondar
and Assab. On tst May 1st R.N.C. occupied
Waldia taking 200 prisoners, but a demolished
tunnel on the road held up further advance for
three days. In the meantime Campbell’s scouts
-were directed forward on to Alomata and
Quoram. On 5th May Alomata was occupied
and some prisoners including two Brigade Com-
manders were captured; but road blocks 8
miles to the north prevented a further advance
until 7th May. .

62. On 7th May the remainder of ist S.A.
Brigade Group, less one company of 1st
D.E.O.R. and some armoured cars, which were
left to ison Dessie, moved forward, and on
arrival at Alomata on 8th May I placed them
‘under command of Kaid for operations against
Amba Alagi from the south, which place was
then being attacked by him from the north.

C. Operations against Maraventano’s Column,
(4th April—2and May, 1941.)

63. On the 4th April the Italians evacuated
‘Debra Marcos. The garrison of Debra Marcos
had apparently received orders to withdraw to
Dessie, but the occupation of Addis Abeba by
‘our troops on 6th April deprived them of the
use of the only known motorable road between
Debra Marcos and Dessie. A column of some
14,000 including 7oo civilians, under the com-
mand of Colonel Maraventano withdrew across
the Blue Nile at Safartak and was pursued by
‘one weak company of the Frontier Battalion,
Sudan Defence Force, as far as Cuiu near
Ficche. On the 8th April this column was
located at Quoziam when they were effectively
bombed and machine-gunned by our aircraft.

GAZETTE, 10 JULY, 1946 3587

After further bombing on 23rd April Maraven-
tano abandoned his M.T. and took to the hills.
The Frontier Battalion Company which had
now been reinforced by portions of two Opera-
tional Centres and a platoon of the 2nd
Ethiopian Battalion (a total strength of 150 all
ranks) again took up the pursuit. Maraven-
tano’s column, although reduced by desertions
to about 8,000 combatants, made towards
Addis Dera presumably with the object of even-
tually reaching Dessie.

Dessie, however, fell on 26th April to the
1st S.A. Brigade and it then appeared likely
that Maraventano would surrender, but in spite
of being harassed by his pursuers, hampered
by the lack of transport and food, and bur-
dened with many sick and wounded, he stub-
bornly continued his arduous trek towards
Uorro Tlu where he apparently decided to
remain as he considered the country suitable
for defence and shelter, and food was available.
On 14th May, however, there were indications
that Maraventano was in on the move, this
time in the direction of Debre Sina (Agibar).
A small force was sent off at speed to take and
hold the fort at Uoghidi-which commanded. the
enemy line of retreat. This fort was success-
fully occupied and its Banda garrison joined
our forces. On 17th May our main force had
followed up and gained contact with the enemy
rearguard travelling over extremely difficult
country.

64. On 18th May the enemy column having
deployed on a plateau, Colonel O. C. Wingate,
DSO. Commander of the Sudan and patriot
forces, decided to attack wherever possible, and
proceeded to do so. These attacks were con-
tinued on the 19th and on the zoth, when the
Italians were seen to be withdrawing. Once
more a general advance of the patriot forces
was ordered. A running fight ensued, the
patriots fighting with great courage and inflict-
ing heavy casualties on the enemy.

Maraventano’s column, which had by now
been reduced to about 7,000, found their retreat
to Debre’ Sina cut off by our occupation of the
fort at Uoghidi and so deployed and took up a
defensive position in the Borena area. Oppos-
ing him were some 1,000 patriots with a further
500 patriots and 37 Sudanese in reserve, but
Maraventano still refused to surrender.

Finally, on 22nd May, after being told that
he would be attacked unceasingly, ventano
capitulated and his force was escorted back to
Ficche and handed over to the 11th (A) Divi-
sion. So ended what must have been for the
whole of his column an exhausting and
desperate flight through mountainous country
full of hostile Ethiopians.

D.—Internal Security ‘and Mopping Up
Operations in North East Somaliland.
(2oth April-2rst May, 1941.)

65. These operations, carried out in north-east
Somaliland, resulted in the clearing of that part
of the country of all Italian posts, the re-
establishment of British control in the Mijertein,
and the re-commissioning of the lighthouse of
Cape Guardafui, which the Commander-in-
Chief, East Indies, required.

66. On 2oth April, a column under the com-
mand of Major G. R. Musgrave, consisting of
a company of Aden G(R) troops and a section
of R.A.F. armoured cars, also from Aden, left
Burao in hired transport. Accompanying the
