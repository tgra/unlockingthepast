SUPPLEMENT: 10 tHe LONDON: GAZETTE, 26° FEBRUARY, 1948

106. Meanwhile, during the autumn, prepara-
tions were initiated for giving air support to the
Chinese, on the assumption that ihe next
Japanese move would probably be towards
Kunming. It was the intention to form an
International Air Force, consisting of R.A.F.
bombers and fighters and of an American
Volunteer Group undet Col. Chennault, to
operate in South China. Administrative
preparations were begun, petrol stocks were sent
to the Chinese airfields, and bombs and com-
ponents were prepared for despatch. Early in
November, 1941, an R.A.F. Commission was
sent from the Far East to investigate operational
conditions: it included several senior staff
officers of A.H.Q. and the station commander
of. Tengah, who were still away when the
Japanese landed in Malaya. The project was
no small commitment for A.H.Q., as G.H.Q.
had insufficient staff to undertake all the de-
tailed planning and administration which would
normally have been done at the level of the
higher command: much of this had necessarily
to be done by the staff of A.H.Q., which was
already insufficient: for dealing with its own
work (paras. 96-98).

CO-OPERATION WITH Navy.

107. A.H.Q, had -advocated a combined
Naval/Air Operations Room in Singapore to
co-ordinate and control the seaward air opera-
tions of the Command with the naval forces of
the Commander-in-Chief, China Station, but it
was decided that such co-operation would be
Better conducted on a G.H.Q./C-in-C. China
Station level. To ensure liaison, however, a
Naval liaison officer was attached to A.H.Q.,
for some months before war broke out: later a
Naval air-maintenance officer was added.

108. It was recognised that should a full scale
Eastern Fleet be based on Singapore, many de-
tailed ‘arrangements for liaison would become
necessary. But a full Eastern Fleet staff could
not be assembled. owing to a shortage of naval
officers; indeed, it was considered unwise to
assemble one in Singapore before the situation
cleared, namely until a fleet arrived in Singa~
pore and its future role could be estimated.

Five days after the outbreak of war, how-
ever, a staff of jumor Naval officers was pro-
vided for watchkeeping in the Army/Air Com-
bined Operations Room, a step made possible
when additional officers were thrown up by the
loss of H.M.S. Prince of Wales and Repulse.
They proved adequate for subsequent needs,
but had the Far Eastern Fleet remained in
being in Singapore it would have been neces-
sary to,strengtheh them in order to provide
the closé co-operation which would have been
then essential. : .

'

rog. Co-operation with the C.-in-G,, East
Indies was close, and.a Combined Opérations
Room had been established at Colombo. There
was real understanding ‘of the problem facing
the R.A.F., particularly the difficulty, owing to
shortage of flying boats, of assisting in the con-
trol of sea communications in the Indian Ocean..
There were never more thai two ‘Catalinas,
often only one, available in Ceylon for this
work.’

110. Invaluable memoranda about Naval/ Air
matters, obtained by G.H.Q. from Coastal
Command and other sources, were available at
A.H.Q. These were collated and revised to suit

1359

local conditions and a Far East Command hand-
book -was printed. It was issued in August,
Ig4i, to R.A.F, Units and Naval Commands
for guidance in carrying out all types of opera-
tions over the sea.

. CO-OPERATION WITH ARMY IN Maraya.

Close Support.

riz. Co-operation with the Army in Malaya
had not been highly developed or exercised in
the past. No. 21 Squadron, R.A.A.F., when
it was equipped with Wirraways, had been re-
garded in part as an A.C. Squadron, and had
carried out some limited exercises with troops:
in the field. The methods of co-operation which
had been practised. were, however, not in line
with recent developments in Europe and the
Middle East.

112. There was much material available at
A.H.Q. of the experience gained in other Com-
mands but, owing to lack of staff, the lessons
had not been digested. Active steps were taken
to remedy this, and instructions for the joint
information of Army and Air Force Units to
cover the operations of bombers in support of
troops were produced and issued in September,
1941, with the concurrence of the G.O.C.,
Malaya Command. Similarly, instructions were
compiled and issued for joint information to
cover the operations of fighter aircraft employed
on tactical reconnaissance.

113. Classes were started for training aircrews
in Army organisation and tactics. Each bomber
and fighter squadron in the Command was
affiliated to an Army formation and was allotted
so many flying hours per month for combined
training. But owing to lack of signals equip-
ment, communications were improvised and
primitive, which severely restricted the type ‘of
support which could be given. - .

Aerodrome Defence.

114. For some years before war broke out,
considerable difference of opinion had existed
between the Army-and the R.A.F. about the
siting of aerodromes on the peninsula of Malaya.

‘Until 1937 the army’s policy had always
been to have the East Coast undeveloped as
far as possible because insufficient forces were’
available to defend the long coast-lne. ,
* The need then.arose for aerodromes on the
peninsula well forward of the Naval base at
Singapore. Sites for them on the eastern side
of the mountainous backbone of the peninsula,
hitherto undeveloped, were. essential for two
reasons, Firstly to obtain maximum air range
over the sea to thé east, from which direction
the threat to Malaya was greatest. Secondly in
order to avoid the cloud-covered mountainous
backbone which, in those days, effectively pre-
vented aircraft based on aerodromes on the-west
side from opera‘ing over the sea on the east,
the thréatened, side. ~ :

Unfortunately there had been insufficient co-
opefation on the spot in Malaya between the
two’ interests involved, with the result that
some of the sites selected were tactically weak
to defend.. But in the Spring of 1941 the neces-
sary full co-operation was established between
the services on the spot, in this important
matter of selecting aerodfome sites. eis

115. However, those aerodromes that were”
located in' the Singapore-fortress area were well
sited for defence. They were, furthermore,

as
