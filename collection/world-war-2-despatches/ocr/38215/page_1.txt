FOREWORD

The preparation of this Despatch on the
Operations in Malaya which took place
between the 8th December, 1941, and the 15th
February, 1942, has been influenced by the fact
that since the conclusion of those operations a
gteat deal of literature has appeared on the sub-
ject. Statements have been made and opinions
expressed by writers, many of whom had but a
cursory knowledge of Malayan conditions or of
the factors which influenced decisions. Often
these statements and opinions have been based
on false or incomplete information. It has
therefore become necessary, in the interests
both of those who made the preparations for
the campaign and of those who took part in it,
that a full and comprehensive account should
be given both of the operations themselves and
of the events which led up to them. A know-
ledge of events in Malaya prior to the outbreak
of hostilities in the Far East is also essential for
a proper understanding of the conduct of the
operations because the initial dispositions for
the defence of Malaya were to a large extent
dictated by those events. The Despatch there-
fore is more detailed than would otherwise have
been the case.

2. The Malayan campaign had two novel
features (a) It was the first large-scale campaign
for a very long time to be fought within British
or British-protected termtory, and (b) It was
our first experience of a campaign fought with
modern weapons in jungle warfare conditions.
Many lessons were learned from this campaign
under both these headings and many more have
been learned since in other theatres of war. In

reading this Despatch 1t should be ‘borne in mind
that the knowledge which now exists was not
at that time available to those responsible for
the conduct of the operations, whose task it
was in consequence to attempt to solve many
new and novel problems.

3. The preparation of this Despatch after a
period of four years has naturally presented cer-
tain difficulties, especially as some of the rele-
vant documents were lost either by destruction
at the time of the capitulation of Singapore or
at sea or from other causes. Every possible
endeavour has, however, been made to ensure
accuracy by reference to such documents as are
in existence, to individuals, and by other
means In particular I have had the advantage
of being able to refer to such War Diaries as
reached Home safely and also to a very detailed
narrative of the operations compiled under my
instructions by the late Lt.-Col. F N.
Cobley, the Loyal Regiment, while a prisoner-
of-war in 1942 when memories were still fresh.

I believe, therefore, that the facts as pre-
sented are substantially correct.

PART I. THE PERIOD PRIOR TO THE
OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES WITH
JAPAN.

Section I.—TopoGraPHy AND CLIMATE.

1. Malaya is some 400 miles long as the crow
flies The length of the main road and the west
coast railway from Singapore to the Malaya-
Thailand frontier is approximately 600 miles.
The width of the country varies from about
200 miles in the widest part to about 60 miles
in the narrowest. Singapore Island lies at the
southern end of the peninsula and is separated
from it by the narrow Straits of Johore. Malaya
is bounded on all sides, except on the North, by
sea.
