1716 SUPPLEMENT to tas LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948

my appreciation. On the 20th January ABDA
Command (00186 of 20/1) informed the Air
Ministry that while the reinforcements asked
for were undoubtedly required, it was not
known whether they would have to be found
from the aircraft allotted to the South Pacific
theatre. The full position was asked before
agreement to allocate from the total pool was
possible—since the need in the Southern
Malayan theatre was more immediate than that
in Burma.

27. Proposals for immediate Fighter rein-
forcement.—On the and February the Deputy
Chief of the Air Staff telegraphed the Air
Ministry’s proposals for reinforcements for
Burma in the immediate future (Webber W.446
of 2/2). This approved an immediate rein-
forcement of 2 further Hurricane Squadrons,
bringing the programme to 6 Hurricane Squad-
rons in all, but assumed that we should be
able to re-equip 67 Squadron.with Hurricanes.
There were never enough Hurricanes to do
that. After the fall of Singapore on February
15th the Chiefs ot Staff diverted these 2 Squad-
Tons (30 and 261 Fighter Squadrons) to Ceylon.
Thus the total Fighter force actually available
throughout the air campaign in Burma was
reduced to 3 Hurricane Squadrons.

28. Initial Equipment of Hurricane Squad-
yons and the Hurricane Flow.—The inability
adequately to equip our Squadrons with Hurri-
canes and to maintain them during air action
had a serious effect on the air campaign. For
example, it led to a situation in which it was
only possible for 6 Hurricane II’s to take the
air against the first heavy attack on our air
base at Magwe on 21st March—and except for
x aircraft every Hurncane II in the Command
was present at Magwe on that day.

29. The requirement initially to equip 17,
135 and 136 and to re-equip 67 Squadron was
a total of 80 Hurricanes (i.e. 16 I.E. plus 4 1.R.
per Squadron). Additionally, a flow of at
least 24 per‘month was necessary to meet mini-
mum war wastage» Therefore over the cam-
paign which lasted three months, the total
requirement was at least 128. During this
period a considerable number of our Hurricanes
due for Burma were diverted to Singapore.
Thus of this total requirement only a pro-
portion arrived in Burma and of these a
number were obsolescent, worn-out Hurricane

’s.

30. Hurricane Effort—Consequently _ the
maximum number of Hurricanes reached in
action with the enemy was about 30 Hurricanes,
i.e, the equivalent of 2 instead of 4 Squadrons.
This strength, moreover, fell away rapidly due
to lack of reinforcing aircraft, proper opera-
tional facilities and absence of spares, and was
on 11th February 15 serviceable Hurricanes,
and on 5th March only 6.

31. Maintenance, Spares and Tool Situation,
—With the exception of 2 Hurricane ‘“ pack-
ups,’’ no spares for the Hurricane II’s arrived
in the country before the fall of Rangoon,
‘Consequently, aircraft: becoming unserviceable
for lack of small parts remained so unless
requirements could be provided from the
cannibalisation of other unserviceable aircraft.
There was a great shortage of tools and rotol
kits, while the lack of air screw- blades was
serious. Moreover, since the equipment of our

R.S.Us. and A.S.Ps. did not arrive before the
fall of Rangoon, there was no proper organisa-
tion for the repair and salvage of aurcraft..
This factor exercised a considerable influence
on our small fighter force and contributed
towards the critical shortage of serviceable
Hurricanes at Magwe on the 21st March.

32. A.V.G.  Maintenance.—The A.V.G.
Squadron at Rangoon usually had 2z P.qo ar-
craft of which about 15 would be serviceable.
Later in March this figure fell to 10 or 7. But
here again the shortage of replacement aircraft,
spares, and proper maintenance for the A.V.G.
reduced the effort available. The maintenance
crews of the A.V.G. did remarkable work
in maintaining their aircraft, often under
bombing attack. As the A.V. G. were short of
trained personnel, R.A.F. personnel were
attached to them.

33. Bombers.—As regards Bombers, the
D.C.A.Ss. telegram indicated that of the 7
Squadrons promised, we should only have 3
in the immediate future. This assumed that
Blenheims would be available to equip 60
Squadron. There were never enough Blenheims
to do that. The aircraft, personnel and
“ pack-up ” of 313 Squadron arrived in
January. and early February. The aircraft of
45 Squadron (Blenheim) also arrived but were
unaccompanied by personnel or ‘‘ pack-up.”’
There was a great shortage of tools and spares.
Additionally, the R.S.U. and A.S.P. orgamsa-
tion did not arrive in time. Consequently,
the average daily bomber effort of the combined
Blenheim force stood at about 6 aircraft a day.
Thus throughout the campaign, we had the
equivalent of one Bomber Squadron available
for operations instead of 7.

34. General Reconnaissance.—In respect of
G.R. aircraft, No. 4 Indian Flight equipped
with Wapiti and Audax aircraft arrived in
Burma at the end of December. This was later
replaced by No. 3 Indian Flight which was
armed with an I.E. of 4 Blenheim I’s. After
the fall of Singapore, 139 Squadron en route
for Java was held up in Burma and, equipped
with Hudsons commencing at 6 I.E., under-
took our G.R. requirements. There were no

‘personnel or Squadron equipment and_ the

Hudsons were maintained by No. 3 and No. 4
Indian Flights.

35. Army Co-operation.—2 Squadrons armed
with Lysanders, No. 1 Indian A.C. Squadron
and No. 28 A.C. Squadron, were made avail-
able for operations in Burma,

36. Constant requests were made for the re-
equipment of these Squadrons with modern
aircraft. The Mohawks, however, were not
available and the Lysanders were retained
until the Squadrons returned to India.

37. Indian Aiy Force.—The units of the
Indian Air Force referred to above proved their
war efficiency and gallantry on active service.
In addition to a number of tactical recon-
naissances, No. Indian Squadron’s Lysanders
provided 41 bomber sorties against enemy aero-
dromes and direct support targets. The
standard of accuracy achieved in bombing was
satisfactory. No Lysanders were shot down by
enemy fighters. ‘The G.R. aircraft and, in par-
ticular the Blenheim I’s of No. 3 Flight, carried
out a considerable number of reconnaissances
in the Preparis Channel and the Gulf of
Martaban
