on the broad Medjerda,river which breaks out
of the mountains at this point to flow into
the plain of Tunis through a defile commanded
on the west by the Gebel Ahmera, known to
our troops as ‘‘ Longstop ’’, and on the east
by the Gebel Bou Aoukaz. The bridge which
has replaced the ford carries the main road
from Tunis to the west. On 22nd Decenber,
as the first stage of a renewed assault on Tunis,
a successful attack was made on Gebel Ahmera.
At this point the rain, which had already
caused severe difficulties of movement, became
torrential for a period of three days. The
offensive had to be abandoned and on 25th
December the enemy recaptured Gebel
Ahmera,

This ended the attempt to take Tunis in a
tush and it was clear that we should have to
build up forces for a deliberate operation. It
was also clear that the enemy would be able to
build up faster than we could, for his liaes of
communication through Italy and Sicily were
much more reliable and shorter than ours from
the United Kingdom and United States and
from his ports of entry to the front they were
very short and over good roads in flat country.*
It was necessary, therefore, to go on [to the
defensive in the northern sector though General
Eisenhower considered the possibilities of
mounting an offensive by Umited States troops
against the southern Tunisian port of Sfax in
order to cut the hnes of supply to Rornmel’s
Panzer Army. This plan was abandoned in
January. The next two months were therefore
occupied in consolidating the northern sector
as far as possible with the limited means avail-
able and in beating off enemy attempts to get
round our southern flank. ;

The latter raised difficult problems of com-
mand. The area from Pont du Fahs sou/hward
along the mountain range of the Eastern Dor-
sale was held by the French troops of XIX
Corps, with some British and United States
detachments. Further south the United States
II Corps was assembling around Tebessa, with
detachments forward co-operating with the
French. As a result of General Giraud’s

refusal to place French troops under
the orders of a British commander, XIX
Corps had to come under a_ rather

indirect command from Allied Force Head-
quarters and for this reason II Corps also
remained under General Eisenhower. The
weakness of this arrangement was showa when
a German attack on the French in the Ousseltia
valley, at the northern hinge of the two Dor-
sale ranges, made dangerous progress and had
to be halted by the hasty diversion of British
and American troops from First Army and II
Corps. As a result General Anderson was
appointed by General Eisenhower on ist
January to “‘ co-ordinate ’’ the whole front and
on 24th January both XIX and II Corps were
placed directly under his command. At the
same time General Kuter, of the United States
Army Air Corps, was appointed to co-ordinate
all Allied air support under command of
General Spaatz then Deputy Commander-in-
Chief Allied Air: Forces.

Such, in brief, were the antecedents of the
situation that I found on arriving to assume

command in Tunisia. At the actual moment of
my arrival I was met by a serious crisis on my
southern flank where a battle had been raging
since 14th February. I was therefore flung
straight into a position where I had to give my
main attention to the needs of the tactical
situation, but I had already given much
thought to the strategy which it would be
necessary to pursue and was confident that,
when the immediate dangers had been averted,
and after a necessary period of complete re-
organization, I should be able to work out the
strategic answer to the problem of Tunisia on
the hnes made necessary by the nature of the
country and the strength and dispositions of the
opposing forces.

Tunisia 1s bounded politically on the west
by a frontier running almost due north and
south and therefore parallel to the sea which
bounds it on the east. The most important
part of this long north-south oblong is the
coastal plain, known as the Sahel, which 1s
generally flat and covered with olive groves.
In the north, however, the Algerian mountains.
send down long spurs which run east and west
towards the sea at Bizerta. West of Tunis they
leave a space for the fertile plain of the
Medjerda, after it has burst through the gap at
Medjez el Bab, but south of Medjez there is a
tangle of mountains to the west of the Goubellat
plain which culminate in the three massifs of
Gebel Mansour, Fkirine and Zaghouan. These
are a nodal point of a new system of relief;
from Gebel Zaghouan a series of mountains ex-
tends to the Gulf of Tunis in the north and to
the sea in the east, reaching, after a gap in the
Grombahan plain, up to the peninsula of Cape
Bon; from Gebel Fkirine spring two long ridges
trending south and south-west and known as
the Eastern and Western Dorsales

The Eastern Dorsale is a long, narrow ridge,
rising to between two and three thousand feet,
which extends almost due south as far as Mak-
nassy, where it meets an east—west chain
stretching from Gafsa, It is pierced by passes
at Pichon, Fondouk, Faid and Maknassy, it is.
only at these four points, therefore, that an
army advancing from the west can break into
the plain of central and southern Tunisia.
Round its southern end it is turned by a road
from Gafsa to Gabes but this too runs through
a difficult and very long mountain defile.
Further to the south lies the region of the
“‘Chotts ’’; these are very extensive salt
marshes which narrow the coastal plain to a gap
of only fifteen,miles. The town of Gabes lies
on the coast at the southern end of this gap.
South of the Gabes gap the flat country is split
by, the north-west to south-east line of the Mat-
mata mountains. To the east is cultivated
country, traversed by the main road to
Medenine and, eventually Tripoli; to the west
is desert, almost entirely waterless and unin-
habited. West of the Eastern Dorsale there is
another range interposed across the course of
an advance from the west This at its northerr
end is known as the Western Dorsale, which
runs south-west from Gebel Fkirine, and fades
out eventually north-west of Gafsa. The range
is pierced ‘by passes at Maktar, Sbiba,
Kasserine and Feriana; it is not so serious an
obstacle as the Eastern Dorsale In the south
the divergence of the two Dorsale ranges leaves
a wide plain, in parts semi-desert.

The coastal plain is well roaded and, in
general, north—south movement is easy. East—
