SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 7 JULY, 1948

16. It was fairly certain that the enemy had
at least one submarine operating directly with
him, and he had ample destroyers to inter-
pose between the convoy and my approach—
well advertised as I knew it would be.

I had therefore no hesitation in withdrawing
what remained of the striking force and order-
ing them to the pre-arranged rendezvous after
night actiom—Tanjong Priok.

“H.M.S. ELECTRA—Report oF ACTION 27TH
FEBRUARY, 1942, BY SENIOR SURVIVING
OFFICER.

No attempt is made in this narrative to plot
the course of action. It is assumed that better
details have been forwarded by the cruiser
force. Any courses, speeds or times are ap-
proximate as my action station was 0.0.Q.*
on the torpedo tubes.

2. At about 1520, Striking Force received an
enemy report that two cruisers and five
destroyers were 20 miles West of Bawean
Island. Striking Force was then inside
Sourabaya swept channel, but turned North-
wards. ELECTRA took station 4 miles ahead
of cruisers with JUPITER and ENCOUNTER
on port and starboard beam, 5 miles.

3. About 1600 enemy was sighted ahead on
the starboard bow and action was joined.
-ELECTRA appeared to be acting as flank
marking ship, and was engaged by the enemy
force at once; I assume that enemy destroyers
only were firing at us at a range of 14,000
yards, The first and second salvos were
straddles, anid correct for line, falling roughly
in line with the tubes. No hits were obtained
however. Enemy then turned go° to starboard
and we turned on parallel course. Salvos
continued to fall close, but missing astern, short
and over. This was undoubtedly due to the
magnificent handling of the ship by the
Captain; Commander C. W. May, R.N. About
1640 the enemy turned away to the North and
the Allied force gave chase. This left the
destroyers out of range for a while but the
cruisers carried on the action.

4° About 1700, we appeared to run into a
superior force and the Allied force turned 180°
to the Southward. From my position, the
enemy appeared to have at least two heavy
cruisers or battleships, and several cruisers or
destroyers. This is only a personal estimate,
and it is realised that from deck level, with
all the smoke and confusion of battle, that
this estimate may well be inaccurate.

5. About 1715, EXETER was hit. She
appeared to maintain speed but was having
trouble with steering. Destroyers then made
smoke. °

6. At 1730, ELECTRA was ordeted to
counter-attack. Smoke was very thick and
visibility in a very large area was reduced to
about half a mile, although it is probable that
the bridge personnel could see over the smoke.

As we cleared the smoke, an enemy unit con-
sisting of three heavy destroyers was sighted
on opposite courses going into the smoke.
Range about 6,000 yards. We immediately

engaged and claimed hits from four salvos on
the leading ship. ELECTRA did not fire
torpedoes. Conditions seemed fairly favourable
from the tubes, but as we were still in com-
munication with the bridge, I thought we ,were
going fot bigger game.

8. As the enemy unit disappeared into the
smoke, a lucky shell hit us in number 2 boiler
room, port side. This shattered the boiler and
carried away telemotor pipes from the steering
gear. Steam dropped and in spite of the efforts
of the engine room staff, steam was lost. This
was in a large measure due to the fact that
water ran from No. 3 boiler to the damaged one.
ELECTRA then stopped, with a slight list to
port, and the order was given ‘‘ Prepare to
abandon ship.”’

9 Shortly after, a single enemy heavy
destroyer emerged from the smoke. We
engaged immediately, the guns firing in local
control, as all communication with the bridge
was dead. A single fast destroyer is a pretty
poor target from a stopped ship, but it was
worth a chance. The enemy commenced
hitting with the second salvo, silencing our guns
one by one and causing heavy fires forward
and an increased list to port. With only Y gun
left firing, the order was given ‘‘ Abandon
ship.’’ The injured men were put in the first
whaler, the only boat left whole. The whaler
had about 25 men on board when it left the ship.
Nos. 4 and 5 Carley-floats were got away and
I saw another broken float drift by.

ro. Everybody appeared to have left the ship
that could do so, except Leading Steward
Gretton who came to ask what we should do
with two wounded on the quarterdeck. With
Gretton’s aid, I put them into the water, one
with a Kisbie lifebuoy, and the other with a
grating. Both appeared to be making for a
Carley-float.

11. The enemy was still firing, having closed
so that he could use his pom-poms. About this
time, a shell fell among the men in the water.
I then went round with Gretton, throwing

‘ floatable things in the water amongst them,

two ammunition boxes, smoke floats and a
T.S.D.S. float.

12. The ship then sighed, listed heavily to
port and down by the bows. There were no
live men left im the after part of the ship, so I
took Gretton and left.

13. Once clear of the ship, I saw someone,
presumably the Captain, come to the starboard
side of the bridge and wave to the men in the
water who cheered lustily. The Captain then
appeared to leave by the port side.

14. The ELECTRA then settled more
sleepily, turned over and slowly sank until her
screws and about six feet of the quarterdeck
were showing. :

15. She remained in this position for some
time before finally sinking slowly out of sight,
about 1800.

16. In the nature of things, casualties on
board were very high, The ELECTRA and
her ship’s company stood up to the punish-
ment in the best traditional manner. She was
a grand ship, and I am proud to have served
in her with such a fine crowd of men.
