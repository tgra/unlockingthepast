Ist and 2nd Corps were to withdraw on the -
night of 28th/2gth May to a horse-shoe position
on the line Proven—Poperinghe-Ypres—Bix-
schoote, with outposts on the line Ypres—
Godevaersvelde. The position of 3rd Corps was
more difficult and obscure. 2nd Division, now
reduced to less than the strength of an infantry
brigade, had fought hard and had sustained a
strong enemy tank attack. It was already in
process of withdrawing from the line and orders
were issued for it to fall back in the direction of
Beveren and Proven, prolonging the right flank
of rst Corps. 48th and 44th Divisions were in’
contact with the enemy on a front of over twenty
miles from Bergues through Cassel to Vieux
Berquin, in touch with the French 1st Light
Mechanised Division, west of the latter place.
The French 1st Army had 3rd and 4th Corps in
line between Merville and Sailly-sur-la-Lys,
but were out of touch with their 5th Corps.

The orders to 48th Division were to stand
for a few hours longer. They withdrew that
night under pressure from the enemy, with the
assistance of the armoured vehicles of the
Hopkinson Mission. The garrison of Worm-
houdt was extricated together with such portions
of the garrison of Cassel as could disengage from
the enemy. 44th Division was also ordered |
to disengage that night, and to move north-
eastwards towards the old frontier defences.
46th Division, which had moved on the night
26th/27th May from the Seclin area to Steen-
vorde, was to move into the Dunkirk périmeter.

Before he received this order, the Commander
of 44th Division (Major-General Osborne) had
visited headquarters of the French 4th Corps,
where he learned of the Belgian armistice; and
heard that General Prioux had orders to stand
his ground. He, too, had endeavoured to
convince General Prioux that the only hope
for his army lay in withdrawal.

Later, on 28th May fresh orders were issued
by the French rst Army. They weré to the
effect that General Prioux himself would
remain with the 4th Corps in its present position,
and that General de la Laurencie, with his own
3rd Corps and the Cavalry Corps, would with-
draw so as to arrive within the Dunkirk peri-
meter on 30th May. “No copy of this order
reached General Osborne, who learned of the
change‘of plans when, at 10.30 p.m. that night,
he visited the headquarters of the French rst
Army. As General de la Laurencie had decided
to begin his move at 11.30 p.m., General Osborne,
had some difficulty in conforming, but succeeded
in doing so. I was genuinely very glad to learn
that part, at any rate, of the French 1st Army

would now be sharing in the withdrawal, how-

ever great the difficulties might be.

Occupation of the Perimeter Completed.

53. Ist and 2nd Corps were now free to pro-
ceed with the occupation of their sectors of the
Dunkirk perimeter, and both Commanders met
Sir Ronald Adam on 28th May. 2nd Corps
had, that morning, ordered Headquarters, 2nd
Armoured Reconnaissance. Brigade, to take over
the sector from Furnes exclusive to the sea at
Nieuport, and now ordered 4th Division to move
from the line of the Ypres-Comines Canal to
relieve them. 3rd Division was to follow as
soon as possible and take over the sector
between the French-Belgian frontier and Furnes.

These two divisions had been in the line at
‘Ypres since 25th May. They had held positions

SUPPLEMENT ‘to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1941 -

on the historic ground of the Ypres-Comines
Canal, Zillebeke and the eastern outskirts of
Ypres, and on these positions, the infantry, well
supported by ‘the artillery, had stubbomly held
their ground in the face of strong and deter-
mined attacks by the enemy.

ist Corps also ordered rst Division to move
into their sector of the perimeter ; on the same
day rst Corps was ordered to reinforce the
garrison of Bergues with one battalion. This
order could not be carried out that day, but
next day (29th May) a battalion of 46th Divi-
sion (gth Foresters) was sent there.

During this time it had been a constant
anxiety to G.H.Q. lest those enemy forces
released by the Belgian armistice should fore-
stall our occupation of the perimeter. There
had been no time to lose. Early ‘on the 28th
the leading enemy mobile troops and tanks had
reached Nieuport, and they would have arrived
there unopposed had it not been for the work
of a troop of r2th Lancers. The state of the
roads, congested as they were with refugees and
Belgian troops, must also have played their
part in delaying the enemy. Throughout the
day, however, the defensive positions were
improved and a number of additional troops
from various units, chiefly Royal Artillery, were

_ collected and organised to occupy them.

On zgth May, troops of 12th Infantry Brigade
and Corps Artillery began to arrive; that
night 4th Division relieved the mixed detach-
ments which up to now had been holding the
sector. Throughout the 29th May the enemy
had been attempting to cross the canal between
the French-Belgian frontier and Nieuport.
At the latter place, where the bridge had not
been blown, they established a bridgehead in
the town. Everywhere else they were driven
back. Some attempted to cross in rubber boats ;
others were disguised as civilians, even as nuns,
and attempted to cross with the refugees, horses
and cattle. On this day enemy forces advancing
near the coast were shelled by H.M. ships.

Thus, once again the enemy had been fore-
stalled just in the nick of time, and the prompt
and gallant action of the troops on the spot had
gained the few vital hours which were to make
it possible, against all expectation, to embark
practically the whole force.

54. On the afternoon of 28th May, I moved
my headquarters from Houtkerque to La
Panne, which was in direct telephonic com-
munication with London. On arrival I heard
reports from Sir Ronald Adam and the Quarter-
Master-General.

These reports were not optimistic. No ships
could be unloaded at the docks at’ Dunkirk, and

. few wounded could be evacuated. There was

no water in Dunkirk and very little on the
beaches. The naval plans were not yet in full
operation, and some 20,000 men were waiting
to be taken off the beaches, 10,000 having been
taken off in the last two days, chiefly from
Dunkirk. The area was congested with French
and Belgian troops and their transport, as well
as with refugees.

They gave it as their opinion that, given a
reasonable measure of immunity from air attack,
troops could gradually be evacuated and
supplies landed. If, however, intensive enemy
air attack continued, the beaches might easily
Broome a shambles within the next en ae

Ours.
