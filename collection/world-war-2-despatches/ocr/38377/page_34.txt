CHARYBDIS | from _ Gibraltar . and
INDOMITABLE and PHOEBE from Free-
town, for Operation ‘‘ Berserk.’’ ‘‘ Berserk ”’
was subsequently carried out according to plan
and was of the utmost benefit in exercising
fighter direction and co-operation between the
three carriers.

6. The.convoy under a bogus W.S.* name
escorted by NIGERIA (flag of Rear-Admiral
Commanding, oth Cruiser Squadronf),
KENYA and destroyers sailed from the Clyde
during the night 2nd/3rd August and joined
my flag the following morning.

7, Just prior to sailing, but after the
“normal ’’ convoy conference, Rear-Admiral
Burrough held a meeting with the Masters of
the M.T. ships on board his flagship at which
the whole plan was explained to them in detail.
A meeting with radio operators of the M.T.
ships was also held when all details regarding
fleet communications and procedure were fully
explained. These two meetings were invaluable.

8. Personal messages signed by the First Lord
of the Admiralty wishing the Masters ‘‘ God
Speed ’’ and contained in envelopes marked
“Not to be opened until 0800/zoth August ”’
were handed to the Masters. This act of
courtesy and encouragement was very highly
appreciated.

g. Shortly before leaving Scapa the Admiralty
decided that FURIOUS should carry out
Operation ‘‘ Bellows,’’ to reinforce Malta with
Spitfires, concurrently with ‘‘ Pedestal.’ The
necessary additions and amendments to the
Operation Orders were made and subsequently
distributed to all ships and‘ authorities
concerned.

10. Owing to ‘technical difficulties connected
with the aircraft’s propellers, and FURIOUS’s
humped flying deck, FURIOUS was unable
to sail with the main body. She later pro-
ceeded at high speed with MANCHESTER and
joined my fiag on D minus 3.

iz. The passage of the convoy from the
United Kingdom to the rendezvous with the
aircraft carriers west of the Straits was wholly
successful, though there were many alarms over
U-Boat contacts en route.

12. The convoy was repeatedly exercised in
anti-aircraft gunnery, in emergency turns and
in changing from one cruising disposition to
another, using both flags and short range W/T.
The risk to security in breaking W/T silence
was accepted and as a result of these exer-

.cises the convoy attained an efficiency in

manceuvring comparable to that of a fleet unit.

13. Unfavourable weather conditions coupled
with unsuitable equipment and an inexperi-
enced crew in ABBEYDALE., prevented all
the ships taking part in “‘ Berserk ’’ completing
with fuel at sea. This entailed sending ad-
ditional large and small ships into Gibraltar
on the night of D minus 2 and D minus 1, thus

throwing further heavy commitments on the

already complicated organisation required from

14. It gives me great pleasure to record the
excellent way in which these heavy commit,
ments were met by the Vice-Admiral Com-
manding, North Atlantic, and all concerned at
Gibraltar.

15. During the afternoon of D minus 1, /*

the dummy air attacks on the force, followed /
by a fly past for identification purposes, were ‘
carried out and proved to be of the utmost
benefit, for exercising the radar reporting and §
fighter direction organisation and for giving

everyone an opportunity for studying the fy
chara¢teristics and markings of our own air- /
craft. They did, of course, entail a great /
volume of W/T and R/T traffic which rt
have been very apparent to enemy or enemy-'

controlled listening ‘stations. This risk to ,

security was considered acceptable when '
balanced against the benefit to be derived from
the practices.

16. At 1330 when INDOMITABLE joined
my flag it is believed to have been the first
occasion when five of H.M. aircraft carriers
have ever operated in company at sea
simultaneously.

17. The passage of the Straits and D.x (zoth
August) were uneventful. Fishing boats and
one merchant vessel were passed at close
quarters, but aided by a moonless night and
indifferent visibility it is improbable that the
force was sighted from the shore. Reports
received later showed, however, that the
enemy was fully cognisant of our passage of

the Straits. é

18. D.2 (11th August) was marked bv «ne
following important occurrences :—

(a) The successful completion of the large
fuelling programme, thanks very largely to
the extreme efficiency shown by DINGLE-
DALE and BROWN RANGER. In previous
similar operations it has not been necessary
to provide for so large an oiling programme
since ships going to Malta have been able to
fuel there. In this case Malta had no oil
to spare. The problem of oiling 3 cruisers
and 26 destroyers at sea, under enemy obser-
vation and in U-Boat infested waters, was an
anxious one, failure of which could have
seriously upset the whole plan.

(b) The tragic sinking of EAGLE, which
quite apart from the loss to the fleet of a
well tried and valuable carrier, at once bereft
the force of 25 per cent. of its fighter
strength. «

(c) The large number of sightings and re-
portings of torpedoes and U-Boats, a propor-
tion of which may well have been actualities.

(a) The successful execution of Operation
‘* Bellows ’’ whereby 37 much needed Spit-
fires reached Malta safely.*

(e) The continuous snooping throughout
the day despite all our fighters could do to
prevent it; and the heavy, but fortunately
unsuccessful, air attack at dusk. Our fighters
competed manfully at great height against
the snoopers but the speed and the height
