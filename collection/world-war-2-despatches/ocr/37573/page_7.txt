SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 22 MAY, 1946

serious resistance, and the British Brigade was
exposed to serious danger by both its flanks
being turned. As a result of this enemy pres-
sure, the Tenth Army issued orders for a
general retirement on the axis Alengon-Rennes,
with a view to withdrawing into Brittany. As
co-operation with such a movement would have
been contrary to my own instructions, I at once
issued orders to Beauman’s Force, the 3rd
Armoured Brigade (which had once again re-
lieved the 2nd) and the 157th Infantry Brigade,
for a withdrawal north-westwards to Cherbourg.

16. In the case of Beauman’s Force and the
3rd Armoured Brigade, neither of which were
in contact with the enemy, this was a com-
paratively simple operation, shoud it in-
volved moving at right angles across the simul-
taneous line of retreat of the XIV Corps of the
Tenth Army. The 157th Brigade, however,
was still engaged with the enemy, and it was
only due to the cool handling and tactical ability
of its Brigadier that it was extricated from its
dangerous situation, embussed by midnight on
the x6th/r7th, moved 200 miles by roads
encumbered by columns of troops and refugees
and embarked 24 hours later at Cherbourg.

17. In order to protect the embarkation at
Cherbourg, I had asked for a fresh battalion
of the 52nd Division to be left to occupy a
covering position some 20 miles to the south.

This, combined with the five French battalions
of the Cherbourg garrison, ought to have pro-
vided ample security, and I had hoped to con-
tinue the embarkation until the azst in order to
remove all the stores and mechanized vehicles.
The enemy, however, again upset our calcula-
tions by the speed with which he followed up
our rapid withdrawal. At 9 a.m. on the 18th,
a column of 60 lorries, carrying motorized
German infantry, reached the covering position
near St. Sauveur. Finding resistance there, they
turned west to the sector held by French
troops, and succeeded in penetrating the posi-
tion by the coast road. The French made little
attempt to resist, and I had to make the decision
at 11.30 to complete the evacuation by 3 p.m.
The covering battalion (5th Bn. K.0.S.B.) was
withdrawn between 12 noon and 3 p.m., and
the last boat left at 4 p.m. All weapons were
removed, except one 3.7 in. A.A. gun, which
broke down and was rendered unserviceable,
and one static Bofors gun which could not be
removed in the time. Two Anti-Tank guns
also had to be abandoned during the with-
drawal. When the last troopship left, the
Germans had penetrated to within three miles
of the harbour.
