KINGSTON .engaged an enemy destroyer at 7,000 yards, claiming two hits, ported sighting a large number of caiques behind the smoke screen, which the enemy destroyer was now making. Although in contact with the enemy convoy, .C.S.15 considered that he.would jeopardise his whole force if he proceeded any further to the northward. H.A.. ammunition was beginning to run low. The speed of his force, which he considered must be kept together in face of the continuous air attacks, was limited to 20 knots, on account of CARLISLE's maximum speed being  ax knots: C.S.15, therefore, decided to withdraw and -ordered the destroyers to. abandon the. chase. The Commander-in-Chief, -Mediterranean's message timed o94x of 22nd May, which showed  that this convoy was of considerable size, was not seen by CSiz5 until after 1100."

In the absence of such favourable circumstances he had usually avoided combat. In this sense the operations. had proved slightly disappointing. On the other hand, statistically the results were fairly satisfactory so far as they went, the destruction of t6 aircraft and probable destruction of a substantial number of others being claimed for the loss of 25 of our pilots; and much valuable experience had been gained. Moreover, by a combination of   Circus  and   Rhubarb   operations our ultimate object, which was to seize the initiative, harass the enemy, and force him on to the defensive, had undoubtedly been achieved. :"

Finding nothing there, they examined under heavy fire, and reported that the ships had sailed. This skilful and determined reconnaissance is deserving of the highest praise, as is the initiative of Captain Fancourt in ordering it. i"

The defences were even stronger than in the   Gustav   line which had already given Eighth Army so much trouble; they varied  between five hundred and a thousand yards in depth and the main system, of reinforced concrete emplacements, was linked by tunnels and communication trenches into a mutually supporting whole. The main weakness was the lack of troops to man the defences but Kesselring had all the same ordered the strongest resistance. Eighth Army between zoth and 22nd May was preparing for the assault. Following the failure of the surprise attack on Aquino on the evening of the 18th heavier, but still hasty, attacks had been mounted on the rgth by 78 Division on the right and x Canadian Division on the left; these ran into heavy fire which showed the defences ito be as formidable as had been expected. An attack in full strength would be nec . _ The main blow was to be delivered by the Canadian Corps north of Pontecorvo while 13  Corps would maintain pressure at Aquino and concentrate forward teady to advance abreast of the Canadians. The Poles, who had captured Villa Santa Lucia on the roth, were to continue the attack against the strongly defended hill town of Piedimonte which they had started on the zoth. 8 Indian Division, after its relief by the Canadians, had been sent back east of the Rapido; General Leese now decided to bring it forward again to reinforce 13 Corps, together with 6 British Armoured Division. These moves led to considerable congestion, a foretaste of the serious traffic jams which were to be a feature of the Liri valley operations."
