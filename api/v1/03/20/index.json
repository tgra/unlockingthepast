            "description": "The main attack by 30 Corps began at 2230 hours on 20th March when 50 Division advanced to the assault under cover of very heavy artillery fire and following an air bombardment. The Wadi Zigzaou, which ran in front of the enemy\u2019s positions in this sector, was very deep and steep-sided and the bottom was everywhere muddy and in some places had standing water in it. It resembled, in fact, the fosse of an old-fashioned fortress and our troops advanced to the assault carrying fascines and scaling- ladders as though at the storm of Badajoz. The enemy\u2019s fire, both frontal and enfilade, was very heavy and it was only by the greatest dash and courage that our advanced troops succeeded in crossing the wadi and establishing themselves on the far bank. Three of the powerful enemy strongpoints were captured and the infantry were firmly established. Unfortunately it was proving impossible to reinforce them, for the wadi which they had crossed on foot was quite impassable for wheels and almost impassable for tanks. A few of the supporting \u201c\u2018 Valen- tines \u2019\u2019 managed to get across \u2018but none of the anti-tank guns could be brought forward. A heavy downfall of rain on the 2and added to our difficulties. As a result, when the enemy in the afternoon of 22nd March put in a heavy counter-attack, using the whole of 15 Panzer Division and part of go Light, our position became untenable. 50 Division  bridge- head was dangerously narrowed down and on the night of the 23rd our troops fell back once more, on orders, across the Wadi Zigzaou, under cover of artillery fire."

The maximum lift was assessed at 1,887 tons per day between 20th March and Ist April and 2,075 tons per day between Ist May and 15th May. I emphasised that these figures would entail a very high rate of effort from the squadrons involved, and would entail consider- able retrenchment during the monsoon to pay off the mortgage in maintenance and overstrain we would have contracted in its achievement."

            "description": "This was a serious dilemma since both the arguments for strengthening the east coast assault and for the early capture of the airfields inland from Gela were overwhelmingly strong. My first solution was to transfer to the Avola assault the division assigned to Gela and en- trust the latter assault to an American division, transferred from the landings at Sciacca- Marinella, which would therefore have to be cancelled. It was not a satisfactory solution, for I was unwilling to put an isolated Ameri- can division under command of Eighth Army, but it seemed the best available. Air cover for the assault on Palermo would now have to be given from the south-eastern group of airfields, when captured, and this would cause some delay. I recommended this change of plan to General Eisenhower on r9th March and at a conference on 20th March he agreed to it. My staff continued, however, to explore the possibility of mounting another British division and by 6th April it had been found possible to provide one from Middle East which would stage at Malta. I therefore, in the new plan which was presented on 6th April, restored the American assault at Sciacca-Marinella, added an armoured brigade to the Avola landing and"

            "description": "77. The Marda Pass appeared to be held strongly by the enemy, and viewed tower- ing above the extensive fiat plains of Giggiga, looked indeed a formidable proposi- tion. Nothing could move on the Giggiga plain without being seen, and the aerodrome was in full view of the hills 9,000 yards away. The enemy appeared to be holding a broad front and therefore Commander 11th (A) Divi- sion decided he would await the arrival of 1st S.A. Brigade and attack the pass with two brigades on 23rd March. Patrol activity by the Nigerian Brigade during this period resulted in a claim by the enemy that heavy attacks had been carried out, all of which had been re- pulsed with great loss. On 20th March I received definite indications that the enemy was planning a further withdrawal and it was decided to attack with the Nigerian Brigade only, next day. After stiff fighting ist Nigeria Regiment were able to take a height overlooking the pass on its northern side by 2000 hours on the evening of the arst. The enemy evacuated the pass that night. It transpired that the position was in fact 4 miles in breadth. It was heavily wired, had gun positions iunnelled into the hills, extensive tank traps and mine fields. It had however no depth, and there is little doubt that, the occupation of the height captured by our troops had made it untenable."

With the defenders show- ing such spirit the heaps of rubble raised by the bombardment were actually an assistance to them, not least in preventing the use of tanks. However, we succeeded in clearing the greater part of the town and capturing Castle Hill. That night, contrary to the forecast, the weather broke; torrential rain turned the valley, with its mass of craters, into a bog and de- prived the night attack of the advantage of the moon. The same spirited defence was made on the mountain as in the town beneath. \u201ci \u2019s Hill\u2019\u2019, a small knoll protruding from the glacis of Monte Cassino a short way below the Monastery, was captured by 4 Indian Division on the 16th; this marked the limit of our gains in the heights above the town. Fighting continued in the town and by the 18th most of it was in our hands; but on the roth an enemy counter-attack re-took a point between \u201c Hangman\u2019s Hill\u2019\u2019 and the Castle hill, Our garrison of the former, which had been reduced by casualties, was cut off and progress in the town was halted. On 20th March I informed both Army Commanders: : \u201cThe slow progress made so far \u2018in attacking the town of Cassino with the consequent delay in launching the attack on the Monastery, combined with the necessity of preparing the maximum forces for a full-scale offensive in the second half of April, makes it essential to decide in the course of the next twenty-four or thirty-six hours whether (@) to continue with the Cassino operations in the hope of capturing the Monastery during the next three or four days or, (b) to call the operations off and to consolidate such gains of ground as are ea for the renewal of the offensive ter \u2019\u2019."

While the other two brigades of 20 Indian Division were advancing on Kyaukse, 100 Brigade (less one battalion) and two armoured car regiments made a spectacular raid against the enemy\u2019s communications to the south. Moving with great speed, this mechan- ised column captured Pyinzi on the 20th March and Pindale the following day. Turning east- wards, it then captured Wundwin on the 22nd, destroying large enemy dumps. It then turned north, surprising and killing a considerable force of Japanese encountered at Kume, 18 miles due south of Kyaukse."

            "description": "As already pointed out, the construction had to include both fair-weather airfields to meet our present needs, and all-weather fields to allow air supply to continue during the monsoon. These requirements not unnaturally conflicted. The target for all-weather con- struction was accommodation for three trans- port squadrons at Akyab by the end of April and three at Kyaukpyu by mid-May. In fact we managed to get three squadrons working from all-weather bases in each place in early May. The fair-weather bases were wanted as early as possible and by the 20th March there were two transport squadrons working from Akyab, with two more eleven days later. During April, half a squadron operated from Kyaukpyu for the supply of troops in Arakan only. I make no apology for going into this matter of airfields in some detail, as the responsibility for their construction, as of the great majority of the others in the theatre, rested with the Army, as did their stocking and subsequent supply. 2"

These dates were, however, not nearly early enough to support Fourteenth Army\u2019s rapid advance and it became necessary to develop fair-weather airfields and to put them into operation simultaneously with the construc- tion of the all-weather ones. Two squadrons of C.47 aircraft began supply operations from Akyab on the 20th March, with No, 1 R.A.M.O. which had been switched from Imphal, and a further two squadrons by- the end of the month. Half a squadron operated from Kyaukpyu during April for the supply of troops in Arakan only. The all-weather airfields were in fact completed in both places in early May, when each base operated three squadrons of C.47 transport aircraft."
