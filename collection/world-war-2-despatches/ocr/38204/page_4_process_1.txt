SEANYMPH thereupon turned back on her track and set course 209  to search. The weather at 1200Z, 15th September, was reported as: Wind S. to S.E. 4, sky 0, sea 4-5, visibility 7.*

* 36. At 1213Z STUBBORN, towing X.7, and on the adjacent route to SEANYMPH and X.8, sighted what was at that time believed to be a U-boat in an estimated position 68  51  N. 8  34  E. and dived, surfacing at 1323Z.

37. At 1550Z, while proceeding at 7 knots, X.7, in tow. of STUBBORN, broke from her tow. X.7 surfaced immediately and the auxiliary tow was passed. At 17002 STUBBORN again proceeded with X.7 in tow

~ 38. At 1630Z, X.8 sighted and closed STUBBORN who was at that time getting X.+ in tow again, and at 1718Z STUBBORN, with X 7 in tow and X.8 in company, proceeded to look for SEANYMPH. No contact was made, however, and at dusk (1900Z) STUBBORN proceeded northwards with X.7 and X 8. STUBBORN reported the situation by W/T to Admiral (Submarines) at 1954  who passed the information to SEANYMPH

39. Meanwhile, SEANYMPH,   searched the area unsuccessfully, passed a signal to Admiral (Submarines) at 2045Z informing him of the loss of X.8, At 2151 she received Admiral (Submarines ) signal referred to in paragraph 38 and proceeded to intercept.

40. X 8 proceeded in company with STUBposs and X.7 until 2359, when contact was lost.

tAth September.

The reason was explained at 0400Z, when it was found that since ooo1Z, X.8 had been steering 146  instead of 046  (the result of a phonetic error in passing orders for the course).

41. At 0300Z, dawn showed to STUBBORN that there was no X.8; but at 0315Z a submarine was sighted and identified as SEANYMPH, in position 69  35  N. 10  16  E. All telative information was passed to SEANYMPH who proceeded to look for her errant charge, STUBBORN and X.7 proceeding to the northward.

42. Between 1200 and 1350Z, SEANYMPH sighted and spoke SCEPTRE, and at 1700Z she made contact with X.8. By 2005 she had her once more in tow and, as the weather was favourable, transferred to her the operational crew.

43. In the meantime there had been another case of tow-parting which was not to have such a happy ending. Until or45Z on the r6th, in estimated position 70  49  N. 11  40  E., SYRTIS and X.g had had an uneventful passage. At o120Z, X.9 dived after her period on the surface for ventilating and charging. Speed was then gradually increased to 83 knots. SYRTIS reports the weather at ooorZ/16 as: Wind S.S.E. 3, sea and swell 2-3. SYRTIS decided not to bring X 9 to the surface at 0300 after so short a spell dived but continued until 0855Z, when speed was reduced to 5 knots.

At og07Z, three signals-underwater-exploding were fired to surface X.9. X.g did not surface and at 0g20Z the tow was hauled in and found to have parted. SYRTIS turned to the reciprocal course at 0955Z, to return as soon as possible to the vicinity of where it was thought X.g might have broken adrift. From the log readings and fuel consumption this was estimated to have been between 0145 and 03002. However, no contact was made with X.g; but at 1545Z SYRTIS sighted a well defined oil track which it was considered might have come from an X-craft, running in a direction 088 - ogo , which was the direct course for the slipping position, 200 miles distant.

. Subsequent search revealed no sign of X.g and no further news has been received of her. It can only be hoped that the Passage Commanding Ofhcer (Sub-Lieutenant E. Kearon, R.N.V.R.) made the Norwegian coast, scuttled his craft, and made his way ashore with his crew. It is not considered that X.g took any part in the attack. The passage crew were not trained for it, neither did they have sufficient information to carry it out.

17th September

45. The regrettable loss of X.g was not known to Admiral (Submarines) until some days later, as at the time the loss was discovered, SYRTIS was in an area where, by ihe orders, it was forbidden to break W/T silence. At 0143Z therefore, having abandoned the search, SYRTIS proceeded north to pass a signal by W/T from north of 73  North.

46. Meanwhile the remaining five submarines were proceeding with their X-craft in tow, and TRUCULENT and THRASHER, neither of which had had any difficulties, both made their landfalls from the vicinity of their ordered landfall positions during the day. At approximately o600Z STUBBORN and SEANYMPH sighted each other in the vicinity of position 71  04  N. 15  56  E., and later, between 1447 and 1508Z, STUBBORN and) SEANYMPH were again in contact and spoke to each other by S.S.T.t It was comforting to STUBBORN to learn that X.8 had been met.

47. At 0725Z X.8 experienced some difficulty in maintaining trim. Trim became worse as the day went on, air could be heard escaping from the starboard side charge and the craft took up a list to starboard. It was apparent that the buoyancy chambers of the starboard charge were leaking. At 1630Z, with the compensating tank dry and No, 2 main ballast fully blown, and trim still difficult to hold, the Commanding Officer of X.8 (Lieutenant B. M. McFarlane, R.A.N.) decided to jettison the starboard charge, and this was set to   safe   and released at 1635Z in about 180 fathoms. In spite of the  saie  setting, however, the charge exploded at 1650Z, about 1,000 yards astern of X.8, in tow of SEANYMPH. Both vessels were dived at the time. The explosion was loud but caused no damage.

48. Although this charge had been released, X.8 still had difficulty in maintaining irim and now had a list to port, indicating that the port charge also had flooded buoyancy chambers; and the Commanding Officer decided he must jet atten it too. Before doing so X.8 surfaced a distrusting the   safe   setting, set the Admwalty footnotes
