SUPPLEMENT t6 THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

instructions to the effect that, as our troops
withdrew, an unrestricted Scorched Earth
Policy was to be applied throughout Malaya.
It was at once apparent that our problem
differed in some important respects from that
which had a few months previously confronted
the Russians. This was due in the main to the
fact that, whereas their armies were withdraw-
ing through a country inhabited by their own
people, our forces were withdrawing through
a country inhabited by Asiatic peoples to whom
we had by treaty promised our protection. If
we deprived these people of the necessities of
life such as food, water, etc., or destroyed the
symbols of modern civilisation, such as the
power supplies of their hospitals, they would
claim that we were not treating them in accord-
ance with our promises and they would become
fertile ground for the seeds of the enemy’s pro-
paganda. On the other hand the machinery,
most of which was owned by British firms and
individuals, and the rubber stocks could quite
properly be destroyed. Of greater importance
from the military point of view was the de-
struction of road and railway bridges. This
was obviously essential if we were to succeed in
our efforts to delay the enemy and it had in
fact been done since the beginning of the
operations.

234. Two other aspects of the problem which
received consideration were the practicability
of applying a Scorched Earth Policy and the
moral effect 1t would have, if applied, on both
soldiers and civilians

As regards the former, widespread destruc-
tion of property is not an operation which can
be carried out effectively at the last minute.
To be effective it must be both prepared and
put into execution in advance of the final with-
drawal. In that case, however, the explosions
and fires give to the enemy a sure indication
of the intention to withdraw. It was impossible
also for the military authorities to carry out or
supervise the destruction in so large an area,
The best that could be done was to appoint
officers to tour the country to see that ade-
quate preparations had been made. The execu-
tive work had to be left to the owners or agents
on receipt of orders from a central authority.

235. The moral effect on both soldiers and
civilians would be, it was anticipated, extremely
adverse. At a time when we were doing our
utmost to raise the morale of our troops we
feared that the noise of explosions and the
sight of smoke in their rear would have the
opposite effect. As regards the civilians, we
wanted all the help we could get from the
Asiatic population but, as is well known,
Asiatics tend to take the side of the more power-
ful and we feared that the sight of destruction
being carried out well behind our lines would
induce them to help the .enemy rather than

ourselves. s

236. With these considerations in mind the
Far East War Council, after referring the mat-
ter to London, issued instructions that a
scorched earth policy would be enforced, but
that it would not apply to foodstuffs already
distributed to the civil population, to water
supplies or to power plants.

237. The situation as regards Army Families
at the outbreak of hostilities has already been
explained in Part I, Section IX, ‘‘ Married
Families.” A similar situation existed in the

1285,

Royal Air Force. There were also in Malaya
a number of families of naval personnel who
had shore appointments. On the civil side no
restrictions had been imposed on the entry of
families into Malaya, so that there were some
thousands of women and children, the families
of both officials and unofficials. Many of these
had made their home in Malaya for a number
of years.

238. In December, on instructions from
Home, the question of the evacuation of women
and children from Malaya came before the War
Council. It was at once apparent that important
issues were involved. In the first place many
of the European women were engaged in
essential war work—either in offices or in hos-
pitals or in the Passive Air Defence Organiza-
tion. In many cases it would be difficult to
release them without weakening the organiza-
tion. Moreover, many of them, especially in
the Passive Air Defence Services, were working
side by side with Eurasian and Asiatic women.
It was in fact the European women who had
in many cases taken the lead in building up
the local organizations, If these women were
to be withdrawn now that war had broken out
and there was work to be done, the effect on
the Eurasian and Asiatic population would
clearly be little short of disastrous and a severe
blow would be dealt to British prestige. Again,
if European women were to be evacuated, why
should not those Eurasian, Chinese, Indian and
other Asiatic women, who were not natives of
Malaya, also be evacuated if they wished to
go? Although Japan’s policy was to try to
rally all Asiatics to her flag with the cry of
“* Asia for the ‘ Asiatics ’ ’’ our political object
was clearly to hold Malaya for the British
Empire. It was not to gain a victory of
Europeans over, Asiatics. If, therefore, we
evacuated immediately all European women,
leaving the Eurasian and Asiatic women to do
their work, we should, it seemed, be playing
into the hands of the Japanese and provide a
fertile ground for the seeds of their propaganda.

239. An analysis of the European women in
Malaya showed that they could be divided
broadly into the following categories : —

(a) Married Families of Service Personnel.
—(Rank and File).

Not very many of these were employed
on essential war work. Moreover, many
of them were occupying Government
accommodation which would shortly be
required for reinforcements. They were
for the most part ‘‘ bouches inutiles.’”
Their evacuation was therefore both pos-
sible and desirable.

(b) Families of Officers and Civilians who
wished to leave.

It was considered undesirable to force
these to stay against their will. '
(c) Famihes of Officers and Civilians who

did not wish to leave but who were not

engaged in essential war work

These could be ordered to leave on the
grounds that they constituted ‘‘ bouches
inutiles.””

(d) Families of Officers and Civiltans who
did not wish to leave and who were engaged
in essential war work.

There were a large number in this cate-

» gory. For reasons given above there were

strong objections to their evacuation.
