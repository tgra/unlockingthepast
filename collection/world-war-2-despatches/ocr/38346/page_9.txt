SUPPLEMENT tq tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 7 JULY, 1948

Officer of DE WITT, but she did not join and
no information was received as to whether or
not she ever left Sourabaya.i

30. By 1500/28 rom examination it
appeared probable that two boilers in B boiler
room could be got ready for steaming by about
2300/28, but that satisfactory performance of
these boilers would be dependent on power
trial at sea. Rear Admiral Palliser* was in-
formed accordingly by telephone from Dutch
Naval Headquarters. With ‘two boilers
EXETER’s maximum speed was 15 to 16
knots; with four boilers it was hoped to obtain
24 knots, but 23 knots was the maximum that
could be maintained subsequently.

31. The first part of the night 28th Febru-
ary/1st March’ passed without incident.
Weather conditions were as follows:—wind
E.N.E., force 2, sea 20, cloud two tenths, full
moon. After clearing Sourabaya minefields the
destroyers were ordered tn take up screening
diagram Number 2A and shortly before mid-
hight steam was available in the two additional
boilers. Speed was increased by steps to 23
knots, the maximum capacity of the four
boilers. It may be well to remark here that
all four serviceable boilers were on the star-
board side, two in each boiler room. No unit
system was possible and all four boilers had
therefore to be cross connected. Course was
altered to ooo degrees at midnight to pass some
25 miles East of Bawean Island and at 0200 to

345 degrees.

32. It had been intended to alter course to
290 degrees at 0400, but shortly before this,
three ships, two large and one smaller, were
sighted to the Westward in the light of the
setting moon, distant about ro miles, steering
to the S.S.W., to pass Westward of Bawean
Island. ‘These ‘appeared to be two merchant
ships escorted by a cruiser or destroyer. From
my orders and routeing I had no doubt in my
mind that my object was evasion in this attempt
to clear the Java Sea, and accordingly I turned
away stern on to avoid being sighted, then
worked round to the Northward and resumed
course 345 degrees at about 0430. Subsequently
course was altered to 290 degrees at o600 and
280 degrees at 0700. No enemy air or surface
forces were sighted at dayhght and visibility
was extreme.

33. At about 0750 the crow’s nest lookout
reported the masts of two ships nearly right
ahead. These were identified as the topmasts
of warships, cruisers or larger, steering to the
N.N.E. Course was immediately reversed and
it was thought possible that, with the advan-
tage of light, EXETER had not been sighted.
This hope was short lived as the enemy ships
were seen to turn towards though still well
hull down. An enemy report was therefore
made and repeated but no acknowledgment
was received. This turn towards by the enemy
cruisers was brief and may’ possibly have been

for the purpose of flying off aircraft, as they’

resumed their Northerly course and were soon
out of sight. EXETER worked gradually to
the Southward and Westward through East
finally steering 260 degrees. In spite of failure
to receive acknowledgment of the enemy report

I decided against further repetition, since avoid-
ance of disclosure of movements by D/F*
seemed of greater importance than any possible
advantage to be gained by continuing to make
this report. For some time it appeared that
evasion had been achieved since no enemy
forces were sighted, although it was subse-
quently stated by the Japanese that their
cruisers, as these ships proved to be, had flown
off reconnaissance aircraft. There was how-
ever no indication of this on the radar screen
nor was any aircraft sighted until action was
subsequently joined.

34. It was not until about 0935 that the
topmasts of two large cruisers were sighted
bearing about 170 degrees steering to the West-
ward. ‘Course was immediately altered to 320
degrees with a view to possible evasion, but
these cruisers also were seen to turn towards.
Very shortly after this an enemy ship, at first
thought to be a 6-inch gun cruiser, was sighted
ahead steering directly towards. This ship
proved to be a large destroyer. It was engaged
by EXETER and destroyers at ranges between
20,000 and 14,000 yards, but on being engaged
turned away to the Westward uncer smoke.
Almost simultaneously two more large cruisers
were sighted bearing approximately 330 de-
grees and these at once turned towards. All
four cruisers proved to be ten-gun 8-inch
cruisers of the Ashigara or Atago classes and
one is believed to have been the flagship ASHI-
GARA. Course was immediately altered to
the Eastward (090 degrees), destroyers con-
forming.

35. EXETER’s speed at this time was 23
knots on four out of the eight boilers, but
shortly afterwards the Engineer Officer re-
ported that he believed that steam could be
taised in one more boiler in B_ boiler -room,
and this boiler could be connected in about
an hour. Orders were given for this to be done
and the extra boiler was connected in less than
that time. From then (about 1055) a speed
of 25 knots was maintained and before the end
the ship was steaming at 26 knots. This and
the repair work after the action on 27th
February reflects much credit on the Engine
Room Department.

36. The enemy cruisers to’ the Northwest
were the first to open fire at long range, their
fire being immediately. returned by EXETER.
It was most unfortunate that at the start of this
action the fire control table was damaged and
put out of action by a failure in the enemy
travel drive. Until this damage was realised
salvos fell appreciably out for line and during
the remainder of the action a clock and
Dumaresq had to be used while repairs were
attempted.

37. An enemy report was made when it was
seen that evasion was no longer possible and
two other reports were made Subsequently
during the action.

38. The ensuing action is difficult to describe
in detail with no records available. The general
trend of the action was Easterly with course
varying between about 070 ‘degrees and 110
degrees as alterations were made to avoid
straddling or to open ‘‘A’’ arcs. The enemy
