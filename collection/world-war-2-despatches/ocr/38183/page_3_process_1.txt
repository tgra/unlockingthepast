I. This despatch. covers the period from the date of my appointment as Commander-inChief, Far East, the 17th October, 1940, to the date on which I handed over to LieutenantGeneral Sir Henry Pownall, the 27th December, IQ4I. :

My original staff consisted of seven, exclusive of my personal assistant. Of these seven, the Chief of Staff, Major-General Dewing, the Senior Royal Air Force Staff Officer, GroupCaptain Darvall, as well as my personal assistant, travelled out with me.

The Naval Liaison Officer, Captain Back,

Before leaving England I saw the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Chief of the Air Staff and Major-General Ismay individually, but did not meet the Chiefs of Staff collectively at one of their meetings.

I spent two clear days in Cairo, three in Delhi and three in Rangoon, arriving at Singapore on Thursday,  the rath November. General Headquarters, Far East, started to operate on Monday, : the 18th November, 1940.  gs

During the journey I was able to ses the working of the Headquarters of both the Army and Air Force in Cairo, and to consult with the

Commander-in-Chief, Sir Archibald Wavell, on the methods of operating his headquarters, and especially why he found such a big expansion from his original staff necessary.

I met the General Officer Commanding, Major-General (now Lieutenant-General) Sir K. McLeod, visited various establishments, including the oil refinery at Syriam, and established contact with many of the civil officials.

With reference to paragraph 2 of my Directive, the meaning of the term   operational control   was explained as being higher direction and control as distinct from detailed operational control. .

The first was confirmed during 1941 in many telegrams,  .g., in March,   Avoidance of war with Japan is basis of Far East policy and provocation must be rigidly avoided,  and again in September,   Our policy in the
