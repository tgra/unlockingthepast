AIR OPERATIONS BY THE ALLIED EXPEDITIONARY AIR FORCE IN
N.W. EUROPE From NoveMBER I5TH, 1943 TO SEPTEMBER 30TH, 1944.

The following despatch by the late Air Chief
Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory, K.C.B.,
D.S.0., Air Commander-in-Chief, Allied
Expeditionary Air Force, was submitted to
the Supreme Allied Commander in November,
1944.

On relinquishing my command of the Allied
Expeditionary Air Force I have the honour to
submit the following Despatch, covering its
operations under my command during the
period from 15th November, 1943 tof 30th
September, 1944.

Since this Despatch covers the air support of
the assault of Europe and the subsequent land
operations, it necessarily includes reference to
the strategical operations of the United States
Eighth Air Force and the Royal Air Force
Bomber Command in addition to the operations
of these two Air Forces and the Royal Air Force
Coastal Command directed to the tactical sup-
port of the assault.

As the period covered by the Despatch
extends over ten and a half months of the most
heavy and concentrated air war in the history
of the world, I have not attempted to deal with
the events on a day-to-day basis. Rather I
have taken the tasks undertaken in the pre-
liminary and preparatory phases and in the
assault and post-assault phase and have
attempted to show how these tasks were ful-
filled, as well as briefly indicating what I feel
are some of the outstanding features of these
air operations.

Part J—ComMAND AND CONTROL

Formation of A-E.A.F.

. _ By a Directive (reference COSSAC (43) 81)
diated 16th November, 1943, issued by your

Chief of Staff, I was informed that the Com-
bined Chiefs of Staff had appointed me Air
Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Expedition-
ary Air Force under yourself as the Supreme
Allied Commander, and that I was to exercise
operational command of the British and Ameri-
can tactical air forces supporting the assault of
Western Europe from the United Kingdom. I
was also informed that a United States General
would be appointed Deputy Air Commander-in-
Chief, Allied Expeditionary Air Force. Major-
General William O. Butler was the first General
Officer to hold this post. He served in this capa-
city from rst January, 1944, to 25th March,
1944, and was succeeded by Major-General
Hoyt S. Vandenberg who occupied the position
until 8th August, 1944. Major-General Ralph
Royce then held this appointment until the dis-
bandment of A.E.A.F. on 14th October. 1944.

Forces available

2. The forces under my command comprised
the Royal Air Force Second Tactical Air Force,
the United States Ninth Air Force and the forces
of the Air Defence of Great Britain. The Royal
Air Force Second Tactical Air Force and the
formations of the Air Defence of Great Britain
passed to my command on 15th November,
1943; the United States Ninth Air Force passed
to my operational command on 15th December,
1943, but was not released from its commitment
to assist the United States Strategic Air Forces
in ‘‘ Pointblank ’’ operations until roth March,
1944.

3. You will recall ‘that a definition of the role
of the strategic air forces was not covered in
the original Directive to me, ‘but was deferred to
a later date. However, my plans were made on
the assumption that I should be able to count
on the full support of the strategic air forces
when it was required.
