SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 3 JULY, 1946

their progress via Italy and Sicily, no definite
information to justify our expecting the pre-
sence of German troops in Africa had been
received up to the middle of February. Our
intelligence from Italy was meagre in the
extreme and usually unreliable; nor were suffi-
cient long range aircraft available for more than

a very occasional reconnaissance of shipping in.

Ttalian harbours or in Tripoli. From North
Africa itself our intelligence reports were prac-
tically none, since no service of agents had
been established there during the period before
Italy came into the war nor was it possible
now to establish one. We were thus working
almost entirely in the dark as to the possibility
of German formations being sent to Libya, and
on the whole the balance of our information was
against any such troops having been sent or
being on their way to Libya. Actually, the
landing of a German Light Armoured Division
at Tripoli had begun early in February.

I estimated that it would be at least two
months after the landing of German forces at
Tripoli before they could undertake a serious
offensive against Cyrenaica, and that, therefore,
there was not likely to be any serious threat
to our positions there before May at the earliest.
I accordingly considered that a garrison of one
armoured brigade and one division would be
sufficient to leave as a flank guard in Cyrenaica
and that it would be safe to leave comparatively
unequipped and untrained troops there so long
as their training and equipment would be
completed by May, by which time I hoped to
have reinforcements available of at least one
Indian Division from the Sudan.

I had intended originally that the division
to be left in Cyrenaica should be the 6th
Australian Division, and that the 7th Australian
Division should be the first Australian division
to proceed to Greece. This would mean that
at least one fully equipped and seasoned divi-
sion would be available for the defence of
Cyrenaica for the first month or so, since it
was calculated that the despatch of the total
force to Greece would take ro weeks to com-
plete. General Blamey, commanding the

_ Australian Forces, insisted, however, and as it
proved rightly so, that the 7th Division was
not sufficiently trained or equipped and that
the 6th Division must be the first to proceed.
This involved relieving the 6th Australian Divi-
sion at once by the gth Australian Division,
which was only partially trained and equipped.

The armoured troops for tthe defence of
Cyrenaica would have to be found by taking
one brigade from the 2nd Armoured Division,
leaving the other brigade available for despatch
to Greece; both brigades would consist of one
Cruiser regiment and one light tank regiment
only. I decided to send part of the Support
Group with each brigade and to send the Head-
quarters of the 2nd Armoured Division to
Cyrenaica. General Tilly, soon after reaching
Egypt, had died and Major-General Gambier-
Parry was now in command of the division.

To increase the armoured troops in
Cyrenaica, I decided to form a unit from
captured Italian medium tanks.

Conversations with Greek Government.
rz. At the conversations held at Tatoi Palace
on the evening of 2and February, the Greek
Commander-in-Chief, General Papagos, des-
cribed his proposals for defence in the event
of a German attack on Greece. It will be ob-

vious that against a German attack through
Bulgaria the long narrow ‘strip of Macedonia
and Western Thrace would be, in spite of the
limited approaches through the mountain
ranges to the north, extremely difficult to de-
fend owing to the lack of depth. The Greeks
had a fortified line covering
Macedonia which had considerable strength;
but the greater part of the garrison had already
been taken for operations in Albania, and the
troops remaining, even with the proposed
British reinforcements, would be insufficient to
hold this long jine. The same objections
applied to a somewhat shorter position
approximately on the line of the Struma Valley
covering Salonika, West of Salonika there
was a much shorter and naturally strong de-
fensive line along the line of hills west of the
Vardar, following in part the line of the
Aliakhmon river. This defensive position was
called by General Papagos the “ Aliakhmon
Line.’”? He stated that, if the Yugoslavs would
act as allies, there was every advantage in
holding a line covering Salonika since this was
the only port through which munitions and
supplies could be sent to Yugoslavia; in view,
however, of the dubious attitude of the Yugo-
slavs it was impossible to tely on their co-
operation; and he therefore proposed to with-
draw the Greek troops in Macedonia and
Eastern Thrace, except for covering detach-
ments, to the Aliakhmon Line to prepare a
defensive position there. He also indicated that
it would probably be necessary to begin the
withdrawal of the Greek forces in Albania to a
shorter line and to use a part of them for the
reinforcement of the Aliakhmon Line, He stated
that it would require some twenty days to with-
draw the troops in Macedonia and that he would
then have a concentration of thirty-five
battalions on the Aliakhmon line with one or
two divisions in reserve, When joined by the
British contingent, this would constitute a
formidable aatcnalys force in a very strong.
natural position. The main danger to it lay
in the exposure of the left- flank if German
forces succeeded in! advancing through
Southern Yugoslavia and in entering Greece
by the valley of the Cherna or Monastir Gap.
Tt was considered, however, that the Yugo-
slavs, even if they would not beforehand make
common cause with the Allies in resisting the
Germans, would fight to deny them passage
through Yugoslavia and that, if so, the
mountainous nature of the country would make
the German turning movement slow and
difficult. 3

The proposals of General Papagos appeared
to offer a reasonable prospect of establishing
an effective defence against German aggres-
sion in the north-east of Greece. It was recog-
nised that our chief dangers would come from
our inferiority in the air, the uncertainty of
the Yugoslav attitude and the dangers to our
shipping in the narrow waters of the Aegean.
Tt was considered, however, that the import-.
ance of bringing timely assistance to Greece
was such that these risks were acceptable. The
conference. agreed to the proposals of General
Papagos; and it was understood that he would
at once begin the withdrawal of troops from
Macedonia to the Aliakhmon line.

for the despatch of the force to Greece, the
Foreign Secretary and the Chief of the Imperial
