SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

The Mersing area was strongly defended. It
was covered by a large number of anti-tank
and anti-personnel mines, though the effective
life of these in the humid climate of Malaya is
limited.

385. On the 14th January, when contact was
first made on this front, Eastforce (Brigadier
‘Taylor) was composed of :— '

22 Australian Brigade Group.

2/17 Dogras (released from the Singapore
Garrison).

Detachments of the Johore Military Forces.

Administrative Units.

It was disposed with two battalions holding
the Mersing area with detachments forward at
‘Endau, one battalion at Jemaluang, and one
‘(2/17 Dogras) watching the long and vulner-
-able communications back to Kota Tinggi. On
the night r7th/18th January, as has been re-
.corded, the Jemaluang battalion was trans-
-ferred to the Muar area, but later a weak Indian
battalion was placed under command for
defence of the Kahang aerodrome, and also an
anti-aircraft and an anti-tank troop.

386. On the 14th January contact was made
with an enemy force moving down the coast
from Kuantan at Pontian north of the River
Endau. After some patrol encounters our
troops fell back behind the River Endau. The
‘loss of the battalion from Jemaluang on the
17th/18th January caused some re-adjustment
of the defences as a result of which the Endau
“detachment was withdrawn and the road
between Endau and Mersing heavily cratered.

387. On the 2st January an enemy force
‘approaching Mersing from the North was
‘ambushed by our fighting patrols and suffered
heavy casualties On that day, in accordance
with decisions taken at the Yong Peng Con-
ference (see above) the Commander Eastforce
was given the role of holding Jemaluang with
:detachments forward in the Mersing area. On
the zand a Japanese attempt to cross the river
at Mersing was repulsed with heavy loss.
During the night zand/23rd January one
battalion (2/18 Battahon A.1.F.) with support-
‘ing arms was withdrawn to the Nithsdale
Estate between Mersing and Jemaluang, the
forward troops remaining in the Mersing area.

On the 23rd a naval convoy was sighted
between Singgora and Mersing moving south.

388. At 0745 hours on the 26th January our
air reconnaissances reported two transports and
some smaller craft escorted by two cruisers and
twelve destroyers closing the shore at Endau.
This convoy was twice attacked during the
day by Hudson, Albacores and Vickers
Vildebeeste aircraft escorted by Hurricanes and
Buffalos. Each time a large force of Japanese
Navy Zero fighters operating from Kuantan
was met and there was much air fighting. A
minimum of 13 enemy fighters were destroyed
while we lost 1 Vickers Vildebeeste, 2 Hurri-
canes and 1 Buffalo. Both enemy trans-
ports were hit, but the landing was not pre-
vented. Our Air Striking Force in Malaya,
even such as it was, had now vanished. On
the night 26th/27th January H.M. Australian
destroyer ‘‘ Vampire ’’ and H.M.S. ‘‘ Thanet ”
were sent to sweep up the coast and attack the
Japanese transports. Off Endau they fell in
with and engaged three destroyers and a
eruiser. The ‘Thanet’? was sunk and a
Japanese destroyer severely damaged.

389. The fresh enemy troops advanced rapidly
from Endau and at midmght 26th/27th
January their leading battalion marched into
an ambush which had been prepared for them
in the Nithsdale Estate, There was confused
and bitter hand-to-hand fighting during the
night, in the course of which over 300 of the
enemy were killed while our losses in killed,
wounded and missing were less than roo. Our
ambush troops then fell back through the
Jemaluang position.

SecTION XXXIX.—THE WITHDRAWAL TO
SINGAPORE ISLAND 27TH-3IST JANUARY, 1942.

390. The Plan.—On the 27th January I
teceived a telegram from the Supreme Com-
mander South West Pacific giving me dis-
cretion to withdraw to Singapore Island
if I considered it advisable. On that
day the full significance of the dispersal
of the Batu Pahat Force and the opening to
the enemy of the West Coast road became
apparent. Our remaining troops on that road
were not strong enough to stop the enemy’s
advance for long and there were no reserves
available. The 18 British Division had not
yet arrived. I felt that any further delay might
result in the loss of the whole of our forces on
the mainland. I therefore decided to authorise
a withdrawal to Singapore Island, even though

:this meant failure to achieve our object of pro-

tecting the Naval Base. I accordingly approved
a plan which was already being worked out by
the Commander 3 Indian Corps for this with-
drawal.

391. In anticipation of such a withdrawal
certain preliminary steps had already been
taken, among which were the following : —

(a) An outline withdrawal plan had been
issued on the 24th January.

(®) Orders had been given to begin thin-
ning out the Anti-Aircraft guns and search-
lights from South Johore.

\(c) The Rear-Admiral Malaya had been re-
quested to arrange for all craft on the north
shores of the Straits of Johore to be either
sunk or removed to the south shores of Singa-
pore Island.

(2) Arrangements had been made to insert
explosives under the Causeway and to
destroy the lock at the north end of the
Causeway.

(e) The organization of the defences of
Singapore Island had been planned.

392. The Plan, which was approved at a
conference held at Headquarters 3 Indian Corps
at Johore Bahru on the 28th January, was in
outline as under: —

(2) A co-ordinated withdrawal to take
place simultaneously on all four routes.

(b) The final withdrawal to the Island to
be on the night 30th-3rst January.

(c) The final withdrawal through the
Johore Bahru area to be carried out rapidly
in M.T. . ;

(@) All withdrawals to be Carried ‘gut by
night in accordance with a pre-arranged pro-
gramme.

(e) Anti-aircraft defence to be arranged for
the protection of all bottle-necks. In par-
ticular, the maximum anti-aircraft defence to
be concentrated for the protéction of troops
moving over the Causeway.
