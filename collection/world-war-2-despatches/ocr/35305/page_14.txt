I visited H.M. the King of the Belgians and
General Van Overstraeten and reached agree-

ment that the Belgian 1st Corps should be .

withdrawn from the area of znd Corps and that
the left boundary of the B.E.F. should be
adjusted so as to allow the Belgians the use of
the road Vilvorde-Alost for this purpose. I
also stressed the importance of having fresh
Belgian troops established early in position
north of Louvain to continue the British line
covering Brussels.

Further serious news came from the south
where the enemy had crossed the Meuse between
Sedan and Méziéres, and further north he was
reported to be surrounding the fortress of St.
Héribert (4 miles S.S.W. of Namur).

The French Cavalry Corps on my right had
on the previous day received orders to retire
to the Perwez position whence they subsequently
withdrew, according to plan, to the main position
running through Gembloux.

At the request of Air Marshal Barratt I
placed at his disposal for use on the French
front three squadrons of fighters which I had
only recently received in response to an urgent
appeal to the Secretary of State for War.

23. On 15th May the Dutch Army laid down
its arms; the immediate effect of this on the
operations of the B.E.F. was small, for the
British forces operating in Holland had at no
time been under my command. I anticipated,
however, that this would come as a shock to
the Belgian Army.

The French 7th Army withdrew its advanced
formations to the neighbourhood of Antwerp
and on this day ordered divisions to move across
my rear to fill the gap created further south.
This move, however, did not take place till
some three days later when it was accomplished,
thanks to efficient traffic control, with little
delay to our own movements.

On this day (15th May) I established a
command post at Lennick St. Quentin, 6 miles
west of Brussels. On the British front, the day
passed quietly on the whole. 1st Corps was not
attacked in strength ; 3rd Division of znd Corps
was attacked north-west of Louvain and its
forward positions were penetrated, but a counter-
attack successfully restored the original line.
There was considerable enemy bombing of
rearward areas during the day, and the movement
of refugees became increasingly difficult to
control, This was, in part, due to the bombing
of Tournai and other towns on the routes and
to the French decision to close the frontier to
pedestrian and horsed traffic. Despite my
requests, made as early as roth May, the Belgian
authorities had done nothing to restrict the use
of private motor cars or the sale of petrol.

During the day I received a request that I
should take over part of the front held by the
French division on my right. To meet this
request I placed under the orders of this division
a brigade of 48th Division; this step proved
necessary since at about 6 p.m. the enemy had
penetrated the French front, thus threatening
the right of 2nd Division. By this time, how-
ever, 48th Division, less one brigade, was in
position in ist Corps reserve behind 2nd
Division, and I agreed with the commander of
ist Corps that the withdrawal of his right
should take place to the River Lasne to join
up with the French left. This movement was
carried out on the night of the 15/16 May,
closely followed by the enemy.

SUPPLEMENT 10 Taz LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, IQ4I

By the night of 15th May the movements
envisaged in Plan D were all running ahead of
schedule, 4th Division was moving into Corps
reserve behind 3rd Division; 5th Division was
moving on to the Senne in place of 50th Division
as originally planned, and the latter was now
moving to G.H.Q. reserve along the River
Dendre.

OPERATIONS—SECOND PHASE
(r7th-26th MAY)

Withdrawal to the Escaut decided on; the threat
to Arras and to the right flank; formation of
Macforce and deployment of 23rd Division on
the Canal du Nord. The enemy reaches the
Somme and cuts communications with the Base ;
Calais and Boulogne invested: the admini-
strative position. The organisation of the Canal
line. Alternative lines discussed with French
and Belgians, resulting in further withdrawal
Jrom the Escaut to the Frontier defences and
Sresh plans for attacks southwards in conjunction
with French main forces. 5thand 50th Divisions
counter-attack on 21st May. A attack
im conjunction with French planned for
26th May: this plan is abandoned owing to
penetration of Belgian line on the Lys.

The beginning of the withdrawal (16th-17th May)

24. By 16th May, it became clear that a
prolonged defence of the Dyle position was
impracticable. The French rst Army on my
right were unlikely to make good the ground
lost’ on the previous day, notwithstanding the
support I had given them in the air and on the
ground, and a further withdrawal seemed likely
to be forced on them by events in the south.

On the other hand there had been no serious
attack on the Belgian positions on my left ;
nevertheless, any withdrawal from our present
positions would of necessity involve a withdrawal
by the Belgian Army in the course of which
Brussels, and probably Antwerp also, would be
abandoned to the enemy,

Very early on 16th May therefore, I sent a
representative to General Billotte who was
co-ordinating the movements of the British,
French and Belgian Forces; I asked that, if
he intended to withdraw, he should let me know
the policy and the timings at once, especially
as the first bound back to the Senne canals
involved a march of some fifteen to twenty
miles,

At about 10 a.m. I received from him orders
for a withdrawal to the Escaut, and for the
occupation of the positions along that river
originally planned. The operation was to begin
that night (16/17 May), one day being spent on
the Senne and one day on the Dendre positions ;
thus the Escaut would be reached on the night
of 18/19 May, though the French orders did
not rule out the possibility of staying for longer
than one day on each bound.

That evening, I held a co-ordinating con-
ference at rst Corps Headquarters as a result
of which I ordered 5th Division, which was on
the way to join 2nd Corps, to the line of the Senne
in rst Corps reserve. Two brigades of 46th
Division* which had been moved up from the
Lines of Communication for the protection of

* One of the three divisions sent to France for
pioneer duties.
