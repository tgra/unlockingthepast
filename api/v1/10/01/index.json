            "description": "56. It was on 1st October, 1940, that radar was first used to control anti-aircraft gunfire. The first sets had actually been received at the end of 1939 but a delay in applying them to anti-aircraft work had been caused by their complete inability to give any indication of the height of the aircraft and the intervening months had been spent in trying to overcome this handicap. In this work I must especially mention the untiring and valuable help given by Major-General M. F. Grove-White, és. D.S.0:, O.B.E., at that time G.O.C.2 AA Division. The only use to which it had been Possible to put the few available sets was direction-finding, but, as the heights still had to be found visibly by a height-finder, there was only a very small improvement on the old system, in that targets could be picked up a little earlier. .",

            "description": "On 1st October General McCreery assumed command of Eighth Army in succession to General Leese, who had been appointed to command Allied Land Forces in South-eastern Asia. It was a well-deserved promotion for one who had worthily carried on the traditions established by General Montgomery and who had made his mark on the campaign in Italy by his handling of large forces in the Liri valley battles. General McCreery had commanded 10 Corps since the. first landings at Salerno. That operation might be said to typify the kind of task in which he had ever since been engaged, the achievement of vital results with limited resources, by hard fighting in difficult terrain where a scientific adjustment of means to ends called for constant changes of tactics and all the craft of generalship. The first crossing of the Garigliano, and the operations east of Arezzo, are further examples of his successful use of the strategy of deception. I was well acquainted with General McCreery’s qualities as a scientific soldier with a gift for the offensive from the time when he had been my Chief of Staff for the Alamein campaign and onward to final victory in Tunisia, and was therefore particularly pleased to have him as one of my Army Commanders.",

            "description": "Fifth Army meanwhile had been experiencing difficulties of a different kind. The landings at Salerno had met stiff opposition, and the accumulation of supplies had to be made under enemy fire; but the administrative planning had been very thorough, and the arrangements made proved very satisfactory until bad weather on D plus r2 stopped all unloading for three days. Salerno port, though soon captured, was initially rendered unusable by enemy shellfire, and the harbour at Castellamare was found to have been so damaged as to be useless; but the small port of Torre Annunziata was captured in good repair by the end of September and this, with the use of Salerno and of various beaches, sufficed thereafter until the opening of the port of Naples. When this city was entered on 1st October it was found that the port had been most systematically obstructed and the facilities there destroyed. The resuscitation of the port was immediat put under way, with such ingenuity and to su good effect that by the second week of October it was already discharging 5,000 tons per day. This was sufficient to keep Fifth Army supplied with essential commodities but owing to the accelerated arrival of new formations and the partly unforeseen demands of the civilian population reserve stocks were not built up according to schedule.",

            "description": "The first phase of this plan was already practically completed when I wrote and, after the pause, we proceeded with the second phase. -Fifth Army had a hard struggle for the passes leading down into the plain of Naples but by 28th September ro Corps was through and the King’s Dragoon Guards entered the great city at 0930 hours on 1st October. Eighth Army's principal objective, Foggia and its airfields, had fallen four days before on the 27th. On Doth fronts the pursuit went on, but it was slower now. On 6th October Fifth Army stood along the line of the Volturno River and realised that it would have to force a crossing against strong resistance; Eighth Army had also left behind the early days of rapid advance across the open country of Apulia and the line ran clear across Italy through the mountains from Termoli to Benevento and Capua and down to the Tyrrhenian at Castel Volturno. My _plan had been based on the German intention to withdraw to the Pisa-Rimini line and that intention had now been revoked on the highest authority; but before proceeding to discuss the effect of this new situation I must pause to describe the problems of administration which now faced us.",

            "title": "Fifth Army Sets Sights on Taranto: Assault Planned for October as Strategic Shift Takes Shape",
            "description": "An assault on Taranto had been considered earlier but rejected on what then seemed sufficient grounds. At the date proposed, Ist November, the weather was likely to be unsuit« able for beach maintenance, we should have lost too many landing craft in the three previous assaults (i.e., Sicily, Reggio and Cotrone) and air cover would be impossible since Taranto would be out of range of the majority of our fighters operating from the airfields in. north-eastern Sicily, These reasons were no longer cogent. No degree of success could change the November weather in this stormy part of Italy but it would ensure our being able to mount the assault earlier, and a provisional date of rst October could now be contemplated with some confidence. More landing craft were now available as a result of our light losses in the landings in Sicily and we had considerable hopes that it might be unnecessary to carry out one or other of the assaults at Reggio and Cotrone, per-. haps even both, with a consequent further saving in resources. As for air cover we now had hopes of a rapid advance to seize the airfields at Cotrone and in any case, if the Italian defences in Apulia were as feebly manned as in Sicily (and the German forces in the area were weak), a lesser scale of air support might be acceptable. The advantages of the operation were considerable, It would give us the Possession of ports through which a large force could be built up and it would place us in a geographically protected area on the same side of the Apennines as Foggia, the capture -of whose numerous airfields for the use of the Strategic Air Force was one of dur first objectives in Italy. Oni 22nd July, therefore, Fifth Army was directed to prepare plans for an operation ‘‘ to seizé and secure the Heel of Italy east of the line Taranto-Bari inclusive,’’ with target date 1st October, to be carried out under my command. Planning for the assault on Sardinia had already been cancelled on the 2oth and responsibility for this operation, together with that against Corsica, was handed over to the French. ‘With this decision the western islands passed out of the strategic picture; in the event the Germans withdrew from both, with a precipitancy which they probably later regretted. : :",
