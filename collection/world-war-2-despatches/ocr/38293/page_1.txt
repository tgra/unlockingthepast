\ TRANSPORTATION, OF THE ARMY TO GREECE AND
wy EVACUATION OF THE ARMY FROM GREECE, 1941.

}
' TRANSPORTATION OF THE ARMY TO
GREECE,

The following Despatch was submitted to the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on
the 11th December, 1941, by Admiral Sir
Andrew B. Cunningham, G.C.B., D.S.O.,
Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Station.

- Mediterranean.
rth December, 1941.

Orrration ‘‘ Lustre ’’.

Be pleased to lay before Their Lordships
-the following report concerning Operation
‘* Lustre ’’—the move to Greece of some 58,000
trJops with their mechanical transport, full
ejuipment and stores. The operation com-
menced on 4th March and ceased on 24th April
when the evacuation from Greece commenced.

2. The operation ‘was carried out in accord-
ance with the outlines contained in‘ the Com-
mander-in-Chief’s Operation Orders and, in
general, went according to plan.

3. The passage from Egyptian ports to the
Piraeus, vintually the only port of the country,
Jed past the enemy bases in the Dodecanese
from which ‘his air and sea forces were in a
good position to operate against our lines of
communication. Cover had also to be provided
against interference from enemy surface forces

from Italy. In consequence it was desirable to .

move as many personnel as possible in warships
whose high speed would také them quickly
through the danger zone. In-the event the
movement of personnel in H.M. Ships became
a necessity owing to the mining of the Suez
Canal ‘which prevented sufficient troopships
beaue available.

.' This policy proved successful and during the
etels period of this complicated operation no

59402

men or equipment were lost at sea-except for
a few casualties from bomb splinters in one
merchant ship. The losses sustained were either
in ships proceeding in the convoys but not con-
nected with ‘‘ Lustre’ or in anpS returning
empty (see Appendix),

4. During the greater part of the move a
proportion of the Battle Fleet was kept at sea to
the westward of Crete to provide heavy cover
for our forces. In addition, Operation M.C.9,
running a Malta convoy, was carried out
between ahs and 24th March whilst ‘‘ Lustre "’
still proceeded

5. The whole operation was smoothly carried
out owing to the hard work and willing spirit
shown in the'ships concerned. It threw a con-
siderable strain on the port of Alexandria where
nearly all commercial shipping movements had
to be stopped. The difficulties were, however,
overcome, including some trouble with Asiatic
crews of merchant ships, by a firm insistence
that, whatever the numbers of men or vehicles
the Army had ready to move, the demand must
oe eat and men and stores reach Greece without

elay.
