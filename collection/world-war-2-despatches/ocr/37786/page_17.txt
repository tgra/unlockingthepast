SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 13 NOVEMBER, 1946

ossible withdrawal of some British troops from

forth Africa to the Middle East for Aégean
operations was raised, General Eisenhower
replied that the ability of North Africa to furnish
British troops after the completion of the Tuni-
sian campaign depended upon the decisions of
the Combined Chiefs of Staff on the course of
operations in the Mediterranean, following the
planned invasion of Sicily. He declared, there-
fore, that the movement of troops from North
Africa to Middle East should follow, and not
precede, these decisions.

180. Nevertheless, although the prospect of
obtaining troops from North Africa was uncer-
tain, a detailed plan for a full-scale attack on
Rhodes and Scarpanto, and the subsequent
occupation of other islands, was produced by
and May. The principal feature of the plan
was the landing of forces two hundred and fifty
miles from their nearest air bases in Cyprus,
and still farther from Cyrenaica, and the crux
of the operation was the provision of the
necessary air cover and adequate air reinforce-
ments. But to offset this difficulty, other large-
scale operations would probably be in progress
in the Central Mediterranean to deter the enemy
from reinforcing the A®gean.

181. The minimum troop requirements for the

whole Agean operation, including garrisons for
Rhodes, Scarpanto and other islands, were three
infantry divisions, one armoured brigade, two
independent infantry battalions, two parachute
battalions and corps troops.

182. This plan was produced by No. 2 Plan-
ning Staff, which had just been formed in Cairo,
and which was composed mainly of officers of
the 3rd Corps Headquarters. No. 2 Planning
Staff was re-designated Force 292 in June, 1943,
when it seemed likely that active operations in
the Aigean were to be undertaken and a Force
Headquarters would be required to conduct
operations in the field. But the uncertainty of
Turkey’s attitude, the complexities of the poli-
tical situation in the Balkans, and the needs of
Sicily and Italy made detailed planning diffi-
cult, and during the nine cious from May,
1943, no less than seven plans were produced
for the capture of Rhodes, Crete and other
islands in the Dodecanese and the Aigean.

183. The scope of each plan varied in rela-

tion to the object to be attained, the varying
degrees of opposition likely to be encountered
and thescale of co-operation of the Turkish Gov-
ernment. The early plans, which envisaged not
only the capture of the Dodecanese and Aigean
Islands but further operations on the mainland
of Greece, had to provide for crushing both
German and Italian resistance. Later plans,
after the collapse of Italy, dealt only with the
capture of Rhodes or Crete held by the German
garrisons supported by Fascist elements of the
Italian garrisons. In some cases the plans had
to be made in the absence of a Naval Planning
Section, and consequently were never fully
completed.

184. On four occasions a force was assembled
and partially prepared to undertake the capture
of Rhodes. As the collapse of Italy appeared
imminent, the 8th Indian Division was actually
embarked and rehearsed in a landing operation
at Suez. This rehearsal took place on 24th,
25th and 26th August and the force was to be
teady to sail on rst September. Unfortunately,
however, on 26th August I was informed that
the transports had received orders to proceed

B

to India,* and the force was disembarked and
teturned to its stations; the 8th Indian Divi-
sion was sent to Italy almost immediately.
When, on 8th September, the Italian armistice
was announced and an opportunity for seizing
the island arose, the shipping and the force
which had been specially prepared for a quick
seizure of Rhodes had been dispersed.

185. Thus the Italian armistice took me at a
complete disadvantage. Owing to the claims of
other Commands, a carefully planned and re-
hearsed operation had just been jettisoned and
no urgent action was contemplated in the imme-
diate future, since I was not kept informed of
what was afoot and first learned that Italy was
discussing terms only a few days before the
public announcement that the armistice had
been concluded. I therefore had neither time,
troops nor shipping to prepare to take ad-
vantage of the chances which were thus offered,
whilst, even before the Italian capitulation was
announced, the movements of German troops
in the Aegean and Ionian islands indicated that
they were preparing to be attacked there, and
that they expected to find the Italians of little
fighting value.

186. Events immediately following the
armistice showed that German plans to cope
with such an eventuality had been well laid,
and the attitude of General Vechiarelli, com-
mander of the Italian Eleventh Army, at
Athens, who refused to co-operate with us,
and whose troops were ultimately disarmed,
undoubtedly assisted the Germans to consoli-
date their positions. The German take-over in
Crete was accomplished quite smoothly, and
at Scarpanto the newly arrived German
Fortress Infantry Battalion had little difficulty
in asserting itself.

187. In spite of this, the opportunity for
seizing. Rhodes before the German ison
there could re-organise and adjust itself to the
changed’ circumstances (provided the Italian
garrison could exert itself in our favour) still
existed. I therefore decided to despatch the
234th Brigade, a regular brigadé which had
come from Malta in June, 1943, to the island,
to assist the Italians in overpowering the
Germans.

188. At this time the German air forces in

. Greece and the Aegean were not considered

sufficiently strong to constitute a major threat
to these operations, nor were their land forces
on Rhodes of any great consequence, consisting
as they did of one division, General Kleeman’s
“ Sturm ’’ Division, six thousand strong, which
was outnumbered by the Italians by six to one.

189. The expedition of the 234th Brigade was
to be preceded by a small mission whose task
was to make contact with the Italian com-
mander in Rhodes and induce him to take over

“It had been agreed at the Washington Anglo-
American Conference in May, 1943, that in order
to keep up the maximum pressure on the Japanese,
a combined operation against the Arakan should be
staged later in the year, This operation had been
given priority for resources after the main operations
against Italy. In view of the possible developments,
part of the shipping destined for the Arakan opera-
tion was held for a time in the Mediterranean. In
order to implement agreed strategy in the Far
East, however, it was necessary to release those ships
before the end of August. It was considered at |
the time that the Arakan operations would -have
been of greater benefit to the War as a whole than
the capture of Rhodes. In the event, however, the
Arakan operations were later cancelled.
