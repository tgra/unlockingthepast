SUPPLEMENT To tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 19. MAY, 1948

Nicut 24TH/25TH APRIL.

4. General Disposition.—Ships had. been
detailed to embark troops at Nauplia and
Raphtis as shown in paragraph 2 above.

5. Bombing of GLENEARN.—At 1745 on
24th April, whilst on passage to Nauplia, H.M.S.
GLENEARN was attacked by two Heinkel

ombers and was hit on the forecastle. The

chor and cable gear were destroyed and a

e started forward. The fire was extinguished
and the ship proceeded at 1845.

6, ULSTER _ PRINCE — Grounding.—
‘HLM.S. ULSTER PRINCE in attempting to
go alongside the quay ran ashore and, although
every endeavour was made to get her off by
towing, it was not possible to do so in the
time available. The following day she was
heavily bombed and gutted. Apart from the
loss of the ship which was severely felt during
the rest of the operation, this had an
unfortunate effect in that she was a physical
obstruction to destroyers and corvettes going
alongside, thus slowing down the rate of
embarkation at Nauplia on that and other
‘nights. I agree with the Commanding Officer
of H.M.S. ULSTER PRINCE that it was
unwise to attempt to put her alongside when
the information as 7 water, etc., was so
meagre. :

9. ‘Embarkation at Nauplia.—tt is estimated
that the following numbers were embarked : —

PHOEBE a

2,13

* GLENEARN | 5,100
VOYAGER ... .. ae 340
HYACINTH zs 113
Total ... 0. Z 6.685 |

8. Embarkation at Raphtis. aegis a. a slow
start owing to. lack of troops ready to embark,
things went smoothly’ and ‘about 5,000 were
embarked in GLENGYLE and 7oo in H.M.S.
CALCUTTA

3051

II. Disposition for night’s embarkation.—
F.0.A.M.’s programme provided for embarka-
tion at Megara in PENNLAND, THURLAND
CASTLE, COVENTRY, WRYNECK,
DIAMOND and GRIFFIN commencing at
2200. I also despatched WATERHEN and
VENDETTA, on. their arrival at Suda with
A.N.29, to assist. DECOY, HASTY and
HAVOCK were detached to Nauplia to investi-
gate the situation there as regards troops and
the ULSTER PRINCE and were ordered to
embark any troops available and convey them
to Suda.

- 12: S.S. PENNLAND.—During the after-
noon the PENNLAND was bombed and
damaged. H.M.S, GRIFFIN was ordered to
stand by till dark. Later the PENNLAND was
again attacked and damaged and eventually
sank. H.M.S. GRIFFIN picked up the
survivors and 1 sturned to Suda.- I therefore
diverted DECOY, HASTY and HAVOCK from
Nauplia to Megara La embark PENNLAND’s

* quota as far as possible.

25TH APRIL.
g. Convoy to  Alexandria—Diversion.— .
H.M.S. .ORION arrived Suda at 184:

: 5.

H.M. Ships GRIMSBY and VOYAGER with
certain ships from Suda were then leaving
harbour for Alexandria. It was explained to
the Naval Officer-in-Charge, Suda, that the
contents of several-of the ships which had just
sailed would be urgently required at Suda, e.g.
food and coal. GRIMSBY was therefore
ordered to return to Suda with THEMONI,
‘ROCOS, ZEALAND and KIRKLAND, and
VOYAGER to continue with the remainder
comprising CHERRYLEAF and some Greek

ips.
(x0. General Situation—The military situa-
tion in Greece was obscure. The numbers to
be evacuated were given in F.O.A. M. ’s* 1813

13. On my arrival at Suda I conferred with
the Naval Officer-in-Charge and later took
H.M. Ships ORION, PERTH, PHOEBE and

During the whole of this time I was in
constant anxiety with regard to fuel. There
was none at Suda and R.F.A. .BRAMBLE-
