ENCLOSURE 2 To F.O.C. Dover’s LeriEr.

From Senior Officer, gth M.T.B. Flotilla.

DaTE 27th September, 1943.

To Senior Officer, H.M.M.T.B.s,
Dover.

I have the honour to submit the following
report of the action on the night of 26th/27th
September off Point du Haut Banc between a
combined Motor Torpedo Boat and Motor Gun
Boat force and an escorted enemy convoy.

Own Forces.

2. Force A, M.T.B.s 202 (S.O.), 204 and
231, and Force B, M.G.B.s 108 (S.O.), 118
and 117. S.O. Force A was in command of
the combined forces.

Object.
3. To intercept and destroy northbound con-

voy which was expected to be on passage from
Le Havre.

Weather Conditions.

4. Visibility moderate to westward, poor to
eastward, due to clouds and land giving no
horizon; sea moderate; swell short; wind N.W.
force 4*; squally.

Narrative.

5. Forces A and B slipped at 2325/26th and
proceeded in accordance with Vice-Admiral,
Dover's signal timed 1545 on 25th September
(copy attached). AA buoy was passed at 0046
and course was set through swept channel until
Point du Haut Banc was bearing east, when
course was altered to east. When forces were
9 miles east of Point du Haut Banc, radar was
switched on and M.T.B.s came in single star-
board cruising line. M.G.B.s were in single port
cruising line. This formation is always used
when approaching patrol line as no signalling
is allowed by me unless in emergency, and
speed can be reduced or increased without
danger of collision.

6. Forces stopped in position Point du Haut
Banc 5 miles at 0202 and engines were cut.
Position was checked with bearings from
Etaples and Point du Haut Banc lights and
constant radar watch was kept. As the horizon
to the westward was far better than to the east-
ward and it was suspected that northbound
convoys used the inshore route, I decided at
0245 to move 1} miles more inshore, where
forces stopped and cut engines at o251.
Although the weather was too bad for proper
use of hydrophone, watch was kept as well as
with radar. A faint ‘‘ ping ’’ noise was heard
in the hydrophone and at 0307 a faint pro-

eller effect was obtained through the inter-
erence. By this time the radar as well was
giving echoes and ‘‘ hydrophone up” was
‘ ordered. The ship was rolling too much to use
the radar echoes for plotting the enemy move-
ments accurately.

7. Enemy was sighted at 0308 when clear of
a low dark cloud obscuring the horizon. Imme-
diately after the first radar echoes were
obtained fast signalling with a blue light was
seen on the same bearing as given by radar
and hydrophone, being south zo degs. west,
thus confirming by visual contact the

technical ones. As it could be seen that
under «the present circumstances the enet
would be passing too close to the seaward of
us, I ordered both forces to start up at 0309,
and proceeded on course north-east to get more
inshore. I steered north-east and not east
so as to prevent showing more silhouette than
was necessary. Speed at first 12 knots and
later increased to 20 knots for reasons of wash.
The enemy was expected to do 9 knots. Enemy
was kept in radar touch all the time.

8. At 0317 forces were stopped in position
290 degs. Point du Haut Banc 1.8 miles and
the ships’ heads kept pointing in the direc-
tion of the enemy to keep the silhouette small.

At 0319 the enemy was sighted again in the
form of several still, small, dark shapes.

g. At 0320 several starshells exploded dead
above us. Immediately afterwards a most
violent battle started in the direction of the
enemy. Radar gave a range of 2,000 yards
to the enemy. I ordered the forces to start
up and proceeded on course north-west, speed
36 knots, in order to get to the seaward of the
enemy forces and the shore batteries. An
attack under these circumstances was out of
the question. It could not be observed where
the starshells were coming from. No small arms
fire was directed at us except some stray
bullets. Shell fire, however, was experienced.
At 0323 speed was reduced to 22 knots so as
not to damage the engines. Boats were bump-
ing heavily against the swell.

Io. In the light of the starshells the bows
and bow waves of nine E or R-boats* forming a
screen ahead of the convoy could be seen in
line abreast, six of which seemed to be point-
ing in our direction, giving the impression
of being in pursuit of us. No fire from these
ships however seemed to be directed at us.
The whole situation was rather puzzling.

rz. When the enemy convoy was south of
us the gunboats on our starboard quarter swung
into attack to create a diversion, passing astern
of the M.T.B.s to the south-west, in accord-
ance with plans discussed previously. When
the M.T.B.s had cleared the light arc of the
starshells and I considered that the gunboats
had attracted the attention of the enemy effec-
tively, course was altered to the north and
later to the north-east, speed 30 knots, and east
at 0328. Speed varied between 30 knots and
18 knots as convenient. Radar touch was kept
all the time. Force was stopped at 0337 in
position 350 degs. Point du Haut Banc 4.2
miles, when range was 4,500 yards and M.T.B.s
were well inshore of the enemy route.

12. When the inshore position was reached,
Force B was ordered to attack from the sea-
ward. By the time, however, Force A attacked,
no diversion from seaward took place. When
the enemy came up north the M.T.B.s slowly
closed in, keeping well out ,of sight of the
screen ahead. The enemy, ‘however, sil-
houetted against a fairly light horizon, could
be observed with ease from about 1,800 yards.
As soon as the screen ahead of the convoy
passed, the M.T.B.s increased speed to between
8 and 12 knots, closing in to about 1,400
yards.
