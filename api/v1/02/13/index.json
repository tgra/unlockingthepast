            "description": "552. On the morning of the 13th February the Rear-Admiral Malaya decided to sail all the remaining ships and sea-going craft to Java during the night 13th-14th February and to leave Singapore himself. There was accom- modation on these ships and small craft for about 3,000 persons in all, in addition to the crews. It was the last opportunity that could be foreseen for any organized parties to leave Singapore. At a meeting held by the Rear- Admiral the vacancjes were divided between the Services and the Civil Government. One thousand eight hundred vacancies were allotted to the Army."

A new bridgehead was established by 33 Corps opposite Myinmu, in the teeth of determined opposition on the part of the Japanese, who took it to be part of a major encircling movement against Mandalay in conjunction with the forces in the Singu bridgehead to the north. They accordingly threw in most of their available reserves to combat it. A feint crossing was made far to the south, opposite Seikpyu, while the main thrust was made a little upstream, opposite Myitche, where 4 Corps was able to establish a foothold against comparatively light opposi- tion from the enemy, who still underestimated the threat to his left flank. When this bridge- head had been consolidated, a motorised brigade was concentrated behind its lines."

This attack met with considerable resistance on the part of the enemy, who was entrenched behind strong wire, and used armoured cars. After severe fighting the enemy was driven out leaving a number of prisoners, 5 armoured cars and some artillery and other weapons in our hands. The attack was led by the 2nd Gold Coast Regiment, with great gallantry. Although the leading troops of this Battalion had prac- tically all their white personne] killed or wounded, the attack was pressed home with unabated vigour and courage."

            "description": "only. [he main body of gth Indian Infantry Brigade was ordered to remain in the Metemma area, so that they could be quickly switched to the main front. By 1st February the enemy was on the move, pursued by the mechanised column consisting of the carriers of 9th Indian Infantry Brigade and a Motorised Company of 3/12 Frontier Force Regiment, preceded by a detachment of 21 Field Company, Sappers and Miners. The enemy\u2019s retirement on this front was much less hurried than on the 4th and 5th Indian Divisional lines of advance and great delay was imposed by his lavish use of mines along the seventy miles from Metemma to Chelga. It was in clearing these mines that Second-Lieutenant Bhagat of 21 Field Com- pany, Sappers and Miners, earned his V.C. for cool and conspicuous gallantry and endurance over a long period. After crossing the River Gandwa, where our mechanised column first made contact with the remnants of the Italian garrison of Karawa which was retreating in dis- order harassed by the patriots, steady progress was made, and by roth February, contact was made with the Abyssinian patriots jn Wahni. By 13th February, 9th Indian Infantry Brigade, less 3/12 Frontier Force Regiment, was con- centrated in Gedaref, leaving 3/12 Frontier Force Regiment supported by 144 Field Regi- ment, less one battery, 21 Field Company and one troop of \u2018 X \u2019\u2019 Light A.A.

The river here is about 1,500 yards wide. and the current is strong (three knots). High ground to the south-east gave the enemy observation over the area initially. Not being an ideal crossing- place, it was only lightly defended. Moreover it was the junction of 31 and 33 Japanese Divisions, which, as was hoped, led to confusion when we struck. The crossing was made by 100 Brigade on the night 12th-13th February, and, by the following night, a bridgehead six miles wide by two miles deep had. been developed. The success of this operation was in great measure due to the diversionary attacks made elsewhere by 32 Brigade which attracted troops away from the real crossing. This crossing by 20 Indian Division is also notable for the fact that it was supported by the only Corps artillery concentra- tion attempted during the whole campaign. Generally, the artillery\u2019s r\u00e9le was unspectacular but it should not be thought for that reason. that it was unimportant. The often few guns in action, brought forward sometimes by tremendous effort, played a vital r\u00e9le and Commanders repeatedly commented on the effectiveness of the fire support that was provided."

The difficulties likely to be encountered in an event of a forced with- drawal across this river were especially stressed. It also pointed out that the loss of Pegu would be likely to seal the fate of Rangoon and referred to the policy of stocking bases in Ceniral Burma with a view to continuing the campaign and covering the road to India in the event of Rangoon being lost. It ended with an appeal for more troops, especially British, as early as possible. ."
