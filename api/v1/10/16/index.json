            "description": "248. During the period, 16th October to 7th November, two British and five Italian sub- marines operated to Leros from Beirut and Haifa. The turn-round was estimated to be fourteen days and it was expected that 150 tons a week could be supplied by this method. The main limitation was the Royal Navy\u2019s inability to sail the submarines during the period of the full moon owing to the risks involved. Another limiting factor was the size and weight of the package that could be carried, the ideal being a 16-inch cube\u2019. which could be lifted by one man. However, this limitation was overcome by close co-operation between the submarine com- manders and the army personnel responsible for loading, and amongst other awkward loads twelve Bofors guns, six\u2019 2-pounder guns and one Jeep were. sent, in addition to eighteen | M.M.Gs. and 250 tons of more easily handled stores."

The report is lengthy owing to the need to caver, if only superticially, the very many different aspects of what is acknow- Jedged to be\u2019 the greatest amphibious opera- tion in history. Because the report is'so bulky, I have decided to write this covering letter in a form which will enable those who wish to do so to obtain a bird\u2019s eye view of the operation \u2018as-a whole, including the preparatory period and the build-up,\u2019 without going into detail."
