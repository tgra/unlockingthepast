1366 SUPPLEMENT to tas LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

air-raid shortly after 0400 hours on the 8th
Decémnber. Radar detected the approaching
raid at a distance) of 130-140 miles from
Singapore (giving more than 30 minutes warn-
ing). Its approach was promulgated from the
Fighter Control Operations Room. Unfor-
tunately the staff of this room was unable to
obtain any response from the H.Qs. of the
Civil A.R.P. organisation, with the result that
the civil population received no effective warn-
‘ing, nor was the Civil Air Defence Scheme put
into effective action until it was too late. Some

-17 aircraft took part in this raid, the majority

of the bombs falling at Seletar and Tengah.
At the latter place 3 Blenheims of No. 34 (B)
Squadron were damaged and the aerodrome
was cratered.

Japanese attacks on Northern Airfields.

182. Between 0730 and o800 hours, Kota
Bahru, Gong Kedah and Machang aerod:omes
were attacked by bombers and low-flying
fighters; except for dummy aircraft, the latter
two were unoccupied at the time. These
attacks were repeated throughout the day
mainly by low-flying fighters, with httle effect
save in delaying the refuelling and re-armament
of aircraft at Kota Bahru.

183. Sungei Patani, Penang and Butter-
worth in N,W. Malaya were also attacked
throughout 8th December by formations of
from 27 to 60 bomber aircrafl, with serious
results. The Japanese used light bombs only,
directed against aircraft and personnel; they
studiously avoided damaging aerodrome
surfaces. Personnel on the spot noted that for
the next few days Japanese attacks in this
area frequently synchronised with aircraft
landing or getting ready to take off. This
indicated a leakage of information to the
Japanese, but it was never definitely proved
that such a leakage actually occurred.

184. There was a particularly serious attack
against Alor Star, delivered immediately after
No. 62 (B) Squadron had landed after its
attack at Patani (para. 180). The aerodrome
was first bombed by 27 Japanese aircraft,
which then came down low and machine-
gunned aircraft on the ground. As a result
No. 62 (B) Squadron had only two serviceable.
aircraft left.

185. Nos. 21 (F) R.A.A.F. and 27 (NF)
Squadrons at Sungei Patani also suffered
badly and were each reduced to 4 serviceable
aircraft; and in consequence of the repeated
low attacks on this airfield both squadrons,
with their personnel, were withdrawn to Butter-
worth. It was later learnt that the guns in
the Buffaloes had given trouble and were all
unserviceable from lack of solenoids. The
serviceable Blenheim fighters of No. 27
Squadron had carried out periodic patrols over
N.W. Malaya wit out result. No 34 (B)
Squadron at Butterworth was also seriously
reduced.

Ground Situation in N.W. Malaya.

186. Aircraft losses from enemy attack thus
gravely weakened the air forces available in
N.W. Malaya for supporting the army, where
the main enemy advance on land was expected
to develop. On the 8th there was little enemy
air activity against our own ground forces,
owing to the enemy’s concentration on the
bombing of our aerodromes.

187. ‘‘ Matador ’’ had been cancelled during
the morning, andthe Army was taking up
positions forward of a partially prepared line
at Jitra. Covering forces were advancing
north and north-east from Kedah province:
one to make contact along the line of advance
from the Singora area, the other (Krohkol) to
occupy what was known as the Ledge, an
important tactical feature. across the Siamese
frontier on the Kroh-Patani road, which pro-
tected the communications of the force in
North Kedah.

The first of these covering forces made con-
tact with the enemy at 2130 hours on the
8th, at Ban Sadao, ten miles inside Siam. The
other (Krohcol) reported some opposition from
Siamese forces, but continued its advance.

Enemy landings in Stngora ind Patani area.

188. At o915 hours on the 8th December
the P.R. Beaufort returned from its recon-
naissance of the *Lakon Roads (para. 174).
En route, it had “been heavily attacked by
fighters and landed in a badly shot up con-
dition, subsequently having to be destroyed.
The pilot reported verbally that a large con-
centration of vessels was landing troops in the
Singora-Patani area. His photographs were
flown back to Singapore by the remaining
Buffalo fighter. Shortly afterwards, Norgroup,
under orders from IJIrd Corps, despatched 3
Buffaloes of No. 21 (F) Squadron R.A.A.F. on
a tactical reconnaissance to Singora. This
reconnaissance confirmed .the presence of the
main convoy in the Singora area and also
revealed a force of about 60 Japanese air-
craft, mainly fighters, on Singora aerodrome.

Squadrons driven out of aerodromes in N.E.
Malaya on 8th December.

189. It 1s now necessary to return to the
Kota Bahru area. Heavy fighting had been
going on on the beaches all day, and reserves
had been put in to try and regain the beaches
by counter attack. At 1245 news was received
at A.H.Q. of the landing of further troops from
one transport covered by a cruiser and several
destroyers. The Station Commander ‘at Kota
Bahru had at 1200 hours despatched 4 Hudsons
and 3 Vildebeestes to deal with this threat.
It transpired later that the report of this
further landing was false, but aircraft continued
mopping up barges and machine gunning
beaches. At 1530 a Hudson from Kota Bahru
bombed the railway bridge across the South
Golok River west of Kota Bahru, but with
doubtful success; the crew, however, observed
that the line itself had been partially destroyed
already at a point further eastward.

190. Towards 1600 hours reports received at
A.H.Q. indicated that the situation on_ the
ground had become serious. The Station Com-
mander reported that penetration had been
tnade up to the aerodrome boundary, and that
aircraft and personnel had come under
sporadic fire. On his representation
A.H.Q approved ithe evacuation of the
aerodrome. All aircraft were ordered to
Kuantan, personnel and stores to proceed by
train, whilst the denial scheme was to be put
ingjoperation This was successfully achieved,
ana 5 Hudsons and 7 Vildebeestes arrived at
Kuantan This withdrawal as far south as
Kuanlan was unavoidable because Gong
