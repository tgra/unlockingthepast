U.S. forces had to share port facilities in the Isle

of Wight area, it was evident! that co-ordina--

tion of naval plans in some detail would be
necessary on my level as the Allied Naval Com-
mander-in-Chief. This was effected smoothly
due to the loyal support of both Task Force
Commanders, but I am awate that the U.S.
naval authorities ‘had to exercise considerable
restraint in submitting to a degree of control
by superior authority on a level higher than
that to which they were accustomed. In their
teports the U.S. naval commazders have com-
mented that in their view my orders extended
to too much detail. No argument, however,

that thas -been produced since the operation °

has led me to change my opinion that full co-
ordindtion in detail was necessary on the
highest naval: level. .

Development of the Plan.

5. An outline plan for the operation had been
pfepared by *C.0.S.S.A.C, in July, 1943, and
was approved by the Combined Chiefs of Staff
at the Quebec Conference. Its‘ soundness was
proved later in detailed planning as in no

respect were its fundamentals altered, though’

its scope and range were extended. -On the
naval side, as the plan developed so the naval
requirements grew, and for some months we
were planning without being certain that our
full demands would be met. *Thhis uncertainty
was a constant anxiety to me and was onl
removed at the eleventh hour. ;

6. The naval problem that had to be faced
can be briefly summarised as’first the breaking
of the strong initial crust of the coast defences
by assault together -with the landing of the
. fighting army formations; and secondly to com-
mence, and continue without a'pause for five
or six weeks, their reinforcement at as high
a tate as possible. The first required the co-

ordination of the movement of thousands of |

ships and landing craft and aircraft and then
of their fire power, the second ‘the co-ordina-
tion of the activities of hundreds of thousands
of men and women of all services, both in the
United Kingdom and off the ,French coast,
marshalling, loading, sailing, unloading and
returning at least eight ship convoys a day in
addition to ten or twelve landing craft groups.
Considerations of time and space'did not permit
the use of any unexpected manceuvre to confuse
the enemy: we had simply to drive ahead in
great strength and to ensure that the organisa-
tion was as efficient as it could be, as the time
factor was all important. ©

7. The one fundamental question on which
there had to be early agreement was whether
to assault during darkness so as to obtain the
‘greatest measure of surprise on! the beaches,
or whether to assault after daylight and to
rely on the greatly increased accuracy of air
and naval bombardment under: these condi-
tions. The decision which was made, to make
a daylight landing, was in accord with experi-

ence in the Pacific against strong defences, .

when the assaulting force possessed decisive

naval and air superiority, and I am convinced

that this is the correct answer’ under these

conditions. When the decision was made there

were no beach obstructions in place on the

“Neptune ’’ beaches. Their later. appearance

would almost certainly have caused the decision
to be-revised, had it been originally made in
favouf of darkness, and it was very fortunate
that no change was necessary as, all training
and, to some extent, development of weapons.
was affected. It should, however, be noted
that there-was by no means general agreement
as to a daylight attack, and that even after
the initial decision had been agreed between:
the three Commanders-in-Chief of the Expedi-
tionary Force at least two vain efforts were
made to change it. : i

Administrative Planning.

8. Administrative Planning for a major cross-
Channel operation had been carried on in the
United Kingdom since May, 1942, by a skeleton
staff. As a result, preparations were far
advanced before the operational plan took
shape and the logistic requirements of the latter
were able to be fully met:

Enemy Miscalculations. : .

g: ‘Because the power of manceuvre at sea
was so limited the need for keeping the enemy

forces had to be controlled. I understand that
the success of the radio measures taken was
-an important contributory factor in securing
surprise. Other measures included the bert

of dummy landing craft in Dovér ‘and Négre .

Commands before D day and the parking of
PHOENIX and WHALE Units* at Selsey and
Dungeness. Arrangements were also made with
the Admiralty for the large number of com-
mercial ships that were destined for the Thames
and ships for loading to sail in later ‘‘ Nep-
tune ”’ convoys to wait in Scottish ports until

‘the operation began. Thus the concentration

of shipping automatically spread itself through-
out the ports of the United Kingdom and,
although most congested on the South Coast,
it was not confined to that area.

Io. Tactically, a naval diversion employing
light craft was carried out in the Straits of
Dover to support the air bombardment in this.
area simultaneously with the main assaults,
whilst a similar diversion was made in the
neighbourhood of Cap d’Antifer. In bdéth of
these and also off Cap Barfleur radio counter-
measures were employed by aircraft and by
the surface craft taking part to give an appear-
ance to enemy radar similar to that presented
by the real forces.. We now know that these
were very successful and were an instrumental
factor in enabling our forces to continue for so
long towards the enemy coast before their
composition could be determined.

Security.

rz. Complete security was maintained, and.
it is considered that the very highest satisfaction.
may be felt-that, despite the many hundreds.

of the plan, so far as is known there was no-
leakage. Some anxiety was felt on one or two:
occasions over individual cases in which orders.

to the instructions given, but no harm ‘is be-
lieved to have come of these isolated incidents.

and, when the very large number of documents.
