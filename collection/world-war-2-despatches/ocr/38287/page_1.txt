REPORT OF AN ACTION AGAINST AN
ITALIAN CONVOY ON THE NIGHT OF
THE 151H/16TH APRIL, 1941.

The following Despaich was submitted to the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on
the 8th June, 1941, by Admiral Sir
ANDREW B. CUNNINGHAM, G.C.B.,
D.S.O.,-Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean
Station.

Mediterranean.
8th June, Ig4r.

Be pleased to lay before Their Lordships the
attached report by Captain (D), Fourteenth
Destroyer Flotilla of the successful action fought
by the division of destroyers under his com-
mand against an Italian convoy on the night
of the 15th/16th April, 1941. ;

2. The search for the convoy was conducted
skilfully and with sound appreciation. The
action itself was conducted by all concerned
with determination and gallantry and was com-
pletely successful, resulting in the annihilation
of the convoy and escort. ‘

3. These results reflect the highest credit on
Captain P, J. Mack, Royal Navy, and the
forces under his command. The fighting spirit
and high standard of training of the ships con-
cerned is amply demonstrated by this incident.

4. The- loss of such a fine fighting unit as
H.M.S. MOHAWK is much to be regretted but
such losses by chance torpedoes in a mélée are
only to’ be expected, and it can be counted for-
tunate that Commander J. W: Eaton, Royal
Navy, and a large proportion of his ship’s
company were saved. :
