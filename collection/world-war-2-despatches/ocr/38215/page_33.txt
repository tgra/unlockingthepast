SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

was a large gap now between the main road

and Kedah peak.- East of the road, however,
‘our forward troops were still in position, but
they were now moved to block the main
road down which the enemy was advancing.
By, the afternoon the division was again in
confusion and the 28 Brigade was the only
ne which could for the time being be relied
upon. The Divisional Commander decided to
withdraw his force behind the River Muda
during the following might covered by the only
fresh troops which were available i.e. the In-
dependent Company which had just arrived
from Penang and one squadron of 3 Indian
Cavalry. Units of the 28 Brigade and the 2
East Surrey Regt. did some splendid work in
covering the withdrawal. As had happened
before, the premature demolition of bridges
was the cause of losses of many vehicles and
castiers.

179. By the morning of 16th December the

Division was south of the River Muda and had
passed into Province Wellesley. The 12
Indian Brigade Group (less one battalion) had
moved into position ion its right with one
battalion (the 5/2 Punjab Regt.) at Batu
Pekaka, an important bridge over the River
Muda, and the Argylls at Baling.
. 180. The Division was in no fit state for
further operations. Most of the men were tired
and dispirited. They badly needed time to re-
organise and refit. There had been a further
heavy loss of vehicles and weapons. Some of
these it was now impossible to replace. The
tanks had again played their part in the battle
of Gurun, but the enemy should not have been
allowed to penetrate as he did down the main
road. Later, lack of communications made it
difficult for formation commanders to control
the battle. The Divisional Commander
courageously tried to control the battle from a
carrier, but the thickly wooded’ country was
against him. All the infantry brigade Com-
manders had become casualties.

x8z. On the 15th December the R.A.F.
evacuated Butterworth aerodrome The 16
Light A.A. Battery had done some good work
in defence of this aerodrome, claiming 4 enemy
aircraft certain and 6 other probables brought
down.

182. Penang.—Although the Island of
Penang had been since 1936 (see Part I
Section VI) officially a fortress, it was in fact
in December, 1941, far from being one. The
garrison on the 12th December, 1941, consisted
of: —

Fortress Headquarters and Signals.
rz Coast Regt. Hong Kong and Singapore

Royal Artillery (two 6-in. batteries).

36 Fortress Company Royal Engineers

{manning searchlights).

One Company 5/14 Punjab Regt.

1 Independent Company.

Detachment of 3 Indian Cavalry.

The 3 (Penang and Province Wellesley)

Battalion S.S.V.F,

A Mixed Reinforcement Camp.
Administrative Detachments. a4

There were no anti-aircraft defences as the
guns and searchlights had not yet arrived from
the U.K. The civil airport was too small for
normal R.A.F. requirements. The only fighter
defence was provided by five Buffalo Fighters
which were able to operate for one day only
from the Butterworth aerodrome.

In addition to the Island the Commander

“Penang Fortress (Brig. Lyon) was responsible

also for a part of the Prai-Butterworth area’
on the mainland and for the Lines of Com-
munication area (North).

183. The original object of fortifying the
Island of Penang was to secure the anchorage
which lies between the Island and the main-
land from sea and air attack, as the Royal
Navy contemplated using it both for warships
and as a convoy collecting port.

184. The pre-war instructions to the Com-
mander 3 Indian Corps were to the effect that
rz Indian Division, if driven back, would fall
back on the axis of the main road and railway
communication arteries, leaving on Penang
Island, which would be held, up to two
additional infantry battalions with supporting
troops.

185. The effects of the first air attacks on
Penang on the roth and 1rth December have
already been described in Section XIX. On
the 13th December 50 Naval Ratings, survivors
from the “ Pririce of Wales ’’ and “‘ Repulse ‘”
arrived to operate the ferries, the crews of
which had disappeared.

On the 12th December at a meeting between
the Fortress Commander and the Resident
Counsellor it was decided to evacuate on the
following night all European Service families
and the Resident Counsellor was asked tc
arrange for the evacuation of all civilian
European ‘women and children. This decision
was taken as a normal measure to evacuate
“ pouches inutiles’’. The evacuation of the
sick and wounded from the military hospital
was also ordered.

186. On the 13th December the policy as re-
gards the defence of Penang had to be reviewed
in the light of the situation on the mainland
which has been described earlier in this Sec-
tion. There was avery real danger that the
tz Indian Division, which at this time was in
an exhausted and very disorganized condition,
would be overrun and cease to exist as a fight-
ing formation. There was also the danger that
the threat from Kroh, which was now much
greater than we had anticipated, would cut the
communications of the 11 Indian Division in
the Kuala Kangsar area. If either of these
things had happened, the enemy would have
had a clear run down the west coast, for there
were no other troops with which to oppose him
north of Johore, and by doing so he would have
cut the communications of 9 Indian Division
on the east coast. That was the situation we
had to face and we had the choice of trying to
fight the enemy both on the mainland and on
Penang Island or of concentrating the whole
of our resources for the battle on the mainland.
The anchorage was no longer of any use.

187. The matter was of such importance that
I brought it before the Far East War Council
on the morning of 14th December. The pros.
and cons. were discussed and carefully con-
sidered. It was decided that our ability to hold
Penang must depend upon the result of the
battle upon the mainland, and that we should
concentrate on averting the calamity which
threatened; further, that if we failed to stop
the enemy upon the mainland the policy would
be to evacuate what remained of the garrison
from Penang rather than leave the population
exposed to unrestricted air attack against which
we could provide them with no defence.
