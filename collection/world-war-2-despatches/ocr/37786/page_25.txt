so that they could take their place,in a British
field force.

258. The 2nd Polish Corps, under command
of General Anders, was the largest allied force
to be trained and equipped in this manner.

., In Augist, 1943, a Polish Corps of two infantry
, divisions and one tank brigade began to move

to Middle East from Persia and Iraq Command.
By the middle of October the first part of the
move was complete, and most of the corps was
concentrated for training in Southern Palestine.
At the end of November the corps moved to
Egypt, preparatory to moving overseas to
Italy. Here re-organisation took place on the
latest British war establishments, to bring the
corps into line with British formations and
units, and on roth December the move to Italy
began. The corps was landed in Italy fully
equipped with the exception of a small number
of technical vehicles, of which there were none
available in the Middle East.

259. The Fighting French have also been
trained and equipped by Middle East. In
February, 1943, General de Larminat requested
that a Fighting French Division should be
formed from the two independent Fighting
French Brigades then concentrated at Gambut.
This was agreed, andi the division was com-
pletely equip by the end of March and
moved from Tobruk to Tripoli on 18th April.
There it came under command of the roth
Corps and moved up to relieve the 51st Divi-
sion in the line at Enfidaville on 6th and 7th
May. A Fighting French Flying Column was
also placed under command of Eighth Army
during the advance to Tunisia. It came under
command of the 30th Corps at Ben Gardane,
and after a short attachment to the 4th Light
Armojired Brigade it passed, on 31st March,
under command of General Leclerc as part of
““L” Force, which had come up from Chad.

260. After the defearc of the enemy in
Tunisia, the French forces were withdrawn to
Tripolitania for re-organisation; the 1st Fight-
ing French Division was organised as a normal
British Division and the 2nd Fighting French
Armoured Division was formed from ‘‘L”’
Force, the Flying Column, two Tank Squad-
rons which had arrived from the Delta by
sea at the end of June, and from recruits from
Tunisia. The xst Fighting French Division
remained on British war establishments and
with British equipment, and its battle losses
were made up from the and Fighting French
Armoured Division, who were to be equipped
from American sources, Both divisions and
the 4th Fighting French Brigade passed under
French command at the end of August, French
forces in Syria have acquitted themselves credit-
ably in the static role to which they have
been assigned.

261. The Poles and the French brought con-
siderable numbers to be trained and equipped;
the Greeks have been fewer in numbers, but
have none the less presented a difficult problem.
In February, 1943, two Greek Brigades were
training under command of Ninth Army. At
this time the formation of the rst Greek Divi-
sion, which was to be a training and adminis-
trative formation, was under consideration and
the staff was being collected and trained in
Cairo. Political unrest, which had been a
considerable source of anxiety during the period
under review, then broke out and at the begin-
ning of March, 1943, led to a grave state of

5593

indiscipline in both brigades. The instigators

‘ of the disturbances were left-wing officers and

men with violent anti-Metaxist sympathies, It:
became mecéssary to remove a number of
officers, but for political reasons the ringleaders
could not be removed. The formation of the
1st Greek Divisional Headquarters was discon-
tinued and the command of both brigades was
taken over temporarily by British Brigadiers.
On 6th July further disturbances took place,
this time mainly ‘in the 2nd Greek Brigade,
as a result of which two battalions of the and
Brigade were disbanded, and the Ist
Brigade was completed to war establishment
ifrom the reliable elements of the and Brigade.
The 8th Greek Battalion, which wes intended
for guard duties only, was formed from the
remnants of the 2nd Brigade, less the ring-
leaders, who were sent to the Sudan. There
were no further disturbances throughout the
period and in December, 1943, the 1st Greek
Brigade was pronounced fit for an operational
role.

262. The Greek Sacred Squadron, which
Tepresents the finest elements in the Greek
Army, was part of General Leclerc’s “L”’
Force from the middle of February to the end
of March, 1943, and took part in active opera-
tions under command of the Fighting French
Forces. On 1st April it came under command
of the New Zealand Division, and on 17th
April it left them at Enrfidaville to return to the
Delta. The Squadron was re-organised by the
middie of May and came under command of:
of the Special Air Service Regiment, It was
trained in combined operations as a parachute
squadron, and on 2gth October part of the
squadron went to Samos by sea, the remainder
being dropped by air three days later, On
the fall of Samos they were safely evacuated to
Middle East through Turkey.

263. The Greek Armoured Car Regiment, of
two squadrons, has ‘been a first-class unit
throughout my period of command. It has
been stationed in Syria, under the command
first of the roth Armoured Division and then
of the gth Armoured Brigade.

264. At the beginning of February the
Yugoslav Army in the Middle East consisted
of a headquarters, one battalion and a depot.
The ibattalion came under command of the
roth Indian Division (25th Indian Infantry
Brigade) on 21st July 1943, and moved to Ar
Rama; it has remained under command ever
since. By October the battalion, fully equipped
and up to strength, had reached a high stan-
dard of training and was included in the Order
of Battle for operations in the Aegean.

265. At the end of December, Partisan
propaganda leaflets were distributed in the
battalion by the sympathisers of Marshal Tito.
Shortly afterwards about one-third of the men
and one officer from the fbattalion signed a
declaration refusing to obey orders from the
General Headquarters of the Yugoslav Forces,
and placed themselves under British command
until such time as they could join the Partisan
Forces. They were segregated and put into a
camp at Geneifa. i

266. A Belgian Brigade Group arrived in
the Middle East from the Belgian Congo
between the middle of April and the middle of
June, 1943. It was organised on Belgian war
establishments and had been trained for jungle
warfare. . :
