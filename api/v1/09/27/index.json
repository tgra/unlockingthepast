There was a strong suspicion at this time that the German raiders were using two prominent landmarks—the Isle of Dogs and Hyde Park—over which they turned to their various objectives. Two geographical barrages, designed to explode over these two points, were, therefore, worked out and were fired for the first time on the night 26th/27th September, 1940. There was no marked improvement in the number of raiders destroyed but the plan had the advantage of controlling the ammunition expenditure. ;",

The westward move to this area was made openly in daylight and when the division moved due north after dusk it was represented in the staging area by the measures I have already described. A wireless network of Io Corps, with all its brigades, was represented as operating in the southern sector up to D-day and from D mirfis 1 onwards occasional false messages were sent suggesting a move forward into 13 Corps’ area.",

They saw signs of military activity at two points in and adjoining the Speulder Bosch and a third point just south of the neighbouring railway; but there was no proof that this activity had anything to do with rockets. However, on the same day and the two following days six more rockets fell near Norwich and one off the Norfolk coast. In four of these seven cases the information furnished by radar suggested or was consistent with firing from the area between Amersfoort and Apeldoorn. Whether our suspicions of the Speulder Bosch were justified or not evidently",
