thus appreciated the power and efficiency of the
Royal Navy. I have already spoken of the
work of the Royal Navy in the operations in
Somaliland in the despatch dealing with that
campaign.

53. It would be difficult to speak too highly
of the work of the Royal Air Force in the
Middle East and of their support of the Army
to the limit of their capacity. Both the original
A.O.C.-in-C., Air Chief Marshal Sir William
Mitchell, K.C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O., M.C.,
A.F.C., and his successor, Air Chief Marshal
Sir Arthur Longmore, K.C.B., D.S.O., have
co-operated wholeheartedly in combining the
operations of the Army and the Air Force to
the best advantage; and the relations between
the two Services, at G.H.Q. and in the various
Commands, have been always close and cordial.

It has become more obvious with every
phase of the war in the Middle East both that
the development and reinforcement of the
R.A.F. must keep pace with the growth of the
ground forces, which it has not done up to
date, and that co-operation between the ground
and air forces in all stages of any operation need
the closest study.

54. Co-operation in planning between the
three Services is miaintained by the Joint Plan-
ning Staff, whose work has been uniformly
excellent. They have never failed to produce
an agreéd solution of any problem put to them.

55. I desire to express my gratitude to the
Commander-in-Chief in India, General’ Sir
Robert Cassels, G.C.B., C.S.I., D.S.0., and to
the Army in India for the manner in which
requests for assistance in units, officers or
material have itivariably been met to the limit
of India’s capacity. The Indian’ troops sent to
the Middle East are well maintaining their high
reputation in the camp and in the field.

56. The co-operation of the Egyptian Army
in the defence of Egypt has been: hampered by
the lack of a definite policy by the Egyptian
Government, who have never quite decided the
point at which resistatice to the enemy by the
Egyptian Army should begin. For some time
Egyptian units-formed part of the garrison of
Matruh, and an Egyptian A.A. unit did’ excel-
Jent work in defending Matruh against air
attack though frequently subjected to heavy
bombing.

At present part of the Egyptian Froritier
Force is defending the Siwa Oasis, and an
Egyptian Mobile Force, under Prince Ismail
Daoud, is in readiness to support the garrison
of Siwa. Egyptian A.A. and C.D. units are
assisting in the defence of the Fleet Base at
Alexandria; the Egyptian Army provides a
force for the defence of Wadi Halfa against
possible enemy raids, and guards vulnerable
points in the Delta.

Appreciation of Services.

57. I should like to call particular attention
to the services of Lieuteniant-General Sir H. M.
Wilson, K.C.B., D.S.O., G.O.C.-in-C. British
Troops in Egypt. He has had a very onerous
task in providing for the defence of Egypt
with inadequate resources, in fitting for war
the troops sent to his Command, in organising
the expansion of the base in Egypt, in securing
the co-operation of the Egyptian Army, and
in dealing with many difficult and delicate
problems in the relations between the forces in
Egypt and the Egyptian Government and

people. His sound knowledge and imperturb-
able common sense have enabled him to deal
effectively with all these problems and he has
obtained the’ confidence and liking of the Egyp-
tians with whom he has had to work. It is
largely due to his direction that the small
British force in the Western Desert has so
effectively delayed and checked the Italian
advance,

58. Major-General W. Platt, C.B., D.S.O.,
has commanded the troops in the Sudan
throughout the period with marked efficiency.
He kept his head during the dangerous period
when the Sudan was exposed to’ the attack of
greatly superior Italian forces and used his
slender resources to the best effect to meet the
danger. With the arrival of reinforcements
he has initiated offensive action against the
enemy whenever possible, though still inferior
in numbers.

59. Lieutenant-Generals M. G. H. Barker,
K.C.B., D.S.O., G. J. Giffard, C.B., D.S.O.,
and P. Neame, V.C., C.B., D.S.O., have in
succession held the command in Palestine. I
consider that all three have shown ability’ and
tact in dealing with the military and political
problems of the country.

60. Major-General D. P. Dickinson, D.S.O.,
O.B.E., M.C., did most valuable work in the
early part of the war in organising our war
effort in East Africa under difficult conditions.

61. 1 have been fortunate in my staff and
desire to place on record my appreciation of
their work, their willingness and their efficiency.
In particular, I owe a deep debt of thanks to
Major-General A. F. Smith, D.S.0., M.C.,
Deputy Chief of the General Staff, who has
been the chief General Staff Officer of the
Middle East Command since its: beginning. He
has shown himself an admirable staff officer
in every way, and his personality and unfail-
ing cheerfulness has made its influence felt
throughout the staff and has impressed the
many foreign officers with whom he has had
to deal.

Major-General B. O. Hutchison, C.B.E.,
Deputy Quarter-Master General, joined Middle
East in October, 1939, as principal administra-
tive officer and has directed the expansion of
its administrative responsibilities ever since.
His capacity for hard work, organizing ability
and foresight have been most marked. He is
an outstanding administrative staff officer.
