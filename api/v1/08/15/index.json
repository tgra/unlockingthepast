            "description": "2. Prior to the formation of the new Com- mand, an administrative reorganization had been introduced by General Headquarters Middle East, with the object of freeing Com- mander Tenth Army from the administration of the bases and lines of communication in Persia and Iraq so that he could concentrate on his operational task. By this measure, which came into effect on 15th August, 1942, the control of the general administration of the ports, depots and communications behind the Tenth Army was vested in a senior Staff Officer of General Headquarters Mideast, designated the Inspector General of Communications (1.G.C.); while there was created an area Command, known as Pibase, to deal with the internal security and local administration of the Base and Lines of Communication area. At the same time the zone of responsibility of the Commander Tenth Army was to have been further reduced by transferring Northern Iraq from the Tenth to the Ninth Army."

The sustained resist- ance which they were meeting in South-East England probably led them to believe that Fighter Squadrons bad been withdrawn, wholly dr in part, from the North in order to meet the attack. On the 15th August, therefore, two large raids were sent, one to Yorkshire and one to Newcastle. by Fighters. The distance was too great for Me. rogs, but not for Me. rros."

            "description": "East of Etna the country offered many obstacles to a rapid advance. It is a thickly inhabited narrow strip, confined between the mountains and the coast, and the cultivation, especially the walls of the vineyards and olive groves, makes it excellent defensive terrain. 5 and 50 Divisions could make only slow pro- gress, although the enemy had by now decided to evacuate and was seeking only to impose the maximum delay. Thanks to the difficulties of the terrain which I have already mentioned, he was able to extricate a high proportion of his troops, though not, of course, their heavy equipment. The Messina area was very heavily defended; anti-aircraft fire, for instance, was described by our pilots as worse than over the Ruhr. General Montgomery was anxious to bring a Corps into reserve to prepare for the invasion of Italy and on 13th August he pulled out 5 Division and 13 Corps Headquarters to join the Canadian Division in preparation for the new assault, 50 and 51 Divisions con- tinued the pursuit. An attempted landing in rear of the enemy on the night of 15th August, in the style of those carried out on the north coast, was very nearly successful but the enemy were retreating too fast for any to be cut off."

            "description": "35. The position early on 15th August was as follows. Observation Hill, which was vital to the defence of the whole position, was dominated by artillery from Round Hill at Many of the defences had been destroyed; and the garrison, which had gal- lantly resisted for four days, was becoming tired. Attempts to dislodge the enemy from the Mirgo Pass and from the low ground south of Castle Hill had failed. There was also a threat from the enemy detachment advancing along the coast road from Zeilah, though this advance, which had been shelled by the Navy from the sea and bombed by the R.A.F., was not being pressed with any great energy. Enemy air attacks on troops and transport in the open had been constant. They were not very dangerous but had a considerable nuisance effect. In these circumstances General Godwin Austen came to the conclusion that a retreat on Berbera and evacuation was the only course to save the force from a dangerous defeat and possible annihilation. He accordingly tele- graphed G.H.Q., Middle East, giving the two aliernatives, immediate evacuation or con- tinuation of the action with probable loss of a very large proportion of the force."

The brunt of the enemy\u2019s effort was, however, made on Observation Hill which was subjected to a very heavy bombardment for two hours. This was followed by a fierce infantry attack at 1700 hours, under which the garrison at last gave way. I regret that the 3-pdr. gun of H.M.A.S. Hobart was here lost together with the detachment. Their presence and conduct had been of the utmost value to the morale of the garrison."

            "description": "It will be noted that no decision had been taken, at the time this directive was issued, whether ANVIL should be mounted or not; on the other hand the forces to be provided for it from Italy had now risen to seven divisions. This uncertainty was a very great handicap to our planning, and its psychological effect on the troops expecting to be withdrawn, especially on the French, was undoubtedly serious. It is hard to expect troops to give of their best when they are continuously \u2018' looking over their shoulder \u2019\u2019 to a new objective, particularly when it is so attractive an objective as the liberation of their own country. This situation lasted throughout June. On the 14th I was instructed that VI Corps Headquarters was to be withdrawn at once, 3 Division on 17th June and the 36th on 27th June. On the 24th a French division was to be withdrawn to the Naples area, followed by a second in the first week of July. On the same day \u2018the Com- bined Chiefs of Staff signalled \u2018\u2018 the destruction of the German armed forces in Italy, south of the Pisa-Rimini line, must be completed. There should be no withdrawal from the battle of any Allied forces that are necessary for this purpose \u2019\u2019. Nevertheless I was informed on the 16th that, in order to preserve the possibility of mounting ANVIL, it was necessary to pro- ceed with the programme of withdrawal of forces already laid down. We could still hope that we might get these troops back again later but this became more unlikely after it was known that General Eisenhower had strongly recommended the operation in a signal of 23rd June. The final decision in its favour was communicated to me on 5th July. ANVIL* was eventually launched on 15th August."

            "description": "15th August, a conference attended by Roatta, the Italian Chief of Staff, and three other Italian Generals on the one hand and by Rommel, Jodi and Rintelen on the other\u2019. After some ugly bickering between Roatta and Jodl over the question of German troops being used for the \u201c protection\u2019\u2019 of the Brenner route the two p for the defence of the country were produced. The Italians wished for twelve German divisions of which nine were to be in Southern and Central Italy, one in Corsica, and only two in Northern Italy and Liguria; this figure excluded the four divi- sions from Sicily. This plan might reasonably cepa ii is - a i re desire to ve the defence of the whole pensinsula pro- vided for; but after the capitulation it was Late by Hitler as the basis of a charge that Bado- glio had schemed to draw the German forces far down into Italy, as far as possible from their bases, and dispersed in small groups which could be easily dealt with by the Italian troops in the same areas. The German plan for the disposition of their sixteen divisions (ie. including the four from Sicily) put eight in Northern Italy under Rommel, two near Rome and six in Southern Italy; the latter two forces were to be under Kesselring. This plan was the one adopted in the event. Proposals for the employment of Kesselring\u2019s forces, as reported to us by General Castellano, were still fluid and would be based on the Germans\u2019 own strength when the invasion came and their appreciation of the Allies\u2019 strength. In prin- ciple they intended to defend the line of the Apennines from Massa Carrara to Pesaro, the later \u2018\u2018 Gothic \u201d\u2019 line, though if the Allies were to attack this in great strength they would with- draw to the Po. If, however, the Allies showed little strength the Germans would attempt to hold a line\u2018from Grosseto, through Monte Amiata to Perugia and thence to Ancona.j Finally, if the circumstances and relative strengths were particularly favourable, an attempt would be made to stand south of Rome on the line Gaeta, Isernia, Vasto. This was a line which the Italians had already surveyed, and defences were already being prepared at certain points.} There is no need to detail the various stages of the German reinforcement of Italy and I will pass on to the situation as it presented it- self on 3rd September.\u00a7 For the immediate pur- pose dispositions in South Italy are the most important, and they were the best known at the time. Four divisions had been evacuated from Sicily; of these 29 Panzer Grenadier Divi- sion remained in Calabria, 15 Panzer Grena- dier and Hermann Goering Divisions moved to the Naples area to refit and 1 Parachute Divi- sion, less certain elements, moved to Altamura in Apulia. In addition to these there were two newly formed armoured divisions south of Naples: 26 Panzer Division|| in Calabria, based on the isthmus of Catanzaro and 16 Panzer Division covering the Gulf of Salerno. * The minutes of the meeting were found among the -+ This was, roughly, the Trasimene line on which ey offered delaying resistance in June 1944 on their withdrawal from Rome to the \u201c\u2018 Gothic \u201d line. } It tormed the basis for the German \u201c\u2018 Winter \u201d\u2019 line"

Of our own troops I wrote \u201cI have now two highly organised and skilful Armies, capable of carrying out large scale attacks and mobile operations in the closest co-operation.

I proposed, therefore, to give the enemy no breathing space but to continue to press the pursuit up the centre of the peninsula to the line Bibbiena-Florence-Pistoia-Pisa and then over the Apennines; if they were held in force I would mount a full-scale attack on Bologna not later than 15th August. I would then establish a firm base in the area of Bologna and Modena for the development of further operations either westwards into France or north-eastwards into Austria according to the requirements of Allied stategy at that time. At the same time I would secure and protect any airfield areas in the Po valley considered ne for the operation of the Allied Air Forces. As I explained, this plan was only possible on the assumption that I retained the forces I then had in Italy; I had to work on this assumption as long as I could while the fate of ANVIL was being decided."

I have included the planning for subsequent operations, as it was initiated and carried on during the period under con- sideration. But these plans are given in out- line only, because their execution is outside the period of my command and because the Japanese capitulation caused many modifica- tions of the basic plan."
