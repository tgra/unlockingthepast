tions, This road was in part built
en cormche and the work of the American
engineers in restoring it was worthy of the
highest praise.

East of Etna the country offered many
obstacles to a rapid advance. It is a thickly
inhabited narrow strip, confined between the
mountains and the coast, and the cultivation,
especially the walls of the vineyards and olive
groves, makes it excellent defensive terrain.
5 and 50 Divisions could make only slow pro-
gress, although the enemy had by now decided
to evacuate and was seeking only to impose
the maximum delay. Thanks to the difficulties
of the terrain which I have already mentioned,
he was able to extricate a high proportion of
his troops, though not, of course, their heavy
equipment. The Messina area was very heavily
defended; anti-aircraft fire, for instance, was
described by our pilots as worse than over the
Ruhr. General Montgomery was anxious to
bring a Corps into reserve to prepare for the
invasion of Italy and on 13th August he pulled
out 5 Division and 13 Corps Headquarters to
join the Canadian Division in preparation for
the new assault, 50 and 51 Divisions con-
tinued the pursuit. An attempted landing in
rear of the enemy on the night of 15th August,
in the style of those carried out on the
north coast, was very nearly successful but
the enemy were retreating too fast for any to
be cut off.

On the night of 16th August the leading
troops of 3 United States Division entered Mes-
sina. They were joined next morning by Com-
mandos from 30 Corps. Just before dawn on
the 17th, according to the German account,
General Hube, the German commander, sailed
from a beach north of Messina in the last boat
to leave the island. Sicily had been conquered
in thirty-eight days.

ADMINISTRATIVE REPORT ON THE SICILIAN
CAMPAIGN.

THE PLANNING PHASE.

Planning for the Sicilian campaign began at
Bouzarea, near Algiers, in February, 1943.
Brigadier E, P, Nares and Brigadier-General
Archelaus L. Hamblen, United States Army,
were appointed for Administrative planning
with British and American planning staffs
representing Q (Maintenance), Q (Movements
and Transportation), A Branch and the G-4
and G-r Branches.* To the above was added
a strong R.A.F. team of planners which worked
throughout in the joint scheme.

Considerations of concentration of force had
originally suggested an attack by both Armies
on the south-eastern corner of the island but this
had been abandoned in the first plan on the
administrative grounds that there was no port
on the southern ‘shores of sufficient capacity to
maintain the forces in that area which could be
captured. They would, therefore, have to be
maintained indefinitely over the beaches. The

SUPPLEMENT .1o tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 FEBRUARY, 1948

lessons of TORCH Operation* had indi-
cated that it was necessary te capture a suitable
port within forty-eight hours. Consequently it
was decided to proceed with the plan for the
U.S. Seventh Army to assault in the area of
Palermo and capture that port and for the British
Eighth Army to capture Syracuse together with
the airfields of Comiso and Ponte Ohve.

In May the Allied Commander-in-Chief
directed that the administrative aspects of the
original plan should be reviewed. After full
examination, the administrative msks involved
in assaulting in the south-east corner of the island
were accepted and a plan of campaign using
this area for the assault was evolved.

On 23rd May the staff of Eighteenth Army
Group was dissolved, the Tunisian campaign
having been concluded. Major-General C. H.
Miller, MGA Eighteenth Army Group, was
appointed MGA Force r4r (later known as
Fifteenth Army Group) and the Administrative
Staff was concentrated at Algiers to complete the
planning of the Sicilian campaign. The War
Establishment of Fifteenth Army Group initially
approved included the Administrative Staffs of
all Services and departments, but was not im-
plernented in full, only those officers immediately
required for planning being appointed.. It was
later decided that these Services and depart-
ments would not be required until the allied
forces had been established on the mainland of
Italy and that for the Sicilian campaign HO
Fifteenth Army Group would only fulfil the
function of operational command and co-
ordination as HQ Eighteenth Army Group had.
done during the Tunisian campaign.

In view of the unknown risks involved in
maintaining the United States Seventh Army
over beaches for an indefinite period, it was
decided to set up a detachment of a’ United
States Base Section in Syracuse on D plus Io
together with the British Base Area designated
for that port and to include American ships in
the D plus 14 convoy for discharge at 1,000
tons per day at the expense of Eighth Army for
the maintenance of Seventh Army. The object
of this decision was to relieve the maintenance
of Seventh Army over the beaches at the earliest
date possible. It was further decided that HQ
Tripoh Base Area (redesignated ForRTBASE
on arrival in Sicily) should move to Syracuse as
early as possible after the capture of that port
to co-ordinate shipping demands and mainten-
ance between Eighth Army, Seventh Army and
the Air Forces in accordance with the policy
laid down by Fifteenth Army Group. In the
event this co-ordination was not required since
all the maintenance requirements of Seventh
Army were successfully and adequately pro-
vided over the beaches and through Licata and
Empedocle.

On 22nd June, the Naval and Army Task
Forces together with the supporting Air Forces,
both British and United States, taking part in
the operation presented their outline plans before
the Allied Commander-in-Chief and the three
Service Commanders-in-Chief at Algiers.

On 24th June HQ Fifteenth Army Group

moved from Algiers to the British Consulate at
La Marsa, and on 4th July General Alexander
