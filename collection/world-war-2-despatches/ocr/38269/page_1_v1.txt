Enclosure rx. Office of Flag Officer Force   W  20th March, 1945. Report ON Naval OPERATIONS IN THE RAMREE IsLanp AREA. The attached report on the Naval Operations at Ramree Island is forwarded. 2. As stated in paragraph 7 of the report I instructed my Chief Staff Officer, Captain

himself on divisional level with Major-General Lomax at Kyaukpyu and to render all assistance to that officer in hus task of clearing the enemy off Ramree Island. Though this step meant that my Chief Staff Officer was divorced from me from 24th January to 24th February, I am of the opinion that the results obtained justified it.

3. As will be seen from the report the naval operations were of a unique kind, calling for resourcefulness, determimation and professional experience, and Captain Bush rose to the occasion in the able manner I expected him to, and I consider that the success of the naval operations at Ramree was due to this officer's efforts

I have the honour to submit the following Report on Naval Operations in the Ramree Island Area from i1gth January to 2and February, 1945. These operations formed part of the strategic advance of the 15th Indian Corps down the Arakan coast with a view to securing the airfields on Ramree Island from which Fourteenth Army could be supplied on their advance on Rangoon, and operations could be mounted for the capture of that port by sea should it become necessary, and which

E. W. Bush, D.S.O, D.S.C., R.N., to place *in fact did prove the case.
