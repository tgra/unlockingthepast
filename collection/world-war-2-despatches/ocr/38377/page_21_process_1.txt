were ordered to enter harbour in the order   motor launches, minesweepers, CAIRO, merchant ships, and destroyers and at 2006 I ordered the Senior Officer, Minesweepers (SPEEDY) to take the minesweepers and motor launches under his orders and-to proceed ahead.

This minesweeper proceeded ahead of CAIRO and appeared to be steering somewhat to starboard of the proper course. On sighting the first mark boat flashing  V , < CAIRO hauled round and led the merchant ships up the marked channel until reaching the

ORARI following closely behind TROILUS also proceeded into harbour ahead of me and was mined about 2 cables from the breakwater. . She was able to proceed up harbour.

Air Co-operation.

52. From 0930 on 5th June, long-range fighters from Malta gave continuous cover to the convoy, except for two short periods when fighters had been heavily engaged and had used up their petrol and ammunition and had had to return to base early, To have maintained this escort at such a considerable distance from base, must have entailed a very heavy strain on the resources at Malta. The timing of the

Remarks on the Passage of a Convoy to Malta from the Westward.

53. The passage entails a period of two days and one night when the convoy is within range of heavy scale air attacks. I do not propose to remark on the problem as it affects the protection from surface forces.

54. During Operation   Harpoon   Force T and the convoy were subjected. to a series of heavy air attacks on the 14th June. Fighters from the carriers and gunfire from the fleet prevented the enemy scoring more than one success against the convoy (TANIMBAR) but it is emphasised that during this period the force of the enemy attacks was directed more against the carriers than the merchant ships.

55. The most critical period of the passage is likely to be from daylight on the final day until the convoy has reached a position where short-range fighters based on Malta can give it cover. It is important therefore that as many long-range fighters as possible should be pro-

\ vided to protect the convoy during this time.

56. With the heavy scale of air attack which

the enemy is capable of launching in this area

I do not consider we can rely on fighters, how-

  ever numerous, being able to prevent a pro-

portion of the enemy's dive bombers delivering

attacks. The enemy tactics appear to be to

break his formations some distance away and

for individual aircraft or small groups to attack from different sectors.

fire to prevent deliberate attacks being  

 



57. It is apparent therefore that merchant ships in convoy must rely on their own close range armament for protection against dive bombing. The enemy evidently has a healthy respect for our fire for he seldom appeared to, press home his attacks to a close enough range to ensure hitting, but the danger from near misses is very considerable.

58. During the final day of   Harpoon  three merchant ships in convoy were lost due to enemy air action. Of these, CHANT received three direct hits, but BURDWAN and KENTUCKY were, I believe, not touched but disabled by near misses. But for the enemy surface force, both of these ships might have been brought in.
