The Italians launched their counteroffensive on the 9th March on a front of about 20 miles, extending from Tepelene in the Southern Sector to the Greek lines West of Corovode in the Central Sector. The enemy forces, which were.estimated at about 10 divisions, supported by large numbers of bomber and fighter aircraft, made continuous attacks until the 14th March, but the Greeks, defending resolutely, repulsed all attacks and inflicted very heavy losses on the enemy. The Italians were unable to gain any ground and on the 14th March the Greeks made a successful counter-attack, taking some prisoners.",

The following day a large enemy convoy of lorries and staff cars in this area was surprised and wiped out.

            "description": "115. The attack on Mandalay Hill was Jaunched by 98 Brigade early on the 9th March, and the hill was captured after 24 hours of the most bitter hand-to-hand fighting. The enemy fought to the end, the last defenders being killed by means of petrol drums, set on fire, which were rolled down into the tunnel they were holding. There followed three days of street fighting. By the 14th the city had been cleared and Fort Dufferin invested. A gallant attempt by 98 Brigade to storm the fort failed, the attackers being held up by the thick weed in the moat. Old fashioned siege warfare methods were then adopted, in order to avoid the casualties which a direct assault would have entailed : but even medium artillery, firing from 500 yards, and aerial rocket projectiles failed to break the massive walls, with their earth embankment. By the 19th March, however, the Japanese had had enough, and that night the remnants of the garrison attempted to escape through the ruins. The majority were intercepted and only a few got away. An immense quantity of equipment, chiefly ordnance stores, fell into our hands and 160 civilian internees were rescued. The capture of Mandalay was a fitting climax to a great advance. (Between the date it crossed the Irrawaddy on the 9th January and the fall of Mandalay, 19 Indian Division had accounted for 6,000 Japanese killed, actually counted on the ground.",

            "date": "9th March",
            "description": "117. In the Meiktila area, there was continuous fighting. While mobile columns of infantry and tanks were successfully operating against the enemy who were attempting to close in on the town, inflicting heavy casualties and capturing many guns, the Japanese were concentrating on capturing the airstrip, two miles north of Meiktila, on which our supplies depended. On the night 15th-16th March, their attacks reached the north-west corner of the airstrip where they dug in. They were successfully counter-attacked but their guns still dominated the strip, and the air-transportable brigade of 5 Indian Division, which was then being flown in landed under artillery fire. Several aircraft were destroyed, but the American Air Commandos were undeterred and no sortie turned back. The enemy then attacked in strength and succeeded in capturing the airstrip. This resulted in an immediate severe curtailment of supplies, including ammunition, since we had to fall back on   dropping   as opposed to  landing.  There followed a week's fierce fighting to regain the strip. The enemy dug in in the broken country to the north, which was almost impassable for tanks, and strengthened the position with numerous anti-tank guns and minefields. This meant that the clearance of the strip was a job for the infantry, together with elements of the R.AF. Regiment and R.A.F. Servicing Commandos, and it was achieved against the most determined opposition with the magnificent support of R.A.F. fighter-bombers. The Japanese artillery, however, still covered the airfield at almost point-blank range and further bitter close-quarter fighting was necessary before the enemy was routed. The whole area was cleared by the 29th March. The enemy's suicidal resistance cost him nearly all his guns and we inflicted tremendous casualties.",
