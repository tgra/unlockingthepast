            "description": "Several of the formations with the Eighth Army needed to reorganise and refit after their * strenuous experiences. Their relief could only be effected gradually as fresh troops became available, but eventually the 5th Indian Divi- sion relieved the qth Indian Division, which meanwhile had been employed in preparing the frontier positions, The Polish Brigade Group and the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade were withdrawn and replaced by the remainder of the 50th (United Kingdom) Division, which I was able to bring back from Iraq. The 1st and and South African Divisions had been reorganised after playing their part in the offensive and on the 12th February, General Ritchie reported that they were certainly fit to hold defensive positions and after another six weeks good training would be ready to under- take offensive operations. :"

A sharp action ensued, the enemy withdrawing towards Asosa. On 12th February Kurmuk was captured'by detachments 2/6 K.A.R. and Sudan Frontier Police. This cleared the last Italians out of the Sudan. Operations con- tinued with the object of attacking Asosa."

            "description": "T had refused to commit the New Zealand Corps, my Corps de Chasse, until it was certain that II Corps could not take the position. The New Zealanders had relieved the Americans south of Route 6 on 6th February to allow the latter to concentrate for the attack; but it was now clear that they would be obliged, not merely to debouch through a gateway flung open for them, but to capture the gate themselves. II Corps went over to the defen- sive on 12th February. My plan now was for 4 Indian Division to capture Monastery Hill while the New Zealanders would seize a bridge- head over the Rapido. The Corps would then exploit up the Liri valley, but this was not to start until weather conditions were favourable enough to allow the movement of armoured forces off the roads. At the same time I ordered Fifth Army to make plans for resuming the offensive with VI Cotps."

            "description": "against steadily increasing resistance. By the 231d March, 80 Brigade were two miles west of the important enemy base of Kyaukse, where they were held up. With a view to outflanking the Japanese positions, 32 Brigade began an encircling movement south-west of the town. A week\u2019s hard fighting ensued before Kyaukse was entered on the 30th March, the booty cap- tured including rolling stock, motor transport, and a quantity of valuable stores. The fall of Kyaukse was a severe blow to the enemy, strategically as well as administratively, since it formed the bastion behind which their dis- organized forces, streaming back from north and west, were attempting to rally. Since crossing the Irrawaddy on the 12th February, 20 Indian Division had killed over 3,000 Japanese (counted), and captured 50 guns."

            "description": "343. Due to the combined results of our own bombing, the Japanese denial measures and general neglect during the occupation, the port, and accommodation facilities at Akyab and Kyaukpyu were found to be almost negligible. At Akyab the main stone jetties and approaches required extensive repairs, and the removal of two ships sunk alongside was necessary. In addition considerable new con- struction was required. Development began on the 15th January. By the 12th February, seven pontoon jetties had been built, and a fortnight later the stone jetty had been suffi- ciently repaired to be used for personnel. A new solid timber piled wharf 600 feet long and twelve feet wide was built in a space of six weeks, and by the end of April, not only had a wreck at the main jetty been removed \u2018but the jetty itself had been com- pletely repaired, all the stone for which had had to be imported. For all this work, only one Port Construction Company was employed, which carried out its task more efficiently, des- pite shortages of material. The target set for the development was 1,200 tons daily before the monsoon and 800 tons daily during it. By the beginning of April, the target had been exceeded and on the 3rd April a record dis- charge of 2,406 tons was achieved. The initial working of the port in the early stages was by 41 Beach Group ut the responsibility was handed over early in February to a Port Com- mandant."
