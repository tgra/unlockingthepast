attacked with success; and a constant recon-
naissance of the Bay of Bengal, over enemy
aerodromes in Burma and of the Port of
Rangoon was maintained as far as possible.
Air information was, however, severely
restricted not only by the weather but by
shortage of long-range aircraft. During this
period the enemy air force was almost
completely inactive.

EVENTS DURING MoNSOON FROM JUNE TO
OcTosER.

22. On the eastern front of India there was
little military activity during the monsoon
period. Some good patrol work in difficult
conditions was carried out in the Chindwin
valley by troops of the 23rd Division and local
levies. The rains were exceptionally heavy,
and all northern Burma and Assam are highly
malarial during the rainy season. It seemed at
one time that the enemy intended to move from
the Chindwin and Myitta valleys into the Chin
Hills, which were held only by local levies
whom we could not support in the absence of
communications. The Chins became alarmed
by Japanese threats and depressed by shortage
of food, and there was a danger that they
might ‘come to terms with the enemy. The
danger was averted by vigorous bombing of
the enemy and the dropping of supplies to the
Chins.

I had determined in June to re-occupy Fort
Hertz (Putao) in the extreme north of Burma,
in order to protect the landing ground there
and to raise and support Kachin levies to
operate between Myitkyina and Fort Hertz.
There was no road from India to Fort Hertz,
and a detachment could only be flown in by
air. It was September before this was possible
and it had to be preceded by a small detach-
ment dropped by parachute to prepare the
landing ground.

INTERNAL SITUATION.

Pr Minsiageed has aceey been made the

isturbances organise: ongress in August
and their effect (see pagent a4). feel
trouble of a different kind necessitated the use
of troops and the declaration of martial law in
part of Sind north of Hyderabad. A fanatical
sect of Moslems known as the Hurs had long
terrorised a considerable district through which
the main line from the port of Karachi runs.
On the 16th May, r942, a gang of Hurs
derailed the mail train from Karachi and then
attacked it. It was impossible to tolerate such
dangerous lawlessness on one of the principal
lines of communication in India. Since the
police and civil authorities were unable to deal
with the situation, a military force was sent
and martial Jaw declared. Major-General
R. Richardson, M.C.. was appointed Military
Administrator. Under his able direction the
situation soon improved, but so deep-seated
was the terrorism of the Hurs, and so difficult
the country, which contains large areas of
marsh and of desert, that the troops were still
employed at the end of the year.

A company of a Parachute battalion was_

employed for some time in operations to round
up bands of Hurs, probably the first use of
parachutists in civil disturbances.

Recruiting was not affected by any internal
trouble, and some 60,000 recruits continued to
be enlisted each month. —

tribal disturbances inspired by the notorious
Fakir of Ipi. The operations were short and
successful. On the whole the situation on the
ay Frontier during 1942 was noticeably
stable.

REORGANISATION OF COMMANDS.

25. During the period covered by this review
it became necessary to reorganise the system of
Military Commands in India. Three Anmies
were constituted to deal with the threats of
invasion of N.W., N.E. and Southern India,
while a Central Command was created in order
to relieve the Army Commanders of large areas
with internal security problems only, and of
a considerable amount of responsibility for
administration and training. Lt.-General
N. M. S. Irwin took over command of the
Eastern Anny, Lt.-General Sir Noel Beresford-
Peirse that of the Southern Army, and
Lt.-General H. B. D. Willcox the Central
Command.

Ocean Bases.

26. When Japan entered the war, and
especially after the loss of Singapore, the Navy
felt the need of additional bases in the Indian
Ocean. Bases were selected at Addu Atoll in
the Maldive Islands, Diego Garcia in the
Chagos Archipelago, Seychelles and Mauritius.
India was made responsible for the garrison of
these and also of Cocos Island and Rodriguez
(East of Mauritius), The defences of Addu
Atoll were originally designed on a considerable
scale, but were later reduced. Scrub typhus
and malaria caused a very high sick rate in the
garrison and labour units working on the airfield
and defences; but this showed signs of improve-
ment by the end of the year as a result of jungle
clearance.

After the occupation of Madagascar I sug-
gested that Mauritius, Rodriguez and Seychelles
could better be garrisoned from E. Africa.
This was accepted and on the rst September
these places passed fo the E. African
Command. I returned the Mauritian garrison
from Diego Garcia to Mauritius during
September and replaced it by Indian troops.

PREPARATIONS FOR OFFENSIVE.

27. Even before we had been driven out of
Upper Burma, I had in April issued instructions
for the re-conquest of the whole of Burma to
be planned. An estimate was to be made of
the troops required, of the measures for their
maintenance, and of the special training and
equipment necessary; airfields and the main-
tenance arrangements for a large air force were
to be planned, since air superiority was the first
Tequisite for operations against Burma by land
or sea.

Planning has continued ever since, and has
shown the difficulties of the problem and the
extensive preparations required. There is no
connection by rail or road between India and
Burma, and the country through which routes
must be made to support’ an invasion is
extremely unfavourable—high hills, dense
jungles and fever-ridden valleys, with no local
supplies available and a very limited popula-
tion to provide labour. Moreover, the rivers
and mountain ranges all run from north to
south. Communications in this direction, there-
fore, that is with the grain of the country, are
comparatively easy; whereas movement from
west to east, against the grain, is very diffi-
cult. Any advance that we make from Assam
