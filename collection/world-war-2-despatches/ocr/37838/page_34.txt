moved to a position off Barfleur, to counter
enemy night operations, Detailed arrange-
ments were also made to ensure that the loss
of one or all of these ships should not leave
us without control of our fighter forces. These
arrangements, briefly, provided for a reciprocal
stand-by between these F.D.Ts., certain naval
vessels, the Headquarters ships, the G.C.I.
Stations landed in France, and the control
centres in the United Kingdom.

322. Fighter Direction Tenders.—Some de-
tails of the operations of the Fighter Direction
Tenders follow: —

(i) F.D.T. 216 was at first located five to
fifteen miles off shore opposite
“‘Qmaha ”’ section of the beach; later it
moved closer in to a position off St. Laurent.
The tasks allotted to this F.D.T. were to
control the day and night fighter cover over
the western assault area. Control was effec-
tive on the only occasion the enemy attacked
beaches in the United States sector in any
strength.

(ii) F.D.T. 217 sailed with the Eastern
Assault Forces. It was also placed five to
fifteen miles off ‘‘ Sword ’’ beach, but later
moved closer in shore. It controlled the day
and night cover to the Eastern Assault Area
and co-ordinated the cover over the whole

SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 JANUARY, 1947

area. The control of the night fighter pool
was handed over to the far shore G.C.C. on
D + 6 and the day fighter cover on D + 8.
The ship then moved to a position off St.
Laurent to act as stand-by control and con-
tinued to control night fighters until D + 17.

(iii) F.D.T. 13 was located forty to fifty
miles off the beach-head to control both day
and night fighters protecting the shipping
lanes. On 12th June, the control of day
fighters in these areas was handed back to a
fixed station in the United Kingdom and the
ship sailed to a position twenty miles east
north-east of Barfleur, where from x5th to
a7th June it controlled night fighters pro-
tecting shipping.

323. The figures below indicate only partially
the excellent work of these Fighter Direction
Tenders, and when the low scale of enemy effort
and the steady and prolonged deterioration of
the weather are considered, the number of
enemy aircraft claimed destroyed and damaged
by the Allied aircraft controlled by these ships,
is high. The figures show the number of air-
craft controlled by Fighter Direction Tenders
at night, and the number of casualties inflicted
by day and night by aircraft actually under
the control of a Fighter Direction Tender at
the time of the combat:—

324. The story of the setting up of Fighter
Control units on the Continent is dealt with ir
Part IV. Here it may be recorded that at 2230
hours on D-Day, the first G.C.I. station on
the far shore began controlling night fighters
and on D + 6 took over the co-ordination of
all night fighters from the F.D.T. previously
responsible. On D + 8, this G.C.I. station had
expanded into No. 483 Group Control Centre,
and control of both day and night fighters over
the battle zones passed to this centre.

325. Allied A.A. Gunfire. The operation
of our fighter aircraft was at times rendered
difficult by the actions of our own anti-aircraft
guns. In fact, I regret to say that engage-
ments of friendly aircraft did occur with some
frequency in the initital stages of the operation.
I made representations to the Allied ‘Naval
Commander about certain instances of promis-
cuous and uncontrolled Tire and both Naval
Task Force Commanders decided to prohibit
any A.A. gunfire from merchant vessels unless
these ships were being directly and individually
attacked. From many reports of observers, it
would appear however, that the merchant ships
were not alone to blame. This gunfire occurred
despite the fact that it had been agreed, during
the planning stages, that no A.A. gunners

should be permitted to engage aircraft unless
they were qualified to tecognise by their appear-
ance all aircraft, both friendly and hostile,
which were likely to operate in the area con-
cerned. Furthermore, the Naval and Army
Commanders were charged with the respon-
sibility of nominating the type of personnel or
unit which should be allowed to engage air-
craft under this rather general classification.

326. It must, however, be admitted that the
weather conditions generally were so indiffer-
ent that the aircraft providing fighter cover
and close support was often forced to operate
below the height which had previously been
agreed as a minimum, except in pursuit of
the enemy. This factor must have caused
complications for the A.A. gunners, especially
when there was enemy activity at the same
time.

327. A complete solution to the problem of
using A.A. guns and defensive aircraft to-
gether in any amphibious operation has clearly
not yet been found, and I am of the opinion
that the whole question should be given con-
siderably more scientific and practical study
on an inter-service and inter-Allied basis than
has been done in the past. I refer again to
this problem in Part V.
