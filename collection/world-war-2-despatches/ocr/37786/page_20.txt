Stampalia on 7th October. The continued
delay was certainly due to our naval and air
offensive against shipping and German key
points. Heavy toll was taken iby British and
American air forces, who, although handicapped
by the lack of airfields, and operating from
very considerable distances, kept up a ceaseless
offensive under trying conditions,

207. Nevertheless, in spite of all we could
do, the enemy continued methodically to con-
solidate his position in the smaller islands.
Naxos and Paros were occupied on 12th
October, and on 15th October Simi, which we
had evacuated two days before after heavy
dive-bombing raids had made the position un-
tenable, was occupied by the enemy. The
German Air Force was well dispersed; its heavy
bombers were concentrated at Eleusis, its
fighters at Kalamaki and Argos, its dive-
bombers at Megara and Marizza, and from these
bases constant attacks were made on Leros.
Delayed-action bombs put Portolago Bay, on
Leros, temporarily out of action on 16th
October, and on 17th and 18th October,
Castelrosso was bombed for the first time since
our occupation.

208. On 26th October, air activity against
Leros and Samos increased in intensity, ibut
there was still no movement from the enemy’s
invasion fleet. The enemy concentrations re-
mained in the Cos and Calino areas, and
further considerable concentrations were seen
in the Piraeus and at Khios; but from the
middle of October onwards the bad weather
which set in probably contributed to the ppost-
ponement of the attack.

209. Up to the end of October, operations in
the Aegean had been controlled by Middle East
Command through the 3rd Corps Headquarters
(Force: 292) and the 234th Brigade (Major-
General Brittorous) on Leros, but recent de-
velopments obviously justified the establishment
of a separate command to take over operations
in that sphere. On x1st November, Major-
General Hall was appointed G.O.C. Aegean,
with the specific task of holding Leros and
Samos in order to cause as much damage as
possible to the enemy’s lines of communica-
tion in the Aegean. In addition, he was given
command of all British, Allied and Italian land
forces in the Aegean, including and north of
Rhodes, Scarpanto and Crete, as well as of
naval personnel in shore establishments not
under Commander-in-Chief, Levant, or Senior
British Naval Officer, Aegean, in that area.
General Hall and Brigadier Tilney, who was
to take the post of Fortress Commander, Leros,
arrived at Leros on 5th November, and from
that date Headquarters, Aegean, started to
control operations.

azo. After discussion with Major-General
Brittorous, who relinquished command of the
234th Brigade, General Hall decided to make
Samos his headquarters. He remained on
Leros long enough to see the defences of the
island organised to his satisfaction and to
clarify relations with the Italians there, and
since the re-organisation of the island’s defences
was proceeding satisfactorily, he was able to
leave for Samos about midnight on 11th
November, leaving Brigadier Tilney in com-
mand on Leros.

211. It was unfortunate that at this time a
planned extensive air effort against enemy

bases and shipping was limited by the weather
and the temporary unserviceability of our
Cyrenaican landing grounds owing to rain.
The enemy, on the other hand, taking full
advantage of the proximity of his air bases,
was able to make our reinforcements of Leros
difficult. The dropping of flares at night hin-
dered unloading operations on certain occa-
sions, and the laying of minefields also added
to our difficulties; in spite of all this enemy
activity the strength of the Leros garrison was
built up to the strength of a brigade. The
original garrison, which had arrived between
the 17th September and the 2nd October, was
the 234th Brigade Headquarters, and the 2nd
Royal Irish Fusiliers, with a company from
the 2nd Royal West Kents, the remainder of
the battalion being on Samos. This was re-
inforced by 4th November by the 4th Buffs,
although their Headquarters Company was lost
at sea, and early in November the Ist King’s
Own completed the Brigade.

212. From the beginning of November, some
increase in enemy preparations was observed.
On 3rd and 4th November, landing craft and
escorts were reported in Lavrion, and on the
5th aircraft reconnaissance showed them mov-
ing eastwards. Between then and the even-
ing of roth November when they arrived in
the Cos/Calino area they moved only by day
under heavy fighter protection, dispersing and
lying up during the night, first in the Paros/
Naxos area and later in Amorgos, Levitha and
Stampalia. Every effort was made by the
Royal Navy and R.A.F. to intercept the force,
but our efforts met with small success due by
day to the heavy scale of enemy fighter pro-
tection and by night to the difficulty of spotting
the craft, which were probably beached an
certainly camouflaged in the many bays avail-
able. During the afternoon of gth November,
our troops moved to their battle stations to
await the enemy attack.

213. The island of Leros consists of three
mountainous regions connected by two narrow
necks of land, neither of which is much more
than a thousand yards in breadth, and so in-
dented is the coastline that no point on the
island is more than a mile from the sea. The
northern and southern mountain areas are both
penetrated by a valley which runs roughly from
North to South, so that an easy natural course
is afforded to the main road; the central moun-
tains alone are continuous, and here the main
toad has to skirt the coast to avoid the hills.
There are practically no possibilities of move-
ment across country; the mountains are steep,
stony and scored with ravines. The lower and
flatter areas, which are intensely cultivated, are
cut up into small fields by low rubble walls,
which are a constant barrier to movement.

214. The main problems of the defence were
the same as on Cos. ‘We were certain to suffer
from inferiority in the air—in particular, single-
engined fighter cover was impracticable and
the available bomber forces including some
diverted from Halian operations, were obviously
not sufficient for the task of neutralising all
the German air bases simultaneously. ‘More-
over, the topography of the island made it
easy to split any defence and to isolate sec-
tors. To meet the threat of invasion, the
island was divided into three sectors, within
each of which all troops, including the Italians,
