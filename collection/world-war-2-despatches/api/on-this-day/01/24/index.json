The weakness of this arrangement was showa when a German attack on the French in the Ousseltia valley, at the northern hinge of the two Dorsale ranges, made dangerous progress and had to be halted by the hasty diversion of British and American troops from First Army and II Corps. As a result General Anderson was appointed by General Eisenhower on ist January to   co-ordinate   the whole front and on 24th January both XIX and II Corps were placed directly under his command. At the same time General Kuter, of the United States Army Air Corps, was appointed to co-ordinate all Allied air support under command of General Spaatz then Deputy Commander-inChief Allied Air: Forces."

After a long conference with me that night General Juin agreed to place his Corps under my command, and next day this decision was confirmed by General Giraud."
