            "description": "Several of the formations with the Eighth Army needed to reorganise and refit after their * strenuous experiences. Their relief could only be effected gradually as fresh troops became available, but eventually the 5th Indian Division relieved the qth Indian Division, which meanwhile had been employed in preparing the frontier positions, The Polish Brigade Group and the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade were withdrawn and replaced by the remainder of the 50th (United Kingdom) Division, which I was able to bring back from Iraq. The 1st and and South African Divisions had been reorganised after playing their part in the offensive and on the 12th February, General Ritchie reported that they were certainly fit to hold defensive positions and after another six weeks good training would be ready to undertake offensive operations. :"

            "description": "General Montgomery were absorbed in the Tunisian battle. In consequence, although the operation was authorised on 23rd January and combined planning headquarters set up on 12th February, the final firm plan was not approved until the 12th May. Thus, although five months were available for perfecting plans for the operation, all detailed planning had in fact to be compressed into two months, resulting in some confusion and considerable unnecessary duplication in the issue of orders."

            "date": "12th February",
            "description": "For the second attempt to force the Acqua Col., 29th Indian Infantry Brigade, which was garrisoning Barentu, was placed under command 4th Indian Division, with the limitation that it was only to be used to exploit complete success, and was under no circumstances to be employed as a reinforcement. The reason for attacking the Acqua Gap was that, in spite of the administrative difficulties of maintaining two brigades in the Happy Valley, this attack if successful, would cut across the enemy's line of communication at a most vulnerable spot, and offered the chance of cutting-off and capturing the greater part of his forces in Keren and on the hills to the West. The period between roth and 12th February was very trying for the troops holding Brigs Peak and Cameron Ridge. The enemy counter-attacked continuously, and during the early hours of 11th iat 3/t Punjab Regiment were driven off Brigs Pi back on to Cameron Ridge."

The New Zealanders had relieved the Americans south of Route 6 on 6th February to allow the latter to concentrate for the attack; but it was now clear that they would be obliged, not merely to debouch through a gateway flung open for them, but to capture the gate themselves. II Corps went over to the defensive on 12th February. My plan now was for 4 Indian Division to capture Monastery Hill while the New Zealanders would seize a bridgehead over the Rapido. The Corps would then exploit up the Liri valley, but this was not to start until weather conditions were favourable enough to allow the movement of armoured forces off the roads. At the same time I ordered Fifth Army to make plans for resuming the offensive with VI Cotps."

            "description": "343. Due to the combined results of our own bombing, the Japanese denial measures and general neglect during the occupation, the port, and accommodation facilities at Akyab and Kyaukpyu were found to be almost negligible. At Akyab the main stone jetties and approaches required extensive repairs, and the removal of two ships sunk alongside was necessary. In addition considerable new construction was required. Development began on the 15th January. By the 12th February, seven pontoon jetties had been built, and a fortnight later the stone jetty had been sufficiently repaired to be used for personnel. A new solid timber piled wharf 600 feet long and twelve feet wide was built in a space of six weeks, and by the end of April, not only had a wreck at the main jetty been removed  but the jetty itself had been completely repaired, all the stone for which had had to be imported. For all this work, only one Port Construction Company was employed, which carried out its task more efficiently, despite shortages of material. The target set for the development was 1,200 tons daily before the monsoon and 800 tons daily during it. By the beginning of April, the target had been exceeded and on the 3rd April a record discharge of 2,406 tons was achieved. The initial working of the port in the early stages was by 41 Beach Group ut the responsibility was handed over early in February to a Port Commandant."

With a view to outflanking the Japanese positions, 32 Brigade began an encircling movement south-west of the town. A week's hard fighting ensued before Kyaukse was entered on the 30th March, the booty captured including rolling stock, motor transport, and a quantity of valuable stores. The fall of Kyaukse was a severe blow to the enemy, strategically as well as administratively, since it formed the bastion behind which their disorganized forces, streaming back from north and west, were attempting to rally. Since crossing the Irrawaddy on the 12th February, 20 Indian Division had killed over 3,000 Japanese (counted), and captured 50 guns."
