SUPPLEMENT to tuE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 JANUARY, 1048

officer to be sent to take local command there.
Major C. R. Templar, R.A. was selected. On
arrival he collected two trucks, filled them with
Canadian troops and went up towards Wong
Nei Chong Gap.

tor. At 1600 hours 21st December a telegram
was received from the Military Attache,
Chungking, that the main Chinese attack could
not start before 1st January but ‘‘ it was hoped
that’ twenty bombers would operate at once
agamst Japanese aerodromes.

oz The question of the women and children
at Repulse Bay Hotel now arose. It was diffi-
cult to give a satisfactory answer but I decided
that the safest course would be to leave them
there for the night The situation was extremely
“ flud,’’ both in this area and the Little Hong
Kong area.

103. After dark enemy landing craft operating
near the R.N. Yard were fired on from pill
boxes and passed West down the harbour, but
no actual landing was attempted. Strong
Police patrols were sent out m the Central and
Western Districts for special yeconnaissance to
confirm this.

104. (a) During the day 21st December The
Royal Rifles of Canada had been trying to
force their way north-eastwards as planned—
one company and carriers, with No 1 Com-
pany Volunteer Machine Gunners in support,
up the Tytam Road; a second Company
directed across country on to Bridge Hill. These
companies made a great effort, in spite of
handicaps, but by the late afternoon could get
no further forward than Red Hill-Bridge Hill,
owing to considerable resistance by the enemy.
Volunteer machine-gunners (Nos 1 and 2 Com-
panies) rendered valuable forward support on
this occasion.

(0) At 2030 hours 21st December Major C. R.
Templar reported an unsuccessful attack on
Wong Nei Chong Gap and that there were still
about one hundred R.A.S.C. and R.A.O C. on
“The Ridge,’’ with fifty Canadians in Alta-
mira House. Further, that sixty to seventy
Canadians were in Repulse Bay Hotel, round
which sniping was continuing.

105. At about midmght a cable was received
from the War Office emphasising the need to
destroy all oil installations This was carried
out by artillery fire on the next day (22nd)
The Texaco tanks at Tsun Wan Wai, the Shell
tanks at Tai Kok Tsui (next to Cosmopolitan
Dock), and the R.N tanks a mile to the South
thereof, were all set well alight, but the Socony
tanks* at Laichikok could not be shelled as
they_were close to the hospital establishment in
the women’s prison,

106. (a) In the evening (21st December) the
decision was taken to evacuate ‘‘ The Ridge,”’
and at about 2230 hours 8 officers and 120
other ranks left, trying at the same time to
clear the catchwater in a southerly direction
This, however, failed under enemy machine
gun fire. They sheltered for the night in ‘‘ Over-
bays ’’, a private house on the edge of Deep-
water Bay.

* A demolition scheme had been fully prepared, but
the area was over-run too quickly on the morning
of 11th December Luckily this Depot was only half
full

(6) Durmg the evening some Japanese
managed to penetrate into the Repulse Bay
Hotel but were evicted by prompt action
initiated by Major Templar.

107. Night 2r/2znd December. Enemy
launches kept the North shore defences on the
alert, but there were no attempted landings.
Sniping occurred from houses round the Race
Course and also in Victoria. The civil popu-
lation observed the curfew well.

ro8 In the morning the enemy opened heavy
fire from Middle Spur and resumed operations
on the high ground North of the Repulse Bay
Hotel, and at 1000 hours he was reported in
possession of two large houses overlooking
Deepwater Bay. At 1030 hours 2and
December I placed Stanley Garrison under the
direct orders of Brigadier Wallis By now
the mtention of linking up East Infantry Bri-
gade with West Infantry Brigade by moving
westwards had perforce to be abandoned.

It may be noted that at this time the 3 7-in
Howitzers at Stanley had only 45 rounds left
in all. This was supplemented later when
the provisioning of Stanley garrison was carried
out by motor torpedo boats from Aberdeen.

In the meantime the enemy had cut off the
water supply in Stanley by the capture of the
Tytam Reservoir area machinery. For the
forces in the Repulse area there was now only
two days’ supply of food and water. The
evacuation of the civilians was still quite im-
practicable either by road or by water though
I went into the question most carefully

Iog (a) 1030 hours 22nd December —Com-
mander West Infantry Brigade reported that
the Canadian troops in the Mount Cameron
area were being heavily dive-bombed and mor-
tared. They had no tools with which to dig
in (although the rocky ground made this in
any case almost impossible), no 3-in: mortars
or bombs, there was no shelter, and there was
nothing to do except stick it out with small
arms fire from behind the rocks. These condi-
tions applied in general to the subsequent fight-
ing on the important high ground there.

Morale now had been seriously affected by
the feeling that it was futile to continue re-
sistance with insufficient equipment, with in-
sufficient mobile artillery support, and without
both air support and air observation.

(b) At this time, too, 2, Royal Scots were
being heavily mortared from the ground near
Jardines Lookout. The enemy seemed to have
no difficulty in keeping up his ammunition sup-
ply across country from North Shore: and evi-
dence was afterwards forthcoming that local
Chinese were forcibly impressed as_ carriers.
Much of the Japanese mortar ammunition, too,
was of a much lighter nature than the British:
one variety was 95 per cent. H.E., thus causing
great moral effect, particularly valuable on
un-seasoned troops in the opening phases of
battle. The Japanese handling of mortars was
extremely good. They were very quick into
action; were quickly ranged, and accurate con-
centrations were put down at short notice at
ranges of 1,500 yards.

(c) By the early afternoon 22nd December
the enemy was consolidating his positions on
the northern lower slopes of Mount Nicholson
within one hundred yards of the 2 Royal
Scots forward defended localities.
