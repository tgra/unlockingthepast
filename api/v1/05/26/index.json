On the Belgian side of the frontier the order to begin the inundations was not given by Belgian G.Q.G. till the morning of 26th May and they never became effective.",

Our line west of Canea was broken and driven back on Suda Bay, so that a considerable portion of the base area fell into enemy hands Suda Bay became no longer tenable. All troops were much exhausted and the enemy air bombing was as intensive as ever. The enemy had by this time landed some 30,000 to 35,000 troops on the island. Early on the morning of 27th May General Freyberg decided that evacuation was inevitable, and reported to me accordingly. In view of the situation he described and the impossibility of sending further reinforcements, I gave orders for the withdrawal of our garrisons from Crete.",

            "description": "As it turned out, the enemy chose to make his main thrust by the southern route and, having concentrated his armoured formations round Segnali, moved them during the night of the 26th May to the east of Bir Hacheim. Early on the 27th he struck rapidly northwards towards Acroma and E] Adem. Meanwhile he made an abortive attack on Bir Hacheim and a half-hearted demonstration against our positions between Gazala and Alem Hamza. Though somewhat scattered, the 30th Corps met the enemy’s northward thrust, and heavy but indecisive fighting continued all day and resulted in the enemy being held south of a line through Knightsbridge and El Adem.",

            "description": "On these orders the pursuit was pressed rapidly. The main difference was that 13 Corps was no longer directed on the TerniRieti area but farther afield; this meant that the South Africans were no longer to turn eastwards to cross the Tiber to seize Narni as originally planned, but to press on to Orvieto. Here again a difficult question of routeing was involved since both they and II Corps were in danger of arriving simultaneously at Viterbo. I decided to give precedence to the armour and II Corps was halted in place until the South Africans were through. Meanwhile VI Corps made rapid progress up the coast in spite of the arrival of two fresh German divisions. On the gth it captured Tarquinia and a task force from 1 Armoured Division, operating on the inland flank, cut into II Corps’ territory to capture the Viterbo airfield. On the rrth, however, VI Corps was relieved by IV Corps and moved to Naples, coming under command of Seventh Army for operation ANVIL. II ad pushed forward with 85 and up the axis of Route 2 and consolidated the position between VI and 13 Corps. It was relieved by the French on oth June. On the oth Eighth Amy had also carried out a regrouping; the Tiber was now to be the boundary between 13 and 10 Corps, with the latter commanding all the troops formerly in 13 Corps east of the river. The final result was to give 13 Corps 78 and 6 South African Divisions, with 4 Division in reserve, and 10 Corps 6 British Armoured and 8 Indian Infantry Divisions, with 10 Indian as reserve. The Canadians were grounded south of Rome. The Polish Corps, which had passed to Army Group reserve on 26th May after the capture of Piedimonte, assumed command of the Adriatic sector from 5 Corps on 17th June, remaining under direct command of my headquarters until 29th June when it passed to Eighth Army.
