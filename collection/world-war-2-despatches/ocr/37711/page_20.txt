to expand, demolitions on a grand scale had to
be overcome—demolition of ports, railways,
bridges and airfields—combined with extensive
and very skilful mine laying.

The repair of well blitzed and intentionally
demolished airfields, or more often construction
of new ones, was in itself a major task: upon
which depended our support from the air.

Twin petrol pipelines were laid from Cher-
bourg across the Seine at Rouen, and from
Boulogne stretching across the Rhine. These
were supplied from ships pumping ashore, and
later in particular from the famous ‘‘ PLUTO.””
The pipelines transported during the campaign
more than a million tons of petrol.

Nearly two thousand Bailey bridges were
erected, including spans across the Seine, the
Meuse, the Rhine and the Weser—some of which
were nearly a mile long. It has once more
been shown that rivers, even very big rivers
with complete demolition belts, do not hold up
an army, in spite of the weight of modern traffic.

Armour and the mass of lorries assisting the
Army played havoc with the roads, and the
maintenance of them in conditions of continual
traffic, especially in low-lying districts in severe
winter conditions, was perhaps the most heart-
rending task that faced the Engineers. They
were greatly assisted by the Pioneer Corps,
which in this task, as in so many others, did a
very excellent job.

The most determined demolitions were in the
ports. But it has been proved that it is im-
possible to destroy a port so badly that it cannot
be put into some sort of operation by the time
the Navy have cleared the mines obstructing
its entrance.

The Sappers were very well equipped; but it
is important to remember that it is the human
element—the resourceful officers and skilled and
willing men—which is the major factor in en-
gineering in war. We were often very short of
Sappers, particularly during the big river cross-
ing operations.

Signals.

It is fundamental that successful operations
demand really efficient communications. It is
therefore worth emphasising that a commander,
at whatever level, must take his R. Signals
adviser into his confidence from the earliest
stages in preparing a plan.

Much of Signals’ work was of the unspec-*

tacular, slogging variety which the provision of
a vast network of communications involves.
The constant aim of Signals was to build up the
solid cable head as far forward as possible, to
provide reliable jumping-off places for com-
munications in the battle area. To serve my
own Tactical Headquarters, which frequently
moved at intervals of every two or three days,
use was made of an ultra high frequency wire-
less of an entirely new type (No. ro set). This
method gave me secure speech communication
with my armies and my Main Headquarters.

I think that one of the main Signals lessons
has been the necessity for insisting that the
officers reach a really high standard of technical
ability. Modern equipment becomes increas-
ingly complicated and diverse, and the officers
must know all about it, if they are to get the
best results.

The Infantry.

In spite of predictions to the contrary, the
Infantry has lost none of its importance on the
battlefield.

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 4 SEPTEMBER, 1946

Modern infantry is a master of more weapons
than ever before, and the infantryman’s life
depends primarily on the skill with which he
uses them; he must reach an _ increasingly
higher standard of training. It has been 4 war
of movement, but although the infantryman’
may motor into battle, his training must keep
him hard and tough—a point which must never
be overlooked in these days of troop carrying
transport,

The introduction of the armoured personnel
carrier is an important innovation in the
employment of infantry. It enables infantry
to be transported across bullet-swept zones in
order to arrive fresh at the vital part of the
battlefield. The development of this technique
has already gone far, and done much to enlarge
the scope of infantry tactics. For example, in
the first major attack by the Canadian Army
astride the Falaise road on 7 August, infantry
carried in ‘‘ Kangaroos ”’ were moved by night
a distance of five miles to their off-loading
point; the last four miles of this advance were
actually within the enemy positions, and the
troops debussed almost on the edge of the
enemy gun areas. They then fanned out to
overrun the belt of country they were attacking.

The tendency to do more and more by night
has been greatly facilitated by the provision of
‘* artificial moonlight ’’. Artificial moonlight,
provided by Searchlight batteries, has now _
become a standard part of our military
organisation and has greatly assisted the
activities of the infantryman. It has also
proved its value in more rearward areas to the
bridge builders and administrative echelons.

It has again been the Infantry who suffered
the heaviest casualties. I cannot praise too
highly the stamina and persistence which the
Infantry displayed in the campaign. Divisions
were called upon to remain continuously in
action for many months on end—to this they
responded admirably, even during the very
bitter winter we experienced.

Airborne Forces.

Airborne forces must now form an essential
part of the Army, as there will often be
occasions in which they can play a vital role.
Apart from their participation in the battle, the
threat of their use can be turned to important
advantage, for experience has shown that
thereby the enemy can be led to make consider-
able and even vital dispersions of his front line
forces. This is in addition to the need to lock
up troops in rear areas for guarding vital zones
and installations when the opponent is known
to have airborne troops at his disposal.

The use of airborne forces in highly mobile
operations is limited, because the time required
for planning their descents frequently results in
the ground troops over-running the projected
dropping zones. But in deliberate operations,
such as the seaborne assault, or the assault
across a major river obstacle, airborne troops
have proved to be a battle winning factor.

The threat of an airborne operation, in con-
junction with other factors, was material in
causing the Germans to retain major formations
in the Pas de Calais during the initial period
after our landing in Normandy. Nearer the
battlefield, uncertainty as to our intentions,
combined with the use of dummy paratroops,
caused alarm and despondency to the enemy.
This delayed the arrival on the battlefield of
portions of his forces at a vital time.
