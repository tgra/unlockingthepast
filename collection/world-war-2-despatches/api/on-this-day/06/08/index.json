            "date": "8th June",
            "description": "Meanwhile the enemy's assaults on Bir Hacheim were renewed. Beginning on the 6th June, the attacks continued and grew in intensity. The Free French resisted valiantly, but on  the evening of the 8th June, General  Koenig was obliged to report that the situation had become serious. It seemed likely that the stronghold would fall unless the garrison was given support from outside. becoming critical, General Ritchi  was anxious  to retain possession of it since, if it were lost, we should have to form a new and extended front facing southwards behind which we might be hemmed in and deprived of our power of manoeuvre. The threat to our rear would be increased, and, while it would be more necessary than ever to attack the enemy's supply lines, to do so from the south would become correspondingly more difficult. I agreed that we must hold the enemy frontally and do everfthing in our power to deprive him of supplies. Orders were therefore issued for an armoured regimental group from the 4th Armoured Brigade with two columns each from the 7th Motor Brigade and the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade to attack the goth Light Division in the rear next day, At the same time a convoy was to be passed in, and arrangements were made for aircraft to drop supplies. It was intended that the armoured regimental group should eventually (join the forces operating round Mteifel. ;"

            "description": "On the 8th June, an enemy attack on Bir Hacheim for the first time made some progress, one of our positions being overrun. Next morning the garrison was subjected to intense dive-bombing and shelling. Attacks from the north continued all day, but in the evening the Free French drove the enemy back once more. On the roth June General Ritchie decided to order the Free French to evacuate Bir Hacheim, Enemy pressure continued from the south and the attacks of the armoured regimental group had not succeeded in relieving it. It was clear, too, that the resistance of the garrison was being worn down. Having be n again subjected to heavy bombing from the air, and having again held off a strong enemy attack, the ist Free French Brigade withdrew during the night escorted by the 7th Armoured Division. Next morning it was reported that at least two thousand men had been safely withdrawn and that many others were coming in."

These in turn moved to anchorages in the Fjords awaiting orders for the forming of the main convoy, which was done during the night 7th/8th June. At each embarkation place, alternative points for embarkation were selected in case of bombing, whilst a reserve of   puffer   craft was held at each locality to meet all probable eventualities. These craft were formed inte small fleets with an Army officer in charge, and two British O.Rs. on board each ship."

This was a much smaller force than I considered necessary, also I disliked using the Free French since J knew that this would be likely to stiffen the resistance of the French in Syria, but I had no other troops I could make available. I was instructed by the Chiefs of Staff to advance into Syria as soon as the above force was reasonably prepared. I reported that 7th June.was the earliest date by which the operation could start, actually it began on 8th June."

The French had obviously expected attack by a much larger force; but finding how weak we were, they soon took heart and their resistance stiffened. On the right the Free French had advanced to within about ten miles of Damascus by rath June. On the left the Australian right column captured Merjayun, while on gth June the left column after an extremely hard fight had crossed the river Litani on the coast. In this action a commando from Cyprus effected a landing on the coast and assisted in the Australian success, though at the cost of somewhat heavy casualties."

That night German armoured units penetrated into Rouen, and the French Tenth Army lost all touch from then onward with its IX Corps in the Rouen-Dieppe cul-desac. 10. The 51st Division was thus completely cut off from its proper line of retirement via Rouen.
