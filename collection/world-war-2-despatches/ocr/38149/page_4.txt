When such a pattern is evident (e.g. the attacks
on our ports; “‘ Baedeker ’’ raids etc.) “defences
can be organised rapidly to meet it,

Section II,_Tse Day Ramer.

28, Afl the equipment available during the
first year ot war had been designed for shooting
at seen targets. Except in cloudy weather it
was, therefore, generally suitable for dealing
with attacks by day and it was by day that the
first attacks were made.

The principle used was the following: a pre-
dictor fitted with telescopes was laid on and
followed the target, a height calculated by a
heightfinder was set into it and the predictor
mechanism automatically calculated where the
target would be at the time the shell burst in
the sky and by means of electric pointers en-
abled the gun to be aimed at that point.

There were, however, limitations to this
equipment. Predictors were not designed to
accept heights over 25,000 feet and as the
enemy developed his tactics he flew more fre-
quently at greater heights; further, there was
a limit to the speed at which the predictor
could traverse so that close targets often moved
across the sky too fast to be followed. Except
in very clear weather the “‘ pick up ’”’ was too
late to.ensure adequate time to bring effective
fire to bear.

29. Reference has already been made to the
shortage of equipment in the early part of the
war. The responsibility for allocating what
‘equipment there was rested primarily with the
A.O.C.-in-C. Fighter Command, who invari-
ably consulted me in the matter. The demands
for defence were, however, so various and the
interests involved so powerful that we were
continually faced with fresh agitations for de-
fences. In order to deal with these requests a
sub-committee of the Chiefs of Staff Committee
known as, the C.0.S. AA Committee was
formed. The three services were represented
on this committee and the Minister of Home
Security was also on it.

30. Another effect. of the oe was that
none of the units was fully equipped with the

weapons it was intended they should have and.

though other types of weapons were brought
in to fill the gap, complications arose because
units frequently had to operate. two, three or
more types of equipment simultaneously.

3x. The Heavy guns included the 4.5-inch
of which I had 355 by June, 1940, when day
raiders began to be serious. Secondly, there
was the 3.7-inch on either a mobile or a static
mounting, and this gun became the mainstay of
heavy anti-aircraft armament throughout the
war and in my opinion was the finest all pur-
poses gun produced by any country during the
war. Unfortunately it was never mounted in
atank. In June, 1940, I had 306 mobile and
313 static 3.7-inch guns and finally I had 226
obsolescent 3-inch guns.

Light anti-aircraft guns at the same date com-
prised the following:—273 40-mm_ Bofors,
which was the chief Light weapon; 136 obso-
lescent 3-inch guns adapted for low level
shooting; 140 miscellaneous types of 2-pounder
guns on loan from the Royal Navy; and 38
2o-mm Hispano cannons. ~

32. The first raids were made in October,
939, upon the Forth and upon Scapa Flow.

SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 18 DECEMBER, 1947

Though the guns: were successful in destroying
some of the raiders, it was at once apparent
that peacetime training and the existing equip-
ment was insufficient to deal. entirely success-
fully with wartime targets, which continually
dived and turned and flew at comparatively
high speeds. Steps were taken to have altera-
tions designed and made to meet the needs
of the situation, but nearly two years elapsed
before these were actually produced.

Until June, 1940, enemy activity consisted
mainly of sporadic minelaying or reconnais-
sance flights, often by single planes, and of
small scale attacks upon convoys and the
northern bases of the Home Fleet.

33. I do not propose to discuss on what
exact date the Battle of Britain began, but
what is certain is that in the second half of
June, 1940, there was a marked increase in
activity by the German air forces over and
around the United Kingdom.

-34. With the limited resources at my disposal
it was impossible to give the country the de-
gree of protection required at this time and the
main weight of the attacks during the daylight
Battle of Britain was borne by Fighter Com-
mand. Nevertheless it is only right to draw
attention to the important part played by the
guns during this battle, a part which the R.A.F.
have never minimised; and inded of the large
daily totals of enemy aircraft destroyed in the

- battle, at times twenty, and on one occasion

thirty, fell to the guns.

When the enemy began to come over in
large formations the Heavy guns frequently laid
the foundation of the Fighter successes by
breaking up the formations with their fire,
thereby rendering them vulnerable, while the’
presence of small groups of enemy aircraft or
individual planes, which might otherwise have
escaped the attention of fighter pilots, was in-
dicated to them by bursts of anti-aircraft fire in
the sky.

. Light filled a réle for which there could
be no alternative weapon, particularly in the.
defence of airfields. Experience abroad had
already demonstrated, and future experience
was to confirm, that airfields lacking anti-gir-

"scraft defence were unable to continue in action

against a sustained attack. Only guns, and lots
of them, can defend an aircraft during the
vulnerable moments when it is taking-off or
landing.

35. The Battle of Britain may conveniently
be divided into four phases althéugh these
sometimes overlapped. During the second half
of the battle there were attacks by night as well
as by day, but I propose to ‘defer discussion
of the night raids until later in this despatch.

+ The first phase of the battle consisted largely
of attacks on convoys in the Channel and on
south coast ports. The heaviest engagements
occurred between Harwich and Lyme Bay,
although places as far on either flank as the
“Orkneys and Cardiff received some ‘attention.
So long as the enemy confined his attacks to
shipping, the guns of A.A. Command could
take no part in the battle and it fell to Fighter
Command, who were able by their radar to
observé concentrations of aircraft in the Calais
region, to endeavour to deal with them. When
ports were attacked the guns were-in action: and
at Portsmouth, Portland and in particular
