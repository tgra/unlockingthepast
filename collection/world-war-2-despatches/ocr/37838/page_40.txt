tional control of the United States and Royal
Air Force troop carrier forces, previously under
my command, had been transferred in accord-
ance with your direction, in August, 1944. A
full report on these operations is being issued
by the Commanding General of the First Allied
Airborne Army, Lieutenant General Louis
Brereton, who had relinquished the command
of the United States Ninth Air Force to take over
this new appointment.

376. Besides the aircraft of the troop carrier
air forces, the aircraft of A.E.A.F., United
States Eighth Air Force, R.A.F. Bomber Com-
mand and R.A.F. Coastal Command were en-
gaged in support of these operations. The
co-ordination of the activities of all the air forces
concerned in a supporting role was carried out
at my headquarters at meetings with representa-
tives of the interested commands.

377. The chief meeting took place on 12th
September, and at this meeting the principal
tasks of the air forces were assigned. These
tasks were: —

(i) The attacking of airfields and known
flak positions by heavy bombers.

(ii) The dive bombing of flak positions
which might be developed by the enemy
during the operation.

(iii) The provision of top cover along the
route to be followed by the airborne trains,
and a fighter screen east and north of the
dropping and landing areas. ‘

(iv) The provision of night fighter patrols.

(v) The arrangements for dummy drops.

(vi) The arrangements for diversions by
R.A.F, Coastal Command.

(vii) The arrangements for re-supply of air-
borne forces by heavy bombers on D+ 7.

378. All these operations as planned at this
meeting were actually carried out, and in addi-
tion, the air forces continued to lend support to
the ground operations during the whole period
that the intense phase of the operation lasted.
I have referred to some of these activities by
the air forces at other points in this Despatch,
but below is summarised briefly what was
actually done.

379. On the night of 16/17th September,
R.A.F. Bomber Command attacked with 200
Lancasters and 23 Mosquitoes, four airfields at
Leeuwarden, Steewijk-Havelte, Hopsten and
Salzbergen. These enemy airfields were those
from which fighters could attack the transports
and gliders carrying the airborne forces. Nearly
goo tons of bombs were dropped with good to
excellent results on these airfields. On the same
night, 54 Lancasters and 5 Mosquitoes dropped
294 tons of bombs on flak positions at Moerdijk,
also with good results. On the following morn-
ing, 85 Lancasters and 15 Mosquitoes dropped
535 tons of bombs on coastal defence batteries
in the Walcheren area. For these daylight
epeaioons Spitfires of A.D.G.B. provided
escort.

380. These operations by R.A.F. Bomber
Command were followed up on the morning of
D+1 by heavy bombers of the United States
Eighth Air Force which attacked x17 flak posi-
tions along the routes to be followed and near
the dropping and landing zones, just prior to the
arrival of the troop carriers. In these attacks,
816 heavy bombers dropped 3,139 tons of
bombs with fair to good results in most cases.
A further six bombers also attacked the airfield
at Eindhoven,

381. During the afternoon of D+zx, 18th
September, 252 heavy bombers of the United
States Eighth Air Force dropped 782 tons of
supplies to the ground forces with good to excel-
lent results.

382. The airborne forces were carried in two
great trains of troop carrier aircraft and gliders,
one following a northerly, the other a southerly
route. The plan for the protection of these two
trains of troop carriers provided for a high cover
of fighters and a force of fighter bombers at low
level, ready to dive bomb any flak positions
that opened fire. On the northern route, air-
craft of A.D.G.B. carried out these two tasks,
as far as the turning point near ’sHertogenbosch,
employing 371 fighters for this purpose. Fighter
aircraft of the United States Eighth Air Force
then took over covering the train of troop car-
riers to the dropping and landing zones.
Fighters of this air force also provided top cover
to the train approaching over the southern
route, and in addition, provided a fighter screen
to the east and north of the dropping and landing
zones. In these tasks, fighters were em-
ployed. In addition, 212 fighters of the United
States Ninth Air Force dive bombed flak posi-
tions along the southern route between the
turning point and the dropping and landing
zones,

383. The attacks on the enemy flak positions
along the routes were very successful. The
great bulk of the land batteries were silenced
and in addition, several flak ships and barges
off the Dutch Islands were destroyed. ‘

384. The G.A.F. reaction to these very large
scale operations was small on D-Day, approxi-
mately 30 enemy fighters only being seen, seven
of which were shot down. On the second,
third and sixth days, however, the German
Air Force reacted much more strongly, and up

.to the end of the operation a total of 159 enemy

aircraft were destroyed over the area.

385. Throughout the operations, the Allied
air forces continued to cover the airborne forces,
to lend direct support to the ground forces and
particularly to attack flak positions. In all,
the supporting air forces flew over 7,800 sorties
in support of Operation ‘‘ Market ’’. A’ total
of 114 airoraft were lost, in addition to the
casualties incurred by the troop carrier forces.

386. The Air/Sea Rescue Service functioned
most efficiently during these airborne opera-
tions. A string of 17 launches was placed
across the North Sea on the northern route and
a further string of ro launches along the
southern route. In addition, special reconnais-
sances were flown, spotting for ditched planes
and gliders. Most of the ditching occurred on
D+2, when the weather was bad and the tow-
lines of many gliders parted. On this day,
one launch picked up all the personnel from five
ditched gliders. In all 205 personnel were saved
by the Air/Sea Rescue Service during these
operations.

Attacks against Enemy Naval Targets.

387. I now turn to the duties of the Air Force
in assisting the Allied Navies in dealing with
enemy naval units trying to interfere with the
landing and the subsequent ferrying of rein-
forcements and supplies by our ships across
the Channel. The following brief review covers
these operations from the time of the assault
to the end of September, 1944. The main
burden was shouldered by R.A.F. Coastal Com-
