5580.

118. Small veterinary detachments were
attached to both the 13th and 30th Corps to
train units in animal management, first aid and
the use of improvised pack transport, so that

the best use might be made of civilian and.

captured animals acquired during the operation.

119. The assault on Sicily, when it took
place, inevitably produced a crop of new
lessons, and caused some of the doctrines
taught during this period of intensive training
to be revised. But the training establishments
had none the less proved invaluable in teach-
ing many essentials and in getting formations
physically fit for their task.

120. As the climax of these preparations,
Middle East Command was responsible for
embarking, in addition to army, corps and line
of communication troops, that part of the 13th
Corps which consisted of the 5th and 50th Divi-
sions and the 4th Armoured Brigade, and the
231st Infantry Brigade, which was in the 30th
Corps. This commitment brought to the proof
all the planning and training, and stretched the
movement facilities to the maximum.

rar. Sixty M.T./Stores ships, tactically
stowed, and twenty-five troopships, in addition
to a large number of landing craft, were re-
quired for the first two convoys. The outline
plan was that M.T. /Stores ships were to begin
loading at Beirut, Haifa and Alexandria early
in June. Personnel ships were to load at Suez
at the beginning of July. Half of the L.S.Ts.
(tank-landing ships, with a capacity of fifty
vehicles, or twenty-two tanks and twenty
vehicles) were to load half at Suez and half
at Alexandria. L.C.Ts. (tank-landing craft,
with a capacity of ten vehicles or six tanks)
were to load at Benghazi. The M.T./Stores
convoys were planned to arrive as follows: the
assault convoy on roth July, first follow-up
convoy on 13th July, amd second follow-up
convoy on 24th July. Thereafter reinforce-
ments and maintenance convoys would be
sailed every fourteen days until 22nd August,
when they would be sailed every ten days.

122. Excluding personnel ships, sixty British
and Allied and thirty United States vessels
were allocated to form the first three convoys.
The necessary work of fitting these vessels was
begun at Ismailia, Port Said and Port Sudan
early in April.

123. To avoid heavy calls on transport, the
stores for the first convoys were moved by the
middle of May to depots adjacent to the ports,
ready to be called forward for loading. Load-
ing in accordance with pre-stowage plans
began early in June and, a from initial
difficulties with vehicle weights and measure-
ments, proceeded very well.

124. During this period the strain was
increased ‘by the fact that vehicles and signal
equipment, once waterproofed, could not be
used for ordinary purposes, and a duplicate
service had to be provided. This was particu-
larly heavy on signals, who were also carrying
a heavy weight of traffic over the long line of
communication to Tripoli.

125. Another problem which had to be over-
come was that of checking, changing and
charging vehicles’ batteries to ensure that they
would hold their charge for the five to seven
weeks during which they might have ‘to stand
in ships’ holds. This was done by special
arrangements,

including the provision of ©

batteries at the ports of embarkation and to
accompany landing craft and vehicles during
transit.

126. When loading started it was found that
many vehicles were mechanically unfit, and
arrangements were made to inspect all vehicles
before they were called forward. Light repairs
were effected on the spot and special arrange-
ments were made in the nearest base work-
shops to carry out heavier repairs. Out of
3,200 vehicles inspected at Alexandria, 932
required repair and 138 were condemned as
unfit for operational use.

127. Embarkation of all personnel in M.T./
Stores ships took place at Beirut, Haifa and
Alexandria and was completed by 5th July.
While the M.T./Stores ships for the 5th and
goth Divisions and the 231st Brigade were
being loaded at Beirut, Haifa and Alexandria,
other formations were being moved to Malta in
teadiness for the assault or follow-up. The
assault troops of the 51st Division were moved
in Janding craft from Sousse and Sfax, and
Main Army Headquarters and the 30th Corps
Headquarters with air formations, also in
landing craft, from Tripoli to Malta. The
ferrying of these troops with their vehicles,
equipment and maintenance stores, involved
the most careful planning in conjunction with
the Royal Navy for the use of the landing craft
available. Before the attack was launched the
Tripoli-Malta ferry had convoyed 7,000
personnel and 1,400 vehicles. In all some
32,000 personnel and 6,000 vehicles, as well as
guns and tanks, were embarked at Tripoli for
Sicily. Other headquarters and units with
equipment, stores and vehicles were moved
from Egypt to Malta in personnel and
M.T./Stores ships. From 3rd to roth June,
7,000 personnel and 600 vehicles were des-
patched from ‘Alexandria to Malta.

128. Embarkation of the assault personnel
on the assault-day convoy into fifteen personnel
ships and of the follow-up personnel on the
third-day convoy into twelve personnel ships
took place at Suez on 29th-3o0th June and Ist
July. Although in these three days approxi-
mately 46,500 personnel were embarked the
operation was carried through smoothly. ,

12g. The programme for loading the
vehicles of the assault convoy was also success-
fully carried out. Since the date of the arrival
of the L.C.Ts. through the Mediterranean left
little margin for loading in Egypt, Benghazi
was to be used as the port of embarkation.
Assault personnel and vehicles of four brigades
(the x5th, r7th, 51st and 231st Brigades)
were therefore moved by rail and road from
the Delta to Benghazi, where they embarked
detween 24th June and 5th July; this involved
a total of 2,700 personnel and 850 vehicles. ~

130. On 16th June the loading of 8 L.S.Ts.
with vehicles and escorts only was begun at
Suez. The L.S.Ts. then sailed to Alexandria,
where they embarked the remaining personnel
and joined up with 9 L.S.Ts. which had been
loaded there. The embarkation of the L.S.Ts.
was completed by 21st June. In all, for the
first two convoys a total of 65,000 personnel,
9,400 vehicles and 60,000 tons of stores was
loaded.

of Eastern Task Force had been an extensive
