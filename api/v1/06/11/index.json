            "description": "losing stage of that period of strat which began with the invasion of North ica in November, 1942, or which might, on a longer view, be considered as beginning when the first British armoured cars crossed the frontier wire into Cyrenaica on 11th June, 1940, the morrow of Mussolini\u2019s declaration of war. The invasion of Italy was part of the next period in European strategy which was destined to culminate in the invasion of the \u2018West and the destruction of the German armies. -When the last German fied across the Straits of Messina the first aim of Allied strategy had been achieved: to clear the enemy from Africa and to open the Mediterranean to the shipping of the United Nations without fear of interruption; in the next phase the Mediterranean theatre would no longer receive the first priority of resources and its operations would become preparatory and subsidiary to the great invasion based on the United Kingdom. It was now called on to break up the victorious team of armies trained in its hard school and to surtender to the West the picked divisions which were to form the spearhead of the assault on the beaches of Normandy."
