SECTION XV —THE AIR SITUATION.

ror. The Air Officer Commanding Far East,
Air Vice-Marshal Pulford, on takmg over com-
mand at Singapore on the 26th April, 1941, was
faced with tremendous difficulties. The aircraft
at his disposal were still very deficient in num-
bers and few of them were of modern types.

toz. The bulk of the fighters were the
American built Brewster Buffalos, compara-
tively slow machines with poor manoeuvrability.
The device by which the .5 in. machine guns
with which they were equipped fired through
the propeller was faulty and caused a lot of
trouble. A large number of the machines were
also temporarily unserviceable when war
started. There was also a squadron of Blen-
heim night-fighters. None of these machines
could be classified as modern fighters. For these
fighters only a limited number of trained pilots
were sent from the United Kingdom. The re-
mainder had to be found from pilots, mostly
New Zealanders, who arrived in Malaya with a
minimum of flying traning and no fighter train-
ing, or by transferring pilots from other types
of aircraft.

103. The bombers consisted of two squadrons
of Hudson General Reconnaissance machines
and two squadrons of Blenhems. Some of these
squadrons were below strength. There were no
heavy bombers in Malaya.

104. There were two squadrons of Torpedo-
bombers of the Vildebeeste type. These
machines were obsolete. They had a very
limited range, and a speed of less than x00 miles
per hour,

105. There was one Flying-boat squadron of
Catalina machines, which had also become de-
ficient in numbers owing to casualties and lack
of reserves.

106. There were no special Army Co-opera-
tion aircraft in Malaya. I arranged, however,
with the A.O.C. Far East for some of the
fighters to be made available for training in
Army co-operation work. It was only possible,
in the short time available and owing to lack
of resources, for the most elementary training
to be carried out.

There were no transport or dive-bomber air-
craft in Malaya.

to7. There was a great shortage of spare
parts, reserve aircraft, and reserve pilots. For
this reason and in order to conserve resources
flying was from May, 1941, onwards greatly
restricted. In order to assist the Air Force, Army
Officers, when travelling about by air, usua’ly
used light machines belonging to the Civil
Transport Line or to the Volunteer Air Force.

The Air Force in Malaya was drained of
trained personnel to supply shortages in the
Middle East. Trained personnel were also

SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE,«26 FEBRUARY, 1948

withdrawn from the Australian squadrons to act
as instructors in Australia.

The restrictions on flying and the shortage of
trained personnel militated greatly against
efficiency.

x08. ‘When war broke out with Japan, the
total of operationally serviceable I.E. aircraft

_ in Malaya was as under: —

in Indian
Ocean).
Total ... 141

This contrasted with the 566 rst Line aircraft
which had been asked for.

In addition to the above, there were a few
Light Aircraft (Moths etc.) manned by the
Volunteer Air Force.

Iog. This was the Air Force with which we
started the war. There was in fact no really
effective Air Striking Force in Malaya and the
fighters were mcapable of giving effective sup-
port to such bombers as there were or of taking
their proper place in the defence.

The A.O.C. was fully alive to the weakness
of the force at his disposal. He frequently
discussed this subject with me and I know
that he repeatedly represented the situation to
higher authority.

1x0. In order to facilitate co-operation be-
tween the Army and the Air Force in North
Malaya should hostilities break out, an air
organization known as Norgroup was _pre-
pared and a commander appointed. The func-
tions of the commander were:—

- (a) to command such air forces as Air
Headquarters might allot to him from time
to time;

(6) to act as air adviser to 6.0.C. 3 Indian
Corps and to command such air forces as
might be placed under the Corps
Commander.

SEcTION XVI.—SuMMARY OF THE SITUATION ON
THE OUTBREAK OF WAR WITH JAPAN.

111. (When war broke out with Japan on the

8th December, 1941, there were some glaring '

weaknesses in the arrangements for the defence
of Malaya.

112. The Navy no longer controlled the sea
approaches to Malaya and there was a great
shortage of craft suitable for coastal defence.

113. The Air Force, in place of a force of
566 ist Line Aircraft asked for by the A.O.C.
Far East or of 336 approved by the Chiefs of
Staff, had a force of only 141 operationally
serviceable aircraft, very few of which were
of the most modern types and some of which
were even obsolete. There were no modern
torpedo-bombers and no dive-bombers, the two
typés required for offensive action against an
