SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 18 SEPTEMBER, 1947

51. Throughout this period, many 15 in.
splashes were seen in and around the smoke,
mostly near the 5th Division, but also more
wildly amongst all other ships.

52. After firing torpedoes, course was con-
tinued to the eastward until 1817 to obtain
a clear view of the weather end of the smoke
and if necessary to cover the convoy from the
northeastward. While it was evident that the
battleship and some cruisers were attempting
to pass to leeward of the smoke, it was equally
evident that the enemy’s most effective course
of action was to pass to windward (east) of it
and that all his force was not with the battle-
ship so that some cruisers might be taking
this course of action.

53. Between 1816 and 1818 when a clear
view was obtained to the northeast and north
no enemy ships were seen. It is now evident
that by this time 2 or 3 of the enemy 6-inch
cruisers must have retired from the battle.

54. At 1827 course was altered to west, still
making smoke and to rejoin the 1st and 5th
Divisions in beating off the enemy to the west-
northwestward.

Puase IV.
The enemy driven off by Gun and Torpedo.

55. This phase started with all divisions
attempting to carry out the torpedo attack
ordered at 1759, and all converging on the all
important point between the battleship and the
convoy about 15 miles southeast of her.

56. Captain (D), Fourteenth Destroyer
Flotilla in JERVIS with the rst Division and
LEGION avoided 4 torpedo-bombers at 1823
by a tur to the southward but resumed a
northwesterly and then a northerly course 4
minutes later. At 1834 he sighted a large
enemy ship bearing 292 degs. about 6 miles, and
at 1835 turned his division together to 270 degs.
at 28 knots. He identified the enemy as one
Littorio class battleship and 3 cruisers widely
spaced in line ahead on approximate course
180 degs,

57. During the run in, the 1st Division
carried out a concentration shoot on the battle-
ship and two hits were seen. At the same
time CLEOPATRA (the only ship of the 4th,
and or 3rd Divisions to get a clear view because
of smoke) engaged the battleship when visible
and the leading 8-inch cruiser at other times.
CLEOPATRA was firing almost continuously
from 1831 to 1856 closing to just under 10,000
yards at 1847. Two hits were seen by 1845,
one of which started a considerable fire on
the battleship’s quarterdeck, and appeared to
put her after turret out of action and further
ae observed after she had turned away at
1845.

58. The enemy returned fire with 15-inch,
8-inch, 6-inch and smaller calibres. The battle-
ship appeared to be in divided control, the
forward 15-inch firing at the 1st Division and
the after group towards our cruisers. All
their fire was erratic and it was hard to say
who was the target.

59. At 1841, at a range of about 6,000 yards,
the xst Division turned to starboard to fire

4379

torpedoes. It appeared that LEGION (the
southernmost ship) actually turned to port,
and she was seen to be almost completely
covered by a 15-inch salvo as she tumed.
She emerged from the splashes with speed un-
impaired and apparently unharmed.

60. KINGSTON was hit by gunfire during
the tum and suffered a fire in a boiler room
and the engine room. She stopped but got the
fire under control and reported at 1907 that
she was able to proceed on one boiler at 16
knots. KELVIN stood by her whilst she was
stopped. KINGSTON was accordingly
ordered to join the convoy, or, if she could
not find it, to proceed independently at her
best speed to Malta. This latter in fact she did.

6r. At 1840, the leading 8-inch cruiser had
altered away, and at 1845 the battleship and
the other two cruisers also altered away and to
a course of about 340 degs.

62. At 1850, Captain (D), Twenty-Second
Destroyer Flotilla in SIKH, who was steering
northwest in an endeavour to get into a tor-
pedo-firing position, observed a certain torpedo
hit amidships on the battleship.

The 5th Division tumed to fire torpedoes from
the enemy’s quarter at 1855, but smoke inter-
fered with the aim and only LIVELY fired.
She fired a full outfit (8 torpedoes) but no
result was observed.

LIVELY had been damaged by a 15-inch
near miss at 1852 and had her fore lower mess-
deck flooded.

63.The enemy was now retiring rapidly to
the northward. No further opportunities for
torpedo or gunfire presented themselves, but
smoke was continued until I913—on a course
to close the convoy.

64. At 1911, course was altered to the north-
ward to concentrate the striking force and
all ships joimed company by 1920 when a
southerly course was shaped again to close
the convoy. KINGSTON was detached.

Air Aitack

65. ‘During this phase several torpedo-bomber
attacks were made on the striking force, all
ineffective, though they might well have used
our smoke to their advantage. There were also
a number of T/B attacks on the convoy, some
combined with high-level bombing attacks.
These also were beaten off without damage.
No aircraft were seen after 1925.

-Dispersal of the Force

66. At 1940, the convoy not being in sight
and dark fast approaching, it was decided
to turn Force B for Alexandria. Accordingly
course was shaped 050 degs. at 22 knots, alter-
ing to o80 degs. at 2040. At 1949, BRECON-
SHIRE was ordered to carry out Operation
‘““B’’, In fact she had already done so at
Igoo and the convoy was already dispersed.

At this time (1940) it was known that the
enemy was retiring to the northward. He had
failed to make contact with the convoy by day,
being driven off, and it was thought unlikely
that he would attempt a night attack after
having his battleship damaged by torpedo.
