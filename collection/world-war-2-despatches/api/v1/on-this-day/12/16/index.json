General Ritchie placed more troops at General Godwin-Austen's disposal to enable him to increase the frontal pressure and instructed him  o send the Armoured Division to turn the enemy's southern flank. The qth Armoured Brigade moved wide over difficult country and gained a position to the south of Tmimi well in rear of the enemy's positions, but its subsequent movements were  much impeded by bad going. On the night of the 16th December the enemy began to withdraw from his Gazala positions and the remnants of his armoured forces managed to slip away in the darkness."

Decisive results were hoped for from the action of the 4th Armoured Brigade on the 16th December, but these hopes were frustrated by the extreme roughness of the country it had to traverse. As its supply vehicles could scarcely move in the soft sand, the brigade had to go south to replenish, and this operation was not completed until about midday. Brigadier Gatehouse then took his brigade further east than his original objective, towards Sidi Breghisc and Bir Temrad where enemy concentrations were reported to be lying. Although they were still hampered by bad going, our tanks caused considerable damage and much confusion among the enemy in the heavy fighting which followed."

By the 16th December, some ten warships had been sighted in company with a tanker off Miri and Lutong, and these ships became the object of our attacks. On the 17th December, 6 Glenn Martins and 5 Buffaloes of the Netherlands East Indies Air Force delivered an attack from Sinkawang, but scored neither hits nor near misses. The same day, Dutch bombers from Samiuwkoa located and attacked this force, a Dutch navy Dornier scoring a direct hit on a destroyer. Encounters between Dutch Buffaloes and the Navy Zero fighters revealed the clear superiority of the Japanese aircraft. Reports of a Japanese landing at Lutong and Baram Point were received, and on the 18th December renewed attacks on enemy shipping in this area were made, without success, by a mixed force. Eight Glenn Martins from Sinkawang had to return without delivering their attack owing to the bad weather, The following day 6 Netherlands East Indies Glen Martins claimed a  hit on a cruiser and some near misses. The roth December, however, was also marked by Japanese air attacks, Kuching aerodrome and town being bombed by about 15 heavy bombers and one seaplane. Civilians suffered approximately 100 casualties, while the main material damage was the destruction of the Borneo Company Benzine Stores, The air war was also carried to Dutch Territory by a heavy attack on Pontianak, much of the city  being destroyed."

The defence of the position was thus left to the German mobile forces, who could delay their departure (without undue risk until our attack appeared imminent. There was still a chance, however, that the outflanking movement of the New Zealand Division might be able to catch some of his rearguards and the greater the losses we could inflict on his German troops the less chance there was of his being able to starid on his next position. Accordingly the date of the attack was advanced as much as possible;:the New Zealanders started off from El Haseiat on 12th December, 51 Division starting active raiding against the positions north and south of the Sebkha on the 11th to distract attention from the move, and the frontal attack was planned for the 14th."

By the 16th December all surplus stores and equipment had been evacuated and the withdrawal of the troops by rail began, The 4/19 Hyderabads were the first to leave so that they could tejoin their own brigade on the west coast. On the roth December the railhead at Kuala Krai was evacuated. The rearmost troops withdrew from Kuala Krai on foot as the large railway bridges a little south of that place had by then been destroyed. Practically all the stores and all the vehicles, except about 80 for which no railway flats were available, were successfully evacuated. A rearguard under Lt.-Col. McKellar, known as Macforce, was lett behind to watch the railway and prevent the repair of the bridges. It included troops of therPahang Volunteers and the Malay Regiment,;and carried out its duties most  efficiently,"

However, on balance, and considering the uncertainty of our knowledge, it would clearly have been unjustifiable to exclude any of the normal methods of defence which we were accustomed to use against piloted aircraft. Accordingly, I recommended in my outline plan, which I submitted to the Air Commander-in-Chief on the 16th December, that aircraft, guns, searchlights, and balloons all be deployed against pilotless aircraft in such a manner as to avoid causing mutual interference. I pointed out, however, that the missiles might well prove too fast for our fighters, and in any case would make difficult targets for A.A. gunners, I recommended, therefore, that the bombing offensive against the installations in France be continued with the utmost vigour. I also asked to be kept informed of the progress made by two committees which had been set up at the Air Ministry to investigate the possibility of radio and electro-magnetic counter-measures. t"

There was still doubt as to whether they meant to make a main stand on these positions, or merely to delay us on. this line. One report received on the 16th December definitely stated that the enemy would not hold Mandalay, but would continue withdrawal southwards. This was a contingency which had to be borne in mind. If the enemy had stood to fight north and west of the Irrawaddy, it was General Slim's plan to destroy him there. But he had always had in his mind an alternative plan which he could employ if the enemy decided as he did in fact to fight east of the river. The time had now come to put this alternative into action."

I had asked the C.1.G.S. at the end of November to consider sending me some African troops for Ceylon or Burma, now that Gondar had fallen and the campaign against Italian East Africa was over; he replied on 16th December that two Brigades could be made available, the first of which could be ready to embark at the end of January. Thus when I visited Rangoon on aist December I had, as I thought, ample forces in sight for the defence of Burma."
