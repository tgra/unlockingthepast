closed. Turned to port and engaged
unknown vessel, now identified as mer-

the only time that an R.D.F. range
‘could be used as later the targets
became too numerous and confused.
As soon as this destroyer was seen
to be well hit fire was shifted to the
rear merchant ship. Hits were
obtained at a range of 4,000 yards ©
with the second salvo and, after about
5 salvos, a fire was started. Fire was
then shifted to the next merchant ship,
‘ a fire started in her too, and the order
check fire given. One torpedo was
fired at the destroyer which had pre-
viously been engaged and this missed.
0230 approx. Opened fire.on the largest mer-
chant ship in the leading group of
three and obtained hits. .
Fired three-torpedoes at this same
group of merchant ships. Results net
observed from the bridge but tubes’
crews claim that one hit was clearly
seen, °

approx. A Navigatori class destroyér
passed through the line from port to
starboard at high speed, between
JERVIS and JANUS.. Two torpedoes
were fired which missed asten. The
4.7-in. guns could not train fast encugh
to catch up the target but the pom-
pom claimed to have hit this ship: ,

Having altered round to port to thé
northward, opened fire on a large mer-
chant vessel on fire to the eastward. ¢

Fired one torpedo at this ship, which
blew up at 0243. ;

Sighted a Navigatori class destroyer
ahead steaming north and making
smoke. Increased to 30 knots and

. hauled out to port clear of the smoke.
As soon as his bow could be seen,
fire was opened and 3 hits with thé
first salvo spotted through his smoke.

Engaged the LUCA TARIGO on various
courses at speed varying between 16
and 30 knots, mostly at fixed sight
range. During this time two torpedoes
were fired in ‘bridge control and. one,
in local control, all of which missed.
The Italian gunnery was poor,. their
tracer could be seen going high and
wide, ©

A great many’ hits were scored on
the LUCA TARIGO and by 0259 she
was stcpped, on fire, and had ceased

“I consideréd that she was in a
sinking condition and withdrew to the

. eastward to join Captain’ (D). Ordered

‘by Captain (D) 14 to finish off the
LUCA TARIGO. Fire was opened at
2,000 yards, many hits were scored,
and an explosion occurred amidships.
A very fierce fire broke out, and the
ship could ‘be seen listing over to
starboard.

0326 Obtained R. D.F. contact range 10,000
yards bearing 330 degs. Increased to
full speed and closed.

T realised that I was in extremely shallow
water and hauled off to the eastward.

1,500 yards apart, and‘ obviously
aground. ;
