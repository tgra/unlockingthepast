Eventually Australia agreed to pro- vide the necessary men and to train them up to aereasonable standard in Australia, this training to be completed by the ist January, 1942. On the 13th November, 1941, however, Middle East reported to the War Office that they could not provide forty tanks for the Far East except at the expense of operational requirements.

The enemy attack, supported by dive- bombers and destroyers, began about six o\u2019clock on the morning of 12th November, when German troops disembarked on the ex- treme North-east of the island and at Pandeli Bay, to the East of Leros town. In the North- east, about five hundred troops were landed and gained the high ground running from Dellapalma Bay to Grifo, including Mt. Vedetta. The enemy were held on this line throughout the day, but by two o\u2019clock on the morning of 13th November, they had over- run Mt. Clidi and extended their bridgehead from Mt. Clidi to Ste.

The battalion destined to seize the airfield at Djidjelli and stock it with petrol was, however, unable to land by sea owing to the swell and went on by road from Bougie, not reaching Djidjelli until 13th November, This delay unfortunately prevented our fighters operating from the airfield and, as a result, the enemy bombers sank several ships in Bougie harbour before air cover could be provided. Losses in personnel were not high but in equipment were considerable, and the infantry were, for some time to come, operating only with what they could and in the clothes they wore when they left their ships."

To a force which relied so much on artillery, the only effective superiority we possessed for a campaign in an Italian winter, this was a most serious matter, the more so as it was not an isolated phenomenon but a world-wide shortage both on the British and United States side. It had naturally been aggravated by our hea expenditure during the \u2018\u201c\u2018 Gothic\u201d line battles. The root cause, however, as I was informed by a signal from the War Office on 17th August, was a reduction in ammunition production all over the Allied-controlled world. This was a condition of affairs which could not hastily be improved and, although I was on 20th October authorized to draw on the Supreme Allied Commander\u2019s reserve up to the full extent which the operational situation might necessitate, there was a serious danger that not only would current operations be severely limited but there might not be suffic- jient stocks on hand for the spring offensive. I drew this conclusion in a letter to General Wilson on 13th November: ."

A week later the enemy advariced from the Dolluang area, and on the 13th November drove back our weak detachments on the road to the north of Fort White, thereby isolating the latter post. The enemy strength in this area was two to three battalions with some field artillery. Our forces consisted of one Indian battalion, much below strength, with one company of a Gurkha bat- talion under its command; also one section of a mountain battery (3.7\u201d howitzers)."
