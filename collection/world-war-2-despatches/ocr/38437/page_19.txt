SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 20 OCTOBER, 1948

‘In the event, owing to the modest dimensions

of the attack, only one further battery was
deployed.

142. I also earmarked six Mustang squadrons
for operations against the bombs in. daylight,
and arranged that their engines should be
specially boosted. Three of them, together
with a squadron of Meteors which I arranged
to borrow from the Second Tactical Air Force,
were to operate between the guns and Lon-
don; the other three forward of the guns, over
the sea. At night two Mosquito squadrons
would patrol over the sea and a squadron of
Tempests behind the guns. A direct link with
the radar stations of the Second Tactical Air
Force in Belgium was set up to assist in giving
warning of the approach of flying bombs from
the general direction of the Scheldt.

143. The attack began in the early hours of
the 3rd March. The first bomb to reach this
country got through the defences and fell at
Bermondsey at 030% hours. The next six
bombs were all destroyed by anti-aircraft fire:
five of them exploded in the air and the sixth
fell into the sea. After a lull of nine hours the
attack was resumed in the afternoon of the
same day and continued intermittently until
noon on the 4th, when there was another lull.
Ten bombs came over during this second burst
of fire: four of them were destroyed by the
guns and only two reached London.

144. The second lull came to an end Jate in
the morning of the 5th March. Thereafter,
until activity finally ceased on the 2gth March,
there was spasmodic activity punctuated by
intervals of quiet. The performance of the
guns during this phase was outstanding.

Indeed, it was so good that, in view of the
unexpected lightness of the attack, I was able
to dispense with the Meteors and five of the six
Mustang squadrons, which returned to their
former duties. During the whole of this last
phase of the flying bomb campaign 125 bombs
approached this country. Eighty-six were shot
down by anti-aircraft guns alone, one by the
Royal Navy and shore guns jointly, and four
by fighters, Only thirteen bombs reached
London.

145. Typhoon fighter-bombers of the Second
Tactical Air Force attacked the launching-site
at Vlaardingen on the 23rd March, Spitfire
fighter-bombers of my Command that at Ypen-
burg on the 2oth and again on the 23rd March.
At both sites essential components were
destroyed. Presumably the missiles launched
during the last few days of the attack came
from the third site, of whose existence we had
not previously been aware.

146. The attacks ended with a bout of inter-
mittent firing between half-past nine on the
evening of the 28th March and lunch-time on
the 2oth. - During this period 21 bombs
approached this country: 20 were shot down,
and the twenty-first came ignominously to
earth at Datchworth, a village of some seven
hundred inhabitants twenty-five miles from
London Bridge. This was the last bomb of
the whole campaign to fall on British soil.

Part III: Tue Rocket CAMPAIGN.

(a) Intelligence and Countermeasures, 1939
to November, 1943.

148. The German long-range rocket, known
to the enemy as the A-4 and to us as “‘ Big
Ben,’’ was a rival to the flying bomb. There
is no doubt, however, that if circumstances had
permitted, the Germans would have conducted
simultaneous campaigns with the two weapons
from northern France.

149. The first hint that the enemy intended
to use a long-range rocket for military pur-
poses was contained in a report received in
this country soon after the outbreak of war.
More was heard of the project towards the
end of 1942, when agents reported that trial
shots with such a missile had been fired shortly
beforehand on the Baltic coast. Early in 1943
a connection was established between this
activity and the German experimental station
at Peenemiinde.

150. From that time onwards a stream of
intelligence about the rocket reached this
country. Not until more than a year later,
however, did we receive conclusive evidence
about the characteristics and performance of
the weapon. During part of the intervening
period responsibility for investigating the new
threat was taken out of the hands of the intelli-
gence staffs and placed in those of a govern-
mental committee created for the purpose. A
number of distinguished scientists and ordnance
experts were invited to speculate about the
nature of the rocket, and some hypotheses were
advanced which ultimately proved wide of the
mark. The prevailing impression in responsible
quarters during the earlier months of the in-
vestigation was that the enemy was forging a
titanic weapon which weighed seventy or eighty
tons and carried a warhead containing some
ten tons of explosive, which would descend
upon London with little or no warning. The
problem of defending the capital against so dis-
obliging a projectile was naturally a source of
some anxiety to my predecessor.
