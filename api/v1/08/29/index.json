            "description": "354. By mid-August, new G.A.F. units began to appear on the Western Front, but although these units pushed up the average daily effort to nearly 300 sorties, the fighting value continued to deteriorate. An effort was, however, made by the G.A.F. throughout the fourth week in August, to assist the land forces trying to scramble back to the Seine by providing cover and relief from air attack at the Seine crossings, but on very few occasions were the attacks pressed home. The enemy losses mounted steadily all the time. On 25th August, United States Ninth Air Force fighters destroyed 79 aircraft in combat and a further 44 on the ground. On 29th August, there was evidence that the enemy units were in flight back to Germany.",

            "title": "\"German Forces Swiftly Reinforce Amidst High Casualties in River Foglia Offensive\"",
            "description": "As always the Germans were quick to recover from their surprise. By 29th August a regiment from 26 Panzer Division, brought across from west of Empoli, had arrived and gone into action on the River Foglia; it was soon followed by thie rest of the division. This was a standard manoeuvre; we had seen before, for instance in the Anzio crisis, the rapid transference of this division, now Kesselring’s only armoured division, from one flank of the Army Group to the other, but this time it was committed so hastily and so unprepared that it suffered unduly heavy losses. At the same time 98 Division was committed from Army reserve. It fought with great vigour in this its first action in Italy and its casualties too were heavy. A regiment from 162 Turkoman Division was a less useful reinforcement. Finally, with that readiness to accept risks which had marked Kesselring’s strategy throughout the campaign, and had gone far to retrieve the initial disasters to German arms which his invariable misreading of our intentions always incurred, the enemy Commander-in-Chief now removed -his. last reserve from the centre and left, 29 Panzer Grenadier Division, and despatched it in haste eastwards. The first elements of the division were in action by 4th September, but the bulk’ did not arrive until the 6th. On the latter day also a regiment of 5 Mountain Division, which had been taken out of the line on its way to the French frontier, was halted and brought back into the line.",
