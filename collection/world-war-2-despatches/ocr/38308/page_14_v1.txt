12. Friendly aircraft, shot down by jire  from the Fleet. One Seafire was  shot down  during a day attack and for this I could see little justification.

 A Hellcat was shot down at first light. For this, although there are complementary reasons, _Imust accept full responsibility because I misjudged the enemy's intention, and flew  off the Hellcats to attack two.aircraft which I estimated

13. Performance of Carriers. Thie carriers have, I think, stood up well to, what is for ts, so extended a period of operational duty in

the course of which 2,429 operational sorties,

have been flown. The maintenance crews, whom it has n ver been posgible to stand: down

on any day throughout the operation, have -  the -carriers, but for .

done their work well: shortage of pilots, bombs and stores, would be good to continue operating: that this should be so reflects credit on their Commanding Officers:

- 14. Extension of First Operating Period. In view of their necessities at Okinawa, and of the

fact that Task Force 58 was in the field before.

us, it is a matter of great regret to me to have been unable to offer to continue to operate after the 20th April: having regard to the conditions set out above and to the fact that no.replenishment fighter pilots have been available throughout the operation I have not felt, having regard to the future, that it was justifiable, to do so: there is the consideration also that the sooner we return to replenish and relieve, the sooner we core forward,

15. I should say in conclusion that the enemy flak positions on Myako are unsubdued  and continue to inflict casualties on  our aircraft: the high explosive bombs with which we are provided have proved unsuitable for their reduction: it is believed that the positions might be: neutralised -by an area bombardment. Any such effort, would be warmly appreciated  by: all our  aircrews.

Be pleased to lay before Their Lordships a. r port on the second and last phase of Operation.  * Tceberg  

2. This covers the j period from the 23rd April to 25th May, 1945, and is in continuation of my letter of 7th. June, 1945.

3.1 entirely endorse the senate of the Vice~ Admiral in paragraph 10 of his covering letter.

- The manner in which the ships of the First

Aircraft Carrier Squadron remained in action, despite the damage sustained from  * suicide   attacks, reflects the greatest credit on ViceAdmiral Sir Philip  Vian and on the Commanding Officers. and" ships  companies of the aircraft carriers. ~~ _ (Signed) Bruce FRASER, ; , Admiral. Office  of the Vice-Admiral, Second-in-Command, ' British Pacific Fleet. . - 6th June, 1945. Sir, * .

 I have the honour. to forward for -your information and in continuation .of, my letter of 9th May, 1945, the attached narrative and report of proceedings of Task Force 57 during  the second _ phase of Operation,     Iceberg   ;.in so far as the British Pacific Fleet is concerned it terminates their contribution thereto. ~ , 2  The. object: throughout. was. to prevent the enemy making * use, of the airfields. in, the Sakishima Gunto group.

_3- Over the whole period IF 57 was.at sea. for 62 days, broken by 8 days re-storing at   tlige maintaining an intermittent neutralisa-

tion of these airfields by day. During its absence an American Task Group took over this duty and, in the later stages, aircraft based

* on Okinawa also took part. Whilst the latter s

 contribution is not known in detail their work at night .was particularly  welconie.

During this time the. Task Force flew 4,852  sorties, dropped 875 tons of bombs and rocket projectiles, destroyed 160 enemy aircraft and damaged 70 others; various other targets such as shipping, W/T stations, etc., were also attacked. Our own losses were 33 aircraft from enemy action; in addition 92 were operationally.

4: Throughout the first- phase of the   Iceberg ? operation and in the early part .of the second phase, the position from which the Force , operated:  was not greatly changed, except on. the occasion of attacking Formosa.  Since  it seemed possible that thie  enemy ; might be fixing the force in daylight by shore radar on the CAP,

  it was  decided after the attack on gth May,

1945, that if would be wis r to move the striking position  further to-the eastward, accepting the  greater flying.distance to Ishigaki. In the event,

  the Fleet was not seriously, sttaelced after this

 was done,
