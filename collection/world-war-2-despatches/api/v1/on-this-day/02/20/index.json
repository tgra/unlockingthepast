            "description": "39. By the 20th February, the shortage of food and ammunition, severe casualties and lack of any tactical success began to have their effect upon the Japanese forces, and they began to try to escape, at first in driblets and then in larger parties. Many of them failed to run the gauntlet and were wiped out. By the 24th February the Ngakyedauk Pass had been re-opened and the Japanese offensive, heralded as the beginning of the march on Delhi, had been defeated."

On their first sortie over the lines on 20th February, they shot down four enemy aircraft, and on 28th February, in company with a formation of Gladiators, destroyed 27 enemy aircraft without a single loss to themselves. This fight, which was the biggest ever fought in the air in Albania, was staged over the Greek lines in full view of both armies. All the enemy aircraft destroyed were confirmed from the ground and caused the greatest jubila-"

This total did not include the 8,500 officers and 180,000 men of Eighth Army, which had reached the borders of Tunisia by February, and which passed under command of 18 Army Group on 20th February. Maintenance of Eighth Army during the remainder of the Tunisian Campaign, until 12th May, 1943,  when the campaign ended with the capture of Tunis and Bizerta, remained my responsibility and proved a heavy one. All other claims were subordinated to this task. Expenditure in materials, vehicles, and, at times, in personnel was high, but the Army was always well-found and this, together with the absence of food deficiency diseases in a campaign fought over a thousand miles from the Middle East base, speaks better than anything else for the adequacy of the maintenance system."

Time fuzes were in short supply, but otherwise artillery equipment and ammunition were able to keep pace with the demands."

On the east flank of the Irrawaddy battlefront, over a 100 miles up river, another great battle was raging. 19 Indian Division, which had broken out of its bridgehead on the 20th February, had begun its drive down the east bank of the river, advancing with great speed and determination. The two Japanese divisions (the 15th and 53rd) opposing 19 Indian Division completely failed to stop it. Strong positions were either assaulted, with tank and air support, or were by-passed. In a  Jeap-frogging   advance, 98 Brigade were the first troops to reach the Chaungmagyi, establishing a bridgehead on the 5th March ; while, further north, 64 Brigade was still mopping up in the Pinlein area and 62 Brigade was fighting at Yenatha, which they captured on the 6th. The result of this method of advance was that we reached and passed through Madaya before the enemy had time to retire to the strongly prepared positions covering the two water barriers north of the town.

On the west bank 114 Brigade entered Pakokku on the 18th after overcoming strong opposition to the west of it. It then started to clear the large island which lies off Pakokku. By this time (20th February), the Japanese were attacking the bridgehead from the south, but prisoners stated that our crossing was regarded merely as a diversion. 28 (East African) Brigade were also heavily counterattacked in Seikpyu area on the 16th. They regrouped at Gwebin, but were again severely attacked on the 20th and withdrew to Letse. Here the threat to our right flank was held. It was evident that the enemy still continued to regard the feints which had been made on both sides of Nyaungu as a greater menace than the real crossing, despite our build-up in the bridgehead."

On 98 Brigade's front, there were indications that the enemy was pulling out from the Thabeikkyin area, after ten days of continuous attacks. 98 Brigade was, therefore, ordered to clear the area between Thaibeikkyin and the southern bridgehead and rejoin the remainder of the Division. This operation was successfully completed by the 20th February, on which date 19 Indian Division commenced its drive south on a two brigade front against continued resistance. 2 British Division encountered only light opposition to their build-up, as the enemy in this sector had concentrated his strength in an all-out effort to destroy 20 Indian Division. In 20 Indian Division's bridgehead, a prolonged and bitter struggle was raging, but the Japanese, following their usual custom, flung their reinforcements in piecemeal and their casualties continued to mount. By the 16th February, we had passed to the offensive, capturing Alethaung Village after savage hand-tohand fighting. Fierce counter-attacks followed against the extreme west of our position ; but, by the 26th we had taken Tabingon and extended our bridgehead to a width of eight miles and a depth of two and a half."
