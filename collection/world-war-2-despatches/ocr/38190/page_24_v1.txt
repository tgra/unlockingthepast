At 0915 hours the enemy had reinforced the northern portion of Mount Cameron where he was about 300 strong. The small party of Royal Marines (q v. para II7) was now patrolling the spurs South of Mount Parish in touch with the 5/7 Rajput Regt. who had collected hospital discharges, etc , and formed a third platoon which had been positioned on the Mount Parish spur.

"Attacked from three sides, the garrison was being rapidly surrounded when at 1645 hours it was authorised to escape, if it could, through the streets leading North West to Canal Road. The two officers and 40 other ranks did so, losing 25 per cent. casualties. A most determined and valuable resistance had been put up on this position (and qv. para. 118). These troops withdrew into and assisted the defensive area between Lee Theatre and the Canal Road, already occupied by the reinforcements mentioned in para. 118,

The enemy now had three guns in action on the water front near the Pemmnsular Hotel,



Kowloon, and another battery at Tai Hang. At about 1g00 hours a large fire broke out on the water front near the China Fleet Club, bindering certain forward movements.

134 At about 2200 hours reports from Aberdeen and Shouson Hill indicated a general move of the enemy from Mount Nicholson/ Mount Cameron area northwards towards the Race Course A possible intention, I considered, might be to turn West and join in the drive along the North face of the island, possibly with the left flank along the line of the   gaps   and  the right flank just clear of Wanchai This would strike a weak place where I had only the Royal Marines patrollmg, In hand were less than a dozen men at H.Q of 2/14 Punjab Regt. unless I drew on the two companies in positions covering Government House, Command H.Q., R.N Yard, Military Hospital, i.e., our last stand.

140. Wanchas  Before dawn 25th December a successful retaliation to the enemies  light infantry gun* was carried out. A Bofors A.A. gun was taken to a position just South of Morrison Hill and vigorous short range fire silenced the enemy activity in the sports pavilons immediately South of Canal Road. Many calls had been made on the Bofors detachments during the last few days. Besides their continuous day role they had also performed night roles, eg., beach defence, replacing equipments disabled or knocked out, such as at Belchers Fort, in which area the infantry beach defences had been weakened by 95 per cent in order to find troops for counter-attack

By 0700 hours anti-tank mines had been laid in the main approaches to Wanchai from
