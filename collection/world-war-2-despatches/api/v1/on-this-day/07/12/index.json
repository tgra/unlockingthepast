            "description": "39. Progress on the east coast was less spectacular and more costly. Augusta was entered by the army on the evening of 12th July (D+2), after a rather exasperating day in which our destroyers alternately entered the harbour triumphantly and were evicted by enemy shell fire to which they could not reply owing to inability to distinguish our own troops; but the situation did not really become cleared up and the port rendered safe for democracy until the morning of the 13th when the Port Party was finally installed and a valuable protected anchorage made available for our use."

Nevertheless, at 0500/ 12th July, she was attacked and sustained some structural damage and casualties from near misses. Though the attacks on the anchorage were of some weight no other damage was caused,"

            "description": "21. Syracuse was occupied at 2100/10th July, the port peey entered during the forenoon of 11th July and the D+3 personnel convoy arrived there according to plan on 13th July : unloading all twelve ships and sailing them again at 1800 the same day was a notable achievement. Attempts were made to enter Augusta which was reported as having been evacuated at 0500 on 12th July but on her way to do so ESKIMO with Naval Commander Force  A  onboard was damaged in an air attack. Later in the day other ships of Force  A  again entered Augusta, and I myself went in in the evening in BROCKLESBY with Naval Commander Force  A . At this time the enemy on the outskirts of the town commenced to shell our ships intermittently with field guns and we had to clear out. I strongly support the recommendation of Naval Commander Force   A  that the foremost elements of the army should have some means of notifying their positions to supporting warships, as on this occasion we saw a large amount of M.T. which we thought belonged to the Eighth Army but which in fact belonged to the enemy. In consequence we missed an excellent and easy target."

            "description": "Accordingly on the 12th July I decided to send to Cyprus the 50th Division (Major-General W. H. Ramsden), just arriving from England, and also the 3rd Hussars (less one Squadron) to replace the 7th Australian Divisional Cavalry Regiment as a mobile armoured reserve. The move of these troops and go days reserves of supplies and munitions was completed by the 2gth August thanks to the efficient arrangements made by the Royal Navy."
