to the improved results achieved by the fighters
after the first week in July. By the 15th July
I was using a tofal of thirteen single-engined
and nine twin-engined (Mosquito) squadrons
against flying bombs. Six of the Mosquito
squadrons alternated between this work and
operations over the lodgment area, two of them
doing bomber-suppért work as well. I found
that, while some pilots took readily to the work
of shooting down flying bombs, the majority
preferred shooting down enemy aircraft - over
France. To instil enthusiasm for the novel and
impersonal business of shooting at pilotless
missiles, and ensure that pilots were not kept
long enough at the task to make them stale,
was not the least of my anxieties.

69. In order to get as much speed as possible,
I arranged that aircraft which were to be used
exclusively against flying bombs should be
stripped of their armour and all unnecessary ex-
ternal fittings, and that their paint should be
removed and their outer surfaces polished. The
engines were modified to use 150-octane fuel
and accept a higher boost than usual. In this
way we managed to increase the speed of some
of the single-engined fighters by as much as
30 m.p.h. #

7o. Even with these modifications the
fighters had only a small margin of speed over
the flying bombs. Nevertheless they did have
a margin. It was reported that a demonstra-
tion by a German pilot with a captured Spit-
fire had convinced Hitler that our fighters
could not catch the flying bomb. This was
true of the Spitfire V, and almost true of the
Spitfire IX; but it was not true of the Spitfire
XIV or the Tempest. Even so, these aircraft
ihad no, more than a fractional superiority.
Hence the problem was essentially one of time
and space. For interteption over the sea we
used a method of close control from radar
stations on the coast, or alternatively a method
of running commentary. At best the radar
chain could give about six minutes’ warning
before the flying bombs reached the coast; but
in practice the time available to the fighters
over the sea was always less than-this, not
only because of inevitable time-lags but be-
cause we dared not risk our modified aircraft
on the far side of the Channel, where they
might be surprised by German fighters. Later
the Royal Navy were to come to our assistance
by providing a chain of small craft which
operated at three mile intervals seven miles”
off the French coast, carrying observers who
warned our pilots by means of signal rockets
and star-shells that flying bombs were on their
way. This improvised system was in the final
stages of development about the time when the
main attack came to a close.

7. Over the land we used the method of
Tunning commentary from radar stations and
Royal Observer, Corps Centres, supplemented
by various devices such as signal rockets, shell-
bursts, and searchlight beams, for indicating
the approach of flying bombs to patrolling
pilots. The weakness of this method was that
sometimes several pilots would go after the
same flying bomb, leaving other bombs to slip
through unmolested. However, there was
nothing else we could do, for the absence of
low-looking radar made close control over the
land impracticable.

72. The majority of the flying bombs crossed
the coast between Cuckmere Haven and St.
Margaret’s Bay. The distance thence to the
southern edge of the gun belt was in most
places about 30 miles. The flying bombs
covered this distance in five minutes. Five
minutes, then, was the time available to the
pilot of an overland fighter to select his target,
get within range of it, and shoot it down, un-
less. gunfire had been restricted or he took
advantage of the rule which allowed him to
enter the belt in pursuit of his quarry. In this
case he would have an extra minute or so
before he reached the balloon barrage. Thus
there was rarely time for a stern chase unless
the pursuer started with a substantial advant-
age in height. On the whole the most effective
procedure was to fly on roughly the same
course as an approaching bomb, allow it to
draw level, and fire deflection shots as it
passed, being careful not to fire when it was
closer than 200 yards lest it should explode
in the air and blow up the attacker.* The hot
gases emitted by a bomb immediately in front
of the fighter made a steady aim difficult, so
that short bursts and frequent aiming correc-
tions were required. Usually several bursts
were needed to inflict enough damage to ex-
plode the ‘bomb or bring it down. Another
method useful on occasions but hardly suitable
for general adoption, was to get close beside
the target and tip it over by inserting the wing
of the fighter underneath that of the bomb and
then raising it sharply.

73. Thus, in many respects the fighters had
a stiff task. That which faced the guns was,
if anything, more awkward still. Theoretic-
ally, pilotless aircraft ought to have made ideal
targets for anti-aircraft artillery, since they
flew on courses which could be accurately pre-
dicted from the data on which the technical
devices normally employed had been designed

‘to work. For the first time in the war, the

gunners were presented with targets that could
not dodge. In practice this advantage was
outweighed by the speed of the missiles and
the critical height at which they flew. They
were too high and went too fast to make good
targets for light A.A. guns, but were too low
and crossed the field of vision of the heavy
A.A. gunners too swiftly to give adequate time
for the radar and predictors to be used and the
guns be laid by hand. These difficulties could
be minimised so far as the heavy guns were
concerned by replacing the mobile guns used in
the original ‘‘ Diver ’’ deployment by static
guns which could be electrically elevated and
traversed and were fitted with improved fuse
setters and other devices which made them
quicker to operate and more accurate. Unfor-
tunately the static guns required concrete em-
placements which took some time to instal.
A steel mattress, known as the “ Pile Mat-
tress,"’ which was devised by the R.E.M.E.
detachment at Anti-Aircraft Command pro-
vided a way out of the difficulty; and the task
of replacing the mobile guns by static guns
was started towards the end of June.

* During the first six weeks of the attacks alone,
eighteen fighters were substantially damaged and five
pilots and one Navigator/Radio Operator killed in
this way. Even though the flying bomb could not
hit back deliberately, ‘‘ Diver’’ patrols were by no
means unattended by risk.
