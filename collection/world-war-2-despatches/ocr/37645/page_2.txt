Italy, to be carried out early in 1941 if the
necessary reinforcements could be made avail-
able from Egypt; this depended mainly on the
success of the Desert offensive.

(6) To maintain pressure in the Gallabat area
where a minor attack had been made early in
November, ‘but to undertake no large scale
operations on that line.

(c) To further the rebellion in Abyssinia by
all possible means.

In Kenya:

(az) In the south to advance to the frontier
on the line Kolbio-Dif as soon as possible.

(6) On the northern frontier west of Moyale
to maintain pressure on the enemy by means
of small mobile columns.

(c) In May or June, after the rainy period,
to advance on Kismayu; I had hoped for an
advance on Kismayu before the rainy season
but General Cunningham at this meeting in-
formed me that after careful examination he
did not consider it possible owing to water
difficulties and lack of sufficient transport.

(d) In the spring and summer of Ig4I to
penetrate into south-west Abyssinia in conjunc-
pea with operations from the Boma area of the

udan.

6. The ruling idea in my mind in the decisions
taken at this conference was that the fomenta-
tion of the patriot movement in Abyssinia
offered with the resources available the best
prospect of making the Italian position impos-
sible and eventually reconquering the country.
I did aot intend at the time a large scale in-
vasion either from Kassala towards Asmara
and Massawa, or from Kismayu to the north.
The two operations to Kassala and Kismayu
were designed to secure our flanks and I
intended that our main effort should be devoted
to furthering and supporting the rebellion by
irregular action. I intended after the capture
of Kassala and Kismayu to withdraw as many
troops as possible from the Sudan and East
Africa for the theatres further north. I had
carefully examined the possibilities of an in-
vasion of Italian East Africa in force during
the period before Italy entered the war. I had
come to the conclusion that the only two lines
of invasion which offered a good prospect of
success for a regular force were from Jibuti on
Addis Ababa or from Kassala on Massawa; and
of these the advance from Jibuti offered the
better prospect of success, since it seemed that
the natural difficulties of the Kassala-Asmara
route would require too great a force for the
single road by which it would have to be sup-
plied. The French collapse and the Italian
occupation of British Somaliland in August
1940 ruled out the possibility of the Jibuti
advance.

7. During a visit to the Sudan in November
with the Secretary of State for War, Mr.
Anthony Eden, I had discussed at length the
requirements for the development of the rebel-
lion in Abyssinia and had made arrangements
to do everything possible to assist the patriots.
I appointed Lieut.-Colonel O. C. Wingate as
staff officer for patriot activities and his energy
and initiative was an important factor in the
means by which the patriot movement gained
so great an impetus in the succeeding months.
Towards the end of November he had flown
into Abyssinia and met Brigadier Sandford who

was already there with a small mission to pre-
pare the way.

8. There were thus three separate lines of
operation against Italian East Africa: in the
north from the Sudan by Kassala into Eritrea,
in the centre from the Sudan and later from
East Africa into Abyssinia, and in the south
from Kenya against Italian Somaliland.

g. The success of the. offensive in the
Western Desert of Egypt decided me to trans-
fer the 4th Indian Division to the Sudan to
enable the Kassala operation to be carried out.
The decision for this transfer had to be made
at very short notice, while the battle in the
Western Desert was still in progress, since
otherwise shipping would not have been avail-
able for some time and it would not have
been possible to stage the attack on Kassala
early in 1941 as I intended. Part of the 4th
Indian Division was actually moved prac~
tically straight from the battlefield of Sidi
Barrani to ships which conveyed them to the
the Sudan, and they were in action again in
the Sudan very shortly after their arrival.

The 4th Indian Division moved partly by
sea to Port Sudan and partly by railway and
boat up the Nile Valley. The whole division
was due to complete its arrival in the Sudan
about the middle of January. General Platt
originally fixed the date for the advance early
in March but I issued orders to him that he
was to attack early in February at the latest.
Eventually the date, oth February was fixed
for the operation. I had sent one squadron
of infantry tanks to the Sudan for the opera-
tion; these were the only tanks I could spare
in view of the operations in the Western Desert.
against Marshal Graziani’s army.

10. Meanwhile the preparations for the
tebellion in Abyssinia were pushed on with
great energy. The chief objective was to place
a sufficient quantity of food and stores into
Abyssinia beyond the escarpment before the
rain rendered further movement of transport
impossible. A small force of one battalion of
Sudanese and a number of specially selected
British officers and N.C.Os. were also sent
forward. The Emperor, Haille Selassie, him-
self crossed the frontier and entered his
kingdom on 2oth January. The subsequent
operations of the small force which cleared the
Gojjam of large Italian forces was a very
remarkable achievement, due largely to the
energy and initiative of Brigadier Sandford,
head of ror Mission, Colonel O. C. Wingate,
who commanded the regular forces taking part,
the British officers and N.C.Os. who assisted
him, and the fine fighting qualities of the
Sudanese battalion. :

1x. During the winter a small mobile force,
known as Gazelle Force, under Brigadier
Messervy, continually harassed the Italian
communications with Kassala and caused them
great inconvenience and considerable losses.
Early in January there were indications of the
enemy’s intention to withdraw from Kassala;
and while on a visit to Khartoum I instructed
General Platt to be ready to advance his opera-
tion to prevent the enemy withdrawal. Before
he could get his troops into action, however,
the enemy had evacuated Kassala and com-
menced his retreat.

1z. This enemy withdrawal and the rapid
and effective pursuit which General Platt at
once initiated caused me to review my original
