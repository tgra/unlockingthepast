SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 16 SEPTEMBER, 10948

there was a stationary vertical beam. Round
this beam the fighter circled until an enemy
bomber entered the “‘ box.’’ Other search-
lights were disposed at intervals of 3} miles
near the centre of the box and wider intervals
near its borders. As soon as the bomber
entered the box the beams of, the outlying
searchlights (belonging to the “ Indicator
Zone ’’) began to converge on it, thus indicat-
ing its approach to the fighter pilot, who there-
upon set a course which would put him in a
peste to intercept it in the central “‘ Killer

me.”” :

efficiency by: the end of 1941, but ultimately
proved very effective and remained substan-
tially unchanged until the end of the war.

(j) Operation “ Intruder ’’.

68. The circumstances in which No 23
Squadron began to fly “‘ Intruder ’’ patrols on
aist December, 1940, have been described
above.

69. It was not until the early spring that
the squadron had many opportunities of suc-
cessful action. With better weather and in-
creased enemy activity it was then very success-
ful, claiming the destruction of three enemy
aircraft in March, r94z, two in April, and
eleven in May, Thereafter, opportunities were
again limited. Nevertheless, it was decided
that a second ‘‘ Intruder ’’ Squadron should
be added to the Command, and No. 418
(R.C A.F.) Squadron, equipped with Bostons,
began to form in the autumn.
> 70. No. 23 Squadron, originally equipped
with Blenheims, re-armed with Havocs in
March and April, I941, and received a few
Bostons later in the year.

71. Between 21st December, 1940, and
31st December, 1941, operation ‘‘ Intruder ”’
was carried out on 145 nights and 573 sorties
were flown, of which 505 were by Blenheims,
Havocs and. Bostons of No. ‘23 Squadron, and
68 by Hurricanes and, Defiants of Nos. I, 3,
87, I4I, 151, 242, 264, 306 and 601 Squadrons,
which were employed on.this work occasionally
on moonlit nights. The destruction of 21
enemy aircraft was claimed, 290 separate
bombing attacks on airfields were reported, and
ten of our aircraft were lost.

. 72. Thronghout this period the executive
control of this operation was something of a
problem. To secure the best results, it was
essential that the ‘‘ Intruder ’’ aircraft should
arrive at active enemy bases just as returning
bombers reached them. This could only be
achieved by a close study of information from
intelligence and raid-reporting sources on the
part of those responsible for ordering the
despatch of the “‘ Intruder” aircraft. In
accordance with the normal practice in my
Command, control of the operation was dele-
gated at the outset to No. rz Group, from
whose stations No. 23 Squadron was operating.
The executive orders were issued by which-
ever of the Controllers at No. 11 Group’s Head-
quarters happened to be on duty at the time,
in consultation with the Officer Commanding
No. 23 Squadron. It was a matter for con-
sideration whether these Duty Controllers, with
their numerous responsibilities, could be ex-
pected to give that constant specialized atten-
tion to the changing data provided by the

re i r

Intelligence and Raid-Reporting services which
was essential for success. The suggestion that
control of the’ operation should be exercised
directly from my Headquarters was made more
than once and from more than one quarter in
1941. I did not think it desirable to make any
change at this stage, but later, when the neces-
sity of co-ordinating the work of .the
‘* Intruder ’’ Squadrons closely with the opera-
tions of Bomber Command made a more cen-
tralised control almost essential, this solution
was adopted.

Day Operations
(a) Defensive
“(i) Forces Available. °

73. At the end of the Battle of Britain, that
is to say at the beginning of November, r940,
the strength of the day fighter force amounted
to 55% squadrons, including three and a half
squadrons in the process of formation. On
paper this was a substantially larger force than
the Command had possessed at the beginning
of the battle; but really the force available was
weaker. Many of our best pilots had been
killed, and quantitatively the casualties had
proved greater than the training organisation
could make good, so that despite such expe-
dients as the transfer of pilots from other Com-
mands, the squadrons were short of their
proper establishment of pilots.

74. The long-term measures taken within the
Command to amehorate this situation are
described in Part II. In the meantime the
position was such as to give some ground for
anxiety Of the 52 operational day squadrons
in the Command at the beginning of November,
only 26 were, in the most strict sense, first-line
squadrons. Another two squadrons were
being kept up to. operational strength so that
they could act as reliefs in an emergency. The
remainder, apart from a half-squadron -em-
ployed as ‘‘ spotters,’ had only a few opera-
tional pilots apiece and were suitable only for
employment in quiet sectors.

75. The practice of stripping some squadrons .

of most of their experienced pilots in order to
keep others up to strength is clearly indefen-
sible except in a grave emergency, if only be-
cause of the invidious distinctions thus created.
It had been adopted by my predecessor in
the late Summer only because, in the circum-
stances of that time, it seemed the sole alterna-
tive to ‘‘ telescoping ’’ or disbanding squad-
rons. As soon as conditions permitted, I aban-
doned this system,- with its categorisation of
squadrons as class “A,” “'B” or “C,”
and all squadrons in turn were given their
chance in the more active Sectors. :

76. Although the Battle of Britain is now
regarded as having ended on 31st October,
1940, no sharp break was noticeable at the
time, Not until some weeks later was it
evident that, for the time being, the Germans
had abandoned the idea of defeating the Com-
mand by a series of mass attacks in daylight.
Even then a resumption of these mass attacks
in the following Spring or Summer was re-
garded as inevitable; and in December I asked
for a force of 80 day fighter squadrons to meet
this situation.

77. The Air Mimstry were unable to accept
the dislocation of their plan for the expansion
of other Commands which the attainment of
