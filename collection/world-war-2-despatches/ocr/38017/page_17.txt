SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON

executing a series of round trips without inter-
mission tor several days under navigation con-
ditions of extreme difficulty and in the face
of unparalleled air attack. :

The Vice Admiral accordingly represented to
ihe Admiralty that the continuance of the de-
mands made by evacuation would subject a
number of officers and men to a test which
might be beyond the limit of human endurance,
and requesting that fresh forces should be
used if evacuation had to be continued after
the coming night, with the acceptance of any
consequent delay.

87. The evacuation plan was communicated

to Units taking part at 1440 and was briefly as
follows: —
Commence 2230/3, withdraw 0230/4. From
East Pier evacuation by Personnel Vessels,
Destroyers and Paddle Minesweepers. From
West Pier, new outer port, by other Mine-
sweepers, Corvettes, Skoots and French vessels.
Drifters and smaller craft into the inner har-
bour, LOCUST remaining outside entrance re-
ceiving loads ferried out by small boats. Tugs
available outside entrance to assist ships in
berthing and in leaving.

88. In the evening the Vice Admiral was
informed by the B.N.L.O. Marceau that it was
estimated 30,000 French remained and that
the French Admiralty agree that evacuation
should be terminated that night if possible.
Force used was to consist of nine Personnel
Vessels with one in reserve, nine Destroyers
(maximum number available), four Paddle
Minesweepers, seven Fleet Minesweepers, nine
Drifters, LOCUST, two Corvettes, four French
Destroyers and a number of organised motor
boat flotillas including lifeboats from Ramsgate
and Dover, together with a large number of
French and Belgian fishing vessels. The lifting
capacity of this force, if used to the full, was
more than 30,000 but it was certain that the
facilities within Dunkirk could not permit more
than about 25,000 to be embarked in the time
available, and this number only if the French
troops moved with the greatest rapidity at all
points of embarkation. This point was im-
pressed upon the French Liaison Officers and a
number of French officers and ratings added
to the augmented pier parties which were de-
spatched to Dunkirk at 2200 in advance of the
evacuation force,

89. The movements commenced according to
plan. The weather conditions at Dunkirk,
although favourable as regards tide were ad-
verse with a north easterly wind tending to
blow Personnel Vessels and Destroyers off the
vital East Pier making berthing difficult. The
MANXMAN, the seventh Personnel Ship due
to sail failed to sail, and her place was taken
by the ROYAL SOVEREIGN.

Tuesday, 4th June.

go. At midnight when the earlier vessels had
commenced the return voyage fog was reported

in mid-channel and off the Thanet coast and,

a number of ships had to anchor before enter-
ing harbour. The EXPRESS and SHIKARI
were the last ships to leave Dunkirk at 0318
and 0340 and carried approximately 1,000
troops and the British pier parties. Except
for an air attack on SHIKARI this final pass-
age was made without interruption by the

enemy and though the fog made navigation
extremely difficult it undoubtedly served to
shield the Armada from enemy aircraft.

gt. When the count was taken later in the
day it was ascertained that 27,000 troops had
been evacuated as a result of the night’s opera-
tion and Admiral Nord agreed that the opera-
tion should be considered as completed, observ-
ing that all ammunition at Dunkirk had been
expended and that the numbers left behind
were small consisting principally of non-
combatant troops. This decision was agreed
to by the French Admiralty at 1100, and the
operation ‘‘ Dynamo ’’ terminated by Ad-
miralty Message 1423/4.

gz. It was realised that in all probability
there might be a number of open boats, barges,
etc., drifting about in the Channel with troops
on board, It was accordingly decided to
have an air reconnaissance over the Channel.

It was reported that a Transport was lying
on its side between Dunkirk and Gravelines
and also a barge east of the Goodwins with
survivors on board,

C. in C. Nore despatched 2 M.T.B.s to find
the transport with no avail. On the 5th the
R.A.F. speedboat did a sweep south of a line
Goodwin/Boulogne and recovered 33 French
troops and two Naval ratings. In addition
French troops were picked up by patrols and
brought in to Dover, Margate and Ramsgate.
Troops also arrived in French and Belgian
Trawlers totalling in all some additional 1,100.

Air reconnaissance was also carried out on
the morning of the 5th but nothing was re-
ported.

REMARKS ON THE INSHORE FLO-
TILLAS AND NAVAL’ SHORE .
PARTIES.

93. About 4oo small craft, ranging from
Dutch Skoots to 30 ft. Motor boats, set out at
various times to the Flanders Coast. In addi-
tion scores of pulling boats, merchant ship
lifeboats, Naval cutters and whalers, were sent
off in tow. Only a proportion—particularly of
the pulling boats—succeeded in reaching the
coast and taking active part in the evacuation.
Fewer still were able to remain off the coast
for more than one period. Nevertheless, these
small craft, in conjunction with the pulling
and power boats of H.M. Ships off the coast,
were responsible for lifting more than 100,000
Allied troops direct off a stretch of open beach
in shoal waters between 1600/27/5 and
o4o0/2/6. Further, a large number of the
power boats operated within Dunkirk Harbour
on the last three nights, working principally in
the inner harbour, which was continually
under artillery fire, ferrying a further large
uncounted number out to the comparative
safety of ships lying off.

94. Throughout the period all these craft
of the inshore flotillas were subjected at one
time or another to intense attack from the air,
both by bombing and machine gun, and a
Jarge proportion also to sporadic bombard-
ment by German artillery. Under this fire
no case occurred of boats ceasing work as long
as troops were in sight on shore, and move-
ments of boats westward away from the fire
zone only occurred as dictated by the military
situation ashore.
