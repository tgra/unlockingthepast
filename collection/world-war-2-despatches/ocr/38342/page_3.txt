SUPPLEMENT to tue LONDON GAZETTE, 5 JULY, 1948

20. Despite this serious accident it is con-
sidered that these bombs were of great value,
for they enabled the troops to be put ashore
with few casualties from the automatic weapons
which were bringing fire to bear on the landing
place, and which might have inflicted even
heavier losses had they been given a clear and
unimpeded view of their targets.

az. It must here be noted that the aircraft
which dropped the bombs.at South Vaagso
appeared to be on fire and not properly under
control. It was almost certainly the Hampden
bomber which later fell into the sea near the
entrance to Vaagsfiord. If this was so, then
the degree of accuracy achieved in placing of
the bombs must have been the result of a. very
gallant attempt on the part of the crew of the
aircraft to carry out in full their allotted tasks.
PRINCE LEOPOLD proceeded to the rescue,
but unfortunately only one of the three members
of the crew picked up, survived.

22. One Hampden bomber which overshot
the target attacked and silenced positions in the
area with machine gun fire

23. It is regretted that one other Hampden
failed to return from this operation.

24. Of the three Hampden bombers detailed
to attack the Rugsundo battery, one had to
return with engine trouble, but the other two
carried out an attack, the results of which could
not be observed from KENYA but which were
apparently very successful,

Military Operations.

a5. For the purpose of the operation, the
Military Forces set out in paragraph 5(b) were
organised into the Operational Headquarters
which remained throughout in the Flagship
KENYA, with the Brigade Commander in close
touch with the Naval Commander on the bridge,
and the troops who were put ashore in Assault
Landing Craft from KENYA, PRINCE CHAR-
LES and PRINCE LEOPOLD and in the ship’s
boats from ORIBI.

The Forces ashore were divided into five
Groups for purposes which will become clear
in the course of this report.

General Tasks of each Group (see sketch map
attached).

26. The purpose of Group z was to land near
Hollevik and clear the Halnoesvik area where
a German gun had been reported. Having
accomplished , this task Group I was to move
along the coastal road to South Vaagso and form
a reserve for Group 2 unless given other orders.

Group 2, which was to be put ashore im-
mediately south west of South Vaagso, was to
attack the town itself and carry out a number
of Military and industrial tasks.

Group 3 was to assault the Island of Maaloy.

Group 4 was retained as a floating reserve in
the hands of the Military Commander of the
Force.

Group 5 was to be landed from a destroyer
on the western shore of Ulvesund in order to
cut communications between South and North
Vaagso and to send a & ghtng patrol into the
latter village.

The Landings.

27. At 0839 PRINCE CHARLES and
PRINCE LEOPOLD lowered all landing craft

which moved off in formation about three

munutes later. In little more than five minutes
No. 1 Group was ashore at Halnoesvik and the *
landing craft of Nos. 2 and 3 Groups were
moving towards the headland just south of
Halnoesvik Village.

28, Just before the landing craft came into
view of the enemy defences in South Vaagso
and Maaloy Island, KENYA opened fire. The
Naval bombardment was extremely accurate
and most effective, and Lieutenant-Colonel J. ’
F. Durnford-Slater, who was in command of
Group 2 and the Senior Officer proceeding
ashore, was able to let the landing craft of
Groups 2 and 3 approach to within 100 yards
of their landing places before sending up the

“cease bombardrhent’’ signal. KENYA
signalled the Hampden aircraft who then came
in at very low altitudes to drop their smoke
‘bombs. As a result of these bombs Group 3
completed their landing unopposed and the
volume of fire brought to bear on Group 2 was
considerably reduced.

The Operations Ashore.

2g. Groups Nos. 2 and 3 landed almost
simultaneously, and from that time onwards
the sequence of events was as follows: —

30. Group I cleared the area and village of
Halnoesvik very rapidly and signalled the
Headquarters Ship for instructions. They were
at once ordered to move along the ‘coastal road
and to come into reserve at Lieutenant-Colonel ,
J. F. Durnford-Slater’s Headquarters which
were situated near Group 2’s landing place.
This signal was made at 0950.

31. Group 3 very quickly gained control of
Maaloy Island, where those enemy troops who
had not been killed by the Naval bombardment
were for the most part demoralised and dazed
by its effect, and quickly surrendered. ‘At og20
Major J. M. T. F. Churchill was able to signal
that all guns on the island were in our hands
and four minutes later he reported that the
whole area was under control. ORIBI, carry-,
ing Group 5 and followed by ONSLOW, moved.
past Maaloy some ro minutes later, as soon as.
the smoke had cleared sufficiently for them to
do so, and entered Ulvesund.

32. Group 2, from the start, encountered very .
stiff opposition, both from, German Infantry:
who fought to the last man in the buildings, in
which they were established, and from snipers,
armed often with automatic rifles, who took up
positions on the hillside west of the town where
they were very difficult to locate owing to the
excellent natural cover. It must ‘be emphasised
that the opposition in South Vaagso was severe
in degree and skilful in quality. It appears
from the interrogation of prisoners that the
garrison had been fortuitously augmented by a
detachment who had been moved into the town
for Christmas but, however that may be, there
is no doubt that the fighting spirit, marksman-
ship and efficiency of the enemy in this area
was of a high order.

33. At 1020 Group 5 were landed just south
of the village of North Vaagso. They cratered
the coast road between North and South Vaagso
and were able to capture a number of prisoners
who had escaped ashore from ships attacked
by ORIBI and ONSLOW. A fighting patrol,
which was sent forward into North Vaagso
