The enemy attack, supported by divebombers and destroyers, began about six o clock on the morning of 12th November, when German troops disembarked on the extreme North-east of the island and at Pandeli Bay, to the East of Leros town. In the Northeast, about five hundred troops were landed and gained the high ground running from Dellapalma Bay to Grifo, including Mt. Vedetta. The enemy were held on this line throughout the day, but by two o clock on the morning of 13th November, they had overrun Mt. Clidi and extended their bridgehead from Mt. Clidi to Ste. Madonne."

Some progress was made at first, but the landing was successfully counter-attacked by a company of Royal Irish Fusiliers, and was pinned down on the lower slopes of Mt. Appetici. It was here and to the immediate North, on the parrow Gurna-Alinda neck of land, that the move to split the defence up into isolated sectors developed. The Pandeli landing was reinforced during the night of I2th-13th November and a further night landing was made on the northern shore of Gurna Bay."

High winds and heavy seas probably prevented any further enemy reinforcements being landed during the day. No activity of any kind was reported from the southern sector, but in. the centre the enemy, having strongly reinforced his troops in the Appetici area the previous night, unexpectedly captured Appetici at midday and thus exposed our right flank and strengthened his hold on the GurnaAlinda neck. -"

On 13th November fighting continued ashore, and in spite of very heavy bombing by the enemy and a further parachute landing at og00B/13th November, which suffered high casualties due to the strong wind blowing, our forces kept the enemy pinned down to the eastern shore in the Alinda Bay area. During the night of 13th/ 14th November, H.M. Ships FAULKNOR, BEAUFORT, and H.H.M.S. PINDOS after attempting to bombard enemy positions in Leros, left the Aegean owing to shortage of fuel. H.M. Ships ECHO and BELVOIR however bombarded enemy positions on Leros at the request of the Army, and later carried out a sweep in the area without making a sighting. Reinforcements from Samos in the motor launches and minesweepers were turned back by the weather. H.M. Ships PENN, ALDENHAM and BLENCATHRA (Lieutenant E. G. Warren, R.N.) entered the Aegean."

The battalion destined to seize the airfield at Djidjelli and stock it with petrol was, however, unable to land by sea owing to the swell and went on by road from Bougie, not reaching Djidjelli until 13th November, This delay unfortunately prevented our fighters operating from the airfield and, as a result, the enemy bombers sank several ships in Bougie harbour before air cover could be provided. Losses in personnel were not high but in equipment were considerable, and the infantry were, for some time to come, operating only with what they could and in the clothes they wore when they left their ships."
