the 5 torpedo boats previously located in St. Nazaire had been located at Nantes p.m. 25th March.  At 1718 I received Commander-   in-Chief, Plymouth's signal timed 1704/27 stating that these torpedo boats had again (been reported in the neighbourhood of St. Nazaire and might be met. This had to be considered as they constituted a superior force. As however, the submarine had apparently not as yet got a report through, and as we had not been

sighted from the air it still seemed probable .

that our presence was unknown, and there seemed no reason for any change-of plan due to the threat which these torpedo boats constituted.   : ;

x2. At 2000 I stopped and transferred to M.G.B. 314 with the Military Force Commander*, The M.L.s and CAMPBELTOWN were form d up into Special Cruising Order No, 3.and were taken towards position Z at 12 knots, with ATHERSTONE: and TYNEDALE spread on either beam.

. 13, At 2200 STURGEON st{ light was sighted right ahead and we passed within hailing distance at 2215. After passing STURGEON, TYNEDALE and ATHERSTONE continued on their patrol. Mist came

down and visibility became poor down to about.

2 miles.

14. From about midnight gun flashes were seen in.the distance to the north east. At   about 0030 on 28th March when still 12 miles _ off it was obvious that considerable air activity was in progress as gun flashes extended over.a wide arc together with a considerable flak.

15. No definite land was sighted until about 

0045 when in the vicinity of Le Chatelier Shoal the northern shore could be dimly discerned. CAMPBELTOWN acting as guide was ordered to steer 050  and M.G.B. 314 thus freed-was able to alter course freely to obtain ranges of the shore by R.D.F. and also  to run off to either side to obtain soundings. A considerable

northerly.set was experienced so that the course '

of 050  was held until Les Morees Tower was passed about two cables to port at about o125.

x16. Up till our arrival at Les Morees Tower no searchlights had been used and we had obviously been undetected. But at this time one searchlight from No. 3 Heavy Coastal Battery was switched on down the Charpentier Channel.  The warning had evidently been

given and this was the signal for all the search- -

lights on both banks of the river to be switched on. From that moment the entire force was floodlit but for what seemed like  five minutes no fire was opened.

17. During this time we made our bogus identity to the shore signal station at No. 3 Battery and signalled in German that we were  * proceeding up harbour in accordance with instruction  . of the searchlights switched out but we were then called up from the south entrance and passed a similar message. While this was in progress, however, the force was fired on by light flak from one position so we made the signal. for   a vessel considering herself to be

recognised as definitely hostile as we were suddenly fired on heavily and the action became general. It is difficult to describe the full fury of the attack that-was let loose on both sides, the air became one mass of red: and green tracer travelling in, all directions, most of it going over: It did not appear that any of the shore surface* batteries opened fire although the rear portion of the line may have

was |opened a flak ship was observed right ahead and she opened fire from her bridge with  some small automatic weapon. Due to the very accurate firing by our pom-pom  the flak ship fire was ineffective and was soon silenced although it was necessary to pass uncomfortably close to her. :

18. We passed the Old Breakwater Light |

at about 14 cables and then sheered off to starbdard while the CAMPBELTOWN conWe lost her for-a while. in the glare of the searchlights but at 0134 she struck the lock and we saw a burst of flame'on,her fo c sle, this however seemed to die away after a minute or two.and we -could only see her Oerlikons firing hard.. '

1g.  While M.G.B.314 hauled round preparatory to going into the land M.L.160 opened an accurate fire with her 3 pdr. on the flak posi: tions to the east of CAMPBELTOWN and on her starboard bow and silenced them. The leading M.L. of the starboard column, M.L.192, was the first to be hit and beached herself against the Old Mole ablaze from end to end. It is not known accurately what happeried to

those inthe starboard column following her'

but some of them anyhow probably succeeded in landing their troops safely-in the Old

Entrance. At this stage it appeared that the.

situation was being got under control. Firing had temporarily decreased and was mostly confined to the flak positions on the house tops.

20. The port column, however, was  less fortunate. . The leading boat, ground d while still ten feet off the jetty in the face of a withering fire from a pill box on the jetty and flak from the house tops. She attempted to go.astern out of it but the M.L. was set ablaze almost at once. and crew were most gallantly rescued by M.L.160.

hurried off to join his men. Finding one M.L. to be following us in we hailed her to go along-  side CAMPBELTOWN's stern which  she. did and was seen to shove off  with a considerable number .of her crew. At the same time M.G.B.314 turned round and secured by the north side of the Old Entrance and received on board some .20 to 30-men from the CAMPBELTOWN. .,

22. M.T.B.74 then came in and reported for

instructions. -I had in mind using her to torpedo .

the CAMPBELTOWN if the latter's scuttling

charges failed. On landing therefore I went  

and examined the block ship from the dock side and Hailed her but she appeared to be deserted.
