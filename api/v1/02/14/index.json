            "description": "32. The transport difficulties inherent in the length of the line of communication were over- come by making the maximum use of all available sea, road, rail or air lifts. For ex- ample, between 14th February and 3rd March, 3,047 reinforcements were despatched from the Delta to Tripoli on road convoys carrying stores for Eighth Army, and at the end of March a special draft of 1,500 infantry reinforcements was sent forward by air. In all, as many as 7,000 reinforcements were fiown forward."

            "description": "On the morning of 14th February a strong German force, estimated to contain about a hundred tanks, emerged from the Faid pass and attacked the positions held by x United States Armoured Division at Sidi Bou Zid. The American division was rather dispersed at the time the attack was made, with detachments at Sidi Bou Zid, on the Gebel Lessouda, an isolated mountain north of the village, at Sbeitla and south of Hadjeb el Aioun on the Sbeitla-Pichon road. The German armour was. handled with great dash and supported by a strong force of dive-bombers. Our forward battery positions were overrun and while a tank battle raged in front of Sidi Bou Zid an- other enemy force had by 1130 hours cut off the infantry holding positions on the Gebel Lessouda. Our tank losses were heavy and the battle became fluid and difficult to control. By evening 1 Armoured Division had concentrated between Sidi Bou Zid and Sbeitla, and next day, the 15th, attempted a counter-attack. This was unsuccessful and the armour drew off towards Sbeitla, leaving the infantry on Gebe] Lessouda still isolated; some were able to withdraw but many were taken prisoner. It was now clear that our armour had been too depleted to hold the plain and a withdrawal was ordered back to the Western Dorsale. To con- form, the Ranger battalion and the Derbyshize Yeomanry detachment had been already with- drawn from Gafsa which was entered by the enemy on the afternoon of the 15th and the French withdrew in their sector-from the Eastern to the Western Dorsale. This movement was carried out in good order and the enemy fol- lowed up only slowly. | General Anderson"

I was therefore flung straight into a position where I had to give my main attention to the needs of the tactical situation, but I had already given much thought to the strategy which it would be necessary to pursue and was confident that, when the immediate dangers had been averted, and after a necessary period of complete re- organization, I should be able to work out the strategic answer to the problem of Tunisia on the hnes made necessary by the nature of the country and the strength and dispositions of the opposing forces."

In proportion with the increased flying, the photographic work of the photo sections of the P.R. Force was expanded, nearly 354,000 prints being produced during January, 1945, the peak month. Technical photographic developments included the introduction of the moving film camera on operational sorties, and the fitting into Mosquito aircraft of forward facing oblique cameras. The latter were first used on 14th February, when a set of stereo- scopic pairs covering the Burma-Siam railway was thereby secured."

            "description": "469. On the evening of the 14th February, A.O.C. 226 Group returned to Palembang from P.II. Both he and A.O.C. 225 Group were informed by the local Dutch Territorial Com- mander that the situation was well under control and that he had every hope of eliminat- ing the paratroops. He gave the impression that a drive was to take place that night to clear the area. Contrary orders evidently were received later by him, because a start was made during the night in burning oil and rubber stocks in the town, and in the destruction of the oil refinery area"

Their ground personnel, who came by sea, landed at Oesthaven about 14th February. The arrival of the latter coincided with the Japanese attack on the Palembang area (which will be related in due course), and they had to be re-embarked for Batavia before they could join their squadrons, which thus never had their own ground staffs with them in Sumatra. Each squadron had 24 aircraft when it left the Middle East. Sixteen of No. 84 Squadron arrived at P.I. 18 of No. arr Squadron arrived on different days between 23rd January and 14th February (para. 318). Unfortunately the change of route from Singapore to Palem- bang resulted in the loss of 3 aircraft of No. 84 Squadron as a result of wrong briefing given to them on leaving Burma about the location of landing grounds in Sumatra."
