            "description": "The steady deterioration of the situation in the Indian Ocean gravely affected our plans in the Middle East, and we begged the Chiefs of Staff to acquaint us more fully with develop- ments in that theatre. On the 23rd April we received a long and detailed appreciation of the situation. In discussing possible Japanese plans, an attempt to invade Ceylon was not Tuled out, although it seemed more likely that the Japanese would try to exploit their success in Malaya and Burma by advancing into India from the north-east. For the time being we were in no position to offer effective resistance by sea, land, or air to any offensive. Should the Japanese press boldly westward without pause for consolidation, the Indian Empire would \u2018be in grave danger. In that event the security of the Middle East and its essential supply line would be threatened. The Middle East and India were therefore interdependent."

            "description": "An appreciation from the Chiefs of Staff in London was received on the 23rd April. It confirmed my general appreciation of the danger to India, +.e., that an invasion of N.E. India by sea, land and air was the most probable threat, while an attack on Ceylon was possible; it recognised the powerlessness of the Eastern Fleet to offer effective opposition; accepted that the land forces in India were inadequate by at least one Armoured Division, one Army Tank Brigade and four infantry divisions, which deficiencies could not be met till late in 1942; and gave the air squadrons required as 66 (there were in India at this time 15 operational squadrons, rising to a total of 25 by the end of June)."

            "description": "/ of x8th April. Eighth Aimy was \u2018to start its attack on the night of Igth-zoth April with 50 Division on the coast, 2 New Zealand Divi- sion just west of Enfidaville and 4 Indian Duvi- sion, with \u2018\u2018 L\u2019\u201d\u2019 Force under command, west of Takrouna. 7 Armoured Division guarded the western flank, made contact with XIX Corps and was available to exploit success. XIX Corps was to attack three mountain posi- tions commanding Pont du Fahs from the south; no date was set for this attack and it was not to be launched until First Army con- sidered that the enemy in these strong posi- tions had ibeen sufficiently weakened by the attacks on either flank. First Army was to attack on 22nd April. 9 Corps would begin in the early morning with 46 Infantry and x and 6 Armoured Divisions. The infantry were to destroy the enemy positions west of the salt marshes of Sebkret el Kourzia and the armour was then to follow through as quickly as pos- sible directed on Gebel Mengoub, an eight hun- dred foot feature fifteen miles from the north end of the marshes and the same distance from Tunis, 5 Corps would attack in the evening of 22nd April with 1 and 4 Divisions south of the river, directed on Massicault, and 78 Divi- sion in the mountains north of the river with Gebel Ahmera (\u2018\u2018Longstop\u2019\u2019) as their first objective. TH Corps\u2019 attack was timed for the next day, 23rd April, with 1 Division attack- ing on the Sidi Nsir road with its final objec- tive the pass above Chouigui, and 9 Drvision on the axis Sedjenane-Mateur. In order to con- trol the battle I had moved my Headquarters to a wood near Le Kef, after a short period at Haidra, between Tebessa and Thala."

            "description": "On the northernmost sector progress by II Corps was steady and continuous throughout this period. The enemy defences were strong and long-established and the terrain, as I have said, was particularly difficult; these advan- tages outweighed in the early stages their numerical inferiority and the lack of reserves for the defence, but as position after position was wrested away there were increasingly less troops to man the positions in rear. 9 and 1 Infantry Divisions attacked on, the morning of 23rd April on the Sedjenane-Mateur and B\u00e9ja-Mateur axes respectively. On the first day 9 Division gained its objective west of El] Aouana 1 Division made slightly slower progress but by the 25th had reached the high ground a mile to the south-east of Sidi Nsir station. This advance had exposed the left flank of the division and 34 Infantry Divi- sion was now brought in between the other two to clear up the area astride the Sidi Nsir- Mateur road. The mdge of hills west of Sidi Nsir was cleared by 28th April after three days of concentrated artillery fire and on the same day the high ground east of the village was captured after close and heavy fighting."

In a series of attacks on one day alone, the enemy destroyed 10 Blenheims on the ground at Niamata and damaged several other air- craft which had to be subsequently destroyed and abandoned.

Towards the end the repeated enemy attacks on our aero- dromes in the Athens Area caused further heavy losses, and as a final blow a force of Hurricanes retained at Argos to cover the evacuation was almost wiped out when 13 of them were destroyed on the ground during intensive enemy air attacks on 23rd April."

            "description": "14. Contact was maintained throughout the operation with the Norwegian High Command who were naturally very concerned about the withdrawal of troops from South Norway. The Norwegians realised that their forces were not properly armed for modern warfare and they made repeated requests for artillery, especially A/A, for the defence of Tromso and North Norway and also to equip the large number of coasting vessels upon whose movement up and down the coast depends the life of the country. These requests I passed on to the Admiralty for H.M. Government but the Norwegians, who seemed to imagine that immense reserves of guns and ammunition, etc., were readily avail- able in England, could not understand why their requests were not immediately complied with. To ease matters I authorised the issue to them of all the war material, not required by the Anny, taken in the captured German Transport ALSTER which was sent to Tromso on the 23rd April to discharge accordingly; to meet Article 39 of the Naval Discipline Act, the British Consul at Tromso was asked to watch the discharging and make an affidavit of goods handed over; a copy of this affidavit was sent to the Secretary of the Admiralty later."

The enemy air effort was limited to occasional unsuccessful attacks on Allied photographic reconnaissance aircraft, and to small-scale ground attack activity by Stukas and Me. 109 fighter bombers in the battle area. This latter effort reached its peak on the night 22nd-23rd April, when ten to fifteen sorties were reported on the Fifth and Eighth Armies\u2019 fronts. After that date this harassing activity quickly declined as the Allied ground- forces over-ran the bases at Villafranca (10 miles S.W. of Verona) and Ghedi (10 miles"

The embarkation programme was accordingly revised to enable a greater number of troops to be embarked in the Peloponnesus whence the journey to Crete would be shorter and less exposed to air attack. Fortunately, however, the plan remained elastic, and when the Corinth Canal was cut by enemy para- chutists in the early morning of 26th April, it was possible again to change the plans and to embark the 4th New Zealand Brigade from a beach east of Athens, Porto Ratti, instead of from the Peloponnesus."
