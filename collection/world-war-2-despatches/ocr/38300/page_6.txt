of Force “‘ P.” The first pair of fighters
located Force’ ‘‘A’’ and then returned.
Nothing further was seen of any shadower.

In the interchange of signals, Force ‘‘ A’’ used -

C.S.1’s call-sign on one occasion and it seems
probable that owing to the use of power neces-
sary for reception’ at over 100 miles,“ both
forces: were detected by D/F at. this time. I
am not*certain that Force: ‘‘ P ’’ was actually
sighted but’ it seems likely that the aircraft
shadowing ‘Force ‘‘ A’’ took-a further look
to seaward before: returning to its base, and
visibility at-this.time was such that it may
well have sighted Force ‘P.” During ‘this
period homing signals from shofe stations were
heard and detected by. D/F, and I think the
aircraft must have been at the limit of its
endurance. |

clusion that the only. satisfactory thing was to

informed VICTORIOUS that I intended to do‘

so, and made arrangements to board her with

Unifortunately it blew up véry hard and I-did

seemed ‘little doubt that it had been brought
down. ‘The Flight had found two armed
trawlers just short of Tromso and had
attacked them. Jt was the Flight Leader who
had been fost, ‘and he appears to have .con-
tinued -the attack too long: As the. attack’
‘was made out of sight of Tromso no information
of shipping in the harbour was obtained.

49..The Force withdrew at 25 knots for
two hours, and’ reducing to 20 knots at 0600
set course for Seidisfiord. I wag unable to
pass the report of the attack until 1700 on

out very clearly the importance of the ° s

an operation already planned and discussed it
is not so: necessary, though even then there
is much to be said for it as otherwise a large §
degree of discretion may have to be given to
the carrier Captains at the last moment.

Planning and Preparations -

53: By force of circumstances this operation ©
was carried out in a hurry. Neither
VICTORIOUS nor FURIOUS was really ready
for such .an operation, and some of the pilots
had never deck-landed, before. During the six
days in which the-operation had to be planned
VICTORIOUS’ was frequently at sea exer-  ‘j
cising, as also was DEVONSHIRE for some \
days. FURIOUS’ was only in company for
two days arid was at sea exercising most, of
that, time. , This made it very difficult for any
consultations to be held as to- details of the
plan. The capabilities of the two carriers were
so different that the sclieme of fly-off presented
cotisiderable difficulties and was only decided
at the last minute. “

Intelligence. * .° t

54. For operations in this aréa, to be effective.
in doing material damage, far’ better intelli- |
gence than was available in this case is neces-
safy. The presence of such a force must
always be an embarrassment to the enemy, but
without intelligence it is like looking for a ',;
needle-in a haystack to try to locate the small
amount of shipping that may be strung out
along the inner leads and open sea between
say, Narvik and Kirkenes. That much can as
be done in this way I am certain, if the oppro-
priate force is employed: and routine recor
naissance'can be made. :

The. way in which the attack was
