During the evening I called on the Governor
and the C.-in-C. Far East, to whom I reported
that the First Degree of Readiness had been
assumed by all troops under my command.

123. The first Catalina sent out failed to
make contact during the night 6-7th December.
A second was despatched early on the 7th
December and instructed that, if no contact
was established, a search was to be made from
to miles off the west coast of Indo-China as
G.H.Q. anticipated that the convoys might be
concentrating in the Koh Kong area where there
was a suitable anchorage. No reports were re-
ceived from this Catahna and, from informa-

«tion subsequently received, it would appear
that this boat was shot down by the Japanese.
Three Hudson aircraft sent out on the same
morning similarly failed to make contact,
owing to bad weather conditions which forced
two of them to abandon the search.

Further Hudson reconnaissances were sent
but only single merchant vessels were sighted in
the Gulf of Siam at 1345 hours and 1545 hours
respectively These Hudsons were then sent on
a diverging search off the Siamese Coast, and at
1750 hours one merchant vessel and one
ctuiser were sighted steaming 340°. The
cruiser opened fire on the reconnaissance air-
craft. At 1848 hours under conditions of very
bad visibility, four Japanese vessels, perhaps
destroyers, were seen off Singora steaming
south.

It will thus be seen that for a period of
nearly 30 hours after the first sighting the air
reconnaissance sent out had failed to make con-
tact with the main invasion forces, owing to
bad weather.

Tf the report of the Catalina flying boat having
been shot down by Japanese aircraft on the
morning of 7th December, 1941, is correct, then
this was the first act of war in the Malaya area
between Japan and the British Empire. If
not, then the first act was the firing on the
Hudson reconnaissance aircraft by a Japanese
ship on the evening of the 7th December.

124. An appreciation of the situation showed
that the enemy convoy, if it was bound for
Singora, could reach there about midnight
7-8th December, whereas if MATADOR was
put into operation, it was unlikely that our
leading troops, even if they met with no
opposition or obstacles on the way, would
arrive there before about o200 hrs. 8th
December. An encounter battle with our small
force and lack of reserves would have been very
risky, especially as the enemy was expected
to include tanks in his force. There was also the
complication of part of our force having, owing
to the lack of M.T., to move forward by rail
and subsequently be linked up with its trans-
port in the forward area. For these reasons
I informed the C.-in-C, Far East at a Con-
ference held at Sime Road that I considered
Operation MATADOR in the existing circura-
stances to be unsound. Subsequently at a Con-
ference held at the Naval Base at about 2230
hrs. that night, at which both the C.-in-C. Far
East and the C.-in-C. Eastern Fleet (who had
just returned from Manila) were present, it
was decided not to' order MATADOR that
night. At 2320 hrs., the Commander 3 Indian
Corps was informed of this decision and was
instructed to be ready to put MATADOR into
effect at dawn on the 8th December if ordered
to do so.

SUPPLEMENT to tne LONDON GAZETTE, ‘26 FEBRUARY, 1048

125. On the Kelantan front the probable
landing beaches had been heavily wired with
ihree belts of double apron or triple dannert
wire and concrete pill-boxes had been built.
In addition, large numbers of anti-personnel and
anti-tank mines had been laid; but the two for-
ward Battalions had to watch a front of over
30 miles and the average company front was
over 8,000 yds.

At about 2345 hrs. on the 7th December the
Beach Defence troops on Badang and Sabak
beaches, the point of junction of which at the
Kuala Pa’amat was about one and a half miles
N.E of the Kota Bharu aerodrome, reported
ships anchoring off the coast. Shortly after-
wards our beach defence artillery opened fire
and the enemy ships started shelling the
beaches. At about 0025 hrs. on the 8th Decem-
ber the leading Japanese troops landed at the
junction of the Badang and Sabak beaches and
by oroo hrs. after heavy fighting had succeeded
in capturing the adjacent pill-boxes manned by
troops of the 3/17 Dogras. The garrisons of
the latter inflicted very heavy casualties on the
enemy before being themselves wiped out almost
to a man. Hudson aircraft between midnight
and dawn pressed home numerous attacks in
the face of heavy A.A. fire from warships and
transports One of the transports which is be-
lieved to have contained tanks and artillery
was set on fire, either by air attack or gun-
fire, or perhaps both, and prevented from dis-
charging its cargo. As soon as the first land-
ing took place the 2/12 Frontier Force Regt.
(less one coy. West of the Kelantan River) and
73 Field Battery were ordered up from Chon-
Dong with orders to prevent any penetration
towards the aerodrome with a view to a subse-
quent countér-attack.

In the meantime I had informed C.-in-C. Far
East and the Governor that hostilities had
broken out.

126. At about 0430 hrs. 8th December a
Japanese air formation raided Singapore area.
It had presumably come from French Indo-
China, a distance of about 700 miles. The air
raid alarm was sounded but Singapore was not
completely blacked out when the aurcraft
arrived. Bombs were dropped on the Seletar
and Tengah aerodromes and in the City area,
but damage was slight. This was the first in-
dication the citizens of Singapore had that war
had broken out in the Far East.

127. The A.O.C. Far East, in consultation
with myself, decided that the task of the Air
Striking Force was to co-operate with the Army
in repelling the attack on Kelantan. Accord-
ingly the, Squadrons based on the Kedah,
Kuantan and Tengah aerodromes were ordered
to attack the enemy ships lying off Kota Bharu
at dawn. Upon arrival at Kota Bharu these
aircraft were unable to find the Japanese trans-
ports, which had by then withdrawn behind the
Perintian Islands some 15 miles off the Kelan-
tan Coast. One squadron went on to Patani,
where other Japanese transports were seen and
attacked, but owing to fighter opposition it is
doubtful if results were obtained. From now
on the absence of modern escorting fighters was
keenly felt. -On return to the aerodromes in
Kedah some of our aircraft were attacked by
Japanese bombers and fighters while re-fuelling
and considerable losses were sustained. The
aerodromes at Alor Star, Sungei Patani, Butter-
worth; Penang, Kota Bharu, Gong Kedah and
