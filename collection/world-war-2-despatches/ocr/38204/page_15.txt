was trying to extricate herself. The following is "and absorbing, but I believe we were at the

September 22nd

“0710. Set both charges to one hour
and reléased ten pin plugs. Went to 75 feet
and stuck in the net. Although we had still
heard nothing it was thought essential to get
out as soon as possible and blowing to full
buoyancy and going full astern were
immediately tried. X.7 came out but turned
beam on to the net and broke surface close
on to the buoys, going astern to the north-
ward.

We went down again immediately but had
to go ahead towards the net to avoid catching
our stern and the boat stuck again by the
bow at 95 feet. Here more difficulty in
getting out was experienced, but after about
5 minutes of wriggling and blowing X.7
started to rise The compass had, of course,
gone wild on the previous surface and I was
uncertain how close to the shore we were;
so the motor was stopped and X.7 was
allowed to come right up to the surface with
very little way on. By some extraordinary
lucky chance we must have either passed
under the nets or worked our way through
the boat passage, for on breaking surface the
TIRPITZ with no intervening nets, was
sighted right ahead not more than 30 yards
away. 40 ft. was ordered and X.7 at full
speed, struck the TIRPITZ at 20 ft on the
port side approximately below ‘B’ turret
and slid gently under the keel where the star-
board charge was released in the full shadow
of the ship. Here, at 60 ft., a quick stop trim
was caught—at the collision X.7 had swung
to port so we were now heading approxi-
mately down the keel of TIRPITZ. Going
slowly astern the port charge was released
about 150 to 200 ft. further aft—as I esti-
mated, about under ‘ X’ turret. I am un-
certain as to the exact time of release, but the
first depth charges were heard just after the
collision, which, from Lieutenant Cameron’s
Teport would fix the time at 0722.

After releasing the port charge, roo ft. was
ordered and an alteration of course guessed
to try and make the position where we had
come in. At 60 ft. we were in the net again.
Without a compass I had no exact idea of
where we were; the difficulties we had ex-
perienced and the air trimming had used two
air bottles and only 1200 Ibs. were left in the
third. X.7’s charges were due to explode
in an hour—not to mention others which
might go up any time after 0800.

A new technique in getting out of nets had
by this time been developed. The procedure
was to go full ahead blowing economically
and then go full astern, the idéa being to get
as much way on the boat as the slack of the
nets would allow and thus have a certain
impetus as well as the thrust of the screws
when actually disengaging from the net. In
about the next three quarters of an hour
X.7 was in and out of several nets, the air
in the last bottle was soon exhausted and
the compressor had to be run.!! When at
about 40 ft., at 0740, X.7 camé out“while
still going ahead and slid over the top of"the
net between the buoys on the surface. I did
not look at the TIRPITZ at this time as this
method of overcoming net defences was new

taken from Lieutenant Place’s report: time on her starboard bow—we had certainly

passed underneath her since the attack. We
were to® close, of course, for heavy fire but
a large number of machine gun bullets were
heard hitting the casing. Immediately after
passing over the nets all main ballast tanks
were vented and X.7 went to the bottom in
120 ft. The compressor was run again and
we tried to come to the surface or periscope
depth for a look so that the direction indicator
could be started and as much distance as
possible put between ourselves afd the
coming explosion. It was extremély annoying
to run into another net at 60 ft. Shortly
after this there was a tremendous explosion
(0812). This evidently shook us out of the
net and on surfacing it was tiresome to see
the TIRPITZ still afloat—this made me un-
certain as to whether the explosion we had
just heard was our own charges or depth
charges, so X.7 was taken to the bottom . . .”

This last excursion into the nets ‘was
apparently well on TIRPITZ’ starboard bow
and from outside. After getting clear X.7 sat
on the bottom to survey the damage. Com-
passes and diving gauges were out of action but
there appeared to be little structural damage.
The boat was impossible to control, however,
and broke surface on several occasions. On
each occasion fire was opened on her from
TIRPITZ causing damage to the hull, and
finally it was decided to abandon the boat.
X.7 was brought to the surface rather than use
D.S.E.A., owing to the depth charging that was
being experienced. The boat surfaced close to a
target allowing Lieutenant Place to step on to
it, but before the remainder of the crew could
escape, X.7 sank at 0835. Sub-Lieutenant
Aitken was able to get out by the use of
DSE.A. at 1115, but no trace was discovered
of the remaining two members of the crew.
Both Lieutenant Place and Sub-Lieutenant
Aitken were brought on board TIRPITZ and
well treated, as had been the crew of X.6.

The first knowledge on board TIRPITZ that
more than one midget submarine was attacking
came at 0740, when X.7 was seen just outside
the A/T nets, having made her escape after
dropping her charges. Hand grenades were
thrown, fire opened from the 2 cm. and 3.7 cm.
armament, and aircraft made ready to take off
and carry out a search.

As other craft were- outside the nets in un-
known numbers, it was decided not to take
TIRPITZ out of the enclosure, so the gate was
shut, and the ship moved as far away from
the position in which X.6 had sunk by heaving
in on the starboard cable and veering port.
This brought the bows away from both of X.6’s
charges and the first of X.7’s, but left X.7’s
second charge still under the engine room; those
on board TIRPITZ being unaware that a second
attack had been carried out.

TIRPITZ’ log records at 0812 ‘‘ two heavy
consecutive detonations to port ‘at 1/10 sec.
interval. Ship vibrates strongly in vertical
direction and sways slightly between the
anchors.’’ The first explosion abreast Section
VII (‘'X”’ turret) about 6 to 8 yards away
from the ship, the other 56-60 yards off the
bow in the position where X.6 sank.

The weight of the charge was estimated at
goo ibs, whereas, in fact, each of the four
charges weighed 2 tons. It is not clear from
