Neither Headquarters Palestine and Transjordan nor the Royal Air Force in Iraq could assist with motor transport, strenuous effort was therefore made to hire the necessary civilian transport to make up the serious deficiency until the arrival of the three companies from India. It was now necessary to get troops into Deir-ez-Zor as soon as practicable, and orders to this effect were given to Lt.-General Quinan."

I took this step with great reluctance as I knew well that one man could not carry out the duties of Commander-inChief and Commander of the Eighth Army with full efficiency. Moreover I had grave doubts as to the wisdom of changing commanders at so criticala time."

This was the system on which I had worked in Tunisia and Sicily and, now that the comparatively static period of the winter was over, I was anxious to be as close behind the Armies as possible. On rqth June I opened this advanced headquarters at Frascati, using for offices a small building which had previously been used for the same purpose by Field-Marshal Kesselring. This was soon left too far behind by the speed of our advance, and on 25th June I moved to a camp site on the eastern shores of Lake Bolsena."

            "description": "The capture of Elba, early plans for which I have already mentioned, took place about this time. I originally wanted this operation to be Jaunched if possible before the spring offensive opened but it had been postponed to a date between 2oth and 25th May. On 16th May I was informed that it had been further postponed till mid-June. This removed almost all the value of the operation as by that time our troops, advancing overland, would be almost level with the island and on rath June I asked whether the forces earmarked for Elba could not rather be used for a landing on the  mainland in support of Fifth Army. However, this was considered unacceptable as the French would not consent to the use in Italy of  g Colonial Infantry Division, which they wanted to keep for the landings in France. The operation therefore went in as planned in the early morning of 17th June; the occupation of the island was complete by the afternoon of the roth. Steps were taken to emplace medium guns in the north-eastern corner of the island to command Piombino but the town fell on 25th June without the necessity for their use."
