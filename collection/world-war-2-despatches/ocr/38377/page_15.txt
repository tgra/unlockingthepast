SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 AUGUST, 1048

Movements of Forces on the Night 24th /a5th
September (D.—1/D 1). ‘
5. NELSON with her screen proceeded to the
westward until 2130, when course was reversed
to ago°.
1930, several small fishing vessels with bright
lights were encountered.

6. BROWN RANGER, escorted by FLEUR
DE LYS, sailed from Gibraltar to the eastward
at 2030, so as to be in position for oiling
destroyers on D.2.

\ 7. RODNEY, ARK ROYAL, HERMIONE,

; DUNCAN (Captain (D), 13th Destroyer

\ Flotilla), FORESIGHT, FORESTER,
LIVELY, ZULU, GURKHA, LEGION and

. LANCE sailed from Gibraltar at 2300 to
‘simulate a normal sortie of Force H and to

\ rendezvous with the convoy at 0800 the follow-

\ ing morning.

: _ 8 Force Z, consisting of QUEEN EMMA,
PRINCESS BEATRIX, ULSTER MONARCH,
ROYAL SCOTSMAN (whose ultimate destina-
tion was Freetown) and LEINSTER, escorted

; by JONQUIL, SPIREA and AZALEA, had

been stationed astern of the main convoy at

i dusk and ordered to proceed into Gibraltar Bay.

It was hoped that the presence of these ships

} in the Bay would allay suspicion, in the event

of the convoy having been sighted and reported
whilst passing through the Straits.

| g. The remainder of Convoy W.S.11X and

escort, organised in two groups one mile apart,
and led by the Vice-Admiral, 2nd-in-Command,
« Home Fleet in PRINCE OF WALES, and the
i Rear-Admiral Commanding, 18th Cruiser
' Squadron in EDINBURGH respectively,
passed south of Europa Point at o130.

This disposition was adopted to reduce the
frontage of the convoy during its passage
through the Straits.

to. At 0730 RODNEY, ARK ROYAL and
their screening destroyers were sighted from
NELSON at about ro miles, the limit of visi-
bility at that time Half an hour later the
convoy and its escort were sighted, a few
minutes after a Hudson aircraft which was
carrying out an A/S patrol had reported them
in sight to the westward.

rr. NELSON shaped an easterly course while’

‘exchanges of destroyers took place in accord-
ance with HAL (short title for Operation
Orders), paragraph 21. These exchanges were
designed so that destroyers required to accom-
pany the heavy ships after parting company

from the convoy on D.3 should be used to
iscreen the convoy on D.z and D.2 and thus

i economise fuel.

A 12. The forces then formed two groups, as
follows: —

Group I, oe

NELSON (Flag Officer Commanding, Force
H), ARK ROYAL, HERMIONE, COSSACK
(Captain (D), 4th Destroyer Flotilla), ZULU,
FORESIGHT, FORESTER, LAFOREY (Cap-
tain (D), oth Destroyer Flotilla), and
LIGHTNING.

FIELD, EURYALUS, DUNCAN (Captain
(D), 13th Destroyer Flotilla), GURKHA,

voy, H.MS. BRECONSHIRE, CLAN

ROWALLAN CASTLE, DUNEDIN STAR and
CITY OF CALCUTTA.

13. While in V/S touch, Vice-Admiral, 2nd-
in-Command, Home Fleet reported that the
convoy might have been sighted by a Portu-
guese merchant ship west of Cape Spartel, but
that only fishing boats were seen in the Straits.
SHEFFIELD reported that the convoy had not
been sighted either by surface vessels or air-
craft, whilst in company with her.

Movements of Group I on 25th September
(D.1).

14. In order to give the impression to any
shadowing aircraft approaching from the east-
ward that only the usual Force H was at sea,
Group I parted company with Group II, and
proceeded to the eastward at 18 knots, with the
intention of keeping along the African coast.

15. Clocks were advanced x hour to Zone
—2 at r000A/25 and hereafter times are
Zone —2.

16. ARK ROYAL maintained one A/S
patrol aircraft in the air from 1105 until dusk.
During the day 24 out of the 27 Fulmars
carried were flown for exercise, two providing
targets for a height-finding exercise. Six
Fulmars flew round both groups for recognition

purposes.

17. FLEUR DE LYS and BROWN
RANGER were sighted at 1115. FLEUR DE
LYS reported speed made good was 11 knots,
and she was ordered to make good 123 knots.
It was ascertained after return to harbour that
BROWN RANGER intended to convey she was
unable to makeegood more than 11 knots, due
apparently to a foul bottom. This was not
appreciated at the time the signal was received.

18. At 1700, when in position 36° 36’ N.,
or° 58° W., DUNCAN, in position N in
Screening Diagram No. 10, obtained a contact
bearing 120°, 1,500 yards. She attacked with
four charges, the starboard thrower failing to
fire. GURKHA co-operated and attacked with

‘a fourteen-charge pattern at x716, At 1750

DUNCAN fired a second pattern. No further
contacts were obtained, and both ships pro-
ceeded at 1758 to rejoin the screen. Both ships
observed bubbles rising to the surface, possibly
from a damaged U-Boat, after DUNCAN’s
first attack, .

Two French merchant ships, MERS EL -
KEBIR and SIDI ORSA, were sighted about.
1800. Several other unidentified ships weié
reported by aircraft, but did not come in sight
of Group I.
