            "date": "2nd September",
            "description": "The first two days of the battle had ended without any decisive success for the enemy and this was already a decisive success for us. On 2nd September, Rommel changed his tactics. -Instead of continuing the attack he decided to put himself in a posture of defence and await the counter-attack which he felt confident that we should shortly deliver; he therefore massed the bulk of his armour south of Alam el Halfa and threw out a screen of anti-tank guns in front of them. On the left of the armour 90 Light and Trieste Divisions consolidated their positions to keep open the corridor through the minefield. It was not our intention, however, to gratify him by a frontal attack on the Africa Corps but rather to operate against the two infantry divisions further west in order to close the gap in the minefield behind the main armoured force. Orders for this operation had been issued the previous day and 5 Indian Infantry Brigade and 7 Medium and 49 Anti-tank Regiments Royal Artillery, from 30 Corps were moving south to reinforce 13 Corps. At the same time 2 South African Brigade was drawn into reserve. On request of Eighth Army I sent up 151 Brigade from 50 Division at Amiriya to strengthen the south-western end of Alam el Halfa  ridge. Should the plan prove successful the enemy would be so weakened that an immediate advance might be possible; General  Montgomery ordered forward H.Q. ro Corps in case he should need it to command a pursuit force. It was instructed to be prepared to push through to Daba with all reserves available and possibly the Australian Division. Meanwhile the enemy concentrations provided an excellent target to our aircraft and artillery which gave them no respite. Armoured car patrols to the south and east observed the enemy closely and 7 Armoured Division continued to, attack his unarmoured vehicles with great success."

It arrived off Skagi on 7th September, thirty-six hours astern of station, and was there joined by the ocean escort of three destroyers, four corvettes, two anti-aircraft ships and four trawlers. Apart from the weather, and two U-boat.contacts, the passage so far had been uneventful."

            "date": "2nd September",
            "description": "preparation almost as though it were not there. Only two assets now remuined to Kesselring to retrieve the situation: the excellence of his Jateral communications and the fact that the  * Gothic  line had been built on the forward slopes of the range. The importance of the former factor in allowing a rapid reinforcement I have aeady emphasized; the latter meant that there was still one more ridge between the Allies and the plains, known from the village on its summit as the Coriano ridge. The Canadians were already over the Conca, on 2nd September, and 5 Corps were about to pass ir Armoured Division  through in a dash for the flat country beyond. Just in time Kesselring succeeded in manning the Coriano ridge with  1 Parachute, 26 Panzer and 29 Panzer Grenadier Divisions; these three excellent divisions, aided by very heavy rain from 5th to 7th September, resisted all attacks between the 4th and the 12th both on the ridge itself and on its southern flank at Gemmano. As Eighth Army's offensive developed its full extent the enemy was forced to economize strength on the remainder of his front by withdrawing into the  Gothic   line. This was essential if he were to be able to make further reinforcements avajlable for his left; it was also a natural measure of. precaution in case a real _breakthrough was achieved for, apart from LXXVI Corps, now engaged with Eighth Army, the rest of the German troops were still well south of the watershed of the Apennines. The withdrawal began on 30th August. LI Mountain Corps, between Urbino and Pontassieve, moved straight back into the line on a timed programme, releasing one division for the central sector, and 10 Corps, following up, made contact with the line on 3rd September. At the same time the enemy opposite Fifth Army began to pull back. On the extreme right they went back almost directly into the   Gothic   line. Opposite 13 Corps, however, the enemy stabilized on 3rd September on the line of hills north of Florence: Monte Morello, Monte Senario, Monte Calvana and Monte Giovi. IV Corps followed up across the Arno on 31st August and II Corps on Ist September. Little Tesistance was met and we were able to occupy"

            "date": "2nd September",
            "description": "An unexpected difficulty now arose because Castellano claimed he had no authority to sign the armistice and must first consult his Government. He was told plainly that our terms, including the new offer, must be accepted or rejected by the night of rst-2nd September and that, whatever their decision, we should proceed with our plan for carrying the war to the Tfalian mainland. I have wondered since whether we should have been able to make good those bold words if the Italian decision had been negative, but at the time I had no doubt they would accept. On the other hand the military situation had been changing to our disadvantage every day since the plan for Salerno had first been proposed, in view of the constant arrival of fresh German forces.{ However, the bluff was not called; within our specified time on Ist September the King and Badoglio agreed to our terms and at a quarter past five on 3rd September General Smith, on behalf and in the presence of General Eisenhower, and General Castellano, on behalf of Marshal Badoglio, signed the Military Terms of Surrender. The scene of the signature was a tent in an almond grove near Cassibile; thirteen hours ibefore, to the thunder of six hundred guns in the Straits of Messina, the Eighth Army had begun the first invasion of the continent of Europe."
