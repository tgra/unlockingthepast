REORGANIZATION OF THE COMMAND

2. Prior to the formation of the new Com-
mand, an administrative reorganization had
been introduced by General Headquarters
Middle East, with the object of freeing Com-
mander Tenth Army from the administration
of the bases and lines of communication in
Persia and Iraq so that he could concentrate on
his operational task. By this measure, which
came into effect on 15th August, 1942, the
control of the general administration of the
ports, depots and communications behind the
Tenth Army was vested in a senior Staff Officer
of General Headquarters Mideast, designated
the Inspector General of Communications
(1.G.C.); while there was created an area
Command, known as Pibase, to deal with the
internal security and local administration of the
Base and Lines of Communication area. At
the same time the zone of responsibility of the
Commander Tenth Army was to have been
further reduced by transferring Northern Iraq
from the Tenth to the Ninth Army.

The formation of a separate new Command
under the War Office necessitated some modi-
fications to this lay-out. With a General
Headquarters on the spot, the decentralization
of general administrative control was neither
necessary nor desirable, and the Inspector
General of Communications and his staff were
therefore merged into General Headquarters.
Owing however to the length of the divergent
lines of communication leading from the Persian
Gulf, and the extent of development still
needed in the ports, base depots and means of
communication, I considered that closer and
more, continuous supervision was required
throughout the bases and lines of communi-
cation than could be exercised from General
Headquarters. I decided, therefore, as a tem-
porary measure, to include in my staff for this
purpose a D.Q.M.G. Bases and Lines of Com-
munication, with a small staff, located at
Basra. This appointment was filled by Major
General C. R. C. Lane, C.B., M.C., LA,
whose administrative experience and know-
ledge of the country and conditions well
qualified thim for this responsibility.

I decided, also, that the responsibility for
local administration and internal security over
the whole of the Base and Lines of Communica-
tion areas of Iraq and Persia was more than
one Commander could deal with satisfactorily;
I therefore divided the Pibase area into two
area. commands, covering respectively the Base
oe Lines of Communication areas of Iraq and

ja.

POSITION IN SEPTEMBER 1942.

3. The only troops immediately available in
Persia and Iraq to meet a German invasion
were two Indian Divisions and one Indian
Armoured Division. Of ‘these, the former had
each only two infantry brigades and were below
establishment and deficient in artillery,
engineers and signals, and the latter had no
medium tanks; both were short of transport.

Many other deficiencies remained to be
filled before this small force could become a
balanced fighting organization. Corps artillery
units, Anti-Aircraft artillery, engineer units,
signals and administrative units were -either
short of fequirements or lacking altogether.

an area, although planned and started by Head-
quarters Tenth Army, was still not yet
complete, -

The Polish personnel, who, with the 3rd
Carpathian Division already in the Middle East,
were to form the Polish Army in the East,
were in process of assembling at Khaniqin after
their evacuation from Russia; they lacked
organization, equipment and training, and
many of them were still suffering in health from
a long period of hardship.

Decisions had already been made by the War
Office to strengthen and complete the forces
in Persia and Iraq. Two British Divisions (5th
and 56th) had already ibeen diverted to the
Command, and the former was commencing to
arrive. These were to be followed by 7th
British Armoured Brigade from India and the
5th Indian and 3rd Carpathian Polish Divi-
sions from the Middle East. Additional units
and resources of all kinds were being provided.
Naturally these measures took time to complete.

One of my first tasks, therefore, was to
complete the organization, equipment and train-
ing of the forces; in this every week’s delay
imposed by the Russian defence was of inestim-
able value.

4. In the administrative sphere much re-
mained to be done before I could feel confident
that operations in North Persia could be ade-
quately maintained, I refer to this later.

‘One t of administration, ‘however,
limited all my operational planning. This was
shortage of motor vehicles of all types, and in
particular of Royal Army Service Corps trans-.
port in both 2nd and 3rd line; further, many
of the vehicles were old and worn. In Egypt
the demand was incessant for vehicles to main-
tain operations in progress, and for the time I
had little prospect of aid from that direction;
the flow of lease lend vehicles into Persia and
Iraq had scarcely begun. Thus my capacity
to maintain sufficient forces in North Persia was
the limiting factor, rather than the availability
of forces in the Command.

‘Pians FoR DEFENCE OF NoRTH PERSIA,

5. An advance iby the Germans as far South
into Persia as Teheran or Hamadan would en-
able them to sustain air attacks on our oil
installations in Persia and Iraq, heavy enough
at least to reduce the oil output, possibly to
stop it altogether for a considerable time. My
plans had therefore to aim at stopping any
German advance from the North towards these
areas; and with the limited fighting strength
which I could deploy and maintain for this
purpose it would be necessary to exploit fully
any advantages of ground astride the various
avenues of approach.

The Russian authorities in North Persia were
averse from the concerted planning and com-
prehensive reconnaissance was impossible.
From the information available, however, it
was clear that good defensive facilities were to
‘be found in the mountain passes of Chalus and
Manjil (leading from the Caspian coast respec- .
tively to Teheran and Kasvin) and in the
mountainous country about Mianeh astride the
Tabriz-Teheran road. If the enemy avoided
these routes, or extended his advance still
further west, the mountains south of Senna,
and the passes leading from Lake Urmia to
Northern Iraq should also afford opportunities
for a strong defence. ‘Further to the South
