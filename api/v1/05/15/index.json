General Klopper had. been in command of the and South African Division since the 15th May, and during this time had had his headquarters in Tobruk. During the earlier fighting he was responsible for the defence of the fortress and of the coastal area between Tobruk and the rear of the Gazala position. It was well realised, however, that the task was a difficult one, but it was hoped that the experience of the com- manders of the 4th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Brigade, the 32nd Army Tank Brigade and of the 83rd Sub-Area, all of whom, with their formations, had been in Tobruk during the siege would help to lighten it."

Concerning the preparation and use of Bardufoss, comsiderable tact was necessary in dealing with the Norwegians, as they firmly wished to keep it under their control. The acceptance of Norwegian pilots and other air personnel for training in England did much to bring a convenient working arrangement into force."

The problem of com- mand was difficult, particularly in regard to artillery support, while the South Africans were advancing from the south side of the hill. Throughout 14th May the South African Brigade advanced towards Triangle, the big feature overlooking the pass from the south-east. Assisted iby the Patriots, who, in this area, did excellent work, the Triangle was captured by o800 hours on 15th May, finally closing the circle. This made further resistance by the enemy merely useless waste of life, and, on 16th May, an armistice was asked for and granted. Subsequent negotiations resulted in the uncon- ditional surrender of the Italian garrison who were granted the honours of war. ."

            "description": "On this day (15th May) I established a command post at Lennick St. Quentin, 6 miles west of Brussels. On the British front, the day passed quietly on the whole. 1st Corps was not attacked in strength ; 3rd Division of znd Corps was attacked north-west of Louvain and its forward positions were penetrated, but a counter- attack successfully restored the original line. There was considerable enemy bombing of rearward areas during the day, and the movement of refugees became increasingly difficult to control, This was, in part, due to the bombing of Tournai and other towns on the routes and to the French decision to close the frontier to pedestrian and horsed traffic. Despite my requests, made as early as roth May, the Belgian authorities had done nothing to restrict the use of private motor cars or the sale of petrol."

Directly Akyab Island was occupied, work began on expanding the existing all- weather airfield so that it could accommodate three transport and three and a half tactical squadrons, with a target completion date of the 15th May.. At the same time, to meet the immediate and pressing needs of Fourteenth Anny, a fair-weather transport field for two squadrons was constructed and opened on the 17th February. Two tactical strips were also made. Fourteenth Army\u2019s rapid progress, how- ever, made further demands on the airfield development of Akyab. A second fair-weather transport strip was called for, and an advance on the completion date for the all-weather airfield, and finally an increase in the opera- tional capacity of the latter was required. Despite many difficulties this programme of work was completed ahead of schedule. The works on Akyab Island were begun by the Chief Engineer, 15 Indian Corps, but early in February, the responsibility was taken over by the commander of an Army Group Royal Engineers, working directly under my Chief Engineer. \u2019"

            "description": "Secondly, I must again draw attention to the factor of the weather, During the monsoon, say 15th May to 15th November very roughly, we had to expect all fair-weather routes to be out of action ; even all-weather roads were sub- ject to wash-outs and damage. Although flying was certain to be intermittent and hazardous, air supply became often the only practicable means, but it was entirely dependent on all- weather airfields. Al] administrative planning had to include provision for the continuance of adequate maintenance under monsoon condi- tions. The absolute importance of completing the construction of all-weather airfields for supply aircraft before the monsoon was there- fore obvious."

At the same time 7 Indian Division, 268 Indian (Independent) Infantry Brigade and the Lushai Brigade, were driving the enemy south before them down the west bank of the Irrawaddy, and so closing the net. The link- up between 20 and 26 Indian Divisions was made on the 15th May at Taikkyi, 60 miles morth of Rangoon, and 26 Indian Division then came under command of 33 Corps."
