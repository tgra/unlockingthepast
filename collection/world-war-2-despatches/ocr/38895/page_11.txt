SUPPLEMENT 70 THE LONDON GAZETTE, 28 APRIL, 1950

on instructions from the Naval Commander
Force “ A” she loaded her L.C.A. as originally
planned. This necessitated the reorganisation
of her troops and it was not until nearly 0230
that her craft were ready for lowering and it
was 0315 before the first flight got away owing
to the second flight from S.S. DERBYSHIRE
persisting in an attempt to form up at the same
time. The beach was found without difficulty
with the aid of the Folbot* from the mark-
ing submarine.

The first flight from H.M.S. GLENGYLE
beached about 0500; the second flight from
SS. DERBYSHIRE at 0520; and the
remainder from S.S. MARNIX at 0545.

The first flight from H.M.S. GLENGYLE
was met by a little machine-gun opposition,
which was effectively dealt with by L.C.S.t
from S.S. MARNIX. There were no casualties
to craft personnel.

Roser GREEN I and I beaches were used
for the assault as in the light of conflicting
information they appeared to be the best. In
the event all the ROGER beaches were found
to be shallow with constantly changing sand-
banks, except RoGER RED which, though very
small and rocky, was shown by a survey to be
the most suitable for all types of landing craft.
There was also an appreciable and abnormal
tidal effect and many L.C.M. were stranded
and could not be re-floated for some time.
H.M.S. BOXER, THRUSTER and BRUISER
were unable to beach within a reasonable
distance from the shore and had to be un-
loaded by L.C.T.

Slow assault convoy arrives—The slow
assault convoy K.M.S. 18 arrived on time at
the release position and brought up in the
appointed anchorage.

Inner anchorage occupied.—Shortly before
daylight, Naval Commander Force “V” in
H.M.S. HILARY led into the intermediate
anchorage after the approach channel had been
swept. A searching sweep indicated that the
inner anchorage was free of mines and at 0900
shipping was entered into the bay.

By midday both S.N.OL(R) and
SNOL, (S) had moved ashore. A reasonable
rate of unloading was continuously maintained
and at 1630 the L.S.I.(L) and L.S.P.} had com-
pleted disembarkation and sailed for Malta.

B. Bark SouTH.

In spite of the weather which made station
keeping by L.C.1.(L) very difficult, the assault
convoy for Bark SourH was only fifteen
minutes late when it anchored. L.C.A. were
got promptly away from the L.S.1.(M), but
the swell made it difficult for L.C.L.(L), both
in coming alongside and in embarking their
troops.

However, at 0115 the signal for the assault
party to proceed was given, and the craft moved
off with the exception of some L.C.I.(L) which
had not completed loading ; these followed later
direct to the beaches.

The landings on RED beaches were made to
time though two to three hundred yards to the
westward of the correct position in the case

of Rep III. The Green beaches were found
correctly but owing to the weather more time
than anticipated was required for the passage
and the landings were forty minutes late.

Opposition was everywhere slight, surprise
being complete or almost so. At the GREEN
landings some casualties were suffered in
L.C.I. from machine-gun fire and in the Rep
sector an L.C.A. received several direct hits
from a mortar.

The L.C.T. convoy were late but proceeded
direct to the waiting position arriving there
eh 0330. The majority had beached by first

t.

All Rep and GREEN beaches were found to
be smaller than expected, and there was some
congestion, particularly when the Reserve
Brigade went in at first light. Notwithstanding
this all L.CI. and L.C.T. had beached and
discharged by about 0745.

Between 0800 and 0900 reconnaissance of
AmpBeER beach by land and water proved, as
anticipated by the military, that this beach was
only lightly defended. The only opposition
was one burst of machine-gun fire, immediately
silenced by a broadside from EGGESFORD.

By midday AMBER beach was in use, with
L.C.L. beaching there in formation. A rocky
promontory at the eastern end was found suit-
able for L.S.T. and needing only a little work
to make it into an excellent hard. Elsewhere
a false beach with three feet of water inshore
caused some inconvenience and necessitated
the use of D.U.K.W. and a pontoon.

The three L.S.I.(M) were sailed for Sousse
at 1400 followed at 2100 by the first convoy
of empty L.S.T. for Malta. Empty L.C.1.(L)
had been proceeding to Malta in groups as,
and when, ready since 0900. H.M.S. ROYAL
ULSTERMAN was retained by S.N.O.L.(Q)
as his headquarters.

C. Bark East.

When approaching Sicily it was found that
the southerly set was stronger than had been
anticipated but allowance was made for this
and the convoy stopped in the correct posi-
tion at 0030/10th July. All landing craft were
lowered on arrival.

All flights touched down at the correct time,
and the sea inshore being calm, all landings
were made without difficulty. Surprise was
lost fifty yards from the shore and light
machine-gun fire and sniping were encountered
by most on the beach. L.C.S. and L.CF.*
replied with effect and only slight military, but
no naval, casualties were suffered. Only at
RED beach was any serious opposition met and
this was disposed of by troops landed on
SCRAMBLE RED. Throughout the assault only
one landing craft was lost—an L.CP.f burnt
out after being hit in the petrol tank by a
shell splinter.

Although the beaches had been cleared, no
progress could be made in the landing of sup-
porting arms until nearly 0700 when the first
L.C.T. arrived via BarK Sours, having been
delayed and diverted by the weather.

At 0520 the coastal battery north of Pachino
began a barrage on a line about 200 yards off
