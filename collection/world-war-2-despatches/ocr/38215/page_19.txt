SUPPLEMENT To rue LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

(0) The general mass of Indians, normally
a peaceful but ignorant section of the popula-
tion which was mainly interested in the quiet
pursuit of ite livelihood but was becoming an

- easy prey to the agitator.

(c) Indians who were whole-heartedly
British in their loyalty, found largely in the
better type of Indian trader and in the clerical
classes and professions.

(4) The Sikh Community, _ strongly
organized within itself and very susceptible
to the anti-British propaganda emanating
from overseas.

The Eurasians were to be found mainly in
the Colony and particularly in Singapore. The
community as a whole was loyal and presented
no political problem. It was not politically
active.

85 There were a number of Japanese in
Malaya and, as all foreigners were treated alike,
no special restrictions had up to 1941 been
imposed on their activities. They were located
mainly—

(2) In Singapore City, where there were
large business houses, stores, hairdressimg and
photographic establishments, etc.

(6) In Johore, where they owned rubber
and other estates and iron ore mines,

(c) In Trengganu and Kelantan where they
owned large iron ore mines.

(d) In Penang where they carried on similar
activities to those in Singapore.

Although access to the defence areas was
forbidden to the Public and restrictions were
imposed on photography and similar activities,
it was quite impossible to maintain secrecy as
regards the location and the general nature of
the defences being constructed. Moreover, with
such a cosmopolitan population, a Foreign
Power could have little difficulty in obtaining
most of the information it might require, topo-
graphical or otherwise, about Malaya.

86. To sum up, the majority of the Asiatic
population were enjoying the benefits which
British occupation had brought to Malaya.
They had so long been immune from danger
that, even when that danger threatened, they
found difficulty in appreciating its reality and
in bringing themselves to believe that the even
tenor of their lives might in fact be disturbed.

87. As will be appreciated from this brief
review of the civil population of Malaya, the
sense of citizenship was not strong nor, when
it came to the test, was the feeling that this was
a war for home and country. Perhaps more
might have been done by the Government in
pre-war days to develop a sense of responsi-
bility for service to the State in return for the
benefits received from membership of the

{ British Empire.

| 88. Contribution to Imperial Defence.—The
Colony of the Straits Settlements was one of
those which made an annual contribution to
Imperial Defence. In addition to this, the
Straits Settlements, the Federated Malay States
and the Unfederated States of Johore, Kedah
and Kelantan each maintained Local Volunteer
Forces. The Federated Malay States also main-
tained the Malay Regiment and the State of
Johore maintained the Johore Military Forces.
There were also Naval and Air Volunteer
Forces. Among the gifts to Imperial Defence

were the battleship ‘‘ Malaya ’’ given by the
Federated Malay States, the 15 in. Johore
Battery given by the Sultan of Johore and
some armed coastal patrol craft given by the
Straits Settlements.

89. Malaya’s War Role.—Pnor to the out-
break of war with Japan Malaya had been
given a charter for its participation in World
War II. It was to produce the greatest possi-
ble quantities of rubber and tin for the use
of the Alles. This was a factor which had
considerable influence on its preparations for
war.

The Governor and High.Comissioner had
wide powers to enact legislation by orders in
Council.

90. Manpowev.—The subject of the proper
utilization of the available man-power had been
carefully examined in peace-time by a sub-
committee of the Defence Committee Malaya.
It was clear that in time of war as in peace
the Government of the country must be carried
on and that many of the business concerns
must continue to operate. Special war-time
officials would also be required. There was
no leisured or retired class in Malaya which
could be called upon for war-time expansion.

Soon after the outbreak of World War II
the Governor and High Commissioner, under
the powers conferred upon him, ordered that
all European males resident in Malaya should
between certain ages be liable for service in
one of the local volunteer corps. At Singapore
a Controller of Man-Power was appointed in
place of the Man-Power Sub-Committee and in
each Colony and State Man-Power Boards,
on which both civil and military interests were
represented, were set up to consider and give
decisions on, claims for exemption. Many
exemptions had to be granted, even after
allowing for the fact that in many cases
Government and business could be carried on
temporarily with reduced staffs.

No liability to military service was imposed
upon the Asiatic population. Many of the
Asiatics were of a type unsuitable for training
as soldiers and the difficulties of nationality
of registration and of selection would have
been great. Moreover, as already stated, there
were no rifles or other arms available with
which to equip Asiatic units. There was, how-
ever, great difficulty in filling the Chinese sub-
units in the existing Volunteer organization.
This was in no way due to lack of available
material or to lack of effort on the part of
the military authorities. It was due chiefly to
the lack of unity and of ‘forceful leadership
which existed among the Chinese population.

Early in 1941 half the Volunteers were for
the first time called out for a period of two
months continuous training. It was unfortunate
that in April-May labour troubles, involving the
calling out of troops, developed on some of the
estates in the Selangor and Negri Sembilan area
and at the Batu Arang coal mines. This was
imputed in some quarters to the absence of
European officials at the training camps. At
the instance of Government the calling out of
the remainder of the Volunteers was postponed
to a later date. It never in fact took place. |

In Singapore and other large cities Local
Defence Corps were formed. They were trained
in the use of small arms, but ,their role was
