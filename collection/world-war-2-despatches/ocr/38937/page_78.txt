strength should be sufficient to reach the San- .

terno river and, possibly, secure bridgeheads
across it. An offensive with this object in view
was to be launched on 21st November, as
already provided for, and it was estimated that
it would hardly have reached its objective
before the first week in December.* This deter-
mined the timing for Fifth Army. By 5th
December it would have completed its pro-
gramme for the relief, rest and training of the
four American infantry divisions in II Corps;
13 Corps had only been able to rotate their
forces so that only a limited offensive effort
‘could be called for from them. American
artillery ammunition was sufficient for not
more than about fifteen days’ full-scale
offensive operations. In view of that fact
and the other considerations which made
it inevitable that this should be the last
major offensive before the spring of 1945 it was
essential that every chance should be calculated
to ensure its success and I directed that the
actual timing of the offensive, which would be
some date after 7th December, must be de-
pendent on the weather and, if necessary, it
must be postponed until the weather was
propitious. :

The outline plan was as follows. Eighth
Army was to develop its present operations so
as to reach the line of the Santerno, and, if
possible, secure bridgeheads across it, as early
as enemy resistance and the weather permitted.
Fifth Army was to prepare to carry out an offen-
sive with all available resources up Route 65
‘and to co-operate with Eighth Army by an
attack from the Monte Grande position against

Castel San Pietro, on Route 9 south-east of ,

Bologna. The plan and proposed timings were
agreed at an Army Commanders’ conference in
Florence on 26th November. Orders for the
operation were issued on 28th November. The
second paragraph showed the reasons for the
offensive as I have already described them; my
intention was ‘‘ To afford the greatest possible
support to the Allied winter offensive on the
Western and Eastern fronts by bringing the
enemy to battle, thereby compelling him to em-
ploy in Italy manpower and resources which
might otherwise be available for use on the
other fronts.’’

Before these plans could be carried into opera-
tion I was appointed, on 12th December,
Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediter-
ranean Theatre. General Mark Clark took over
from me the tactical direction of the two
Armies with a small operational staff under the
name, revived for the purpose, ‘of Fifteenth
Army Group. Headquarters, Allied Armies in
Italy, was disbanded; part came with me to
Allied Force Headquarters and part, ‘in particu-
lar the operations and intelligence staff, went
to General Clark’s headquarters. I should like
to express here my appreciation of the work of
my staff throughout the campaign. This narra-
tive will have made it clear that our successes
were never won by force of numbers, never
by a simple marshalling of overwhelming
resources, but always by stratagems, secret
concentrations and surprise moves. It is the
task of the Commander-in-Chief to think out
the broad lines of such a strategy but it is for his

he would probably only be on the Senio ; a fresh break
in the weather was the main factor which helped to
prove him right.

staff to evolve the detailed orders and artange-
ments -which will carry his conception into
effect. In this my staff, headed by General
Harding and his American deputy, General
Lemnitzer,* thoroughly fulfilled: all demands
made on them and ensured the smooth work-
ing of a complicated and intricate machine.
This achievement was the more remarkable as
the staff was composed in almost equal pro-
portions of representatives of two different
nationalities, This is an extraordinary fact to
which, in my opinion, too little attention has
been paid. It might have been expected, on a
“ realistic ’’ view of human nature, that a
mixed headquarters of this nature command-
ing a mixed group of Armies would tend to split
in its approach to day to day operational prob-
lems on national lines, a British staff officer
favouring, even if only subconsciously, the
Eighth Army’ and an American staff officer,
similarly, the Fifth Army. Nothing of this~
kind occurred. All branches and all indivi-
duals worked as parts of one integrated
machine, loyal to the common cause and, I
take justified pride in claiming, to their
Commander-in-Chief,

My administrative staff was headed: by
General Robertson: whose ‘experience’ in
this vitally important branch of the military art
reached back to‘the early days of Abyssinia
and the. Western Desert. I have referred from
time to time in the earlier parts of my Des-
patch to various particular difficulties which
faced us in the supply of our troops in
Italy and if I-have not referred to these prob-
Jems since then it is because so firm a founda-
tion had [been laid down that subsequent prob-
Jems were solved almost automatically by the
existing organisation. The proverb calls that
land happy which has no history and certainly |
an administrative machine can ‘be known to be ©
working at its best when nothing is heard of
it either for good or evil. It must not be
imagined that the basic and penmanent difficul-
ties of the Italian scene were abolished; the
blocked and mined ports, the demolished roads
and bridges, the railway lines torn up by
special machines, all these remained and pre-
sented a yet more difficult appearance as the
Germans grew more: experienced at the work
of destruction. The merit of the administrative
staff is that they took them in their stride and
the proof is that, instead of recounting a series
of achievements, it is only necessary to record
that operations were never hamstrung and
operational ‘plans never radically altered
because of any administrative considerations.

For the faultless working of the operational

and administrative machinery the achieve-
ments already recorded will provide sufficient
evidence. The successes of military intelligence

have appeared less frequently and from their
very nature they are much more difficult to
record; there is also the diffi that that
nature is very widely misunderstood by a public
whose mind, especially in wartime, is occupied
by stories true or false of spies and secret

mts. In actual fact espionage can never
play anything but the most minor réle in mili-
tary intelligence and certainly in Italy it pro- |
duced no information of any importance.
Military Intelligence is a more prosaic affair,
dependent on an efficient machine for the
collection and evaluation of every sort of item
