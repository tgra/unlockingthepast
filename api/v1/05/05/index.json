In view of this, arrangements were put in hand to assemble in Palestine a small mechanized force of all arms, which at that time was all that could be spared. This force consisted of an incomplete mechanised cavalry brigade, a field regiment less one troop, three squadrons Trans-Jordan Frontier Force and Ist Bn. The Essex Regiment; it arrived at Habbaniya on 18th May."

            "description": "rx. The first hostile move by the Iraq forces occurred on 30th April, when two infantry brigades of the Iraq Army, supported by Artillery and some armoured cars, began concentrating around Habbaniya and training their guns on the Camp, thereby constituting a direct threat to the British Cantonment there. A demand for the withdrawal of these troops was refused by the Iraqi Commander, who stated that no normal training was to be carried out from Habbaniya, and that fire would be opened on aircraft or troops leaving the Camp. Hostilities broke out on 2nd May and the Royal Air Force station was shelled inter- mittently until 5th May. The Camp was also bombed and machine-gunned by the Iraqi Air Force. The Royal Air Force bombed the Iraqi Positions gcoring many direct hits on their guns, armoured cars and machine gun posts. During this period also the Royal Air Force, despite the fact that the aerodrome was often under heavy fire, successfully evacuated by air to Basra a large number of women and children, who had been sent from Baghdad to Habbaniya when the situation at the former place became threatening. (The remainder of the British population of Baghdad were accom- modated either in the British Embassy or the American Legation throughout the period of Operations.)"

If this force was despatched to Iraq, there would be no possi- bility of providing a force for Syria should the needarise. The Chiefs of Staff accepted this con- clusion and took the responsibility of ordering this force to be sent to Iraq. Accordingly, I made up a motorised column consisting of the 4th Cavalry Brigade, under Brigadier Kingstone (Household Cavalry Regiment, Wiltshire Yeomanry, Warwickshire Yeomanry), 60th Field Regiment, R.A., from Egypt and ist Essex Regiment. The whole force was placed under the command of Major-General J. G. W. Clark, the Commander of the rst Cavalry Divi- sion. The Arab Legion, a military police force enlisted in Transjordan from Bedouin Arabs, also accompanied the force and gave invaluable assistance."

On 4th May xst Gold Coast Regiment supported by artillery attacked two prominent hills which were strongly held by the enemy. A.F.V.s were sent up an old Abyssinian track to support the flank attack by 2nd Gold Coast R\u00e9giment but could make little progress. Later in the after- noon 2nd Gold Coast Regiment came in.on the enemy\u2019s left rear and by 5th May had cut the toad behind the position. The enemy however still held his main positions and it was not until roth May that he was finally driven from them on the two hills.

            "description": "At 0415 hours on 4th May, 2gth Indian In- fantry Brigade moved forward to the attack supported by all available artillery. The attack went with great dash and speed, capturing Pinacle and Elephant Hill. Beyond this the ridge narrows and is devoid of cover, all approaches being commanded by machine- guns from Bald Hill, and other prominent features. The maps had given no indication of the exceeding steepness and narrowness of the tidge beyond Elephant, Further advance in daylight was impossible. At o4r5 hours on 5th May, the attack was resumed and Middle Hill was captured. Between Middle Hill and Little Alagi the ridge again narrows to a razor- back about 150 yds. wide, wired, flanked by precipices and under machine-gun fire. I Worcesters reached, and at one place went through, the wire, but became pinned and could not move in daylight. Middle Hill was consolidated and the Worcesters were with- drawn to this area on the night 5/6th May. 2oth Indian Infantry Brigade was now definitely checked."

In order to induce the Italians to surrender a message was dropped from the air over Bender Cassim on 5th May calling for an envoy to be sent to Carin on 6th May. As .the aircraft performing this task met no opposition, a second aircraft landed and immediate negotia- tions were made with the Residente for the surrender of the post. The column reached Bender Cassim on 6th May, and 67 Italians, of whom 50 were naval military or government employees, were collected together with their arms."

In view of the complete disarm- ing of the city there were no major incidents. Considerable credit was due to Brigadier M. S.

It had arrived in North Africa at the end of April from the United States and was originally assigned to Allied Force Headquarters but one Regimental Combat Team was ordered to Italy, artiving at Anzio on rst June; the re- mainder of the division joined Fifth Army after the fall of Rome. 1 British Armoured Division, which was expected to arrive in June, could not in fact be brought over from North Africa until July."

The programme of reliefs, in particular the move of ro Indian Division from the Middle East, was taking a little longer than was expected and we now estimated that it should be possible to complete all preparations by 3rd to 5th May. I had originally calculated that, in order to give the best support to the western invasion, our attack should precede it by fifteen to twenty-one days; I was unaware at the time of the date chosen for OVERLORD but I was given to understand that a date for our attack in early May would suit General Eisenhower. It would also suit well with the phases of the moon. For the sake of troop movements at night it is always most useful to have a good moon and it would be full on 8th May. I eventually decided on a tentative D-day of roth May. :"

            "description": "67. The Race for Kalewa.\u2014The operations had now developed into a race with the enemy for the possession of Kalewa. A warning was sent to General Wakely at Kalewa to establish local protection and to block the river approaches As a result of this, a boom was constructed across the Chindwin to the south of Shwegyin and the detachment of Royal Marines, which had done such good work on the Irrawaddy, was despatched with Breda guns to cover this obstruction. G.H.Q. India were also requested to order air attacks on enemy craft moving up the Chindwin. I learned later that such attacks were made on the 3rd or 4th May and I have no doubt that they imposed considerable delay on the enemy\u2019s advance up the river. There was also the possibility that the enemy might land at some point short of Kalewa and cut in on the Ye-U\u2014Kalewa road. The most likely point for this to happen was at Maukkadaw from which place a chaung gave easy access to the road at Pyingyaing. A detachment of the Bush Warfare School, reinforced by British infantry from the depot at Maymyo, was therefore sent to Maukkadaw. This detachment was later reinforced by two companies of Gurkhas. At this time I assumed that the 1 Indian Infantry Brigade was moving from Palel to Kalewa and I requested G.H.Q. India to hasten this movement, as I still had reason to believe that a Japanese force was advancing on Kalemyo via the Myittha Valley. I learned on 5th May that x Indian Infantry Bngade would not move into Burma, as it was not considered possible to maintain it in Kalewa, in addition to the troops from Burma that would also be in that area."
