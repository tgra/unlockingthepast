Air attacks, against which my force had no defence, complicated the operation. However disembarkation of the first flight of the force was completed on the evening of 16th April."

From the gth to 16th April, when the battle raged at full intensity, the Tactical medium fbombers were able to devote little attention to their customary railway targets; from the latter date until the 27th (when bad weather grounded the mediums for the rest of the month) the offensive was continued against Brenner line targets and a smaller effort was directed against the north-eastern routes and two bridges in southern Austria and northwest Jugoslavia. The total sorties flown by the Tactical mediums during  April against railway communications amounted to 1,374 in the course of which 2,688 tons of bombs were dropped. Seventy-seven per cent. of these sorties were flown against Brenner line targets. Results of the interdiction policy during April."

As the enemy was forced from his front line positions, the distribution of his forces became increasingly disorganised, and it became difficult, therefore, to brief fighter-bomber pilots concerning their targets before take-off. In these conditions, briefing in the air by advanced mobile operations sections  Rovers  paid rich dividends. Of D.A.F.'s effort on the 16th April, of 800 sorties on close support targets, two-thirds were directed iby   forward"

As rain had already commenced falling it was decided to abandon the Aselle road and transfer the 22nd Brigade effort to the Moggo-Adamitullo road where it was hoped the going was better. Steps were taken to repair the bridges blown by the enemy on that road, and by 24th April 22nd Brigade were advancing south of Ponte Machi."

It was now apparent to me that I had not enough troops to carry out my first intention of both advancing on Gimma and, by pressure from both divisions advancing north and south, clearing the enemy out of the area of the Great Lakes south of Addis Abeba. I considered that of the two objectives, if only one were to be carried out, the latter was the more important. The troops at Sciasciamanna were a constant threat to my L. of C. at Moggio and Adama, and it would be a great advantage to me also to have a through road via Neghelli from Kenya. I therefore ordered 11th (A) Division to concentrate on attacking Sciasciamanna, and rath (A) Division to advance on Dalle and Hula. For this latter purpose I relieved the Commander and two battalions of 24th G.C. Brigade, who- were restoring order in Italian Somaliland, by garrison battalions, and on 16th April sent them to 12th (A) Division."

The remaining nine ships, with most of the escort, continued their  passage. .The delay had probably disorganis d to some extent the German arrangements for attack, but the convoy was sighted by enemy aircraft on 13th April and attacked by U-boats east of Bear Island on 16th April, one ship being sunk."
