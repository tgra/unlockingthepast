This Despatch covers the operations in Burma and North-East India between the 16th November, 1943, the date on which the Supreme Allied Commander,* South-East Asia, assumed responsibility from the India Command, and the 22nd June, 1944, the date on which our lines of communication from Manipur Road (Dimapur) to Imphal were reopened, after the defeat of the Japanese forces at Kohima. By this date, also, the enemy had been cleared from the area north of Kamaing, Mogaung and Myitkyina by the ChineseAmerican forces under General Stilwell,t and a re-adjustment of our dispositions to meet monsoon conditions had been made in Arakan. Thus a definite phase of the campaign may be said to have ended. The Despatch also gives an account of the administrative situation and certain major changes in our organization during the period."
