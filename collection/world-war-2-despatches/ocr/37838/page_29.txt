277. The other four attacks by heavy
bombers were generally based on the same
principle of destroying the enemy strongpoints,
and cratering given areas to prevent the enemy
from attacking the flanks of our forces while
they were advancing through the swept but
relatively undamaged centre of the assault area.

278. The third of the large scale attacks
involving heavy bombers was launched on 25th
July, when 1,495 heavy bombers and 388
fighter bombers of the United States Eighth

and Ninth Air Forces dropped 4,790 tons of .

bombs in a bombardment preliminary to an
advance by elements of the First United States
Army across the Periers—St. Lo highway.
Unfortunately some of the bombs in this attack
fell short and caused some casualties to our
own ground forces in the area.

279. The fourth attack was in support of the
Second British Army south of Caumont. The
preliminary heavy air bombardment was
launched early on 30th July and 693 heavy
bombers of R.A.F. Bomber Command and
over 500 light and medium bombers of
A.E.A.F, dropped 2,227 tons of bombs.

280. The fifth attack assisted the advance of
the First Canadian Army along the Caen-
Falaise road on the night of 7-8th August and
during the succeeding day. 1,450 heavy
bombers of the United States Eighth Air Force
and of R.A.F. Bomber Command, and fighter
bombers of the Second Tactical Air Force
dropped 5,210 tons of bombs on enemy installa-
tions, strong points and forces in the area of the
advance.

281. The sixth attack, also by R.A.F.
Bomber Command, took place on the morning
of 14th August and assisted the Canadian forces
to advance into Falaise. 811 bombers were
employed and 3,723 tons of bombs were
dropped in the attack. Again, in this operation,
some of the bombs fell short of the targets caus-
ing casualties to our own ground forces.

282. In each case, the ground forces were able
to move into the bombarded positions practi-
cally without opposition. That they failed to
exploit fully the break-through is known, but
there are doubtless many reasons for this
failure. In the second attack, the principal
cause of delay was the bottleneck across the
Caen bridges which delayed the moving of
armoured formations sufficiently long to enable
the enemy to remount his screen of guns out-
side the area which had been bombed. In the
third attack, the Army Commander agreed that
the ‘‘carpet’’ bombing did put his troops
through the enemy positions; difficulties which
arose in moving the army forces forward as
tapidly as was necessary again prevented a
complete exploitation. Nevertheless, these
heavy attacks did finally succeed in starting off
the break-through of the ground forces across
the Periers-St. Lo highway, and it was this
‘break-through which eventually determined the
battle of Normandy, which liberated France,

283. I have referred to the lessons learned
from this series of attacks in close support in
Part V of this Despatch. From an air point of
view, the attacks definitely proved that satura-
tion bombing by heavy bombers on a narrow
front can enable an army to break through, but
they also showed the need for the army to ex-
ploit, without delay, the favourable situation
created. Further, the heartening moral effect

of these large scale air support formations on
our own forces and the corresponding shatter-
ing of the will to resist among the enemy has
been stated by Army Commanders to have been
of vital consequence. Air and land action must
be closely co-ordinated. The land forces must
be ready to step off at least immediately the
bombing is over, if not just before, accepting
some slight risk of casualties from our bombing,
and the artillery programme must be directly
related to the bombing plan to ensure economy
of effort by both arms.

284. Pre-arranged Close Support by Medium
and Fighter Bombers.—The operation of
medium and fighter bombers on pre-arranged
support was often in small formations against
targets such as gun positions, tank laagers,
chateaux suspected of housing headquarters
formations, and defended positions. The effec-
tiveness of the support may be judged from the
following extract from a captured document :—

‘* C.-in-C. West (Von Kluge) in a report to
General Warlimont, Hitler’s representative,
on the position at Avranches says—
‘ Whether the enemy can be stopped at this
point is still questionable. The enemy air
superiority is terrific, and smothers almost
all of our movements. Every movement of
the enemy, however, is prepared and pro-
tected by its air forces. Losses in men and
equipment are extraordinary. The morale
of the troops has suffered very heavily under
constant murderous enemy fire.’ ’’

285. Immediate Support.The immediate
support of the armies was provided by the
fighter bombers of the tactical air forces and
in this role the fighter bombers have shown their
greatest effectiveness. Never before have they
been used in such strength and with such
decisive results. I have divided my review of
their operations in the following paragraphs into
four phases of the land battle, as follows:—

(i) The period of static fighting.

(ii) The break-through of the Allied
armies.

(iii) The period of encirclement.

(iv) The retreat across Northern France
and Belgium.

286. In the early period of the operations of
offensive fighter and fighter bomber forces, the
co-operation between the Commander of the
United States IXth Tactical Air Command,
General Quesada, and the Air Officer Command-
ing No. 83 Group, Royal Air Force, Air Vice-
Marshal Broadhurst, C.B., D.S.O., D.F.C.,
A.F.C., was close and effective. Each gave
the other assistance as the occasion arose and
whenever a good target presented itself, neither
hesitated to call on the other to take advantage
of it. The development of common methods of
control and target indication and reference
greatly assisted this British and United States
mutual support.

287. Period of Static Fighting. —During this
phase of the land battle, the tactical air forces
concentrated upon the cloge support of the
armies within the tactical boundary. The
technique of this form of support was con-
siderably developed. A system of Visual
Control Points was perfected by which an ex-
perienced fighter controller rode in one of the
leading tanks, equipped with the mecescary
V.H.F. radio-telephony equipment for the con-
trol of fighter aircraft. By these means an extra-
