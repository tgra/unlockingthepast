SUPPLEMENT ro tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 1048

the strength of the and Armoured Brigade was
now so low that it could not oppose more than
twenty-five German tanks with any hope of
success. It fortunately was not put to the test,
since the enemy kept his main forces round
Msus while pressing the pursuit of the 4th
Indian Division. But the weakness of our
armour made it necessary to retire rather more
swiftly than had been intended, and, having
obtained General Ritchie’s permission, General
Tuker withdrew to Gaf Tartaga and Slonta
during the night of the 31st January.

The 4th Indian Division then reverted to the
command of the 13th Corps. General Godwin-
Austen was preparing fo stand on the line Lam-
luda—Mechili—Bir Tengeder, but intended, in
the event of an enemy attack in force, to retire
to a line running southwards from Gazala,
and, if need be, to a line running south from
Acroma. He had ordered the 1st South African
Division to prepare defensive positions imme-

- diately south of Gazala.
On the 1st February the enemy columns,
. which until then had only felt their way, made
contact with the 11th Indian Infantry Brigade
at Slonta. General Tuker had previously
obtained permission to withdraw further to
Cirene and El Faidia, and the qth Indian
Division retired to that line without delay. At
El Faidia the rth Indian Infantry Brigade was
once more heavily attacked by lorried. infantry
and suffered a number of casualties, but held
its ground. The 4th Indian Division completed
its withdrawal to the Derna line during the same
night.

There was every sign that the enemy was
intending to follow our retirement through the
Gebel in considerable force, and a fresh assess-
ment of the enemy’s supply situation revealed
that it was much better than we had supposed
and that he might shortly be ‘able to send an
armoured division to attack us at Mechili. As
our own armoured forces had been so reduced,
it was decided not to invite disaster by attempt-
ing to stand on a line which would require
more troops and armour than we possessed to
hold it against attack on the scale that now
seemed probable. It would be better to place
more distance between the enemy and ourselves

and to secure a line which was shorter and,

easier to defend. Accordingly orders were given
for Derna to be evacuated and the installations
there to be demolished, and for a general
deliberate withdrawal to the line of Gazala and
Bir Hacheim. Derna, Mechili and Bir Tengeder
were, however, to be held as outposts from
which mobile columns were to operate.

The enemy pressed on along both roads
through the Gebel on the 2nd-February, but our
offensive patrols held him up whilst the main
body of the Indian Division completed the
occupation of the Derna line. Later in the day,
however, our troops were forced off their posi-
tions in the centre of the line and a detachment
at Carmusa was overrun by a force of tanks
and jorried infantry using captured transport.
As the enemy were penetrating between the 4th
Division and our troops round Mechili, General
Godwin-Austen gave permission to General
Tuker to withdraw on Tmimi and E] Ezzeiat at
this discretion, while Free French mobile
columns struck at the enemy forces moving
south from Carmusa. Shortly after, since the
pressure on the 4th Indian Division was increas-
ing, General Godwin-Austen gave orders for the
withdrawal to be accelerated and to contipue by

352

daylight on the 3rd February. The 4th Indian
Division having fought several rearguard actions
during the day reached Acroma that night.

. Except for sending patrols forward, the enemy
pressed the withdrawal no further and made no
move across the desert from Msus. By
‘the 4th February all our forces had fallen back
to the Gazala line. ‘

During the withdrawal the xst Armoured

Division lost over one hundred tanks out of an
original total of about one hundred and fifty,
thirty field guns, thirty two-pounder anti-tank
guns and twenty-five Bofors light anti-aircraft
guns. The enemy’s losses do not appear to have
been heavy, but about thirty of his tanks were
probably destroyed. The number of tanks the
enemy employed in these operations is difficult
to determine, as reports of his tank strength
varied greatly, but it is probable that he did not
employ more than one hundred, some of them
certainly light tanks. The number of tanks
employed forward of Msus and Bengasi was
considerably less than in the initial stages,
owing no doubt to difficulties of supply.
» When the withdrawal of the Eighth Army
came to an end, the Gazala—Bir Hacheim line
was not held in great strength. The rst South
African Infantry Brigade held positions round
Gazala and to’ the south of it, and was about to
be reinforced by the Pol:ish Brigade Group on
its left above the escarpment. The Free French
Brigade Group held Alem Hamza. Bir
Hacheim was occupied by the 150th Brigade
Group and the Guards Brigade. The rst
Armoured Division was watching the gap
between Alem Hamza and Bir Hacheim with
orders to counter-attack any enemy who might
penetrate the position. The 4th Indian Division
was given orders to prepare defences on a line
through Eluet et Tamar. and Er Rigel and
thence southwards, to give depth to the Gazala
position. 2

Having regard to the weakness of our armour,
I was doubtful, when I returned to Cairo on the
ist February, whether the Eighth Army would
be able to hold this line. If the enemy came
forward again, it might well be necessary to
withdraw to the frontier where I had given
orders for positions to be prepared, But I found
on my return that our own prospects of
te-equipping the Army with tanks were better
than I had supposed and that the enemy’s
supply situation might not permit him to
advance further. On the 2nd February, there-
fore, I ordered General Ritchie* to stand at
Gazala so as to preserve Tobruk as a forward
supply base for the renewal of our offensive.

Fortification and Re-organisation.

"As soon as I had decided that Tobruk was to
be held and the enemy stopped on the Gazala—
Bir Hacheim line, General Ritchie began to
plan and construct a series of strong defensive
positions in the triangle lying between Gazala,
Tobruk and Bir Hacheim. The Gazala line
itself consisted of a series of strongpointsextend-
ing from about Gazala to Alem Hamza; a
detached strongpoint some twenty miles south
of the coast near Sidi Muftah; and a second
detached strongpoint at Bir Hacheim. The
positions in the north were mutually supporting
and well covered by minefields. They were so
sited as to bar the direct approach to Tobruk
