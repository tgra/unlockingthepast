SUPPLEMENT to tue LONDON GAZETTE, 11 AUGUST, 1948

46. Surprise.—Our attempt to pass the
convoy into the Mediterranean without the
'+  enemy’s knowledge resulted in a very compli-

cated fuelling programme during dark hours _

at Gibraltar in the days preceding D.1. Opera-
\ tion ‘‘ Berserk,’’ invaluable in itself, was a
further source of embarrassment from the fuel-
ling point of view. With the efficient intelli-
gence service which it appears the enemy now
has in the Gibraltar area it may be argued that
the small chance of effecting any surprise is
not worth the complications and difficulties of
attempting to do so. I think, however, it
would be wrong to take this line. Until the
j enemy’s Teconnaissance forces actually see us
\n the Mediterranean he cannot be sure his
intelligence is correct, and any uncertainty we
can create in his mind must be all to our
benefit. i

47. It would, however, be better, if circum-
stances permitted, to carry out the necessary
and invaluable aircraft carrier co-operation
exercise further away, preferably ‘north of
Treland, on another occasion.

48. Re-fuelling destroyers on D.2.—The re-
fuelling of CAIRO and 24 destroyers between
o600 and 2030 on D.2 was an accomplishment
tedounding very greatly to the- credit of
“BROWN RANGER and DINGLEDALE. But

the Masters of these ships-would be the first to
4 admit that fortune favoured us. The weather
/ was good and a light easterly wind enabled the
»' desired course to be maintained whilst fuelling
‘ was in progress.

Such fortune cannot be expected on all occa-
sions, more particularly in winter months, and
the failure or partial failure of fuelling plans
y must be provided for.

49. Furthermore one must always have in
mind the possibility of the oiler(s) being
damaged or sunk by enemy action Hitherto
the oilers have borne a charmed life, though
on this occasion they experienced alarms on

j account of both enemy aircraft and submarines.

50. Co-operation by other Commands.—
Information I received showed that part of the
enemy’s air forces which attacked the fleet on

 D.2 and D.3 were operating from Trapani and

* recently had been based at Heraklon. It
seems probable, therefore, that the enemy
moved some air squadrons from Greece, and
possibly also from Crete, for the occasion.

51. The diversionary convoy from Haifa and -

Port Said was planned by Commander-in-Chief,

Mediterranean, with a view to dissuading the

enemy from any such re-disposition of his air

forces, and I had hoped that the Army would
:f have helped to further this end by staging an

attack in Egypt. In this hope I
disappointed.

was

52. The attacks on: Sardinian .and” Sicilian
aerodromes by bomber forces from Malta and
Egypt were valuable contributions to our plan
ane it is believed they achieved effective
results.

53. The losses suffered by Force F were
regrettably heavy and the number of merchant
ships which reached ‘Malta disappointingly

small. But I have no fault to find with the
personnel of the fleet because better results were
not achieved. Qn the contrary, Commanding
Officers, generally, have praised the fine bearing
and spirit shown by their ships’ companies,

many of whom were very young and to whiom’

battle was a new experience. I am proud to
associate myself with these tributes, and in
particular give credit to those whose duties
kept them below decks during submarine, air
and E-Boat attacks.

54. The constant A/S vigilance shown by the
destroyers under the leadership of Captain R.
M. J. Hutton (Captain (D), 19th Destroyer
Flotilla) and Acting Captain R. J. Onslow
(Captain (D), 6th Destroyer Flotilla) for a
period extending over 14 days is deserving of
much praise. It is true that the submarine
which sank H.M.S. EAGLE was undetected but
I am very sure that their watchfulness foiled
many another attack. _ 4

55. That 27 emergency turns were made on

+ passage to the Straits and 48 during D.1, D.2and

D.3, consequent on warnings given by the A/S
screen, is an illustration of the value of their
work. Besides this, their defence of the fleet
against torpedo bomber attack was so success-
ful that only one torpedo bomber aircraft
managed to get past them.

56. The work of the aircraft carriers (H.M.S.
INDOMITABLE, Captain T. H. Troubridge,

- and H.M.S. VICTORIOUS, Captain H. C.

Bovell) under the command of Rear-Admiral
Lyster, was excellently performed, while that
of their fighters was magnificent. Flying at
great heights, constantly chasing the faster JU.
88s, warning the fleet of approaching forma-
tions, breaking up the latter, and in the later
stages doing their work in the face of superior
enemy fighter forces, they were grand. The fact
that 39 certainties were shot down by them and
the probability that at least the same number
were incapacitated is a remarkable measure of
the success of the carriers, their teamwork and
their fighters and of the able and inspiring
leadership of Rear-Admiral A. L. St. G. Lyster,
C.B., C.V.O., D.S.O.

57. Tribute has been paid to the personnel
of H.M. Ships but both officers and men will
desire to give first place to the conduct, courage
and determination of the Masters, officers and
men of the merchant ships. The steadfast
manner in which these ships pressed on their
way to Malta through all attacks, answering
every manceuvring order like a well trained
fleet unit, was a most inspiring sight. Many
of these fine men and their ships were lost but
the memory of their conduct will remain’ an
inspiration to all who were privileged to sail
with them.

58. The task of Force X was always difficult
and hazardous. Unhappily a serious disaster
befell them almost at once and heavily tipped
the scales in favour of the enemy. Neverthe-
less they continued undaunted and determined,
and fighting their way through many and heavy
attacks by U-Boats, E-Boats and aircraft, they
delivered five of their charges to Malta and then
fought their way back to Gibraltar. In doing
this they showed a display of fortitude and
