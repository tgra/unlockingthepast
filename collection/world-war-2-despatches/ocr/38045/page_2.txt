8. A further point which was very clearly
shown, is the strength of the German defensive
system in the coastal regions, which confronts
assaulting troops with the problem not dis-
similar to that of the Western Front in the last
war. Arising out of this is the need for
far more effective methods of supporting the
troops, unless it is quite certain that defences
which dominate the landing places cam be over-
run by a surprise night assault. The methods
whereby effective support can be given are not
considered to include night bombing.

g. From the purely naval point of view the
operation has taught us less, if only because
the passage and landings went very largely
according to plan. Although this was so, it is
considered that the liberties that were taken in
dispersing the force so widely on passage with
so small a covering force, could not prudently
be repeated. For example, the groups which
sailed from Newhaven were vulnerable to
attack from the east, and the L.S.Is. (Infantry
Assault Ships) were exposed to a considerable
tisk from the time that they stopped to lower
their boats until they returned to the English
side of the Channel. The conclusion is that a
substantially larger covering force should be
employed in the future, because the enemy is
less likely to be surprised again.

ro, The Naval Forces were fortunate in as
much as they sustained no damage from mines
and no serious damage from coastal batteries.
Until more experience is gained, however, it
would be most unsafe to draw too firm a deduc-
tion from this for future operations.

Ir. The operation was interesting also as
being perhaps the first occasion on which light
naval forces (i.e., coastal craft and landing
craft) manned almost entirely by the Royal
Naval Volunteer Reserve, have been employed
on a large scale and under conditions of
extreme difficulty. They acquitted themselves
well, but the small leavening of experienced
officers of the Royal Navy who were employed
in positions of control was an important factor
in the results achieved.

12. I consider that the chief lessons of the
operation are: —

(i) It was shown still to be possible to
achieve tactical surprise in a cross-channel
operation of some magnitude.

(ii} The comparatively small naval forces
which took part in the operation sufficed to
prevent the enemy from offering any surface
opposition whatever, apart from that resulting
from the chance encounter of Number 5
Group with German armed trawlers.

(iii) If it should be necessary to attempt
a frontal attack on strongly defended enemy
positions again, it will be essential to provide
far more effective means of supporting the
troops. In this particular operation I am
satisfied that a capital ship could have been
operated in the Dieppe area during the first
two or three hours of the operation without
undue risk.

(iv) The enormous possibilities of this type
of operation for bringing about a decisive air
battle were demonstrated.

13. Finally I venture to submit that, should
it be decided to undertake further operations of
this nature in the near future, my Staff and I
may be afforded the opportunity to carry them
out. While realising the force of the arguments

first-hand experience. While every effort has
been made to record the lessons we have learned,
there is so much which cannot be set forth on
paper and which can only be properly grasped.

personal experience.

The Passage.

I. Generally speaking the assembly of the
force and the passage were carried out in
accordance with the plan and without any
major incident. After clearing the gate H.M.S.
QUEEN EMMA (Captain G. L. D. Gibbs,
D.S.0., R.N.(Ret.)) leading Groups 1, 2 and
3, appeared to me to be proceeding at an
excessive speed, and H.M.S. CALPE (Lieut.-
Commander J. H. Wallace, R.N.) and the
destroyers thad some difficulty in taking
station ahead. At oor6 when H.M.S. CALPE
was abeam of H.M.S. QUEEN EMMA a signal
was made informing her that she was ahead
of station and instructing her to reduce to 18
knots. After this the destroyers formed ahead,
and shortly afterwards altered course for the
Western passage through the minefield. The
Dan Buoys and the M.L, marking the entrance
to this channel were only sighted about 2
minutes before H.M.S. CALPE entered the
channel, no signals from the type 78 Beacon
being received on account of a breakdown of
H.M.S, CALPE’S R.D.F.* However, H.M.S.
CALPE and the destroyers of the 2nd Division
successfully passed through the Western
channel, but H.M.S. QUEEN EMMA with
Groups 1, 2 and 3 in company, lost touch
with the destroyers and passed through the
Eastern channel, overtaking H.M.S. FERNIE
(Lieut. W. B. Willett, R.N.) and certain
groups of L.C.Ts.f and L.C.Ps.f but
fortunately without any collisions.

2. A word of praise is due to the 9th and
13th Minesweeping Flotillas (Commander H. T.
Rust, R.N. and Commander L. S. J. Ede,
D.S.O., R.N.) who carried out the task allotted
to them with efficiency and precision.

3. After passing through the minefield
H.M.S. CALPE stopped in accordance with
the plan, and subsequently ‘signalled her
position to H.M.S. QUEEN EMMA, H.M.S.
PRINCE ALBERT (Lieut-Commander H. B.
Peate, R.N.R.) and H.M.S. GLENGYLE
(Captain D. S. McGrath, R.N.), as these vessels
respectively came in sight. H.M.S. CALPE
then proceeded and stopped about one mile to
seaward of the position in which H.M.S.
GLENGYLE with Group 4 had stopped to
lower their boats.

4. At about 0350 gun fire was observed to
the E.S.E. which it was realised must be in
the immediate vicinity of Group 5. At the
time I considered this might be caused by an
E-boat attack, but with the knowledge that
