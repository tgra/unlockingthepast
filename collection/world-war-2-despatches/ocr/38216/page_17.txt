SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

allotted to the Dutch and British respectively
were; —

Dutch: Kuantan - Gr.Natunas - Kuching
(British Borneo).

British: Kota Bahru-Southern tip of Indo-
China-Gr.Natunas-Kuantan.

An extension of the reconnaissance area into
the Gulf of Siam as part of routine reconnais-
sance was not possible owing to a shortage of
aircraft.

The task of executing the British section of
the reconnaissance plan was allotted to Nos. 1
and 8 (GR) Squadrons, R.A.A.F., based on
Kota Bahru and Kuantan respectively. Their
effort was reinforced by Catalinas of No. 205
(FB) Squadron to fill in gaps and to ensure
overlapping the Dutch.

The initiation of the full reconnaissance plan
cancelled the special reconnaissance which had
been carried out hitherto, and involved the
movement of No. 8 (GR) Squadron, R.A.A.F.
from Sembawang to Kuantan. Owing to lack
of transport aircraft and inadequate land com-
munications, the ground personnel and equip-
ment of this squadron proceeded there by sea.

Reconnaissance period 4th-6ih December,
1941.

149. On the qth December, owing to bad
weather, aircraft at Kota Bahru (No. 1 (GR)
Squadron, R.A.A.F.) were unable to operate,
but those at Kuantan (No. 8 (GR) Squadron,
R.A.A F.) carried out their part in the recon-
naissance plan, as did the Dutch, with nothing
to report. Reports of the ‘sightings of strange
submarines in the reconnaissance area had
been received, so a special reconnaissance was
carried out by No. 60 (B) Squadron from-
Kuantan; but it was negative. On this day a
Catalina took Admiral Sir Tom Phillips,
Commander-in-Chief Eastern Fleet, to Manila.

On 5th December, 1941, bad weather still
prevented No. x (GR) Squadron, R.A.A.F., at
Kota Bahru operating, but again the Dutch
Reconnaissance Group and No. 8 (GR).Squad-
ron, R.A.A.F , at Kuantan gave negative re-
ports. On this day a special anti-submarine
patrol was maintained by three Vildebeestes
ahead of H.M S. ‘‘ Repulse ’’ which proceeded
at slow speed en route from Singapore to
Australia.

On the 6th December, 1941, three crews were
despatched to Sourabaya to collect three Cata-
linas loaned by the Dutch. The anti-submarine
patrol in co-operation with H.M.S. ‘‘ Repulse ”’
was also maintained.

First sighting of Japanese Expedition—6th
December, 1941.

150. On December 6th Kota Bahru aero-
drome was serviceable and the full reconnais-
sance plan was operated. The N.E. monsoon
was blowing; its tropical downpours periodic-
ally made unaided navigation and accurate
ship recognition matters of considerable diffi-
culty,

A Hudson of No. r (R.A.A.F.) Squadron,
Captain F/Lieut. J. C. Ramshaw, was the first

-to sight the enemy. He located two approach-

ing convoys :—

(a) at 12.12 1 Motor vessel, 1 minelayer
and I mine sweeper in a position 185 miles,
and on a bearing of 52°, from Kota Bahru,
steering a course of 310°.

B

1363

(6) at 12.46 I battleship, 5 cruisers, 7
destroyers and 25 merchant vessels in-a posi-
tion 265 miles, and on a bearing of 86°, from
Kota Bahru steering a course of 270°.

Another Hudson of the same squadron shortly
afterwards reported another convoy :—

(c) at 13.00 2 cruisers, 10 destroyers and

. 10 merchant vessels in a -position 260 -miles,

and on a bearing of 76°, from Kota Bahru
steering 270°.

I51. Information about the latter convoy was
subsequently amplified to the effect that it con-
tained 21 merchant vessels which were cruising
in two lines astern. This amplification was
received by telephone at A.H.Q. at 1517 hours,

152. The position of the first of these convoys
was such that it had the appearance of having
recently rounded Cape Cambodia and was now
headed N.W. into the Gulf of Siam. The posi-
tion of the other two convoys was about 80
miles $.S.E. of Cape Cambodia, the Southern
tip of French Indo-China; both were steering
west, one slightly ahead of the other. They
might, or might not, be following the first small
convoy and in turn head N.W. into the Gulf
of Siam.

One of the Hudsons had been chased by an
enemy aeroplane and there could be no doubt
that the Japanese knew that they had been
spotted.

153. In the meantime, reports were received
of aircraft, apparently Japanese, taking photo-
graphs at various points. G.HQ. confirmed
that, no offensive action was to be taken by
fighters against them, although A.A. defences
were given authority to open fire on unidentified
aircraft. - ~

154. As a result of the enemy sighting reports,
Kota Bahru was instructed to send Hudsons
from No. 1 (GR) Squadron, R.A.A.F., to
shadow the convoys. Catalinas of No. 205
(FB) Squadron from Seletar were ordered to
take over this shadowing from the Hudsons,
and to maintain it during the night 6/7th
December until relieved by Hudsons again in
the morning of 7th December.

155. On receipt of sighting reports, the Com-
mand was put by G.H.Q. at ‘‘ No. 1 degree
of readiness ’’ which meant that it was to be
“ready for immediate operations and prepared
for enemy attack without prior warning.””

Action taken by A.H.Q. on Enemy Sighting.

156. The following action was taken by
A.H.Q. as a result of the reconnaissance reports
received : —

(a) 7 Vildebeestes of No. 36 (TB) Squad-
ron were despatched from Seletar to Kota
Bahru. (g were ordered but only 7 could
proceed). Aircraft were armed with torpedoes
on arrival at Kota Bahru.

(b) Norgroup was informed that No. 62
(B) Squadron at: AloriStar was removed to
A.H.Q. control.

(c) No. 34 (B) Squadron was retained at
Tengah at short notice to move to Alor Star.

(d) The one Beaufort* still in the Command
was moved to Kota. Bahru to stand by there
for a special photographic reconnaissance re-
quired by G.H.Q. (see para. 162).

* 6 Beauforts had recently been deivered, but 5
were sent back to Australa owmg to ‘‘teething’’_
troubles with the aircraft Nos 36(TB) and 100(TB)
Squadrons were due to be rearmed with this type.
