SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948

paid to Burma at the end of March his dispos:-
tions in the event of a withdrawal north of
Mandalay being necessary, and we decided that
a part of the Imperial Forces might withdraw
with the Chinese on Lashio and possibly even
into China.

In the end the sudden break through of the
enemy into the Shan States and quick capture
of Lashio, together with the enemy ‘threat up
the Chindwin against the road into Assam, led
to the whole of the Imperial Forces withdrawing
by Kalewa and Tamu into India. This was
agreed with the Chinese who decided to with-
draw the Fifth Army up the Irrawaddy valley
on Bhamo and Myitkyina.

24. The defence of the Andaman Islands was
included in the defence of Burma during most
of this period. Its military importance lay in
its seaplane base, in the possibility of establish-
ing an aerodrome there, and in its potential
value to the enemy as a submarine base. The
original garrison was one British company. For
security against a Japanese raid a battalion of
Gurkhas was added early in January, When
it became obvious that Rangoon could not be
held, it was decided to withdraw the whole
garrison, which was successfully carried out on
rath March. On 23rd March the Japanese
occupied Port Blair.

Akyab was held till early in May when
Japanese infiltration by land and sea and attack
by air made it obvious that it would require
an effort disproportionate to its military value
to hold it any longer, since it could no longer
be used as an air base. The garrison and naval
patrol were therefore withdrawn.

Summary oF BurMA CAMPAIGN.

25. The loss of Burma has been from a
strategical point of view our most serious
reverse of the Japanese war. It has deprived
our Chinese allies of a flow of munitions to
continue their long resistance; it has made the
establishment of air bases within effective range
of Japan a matter of extreme difficulty; it has
exposed India to a serious threat of invasion;
and it has had a disastrous effect on British
prestige in the East. The reasons for this
Teverse Merit some examination.

26. The unpreparedness of Burma for war
and its causes have already been mentioned;
and I have recorded my conviction that to place
the control of operations in Burma under a
Far Eastern Command instead of under India
was an error from the military point of view
which it would require strong political reasons
to justify.

27. From a geographical point of view the
defence of Burma against an attack from
Thailand was an awkward commitment. The
fact that there was practically speaking only
one means of entry into the country, by the
port of Rangoon, was a source of weakness;
and this port lay within a comparatively short
range of enemy airfields in Thailand. The long
narrow strip of Tenasserim, over 400 miles long
and nowhere much more than 4o miles broad,
was not easily defensible, while in the enemy’s
possession it was a threat both by air (there
were several excellent aerodromes) and by sea.

If Moulmein in Upper Tenasserim fell, and
here again the ground gave little scope for
defence in depth, Rangoon was very closely
threatened; while a force defending Rangoon
against an enemy advancing from the line of
the Salween River had the disadvantage of

1673

fighting on a front parallel to its communica-
tions and with its base close behind, almost
outside, its right flank.

If ever there was a country where attack was
the best form of defence it was Burma. Unfor-
tunately the means were not available.

28. Such plans and preparations as had been
made for the defence of Burma suffered from
three misconceptions:

(a) that the main attack would be directed
against Kengtung i the Southern Shan
States, the only place to which there were
good communications in Thailand—a motor
road from a railhead at Lampang. Actually
the Japanese made no attempt to use this
obvious route.

(b) that our air force would be able to
prevent the enemy using the limited
approaches to the frontier. The whole ex-
perience of this war is that air forces cannot
prevent the use of a road or railway; and
anyway there were no bombers in Burma.

(c) that the natural difficulties of the
country on the frontier, few and indifferent
tracks, hills and thick jungle and the for-
midable natural obstacle of the Salween
River, would restrict the numbers the enemy
could employ and dictate the direction in
which he used them. Actually, we found
ourselves up against a new feature in war-
fare—an enemy fully armed, disciplined, and
trained on the contmental model using the
mobility, independence of communications
and unorthodox tactics of the savage in thick
jungle. It was perhaps little wonder that
our troops were out-manoeuvred and became
bewildered.

29. British military authorities have seldom
realised that an Intelligence system cannot be
improvised and requires to be built up over a
period of years, The study of Intelligence in
peace 1s not encouraged and officers who
specialise in it are apt to be regarded with
suspicion The operations in Burma are a
striking example of the penalty we pay in war
for this neglect.

30. There was never sufficient naval force
to give any effective naval support during the
Burma Campaign; and its absence made the
G.O.C. always anxious about a landing near
Rangoon, Actually the Japanese made no
attempt at sea-borne invasion nor were any
ships from convoys to Rangoon ever lost from
enemy action.

Commodore Graham, R.N., with small
forces did some good work in the protection of
Akyab and the coast to the south in the later
stages of the campaign.

The situation as regards air support has been
sufficiently imdicated in the narratives of
General Hutton and General Alexander. I con-
stantly endeavoured to obtaifi air reinforcements
for Burma but they were not available.

The operations are a striking example of the
importance of an adequate warning system,
which conditions in Burma made it extremely
difficult to organise. _

The Japanese air force did not show itself
particularly efficient or formidable in Burma,
either in bombing or fighting. Our small air
forces, skilfully and boldly handied, were more
than a match for the enemy as long as good
airfields and warnings were available.

Casualties and material damage from aur
attack were small but the moral effects were
