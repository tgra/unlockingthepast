C. J. Auchinleck, General, C.in-C., MEF. 7. Note on Possible Commitments in the Spring of 1942. 2oth January 1942. x. In the spring, 1942, we may be faced with the following commitments :  (a@) The defence of our Western Front. (b) The defence of the Northern Front, including Cyprus, and probably also including assistance to Turkey.

(c) The protection of our bases in the Suez and Persian Gulf areas.

2. On 28th December, we reported our estimated deficiencies on st April 1942 to the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff. As a result of recent diversions the situation has changed again.

3. Our minimum estimated requirements for these purposes, and our estimated resources, assuming that the necessary armoured vehicles and transport are provided, are as follows:  

Minimum   vequire- aia Deficiency. ments, :

Armoured ' Divisions 5 34 1} Infantry

Divisions Wy 12 5 Heavy A. A. .

Regiments 34 15 19 Light A. A. :

_ Regiments 55" 18 37

These requirements are based on holding forward on the general line Tabriz Mosul  Syro-Turkish Frontier to deny the enemy air bases and on the despatch of a force to Western Anatolia to assist Turkey.



4. Apart from this serious shortage of forma~- tions and anti-aircraft artillery, there are indications that the delivery of A.F.V s. and M.T. vehicles will fall far short of requirements. Consequently some of the formations will not be complete in transport and therefore unable to take part in active operations.

5. Excluding forces in Iraq (one armoured brigade group and three infant about which details are not yet the following is an estimate of the position on ist April 1942: 

(a) Armoured Divisions,

Two armoured divisions equipped and mobile.

. (0) Infantry Divisions.

Two infantry divisions completely equipped and mobile.

Six infantry divisions nearly complete as regards equipment but deficient of transport in varying degrees.

6. From the above it will be seen that we shall be quite unable to carry out operations as envisaged. in paragraph 3.

Our only course will be to fall back on defences in rear in Persia, Central Iraq and Southern Syria, and to fight a defensive battle, thereby surrendering to the enemy all air bases and landing grounds north of this line, the effect of which will be greatly to increase  the scale of enemy air attack on our bases.

completely

7. Progress in re-equipment after 1st April depends mainly on M.T. arrivals which cannot be forecast accurately. The following is an estimate  based on the probable rate of arrivals:   ;

(a) Armoured Divisions.

A third armoured division should be complete with tanks and transport by mid-May. (b) Infantry Divisions.

It is estimated that sufficient transport for an infantry division should be available each month.

8. Therefore by 15th May the praitien should be as follows : 

(a) Armoured Divisions. .

Three armoured divisions fully mobile. (8) Infantry Divistons.

Three infantry divisions completely equipped and mobile.

Five infantry divisions nearly complete as regards equipment but deficient of transport

in varying degrees.

(c) Tenth Army (Iraq).

One armoured brigade group.

Three infantry divisions.

Equipment position not yet fully known.
