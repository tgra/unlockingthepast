None the less, I decided my plan as
follows: —

5 Corps to make the main attack from
Medjez and to break into the enemy’s main
defensive system between Peter’s Corner and
Longstop.

9 Corps to capture the high ground west of
Sebkret and then to push its armoured divi-
sions across the Goubellat plain, in the hope
that by speed of movement they might get
through the hills to the east, swing north to-
wards Massicault and in that area engage and
destroy the enemy’s armoured reserves and
act against the rear of the defenders opposite
5 Corps. If the armour did not progress
quickly north of the Sebkret I was not pre-
pared to press home this attack; but instead
to keep the armour to break through on 5 Corps
front, after the enemy there had been fought
to exhaustion. 46 Division to revert, in any
case, to Army Reserve after the initial attack.

United States 2 Corps to make its main effort
eastwards, to seize the high ground east and
west of Chouigui and cover the left flank of 5
Corps. United States 2 Corps also to advance
on Bizerta via the Sedjenane-Jefna and the
Oued Sedjenane Valleys.

French rg Corps to advance on the axis
Robaa-Pont du Fahs. But this was not to start
until I considered the attacks by 9 Corps (and
by Eighth Army near Enfidaville) had softened
the resistance opposite French 19 Corps.

My attack to be supported by 242 Group
Royal Air Force, 12 Air Support Command
and the Tactical Bomber Force, all working
under Air Commodore K. B. B. Cross, D.S.0O.,
D.F.C. ‘Western Desert Air Force was also
available by mutual arrangement.

The composition of the Army and United
States 2 Corps is given in Appendix ‘‘ A.”

The attacks were timed to start as under;—

o400 hrs, 22nd April 9 Corps.
2000 hrs. 22nd April 5 Caps
0400 hrs, 23rd April 2U.S. Corps.

Not surprisingly, the enemy apparently was
aware that trouble was brewing and on night
zoth-21st April he launched a strong spoiling
attack between Medjez and Goubellat and also
against 9 Corps, using his Hermann Goering
Division with tanks of to Panzer Division. He
lost heavily, including 33 tanks destroyed by
us and over 450 prisoners. That he did not
succedd in seriously disorganising our ffinal
deployment for the big attack was a tribute to
all units concerned, as naturally the confusion
at one time was considerable when enemy tanks
appeared in the dark amid our batteries, being
deployed ahead even of our Forward Defended
Localities. But the fighting against 46 Division
on g Corps front did delay the launching of
the attack there for four hours and created
some confusion and fatigue amongst the troops
of 138 Infantry Brigade forming up for the
assault.

Without going into details of the very fierce
fighting which developed all along the front
from 22nd to 30th April, I can summarise the
story as follows: —

Q Corps.

46 Division attack north of Bou Arada failed
on the right, but on the left succeeded
sufficiently to allow 6 Armoured Division to pass
through by nightfall, 2znd April. During
23rd-a4th (April, 6 Armoured Division ‘was
followed by 1 Armoured Division, and both

moved eastwards, meeting opposition but
destroying many enemy tanks. However, we
were not quick enough, and a strong enemy
anti-tank gun screen in the broken country
north-east and north of the Sebkret el
Kourzia and near Djebel Kournine prevented
eventually all further advance, despite many
attempts. The enemy withdrew from the
Seba Argout position opposite tthe right of
46 Division. Seeing that no further progress
was likely, on 26th April I ordered 9 Corps
to stand fast and to return 6 Armoured Division
and 46 Division (less one Infantry Brigade
Group) to Army Reserve. This attack by
9 Corps only just failed to achieve its object.
It did, however, inflict severe tank losses on
the enemy, drew his armoured reserves to the
south and (based on subsequent statements by
captured senior officers) seriously frightened
him. It also had the effect of leaving the
enemy opposite 19 Corps in a pronounced
salient, from which they hurriedly withdrew on
25th April. Our losses were not severe.

1g Corps.

The enemy withdrawal just forestalled an
attack by 19 Corps, which therefore followed
up rapidly, and by 28th April had again come
up against stiff resistance and strong artillery
fire on the general line Djebel Derhalfa-road
Enfidaville to Pont du Fahs-Station de Thibica.
An advance of 18 miles.

5 Corps.

In a series of grim hand-to-hand attacks and
counter-attacks against the Hermann Goering,
334 and 15 Panzer' Divisions, the British 1,
4 and 78 Divisions with Army tank support
advanced between 22nd and 30th April to a
depth of about six miles and captured most of
the enemy’s main defensive positions facing
Medjez in a semi-circle from Peter's Corner to
Longstop. Every attack was given very heavy
and concentrated artillery support. Losses
were heavy, especially in commanding officers,
but by the end of April I felt the enemy was
nearly ripe for the break through. Almost
the fiercest fighting of all took place on 2oth
April. On 1st May, Hermann Goering Division
asked for an armistice to bury its dead. This
was refused.

For the break-through I had then in Army
Reserve 6 Armoured Division and 46 Division
(less one brigade group), while 5 Corps had
still in hand one infantry brigade of 4 Division
and the best part of an Army Tank Brigade.
And at last I had room to deploy armoured
forces east of the river Medjerda, over which
two more bridges were built.

2 U.S, Corps.

As the result of constant pressure and proper
use of the big numerical preponderance they
enjoyed to outflank the enemy defences,
2 U.S. Corps by 2nd May had cleared the
enemy from Hills 609 and 612 north and east .
of Sidi Nsir and from the strong Djebel Ajred
and Azag positions: Goums and the Corps
Franc had reached the hills north of Lake
Garaet Achkel. The capture of Point 609 by
United States 34 Division was a particularly
fine piece of work, against fierce opposition
from the formidable Barenthin Regiment,

On 3rd and 4th May the enemy withdrew all
along the front under heavy pressure to the
line of hills west of Bizerta-east of Mateur-
east of Oued Tine valley. Mateur was occu-
pied by United States 1 Armoured Division.
