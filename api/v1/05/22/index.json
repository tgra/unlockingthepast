The sweeps of the Light Forces on the night 2oth/2zst and during daylight 21st were uneventful except for heavy air attacks and the unlucky loss of H.M.S. JUNO (see paragraphs 14 to 20).\u00a2 As far as the Navy was concerned, the real Battle of Crete began on the night of 21st/22nd May, with the success- ful encounter of Force D with an enemy convoy (see paragraph 23). This encounter was. skil- fully and thoroughly exploited, was a heavy blow to the Germans and an encouragement for our hard pressed troops in Crete."

Rain and the im- passability of the tracks prevented further operations north of Chelga, and, on 22nd May the Composite Battalion returned to Amanit, on the road west of Chelga. Except for har- assing tactics and a minor offensive by two companies to cover the withdrawal, no further operations took place on this front. By 30th June the Composite Battalion was concentrating at Gallabat, with forward posts on the Gandwa. As a result of this withdrawal, the enemy was able to move forces from the Chelga area across to the south-east of Gondar, where they were established some 36 miles south-east of Gondar covering the road to Debra Tabor."

The defences were even stronger than in the \u2018\u2018 Gustav \u201d line which had already given Eighth Army so much trouble; they varied\u2019 between five hundred and a thousand yards in depth and the main system, of re- inforced concrete emplacements, was linked by tunnels and communication trenches into a mutually supporting whole. The main weak- ness was the lack of troops to man the defences but Kesselring had all the same ordered the strongest resistance. Eighth Army between zoth and 22nd May was preparing for the assault. Following the failure of the surprise attack on Aquino on the evening of the 18th heavier, but still hasty, attacks had been mounted on the rgth by 78 Division on the right and x Canadian Division on the left; these ran into heavy fire which showed the defences ito be as formidable as had been expected. An attack in full strength would be nec . _ The main blow was to be delivered by the Canadian Corps north of Pontecorvo while 13 \u2018Corps would maintain pressure at Aquino and concentrate forward teady to advance abreast of the Canadians. The Poles, who had captured Villa Santa Lucia on the roth, were to continue the attack against the strongly defended hill town of Piedimonte which they had started on the zoth. 8 Indian Division, after its relief by the Canadians, had been sent back east of the Rapido; General Leese now decided to bring it forward again to reinforce 13 Corps, together with 6 British Armoured Division. These moves led to con- siderable congestion, a foretaste of the serious traffic jams which were to be a feature of the Liri valley operations."
