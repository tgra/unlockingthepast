  14. During the passage the convoy was frequently exercised in emergency turns and in changing from one cruising disposition to another. Outstanding in these exercises was the Polish BATORY leading the fifth column, who was consistently handled with the precision and skill of a well trained naval unit. All ships carried out functioning trials of their A.A. weapons in preparation for the air attacks we expected in the Mediterranean.

' 15. The convoy should have rendezvoused with the destroyers  ESCAPADE, ISAAC SWEERS and MARNE in position 45  50  N., 26  08  W. at 0800 G.M.T. on 31st October. These destroyers had sailed from Ponta Delgada on 29th October and were joining as additional escort. Owing to the  incorrect receipt of a cypher message, the rendezvous was, however, missed, and ROTHER was detached a.m. 31st to look for them but was unsuccessful.  At 1815 on 1st Novembet, H.M. Ships CLEVELAND, ALBRIGHTON and ESKDALE were sighted northbound to join K.M.S. 2 and they reported having seen ESCAPADE earlier in the day steering south-east.

16. At 1830 3rd November, H.M.S. SHEFFIELD was detached and proceeded ahead independently to Gibraltar. Her fuelling of escorts had throughout been conducted most energetically under difficult conditions due to the following swell. On the passage out, escorts were fuelled from SHEFFIELD and ORBITA.

17. From 0930 4th November, the convoy was re-disposed preparatory to the Oran section parting company. At 1150 on 4th November in position 36  13  N., 13  07  W., H.M. Ships JAMAICA, VERITY, WISHART, VELOX, WESTCOTT, ACHATES and ANTELOPE joined as additional escorts for K.M-F.O. 1 and K.MF.A. 1; and at, 1400 K.M.F.O. 1 proceeded independently under Commodore T. H. Troubridge, R.N., flying his Flag  in H.M.S. LARGS. After re-disposing the screen K.M.F.A. 1's course was set for 093 , speed 12 knots.

18. At 0730 Sth November,  the A.A. ships PALOMARES and POZARICA and _ the destroyer AMAZON joined from Gibraltar.  Dutch Ship ISAAC 'SWEERS was detached at 0745 to join Force  H  which had been  sighted 10 miles to the northward at 0720. The 0800 position of convoy K.M.F.A. 1 was 36  07  N., 09  09  W. .

19. A merchant ship bearing 110 , 7 miles sighted at 0925 Sth November proved to be the Vichien CAUDEBEC. bound for -Casa-  blanca with a cargo of wood. WIVERN was ordered to close her and to place an armed guard on board to take her to Gibraltar. Our first prize.

20. From 1600 to 1630 Sth November, the convoy was formed into Cruising Order No. 24 for passage of the Straits. This was in three columns led by KEREN, BULOLO. and -KARANIJA in that order from port to starboard column.

ULSTERMAN, ROYAL SCOTSMAN, ULSTER MONARCH .and LEINSTER left

-convoy steering east.



the convoy for Gibraltar. They were escorted by SPIREA and JONQUIL who had joined from Gibraltar at 1700 for this purpose.

22. The passage of the Straits was uneventful. Several unidentified vessels. on a westerly course were passed when the convoy was abeam Cape Spartel at 2245, but no action was taken.

23. At 0230 6th November, BROKE, MALCOLM, VANOC and WRESTLER joined the screen as reliefs for AMAZON, ACHATES, ANTELOPE and WIVERN, who

  proceeded into Gibraltar.

From passage of Straits to Assault.

24. At 0925 on 6th November, the convoy, being ahead of time, was turned back on its course to 275  by emergency turns. This course was continued until 1010 when course was altered back to 080 .

25. At this time Force  H  and K.M.S.A. 1 were in sight against the Spanish coast to the westward. SHEFFIELD and supporting force had been sighted at 0900 to the eastward. .

27. At 1230 6th November, the Spanish fish- -ing vessel JESUS DEI GRAN was sighted to the south-east. I ordered LAMERTON to board her and to send her under armed guard to Gibraltar. The crew were apparently very friendly and in no way resented this interruption of their peaceful occupation.

 south to north. It was identified as a German

reconnaissance Ju.88. One salvo was fired by POZARICA but with no apparent effect.
