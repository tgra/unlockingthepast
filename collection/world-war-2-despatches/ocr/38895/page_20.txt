2096

Ports—The situation at Syracuse was not
Satisfactory, and it was decided by Naval Com-
mander Eastern Task Force that Naval Com-
mander Force “A” should take over there to
permit Flag Officer. Sicily to proceed to
Augusta where he was urgently required.
Accordingly the staff of Force “A” were
placed .at the disposal of N.O.LC. Syracuse
to help straighten matters out.

At Augusta the harbour and approach
channel were both swept for mines during the
day with negative result. A start was made
with the establishment of coastal forces and
landing craft bases.

NC.E.T.F. visits ports—Naval Commander
Eastern Task Force visited Syracuse and
Augusta in H.M.S. LAFOREY during the day.

Gun support——The normal supporting fire
was carried out when, and where, required by
the army. The only incident of note was
damage inflicted by H.M.S. ROBERTS upon
herself while engaged in a bombardment. This
included one 4-inch mounting put out of action
and an Oerlikon wrecked.

Air activity—Air activity was restricted to
night raids in the north which resulted in
nothing worse than some near misses. Heavy
barrage from shore defences and extensive use
of smoke probably prevented any attempt at
precision bombing.

DS. SOEMBA and FLORES to Augusta—
By order of Flag Officer Sicily the Dutch gun-
boats SOEMBA and FLORES sailed from
Bark East for Augusta.

_ D + 6 Day.
Friday, 16th July.

Weather——Fine weather still prevailed over
the whole area of operations.

Beaches.
A: Bark SovuTH. .

Discharge of stores continued satisfactorily
all day. The pontoon with three mobile cranes
on it was used for discharging stores from
L.C.T. and Scammels to off-load crates from
beached L.C.M. Part of the beach repair
parties having come round from Bark WEST, a
repair park for craft was established on one
section of the beach.

B. Bark East.

Good progress was made with the unloading
of the three M.T. ships in the anchorage and
L.C.T. with stores for 51 Division continued
to arrive from Bark SoutH for unloading.

Four ships of the 14th Minesweeping Flotilla
carried out a searching sweep in the approach
to the anchorage. -

C. Acip Sours and NorTa.

The last Class “A” ship of the D+3 day
convoy sailed to join a convoy from Syracuse.

F.O.8.Y. to Augusta—Flag Officer Sicily
in H.M.S. LARGS transferred from Syracuse
to Augusta. oe ;

K.M.S. 19B and C_ forward—tIt was de-
cided that K.M.S. convoys 19B and C, which
had been held at Malta, should be sailed for
Sicily the following morning. This was to re-
lieve congestion at Malta and permit economic
use to be made of escorts. -- ;

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 28 APRIL, 1950

Gun support.—Supporting fire was given to
the army as required, but there was agairi no-
shoot worthy of particular note.

Enemy air activity—Only at the northern
end of the area of operations was there any
particular incident. Raids on a reduced scale
were experienced during the night 15th/16th
July at Syracuse and near misses resulted in
some damage to H.M.S. BOSTON and a few
minor casualties in that ship and H.MSS.
POOLE. Aircraft mining was also reported
south of Syracuse by H.M.S. ROOKWOOD.

D+7 Day.
Saturday, \7th July.

Weather—There was no change in the
Seater which remained consistently favour-
able.

Beaches.
A. Bark Sours.

Unloading continued satisfactorily and four
M.T. ships and two cased petrol carriers were
cleared and sailed, leaving eight ships in the
anchorage. ‘ ,

B. Bark East.

It was decided by Naval Commander Force
“VV” that after the completion of discharge of
the three ships then present, Bark East
beaches were to be closed. S.N.O.L. (N) was
relieved in the evening by Commander

‘R. W. D. Thompson, R.N. and Captain (D),

21st Flotilla assumed responsibility for the
safety of the ships in the anchorage.

When S.N.O.L. (N) left, all landing craft in
the sector with the exception of two L-C.M.
and one L.C.T. were still in good running
order.

Augusta.—The presence of two E-boats in
the searched channel during the night 16th/
17th July caused minelaying to be suspected.
Convoy movements were held up until 0930
when the port was re-opened after a 100 per
cent. sweep of the channel over a width of two
cables on either side of the centre line had
been completed without disclosing a mine of
any type.

The E-boats were also reported by a patrol
trawler to have fired torpedoes and H.MS.
MAURITIUS at anchor in the harbour
observed two flashes resembling torpedo ex-
plosions outside. No damage was done.

Syracuse—H.M.S. BULOLO sailed from
Syracuse for Malta at 2000 with Naval Com-
mander Force “A” on board, the situation
being, by then, satisfactory with a new
N.O.LC., Captain A. N. Grey, R.N. tempor-
arily in charge. It had previously been agreed
between Naval Commander Force “A” and
Flag Officer Sicily that a prolongation of the
stay of H.M.S. BULOLO would eventually
lead to confusion owing to divided control, and
that the shore organisation would settle down
more quickly when there was no doubt as to
who was in charge.

Gun Support.

The Inshore Squadron once more gave its
support to the army in their operations along
the coast, but no call was made upon the -
bombardment cruisers.

In the evening between 1842 and 1902,

-H.M.S. WARSPITE bombarded Catania, firing

57 rounds of 15-inch at ranges opening at
