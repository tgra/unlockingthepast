            "description": "4or. On our side, great hopes had been placed in the Hurricane Fighters which reached Singapore on the 13th January. (See Section XXXVI). It was hoped that the superior quality of these machines might enable us to regain at least some measure of air superiority over the Japanese. Such, however, did not prove to be the case. In the first place the machines, which were not of the most modern type, did not prove to be superior to the Japanese Navy Zero Fighters. Secondly, the pilots lacked knowledge of the Malayan climatic and geographical conditions. As with the Army reinforcements, there was no time to accustom them to the local conditions. As a result, several of these Hurricanes were lost daily, some being brought down in battle, some accidentally lost, while a few were destroyed or damaged on the ground,"

Photographic evidence confirmed the destruction of some 70 major buildings in the Japanese quarters, while intelligence reports variously estimated Japanese casualties alone at 600 and a 1,000, in addition to those inflicted upon Burmese puppet troops. ~"

It did not seem to me that this policy was consistent with our obligations towards our French Allies at Jibuti, where strong defences had been constructed, and that it would be fatal to our prestige to make so little attempt to defend the Protectorate. It did not at that time seem likely that the Italians, if they entered the war, would expend large forces in the occupation of a country which had little strategic value; and that small enemy forces might be held in check if the garrison received some reinforcement.

At Seletar, 2 Catalinas  at their moorings were burned out and another 2 damaged. Six Blenheims at Tengah were damaged to a varying degree, whilst at Sembawang 3 Buffaloes on the ground were destroyed and 4 damaged. Attacks were carried out by some 80 bombers, of which 2 were brought down and another 4 damaged. The attack was repeated on the 18th against the naval base and the docks, and again 2 were brought down and possibly 6 damaged for the loss of 8 Buffaloes."

By the 13th January Myebon itself and the high ground to the west had been occupied by 74 Brigade with tank support against increasing enemy resistance, and exploitation north through Kantha and east towards Kangaw began. At this stage, Naval launches successfully co-operated by patrolling the chaungs, sinking twenty of the enemy's supply craft besides a number of sampans. The Japanese reacted sharply to this disruption of their communications, sending four relatively heavily armed assault craft into action against the naval motor Jaunches. The enemy ships were promptly sunk. At a later stage, too, the small Naval craft materially assisted in bringing about the eventual destruction of the enemy force north of Myebon."
