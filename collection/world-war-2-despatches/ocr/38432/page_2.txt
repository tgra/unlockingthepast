attacks were pressed home to short range, re-
sulting im a hit with the only torpedo fired,
confirmed by Motor Torpedo Boat 82. It was
not known to the Commanding Officer that his
second torpedo had failed to fire until about
twenty minutes later.- This misfire and the
casualty to the First Lieutenant when about
to release a depth charge, were two misfor-
tunes which combined to spoil a very spirited
attack during which Motor Torpedo Boat 77
was subjected to intense enemy fire.

3. Motor Torpedo Boat 82 fired one torpedo
only, which missed. The conclusions (para-
graph 13 (viii)) of the Flotilla Commanding
Officer are that both torpedoes should be fired
whenever a good target presents itself. This
is considered, without doubt, to be the correct
procedure and has again been impressed on
Commanding Officers,

4. Motor Torpedo Boat 61 (Lieutenant T. J.
Bligh, Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve),
equipped as a gunboat, fought a prolonged
and resolute action with the convoy escort,
which was greatly superior in fire power. It
is considered that this boat did particularly well;
her wheel steering was out of order through-
out the action, during which she was steered
with the tiller from aft.

5. The conclusions of the Flotilla Command-
ing Officer are considered sound, particularly
paragraph 13 (viii), referred to above. The
R.D.+.* with which these M.T.B.s are fitted
was not used on this occasion, as the enemy
convoy appeared before it was expected.

.6. Motor Torpedo Boats 307 and 315, not
having met the others at the rendezvous, were
deprived of their target at the last moment by
its being sunk by a Wellington torpedo-bomber.
The small fast enemy destroyer which had
been escorting the merchant ship was not a
suitable torpedo target and these Motor Torpedo
Boats are not sufficiently heavily armed with
guns to engage such a target with a good chance
of success.

7. Mechanically, all the Motor Torpedo Boats
ran well and without giving any trouble. This
is a far more satisfactory state of affairs than
has recently been the case with boats of this
type, and the improvement is largely due to
the skill and enthusiasm of Lieutenant (E)
W._R. Coverdale, Royal. Navy, the Coastal
Force Base Engineer Officer.

The conduct of officers and ships’ companies
during this operation is reported to have been
excellent.

8. It 1s considered that this force of Motor
Torpedo Boats was well led by Lieutenant
R. A, .M. Hennessy, Royal Navy, the Com-
manding Officer of the 7th Flotilla, who was
hampered by having only two Motor Torpedo
Boats and one Motor Gun Boat, against the
enemy escort ef four destroyers and three E-
boatst and merchant ships which were them-
selves armed. His small attacking force caused
great’ confusion among the convoy, enemy
ships firing on one another and some in the
air. Under these conditions, a really adequate
force of Motor Torpedo Boats should have been
able to sink several enemy ships. In this case

ENCLOSURE 2 TO C.-IN-C., Levant’s LETTER.

From The Senior Officer, 7th M.T.B.
Flotilla.
Date 17th February, 1943.
To The Captain Coastal Forces,
Mediterranean.
Submitted:
M.T.B.s 77 (V.7* om board), 82 and 61

sailed from Malta in accordance with previous
instructions, and passed the boom at 1500.
Having reached the end of the swept channel
a course was set for a position 15 miles due
south of Maritimo Island. All three boats
were carrying a thousand gallons of upper-
deck fuel, and as this was the first time of
carrying it a speed of 18} knots was allowed for
engine revolutions giving 20 knots under normal
load. It was subsequently found that there
was no zeduchon in Speed due to the extra
load.

M.T.B.s 307 aia 315 were due to sail at
approximately 1600, and catch us up en route,
or failing that to rendezvous in position 15
miles south of Maritimo Island.

2. At 2140, an enemy report was received of
one merchant vessel and two destroyers, steer-

” ing 240 degrees towards Maritimo Island. It

was thought that these ships would be our
target, and that they would -evéntually alter
course to the southward, in which case our
position south of _Maritimo Island would be
very suitable.

At 2320, M.T.B. 61 signalled that she had
a defective dynamo and that it was necessary
for her to stop. - Boats stopped at 2325 and
cut engines. At that moment an enemy report
of four merchant vessels and three destroyers
to the northward of us was received, and before
it could be plotted on the chart M.T.B. 6x
reported that she had sighted a large merchant
vessel to starboard, about 1} miles away.

3. All boats were ordered to start up one
engine, and M.T.B. 77 followed by M.T.B. 82.
proceeded on a north-easterly course with the
object of getting the target on the port bow.

On closing it was observed that there were
two columns of ships, with a heavy escort of
destroyers, and that we were steering on-a
course almost exactly opposite to the Port
enemy column.

The starboard column was sighted to ied
and consisted of a destroyer with two merchant
vessels astern. As we were in an ideal posi-
tion to attack the leading ship of sis colin,
the signal ‘‘ Attack with torpedoes ””
and all three boats acted independently. from,
then om

4. M.T.B. 77 (Lieutenant J. B, Sturgeon;
R.N. v. R. ) altered course to port fo get on the
firing course to attack the leading merchant
vessel of the starboard column. In order to
avoid the'port column it was necessary to go
on to all three engines and increase to 20 knots.
