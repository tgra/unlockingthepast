with His Majesty. He told me he knew what
I had come about and that I was going to
see his Ministers. The object of my visit was
to obtain the authority of the Norwegian Gov-
ernment for (1) far more drastic control in
the military areas over the civilian population
and the innumerable small steamers and
“* puffers ’’ navigating the fiords, etc., and
upon which the life and communications of
the people largely depended; (2) closer col-
Jaboration between Civil Government and
British Military Authorities to make this control
effective. Colonel Pollock had already dis-
eussed the subject with General Rugé, who
was understanding and sympathetic and under-
took to insist to the Government that action
in this respect was essential. General Rugé left
me to go to his Headquarters when I arrived
at the King’s residence.

‘ng. On leaving His Majesty I drove back
with Sir Cecil Dormer to Storsteinnes from
where I flew to Tromso and saw the Prime
Minister, Ministers for Defence, and for Foreign
Affairs. The three Ministers also were cordial
and friendly, and promised that these matters
should ibe closely gone into—and a Govern-
ment representative sent to Harstad to arrange
details, This conference was somewhat rudely
put an end to by an air attack aimed at
DEVONSHIRE in the harbour. They had
only returned to Tromso that day, and the
attack that evening was unfortunate. I also
saw Admiral Diesen on the subject of the con-
‘trol afloat who undertook to do everything
hecessary. Vice-Admiral Cunningham had
already taken the matter up with him and
accompanied me to this meeting. The Nor-
wegian Ministers mentioned the need for A/A
sartillery and equipment for their troops and
also the necessity of refitting their ships which
‘they had understood the British authorities
would be able to arrange. The Norwegian
Ministers showed every intention of being help-
ful and anxious to continue the fight, but they
were not unnaturally concerned about the un-
avoidable delay in meeting their requirements
on these points.

Secrion III
Anti-ArecraFt DEFENCE MEASURES

1. The enemy commenced attacks by air on
the day that the first convoy arrived and con-
tinued throughout the period of the campaign.
When, after the withdrawal of our forces from
South Norway, enemy was able to develop air
bases in Trondheim and other places the attacks
greatly increased in intensity and frequency.
Our fighter craft of the Fleet Air Arm and
Royal Air Force, in those periods when they
were available, wrought great havoc among the
enemy and afforded a very welcome relief.
From the earliest days the establishment of
aerodromes was a major preoccupation, but at
the beginning, the land all being covered by
three or more feet of snow, the problem pre-
sented unusual difficulties, The Norwegian
authorities reported Bardufoss as having been
used by Gladiators. Lieutenant Francklin,
R.N. (F.A.A.) organised much of the pre-
liminary work in clearing this and also a suit-
able ground discovered at Skaanland, the
latter having the advantage of being situated
adjacent to the merchant shipping anchorage in
Levangs Fiord between Harstad and

Tjeldsundet passage. The thaw was late this
year and it was the 30th April before I was
sure it had commenced. The flying boat
‘* Cabot ’’ brought Wing Commander Atcherley
to the area on the 4th May and he then took
charge of the finding amd development of aero-
dromes both to the north and to the south.

2. Heavy snowstorms and bad weather in the
early period interfered with good work by the
FURIOUS ibut her aircraft operated to their
full capacity at every opportunity. She was
recalled on April 23rd to re-equip, having then
only eight aircraft fit for service. The urgent
need for A/A artillery was emphasised in a
telegram to the Admiralty on Apnil 25th.

3. After the evacuation of Namsos and
Aandalsnes, the enemy air attacks in the
Narvik Vest Fiord and Vaags Fiord areas were
intensified and the stationing of H.M. Ships
with good A/A Batteries in each area where
merchant ships were anchored or troops work-
ing became more than ever necessary. The
enemy steadily developed the supplying and
reinforcing of his troops in Narvik by means
of troop carrying flying boats and by the
method of parachutes. Minelaying was also
frequently suspected but not actually proved
until May 29th; when five enemy aircraft were
seen to do so in Tjeldsundet. Sweepers in-
vestigated and four mines were exploded.

4. On April 30th, I was informed by the
Admiralty that 48 3.7 in. H.A. Guns and
48 Bofors (making 60 in all with 12 already
in the area) were to ‘be sent, as A/A protection
was of primary importance and ‘two A/A
Cruisers were also ordered to join me on com-
pletion of certain other operations. The next
day, as if to emphasise the matter, the enemy
obtained a direct hit on the building used for
Navai accommodation in Harstad, fortunately
killing only two ratings. At the same time they
bombed the Hospital Ship ATLANTIS
anchored wide away from all other ships and
a Norwegian HospitalShip, causing many
casualties in the latter.

5. The lateness of the thaw caused a depres-
sing delay in the preparation of aerodromes.
I had hoped that Bardufoss would be ready
by the 15th May, in which case Carriers with
the necessary aircraft would have left England
on the 11th May but on the 4th May I had
to report that the snow was causing insuperable
delays. Concerning the preparation and use
of Bardufoss, comsiderable tact was necessary
in dealing with the Norwegians, as they firmly
wished to keep it under their control. The
acceptance of Norwegian pilots and other air
personnel for training in England did much to
bring a convenient working arrangement into
force.

6. The first 3.7 in. A/A Guns arrived in the
area on the 6th May. Bofors Guns reached
Bardufoss on the 7th. Four of the 3.7 in.
Guns were in action at Harstad on the gth and
the other four were on their way to Bardufoss.
Men bombed on shore could now begin to feel
that they had some chance of hitting back; a
psychological factor of considerable importance.

4. The ARK ‘ROYAL joined and was able to
commence operations from a position at sea well
to the northward on the 6th May and the
presence of her fighter aircraft had an im-
mediate and most noticeable effect upon the
enemy’s freedom of attack.
