By this date, also, the enemy had been cleared from the area north of Kamaing, Mogaung and Myitkyina by the ChineseAmerican forces under General Stilwell,t and a re-adjustment of our dispositions to meet monsoon conditions had been made in Arakan.

My first Despatch* covered the period from the formation of 11 Army Group, 16th November, 1943, to the re-opening of the Kohima Imphal road on the 22nd June, 1944, when at 1245 hours, at Milestone 109, the leading troops of the 2 British Division (33 Corps) met the forward troops of 5 Indian Division (4 Corps), and thus shattered the Japanese dream of conquering India. This Despatch describes the operations from the 23rd June, 1944, to the 12th November, 1944, when I handdd over command of 11 Army Group to Lieuti-General Sir Oliver Leese.",
