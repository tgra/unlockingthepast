outlying detachments from the area west of the
Zibyutaung Range. 33 Division had been
forced back east of the Chindwin ; it seemed
probable that this Division would fight a series
of delaying actions along the Kaing—Ye-U
road, but there was as yet no indication that
they would attempt a firm stand on any par-
ticular line. The depleted 31st Division was in
Fifteenth Army reserve in the Ye-U area.

53 Division was in the Naba—Katha area.
This Division, together with the 15th, 31st and
33rd mentioned above, comprised the Japanese
Fifteenth Army. 14 Tank Regiment, which had
suffered heavily in the retreat, was believed
to be refitting in the Shwebo area.

Facing Northern Combat Area Command
and the Chinese Expeditionary Force, there
were 56, 2 and 18 Japanese Divisions, disposed
between Bhamo and the Salween River. These
formed Thirty-third Army, but 2 Division was
only on loan and was to return to Burma Area
Army reserve.

The Japanese Burma Area Army reserve
consisted of 49 Division, in the Pegu Area.
The Japanese were known to be particularly
sensitive to the threat of sea-borne attack, and
our deception schemes were designed to increase
their fears. It was therefore unlikely that they
would move troops from South to North Burma
unless the situation there became critical. This
also applied to 72 Independent Mixed Brigade
at Moulmein.

In addition to the formations listed above,
the Japanese had about 100,000 L. of C.
troops. The fighting qualities which these
administrative units displayed against General
Wingate’s brigades earlier in the year proved
them to be a factor which could not be
ignored. Experience in the Pacific theatre
had shown that Japanese base troops were
capable of stubborn and suicidal defence. The
enemy also had at their disposal two “ Indian
National Army ” divisions, each 6,000 strong,
and seven battalions of the “Burma National
Army.” Both these forces had a considerable
potential nuisance value.

To summarise, therefore, the enemy had,
in November, ten divisions and two indepen-
dent mixed brigades in Burma, disposed as
follows:—33 Army (three divisions) facing
Northern Combat Area Command in the north-
east; 15 Army (four divisions) in the centre
extending from the Railway Corridor, through
the Zibyutaung Range, to the River Irrawaddy :
28 Army (two divisions) in the coastal sector ;
and a division in reserve.

23. The situation of our own forces during
the latter part of November was briefly as
follows.

In 15 Corps, in Arakan, 25 Indian Division
(Major-General G. N. Wood) was in contact
with the enemy in the general area of
Maungdaw and the Maungdaw—Buthidaung
road, the eastern portion of which, including
Buthidaung, was in enemy hands, Our troops
were actively engaged in clearing features of
tactical importance prior to the coming main
offensive in December.

26 Indian Division (Major-General C. E. N.
Lomax) had one brigade forward at the head
of the Kalapanzin River, in the area of Bawli,
Taung and Goppe Bazaars, and two brigades
in reserve. It was in process of being relieved

by the newly-arrived 82 (West African) Division
(Major-General G. Mc J. §. Bruce) and was
about to concentrate for training at Chittagong,
in preparation for the sea-borne assault on
Akyab in February. .

In the upper Kaladan, elements of 81 (West
African) Division (Major-General F. J. Loftus-
Tottenham) had by-passed the enemy positions
in the Paletwa area (Paletwa itself was found
deserted on the 17th November) and were
advancing south down the Pi Chaung. Their
patrols, on the 30th November, were within two
miles of Kaladan village, which lies some eight
miles south-south-east of Paletwa.

3 Commando Brigade was concentrated at
Teknaf and was responsible for the security
of the Naf Peninsula.

50 Indian Tank Brigade had not concen-
trated by the 30th November, and 22 (East
African) Brigade did not arrive till the end of
December.

33 Conps was leading the advance of
Fourteenth Army, with 5 Indian Division on
the right, and 11 (East African) Division on the
left. “5 Indian Division, which had advanced
via Tiddim, was concentrating in the Kalemyo
area prior to being relieved. (Kalemyo itself
had been entered by the leading elements of
11 (@Bast African) Division on the 15th
November.) Between the Ist July and the
30th November, 5 Indian Division had killed
fifteen of the enemy for every one of its own
men, ki The actual casualty figures,
excluding the Lushai Brigade area, and only
including fresh bodies and wounded which the
enemy were actually seen to remove, were:—

11 (East African) Division was advancing on
Kalewa from the west and north. Two
brigades moving along the Myitha Gorge,
supported by tanks, were meeting strong oppo-
sition some six miles west of Kalewa. The
third brigade was advancing south down both
banks of the Chindwin and had reached a point
seven miles north of the town by the 30th
November.

2 British Division and 20 Indian Division,
which had been in rest areas further north,
had begun to concentrate forward, the former
in the’ Yazagyo area and the latter about
Htinzin. (Yazagyo and Htinzin lie in the
Kabaw Valley, about 26 and 35 miles north
of Kalemyo respectively.)

The Lushai Brigade formed an Intelligence
screen on the right flank of 33 Conps. By the
end of November, the Brigade had cleared the
area to the south of 5 Indian Division and was
successfully harassing the enemy as far east
as the Myittha River, with patrols penetrating
as far south as Tilin.

Headquarters, 4 Corps, had reopened at
Imphal on the ist November, after a period
of rest in India. On the 6th November, the
Conps had been ordered to detail a brigade of
19 Indian Division (Major-General T. W. Rees)
to capture Pinlebu and reconnoitre routes from
the Chindwin eastwards to the railway, with a
view to the move of larger forces on the general
axis Sittaung—Indaw. Early reports received
from both ground and air forces indicated that
