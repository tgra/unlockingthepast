SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON

Brigade through his Chief Staff Officer. . The
warning about destruction of the port was given
to him in writing, and he was informed that
this warning had also been communicated to
the Duke of ‘Aosta.

At 0830 hours on 3rd April, 7th Indian
Infantry Brigade, advancing south, was only
25 miles from Massawa. By that evening it
had made contact with the enemy forces. 7th
Indian Infanfry Brigadé Group was placed
under command 5th Indian Division in order
to co-ordinate the attack on Massawa.

On the other fronts the Mounted Infantry
from Arresa had reached Adi Ugri, releasing
all British and Imperial officers and men who
had been taken as prisoners of war by the
Italians. Mobile forces had occupied Adowa
and Adigrat over 100 miles from Asmara.

At Adigrat natives were found looting mat-
tresses on which their wounded compatriot
soldiers lay. Beyond Adowa native children,
some not more than two years of age, were
found brutally and horribly mutilated.

In the meantime, 4th Indian Division, less
gth Indian Infantry Brigade, were clearing
Keren battlefield, preparatory to moving back
to Middle East. bn 2gth March, orders were
issued for the first brigade group of 4th Indian
Division to move to Port Sudan for embarka-
tion. : ¥ ere all

On 5th April, further demands for troops
were received from Middle East, and practically
all of the remainder of 4th Indian Division,
less 7th. Indian Infantry Brigade, was released.
It was sad to part with this Division, which had
rendered such distinguished service under
Major-General Sir Noel Beresford-Peirse,
K.B.E., D.S.O.

Terms of Surrender of Massawa.
That evening, the Admiral commanding the
“Italian Forces in Massawa sent in a flag of
truce, and asked for our terms for the surrender
‘of Massawa. These were dictated over the
telephone to Commander 5th Indian Division,
who passed them on to the Italian envoys. A
truce until r100 hours 6th April was imposed,
but the terms were refused and hostilities were
resumed at 1300 hours.

Capture of Massawa.

Massawa was now attacked from the nortk
and west, and after some fighting, the enemy
surrendered. Commander 5th Indian Division
entered Massawa, receiving the surrender of the
Admiral Commanding at 1410 hours on 8th
April. It was then found that considerable de-
struction to the town had been carried out,
many ships scuttled in the harbour, and the
port facilities badly damaged. Prisoners in-
cluded over 450 Officers and 10,000 Other
Ranks, both Italian and Native. Many enemy
units were represented from the forces that
had been broken at Keren and Ad Teclesan,
and had made their way to Massawa.

Part III.

Oberations leading up to the Batile of Amba
Alagi.

After the capture of Massawa, the two main
enemy centres of resistance in Northern Ethio-
pia were Amba Alagi and Gondar. ‘ The rem-
nants of the Italian armies from Eritrea had
retreated along the two main roads from
Asmara to these areas,.and for some timé pre-

viously the enemy had been preparing a defen-
sive position to hold the Toselli Pass where the
road goes over the first big range of hills leading
into central Ethiopia. Gondar had always
been a big military station, the centre of the
Italian military organisation in the country
North and West of Lake Tana. At this time,
commitments elsewhere made it imperative for
the C.-in-C. to withdraw as many forces as
possible from Eritrea. The: policy laid down
by him was that no major operations should be
undertaken in Eritrea and Northern Ethiopia
which would interfere with the withdrawal of
troops to the Middle East. Though the enemy
forces which had withdrawn southwards were
no longer a menace to the Sudan and though
they had little chance of staging a counter-
offensive to recapture Eritrea, their continued
presence in the country was a source of possible
future trouble and disturbance. It was desir-
able that they should be eliminated.

Forces available.

The forces which remained and were avail-
able for operations against Amba Alagi and
Gondar and for internal security for the whole
of Eritrea were: —

5th Indian Division.

Two M.M.G. Groups S.D.F.

One Commando.

One Battery 68 Medium Regt., R.A.

Two Companies Mounted Infantry, $.D.F.

Commitments,

One brigade, at least, was needed to garrison
Asmara.

One brigade could easily have been expended
on guarding important centres and dumps of
captured stores in other parts of Eritrea and the
Tigre. At the time of the fall of Massawa, .
only light mobile forces had pursued the enemy
southwards along the two roads from Asmara.
Central India Horse was in the area of Mai
Mescic. They were soon withdrawn on relief
by Skinner’s Horse. No. 1 M.M.G. Group
had reached the river Tacazze at Mai Timchet
on the way to Gondar. No. 2 M.M.G. Group
was carrying out a reconnaissance down the
Red Sea coast as far as Zula.

The task of attacking the Amba Alagi posi-
tion was entrusted to 5th Indian Division,
Amba Alagi is 235 miles south of Asmara.
Transport was very limited. Reconnaissance
revealed that the Amba Alagi position was
naturaily strong. The administrative problem
of staging a battle in this area was considerable
and involved a dumping programme which
necessarily took time. At first only the mini-
mum troops were kept forward in the area Mai
Mescic, Quiha and Macalle. Their task was
reconnaissance and to act as a screen to protect
the dumping programme and the concentration
of other troops at the last possible minute.
Sufficient troops were not available for opera-
tions to be undertaken in strength against
Gondar and Amba Alagi simultaneously. It
was decided to engage Amba Alagi first as
success here -would open the road to Addis
Ababa, allowing the move of South African
ions to be routed through Massawa to Middle

ast.

Topography—The Amba Alagi Positicn.

Amba Alagi is 2 mountain over 10,000 feet
above sea level. The road into Ethiopia
