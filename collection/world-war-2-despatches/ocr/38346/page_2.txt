3938 SUPPLEMENT to tue LONDON GAZETTE, 7 JULY, 1948

7. At 1707, enemy destroyers, probably of
the leading flotilla, delivered a long range
torpedo attack. At 1714 EXETER received a
hit from an 8 in. shell in one boiler room and
turned away, reducing to slow speed which later
was increased to 15 knots. DE RUYTER held
her course for a short time, but the remaining
qruisers turned away after EXETER. DE
RUYTER ‘then conformed and American
destroyers assisted to screen EXETER with

smoke and the Allied line was thrown into‘

considerable confusion. About 1715 Japanese
torpedoes reached the Allied line; KORTE-
NAER was struck by a torpedo in the engine
room and sank,

8. By 1725 the Allied cruiser line (except
EXETER) had been straightened again on a
N.E. course but was partially screened from
the enemy by smoke. EXETER was retiring
to Sourabaya on course 150° at 15 knots. At
this moment Admiral Doorman ordered the
British destroyers to counter-attack.

9. ELECTRA, ENCOUNTER and JUPITER
were widely separated and proceeded to attack
independently.

ELECTRA led through the smoke in the
direction of the enemy and on clearing it sighted
an enemy unit of 3 heavy destroyers on oppo-
site courses going into the smoke, range about
6,000 yards. ELECTRA engaged and claims
four hits on the leading ship, but as the unit
disappeared into the smoke a shell struck
ELECTRA in No. 2 boiler room and shattered
the boiler. Steam was lost and ELECTRA
stopped. Shortly after, a single enemy heavy
destroyer emerged from the smoke and the en-
gagement continued, ELECTRA firing in local
control with all bridge communication dead.
ELECTRA was repeatedly hit and her guns
silenced one by one. When only Y gun remained
in action the order to ‘‘ abandon ship’ was
given, ELECTRA sank about 1800.

10, JUPITER on emerging through the
smoke sighted two enemy destroyers which were
engaged for a short period before they disap-
peared. No further target being in sight JUPI-
TER returned to the Allied cruisers where she
was joined by ENCOUNTER. ENCOUNTER
attacked through a clearing in the smoke, but
no details or results of the attack are known.

ir. From 1725 to 1745 the cruiser forces were
screened from each other by smoke. Japanese
gunfire through the smoke, presumably con-
trolled by radar, is reported as accurate. Jap-
anese aircraft were employed on spotting
throughout the action.

12. At 1745 Allied cruisers emerged from
smoke on opposite course to the enemy 8 in.
cruisers at ranges down to 21,000-yards. The

action continued spasmodically until 1832,

several hits being claimed on the enemy
cruisers. -

At 1812, the enemy cruisers turned away
under cover of smoke, the rear ship heavily
on fire aft. When the smoke cleared PERTH
states ‘‘ tanget appeared to be stopped, the bow
rose in the air, then seemed to settle back. We
then lost sight of, her, whether because she
sank or whether the light failed I do not know.”’

By 1830 no enemy forces were in sight.
Night Acton. ,

13. In gathering darkness DE RUYTER
continued to lead the cruisers to the N.E. and
Northward presumably in an attempt to work

round the enemy forces and reach the convoy.
At 1927 four ships were sighted to the Westward
and engaged for a few minutes at 9,000 yards
range; sumultaneously Allied force was illumm-
ated by enemy aircraft flares. PERTH turned
away to avoid suspected torpedoes; the remain-
der of the force conformed.

14. It seems probable that Admiral Doorman
decided it was impracticable to work round the
enemy ‘to the Northward and that better results
might be achieved by getting between him and
the Java coast and working round to the South-
ward, for about 1945 he altered course to r70?.
This course was continued until about 2035
when ships reached very shallow water near
Kodok Point to the West of Sourabaya Strait.
DE RUYTER them turned to’ the Westward
keeping about four miles fram the coast.

15. At about, 2100 in position 06° 45.2’ S.,
112° 05.5’ E. a violent explosion occurred in
JUPITER who was following astern of JAVA,
the rear cruiser. Tihe explosion, attributed by
JUPITER, to a torpedo, occurred on the star-
board side abreast the forward bulkhead of the
engine room and immobilised the ship. No
signs cf a submarine or of torpedo tracks were
sighted from JUPITER who remained un-
molested until she sank four hours later. A
large number of survivors landed on the North
coast of Java from ship’s boats and Carley-
floats. The weather at time of sinking was—
with East force 2, sky and visibility b-7 miles,
sea and swell 21.*

16. From 2150 onwards the Allied cruiser
force was continuously shadowed and frequently
illuminated by aircraft dropping flares. All
alterations of course were signalled by dropping
flares, and occasionally by lines of floating cal-
cium flares placed across the track of the ships.
Under these conditions a surprise attack on the
enemy convoy seemed out of the question.

17. At 2330 contact was made with two
cruisers on the port beam of the Allied force
whicli was then steering to the Northward, .
though its exact position is not known,
Range was about 9,000 yards. Enemy opened
fire followed by PERTH; the enemy fire was
extrenely accurate but very slow. PERTH
claimed that two or three salvos hit, then star
shell falling short concealed the target. One
enemy shell hit DE RUYTER on the quarter-
deck and DE RUYTER turned 90° away,
remaining cruisers conforming.

18, When the line was half way round this
turn a violent explosion occurred in the after
part of JAVA and she stopped heavily on fire.
She was not under gunfire at the time. At
about the same moment DE RUYTER, who
had completed the go° turn, also blew up with
an appalling explosion and settled aft heavily
on fire.t} PERTH avoided the blazing wreck
by the use of full port rudder and one engine.
HOUSTON headed out to starboard.

1g. Admiral Doorman’s verbal orders to his
force before sailing had been that any ship dis-
abled ‘‘ must be left to the mercy of the
enemy ”’ to quote his own words. The Allied
force now consisted only of PERTH and

Division).
