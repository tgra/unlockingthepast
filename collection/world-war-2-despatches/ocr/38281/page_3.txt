SUPPLEMENT to Tas LONDON GAZETTE,5 MAY, 1948

SOVEREIGN in Force “‘B’’ if I considered
this essential.

The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean,
was frankly sceptical and considered I was un-
duly pessimistic. In his opinion, the pro-
bability of an Italian concentration in the
Western Mediterranean was more remote now
than at any time since Operation ‘‘ Hats”
(30th August—sth September).

- Since defects in ROYAL SOVEREIGN could
not be completed in time she was unable to take
part in the operation.

EXECUTION OF OPERATION ‘‘ COLLAR.” .
17. The M.T. ships included in Force ‘‘ F ”’
passed through the Straits of Gibraltar during
the night of 24th/25th November and were
joined by the corvettes to the East of Gibraltar
The remainder of

a.m. 25th November.
Forces ‘‘ B”’ and “ F ”’ sailed at o800 on 25th
November.

The operation proceeded according to plan
and without incident until the morning of 27th
November. The corvettes had been detached
on the evening of 26th November, as they
were unable to keep up with the convoy. A
detailed account of the situation at o800 on 27th
November and subsequent events on that day
are given in the attached narrative.

Points oF INTEREST.
Enemy Intelligence prior to 27th November.

18. So far as I am aware, reliance was placed
entirely on shore based air reconnaissance to
locate the position of enemy units in the Western
Mediterranean prior to 27th November. This
reconnaissance proved quite inadequate for the
purpose- and there was insufficient information
concerning the location of Italian naval forces
prior to the-27th November and no report of
enemy ships being at sea in the Western Medi-
terranean until they were sighted by carrier re-
connaissance a.m. 27th November.

Enemy Intelligence on 27th November. |

1g. With the exception of a Sunderland ane
boat operating from Malta to cover the area
in which our forces would be operating on 27th
November, air reconnaissance was limited to
that furnished by ARK ROYAL’s aircraft.

- ARK ROYAL has a high proportion ‘of young
and inexperienced pilots and observers: Some of
these had to be employed on the initial dawn
reconnaissance, since it was necessary to hold
the first air striking force in readiness to attack
any enemy force attempting to interfere with
the concentration of Forces “‘B’”’ and ‘“F”
with Force ““D’’,

Not only had many of these young observers
little or no experience of reporting enemy for-
mations, but the need for maintaining wireless
silence, except in the immediate neighbourhood
of Gibraltar provides little opportunity to exer-
cise communications i in the air.

‘These factors, coupled with variable visibility
and the similarity of Italian warships’ silhou-
ettes; made their tasks difficult.”

Taking the above into consideration, I con-

sider the crews of the reconnaissance aircraft”

acquitted, themselves with credit.

Results obtained by Air Striking’ Force Torpedo
Attacks.

20. The results obtained ‘by torpedo bomber

attacks on high speed targets during the present

2801

war have fallen far short of the estimates based
on peacetime practices adjusted for ‘‘ opposi-
tion.’’

So far as ARK ROYAL is concerned, this is.
attributed entirely to lack of initial training and_
subsequent runner practices.* Skilful, un-'
observed approaches were made in each case
and the attacks pressed home with courage and
resolution, but the results obtained were dis-
appointing.

Delay in reporting Result of frst Striking 2 F ‘orce
Aitack.

21. It js not always appreciated that send
observation on enemy ships by the crews of air-
‘draft im the striking force, is impracticable.
Observations of ‘‘ own drop ’’ even in peacetinie
practices, is very difficult, and under action con-
ditions, quite fortuitous. Succeeding attackers
may, or may not, be able to observe hits from
preceding attacks, but in general the only defi-
nite evidence is the subsequent behaviour of the -
target. On this occasion it was not until the
teturn of the striking force to ARK ROYAL
had afforded an opportunity for the interroga-
tion of all aircraft crews, that the probability
of one hit on the Littorio class was estab-
lished. Subsequent observation of the target
indicated that her speed had not been reduced
to an extent which prevented her keeping in
company with the Cavour class, at about 25
knots, but does not disprove the estimate that
one hit was obtained.

Fighting Efficiency.

22. With ‘the exception of RENOWN, ARK*
ROYAL, SHEFFIELD and the destroyers of
the 8th . Destroyer Flotilla (the (permanent
nucleus of Force ‘‘ H ’’), the remaining ships ~
taking part in the engagement had been drawn
from various stations and in certain cases, met
for the first time just before the action opened.

23. To illustrate: the constant changes” that
have taken place in the composition of Force-
‘HL ” since rst of July, it is of‘interest to note
that the following different ships have at sofne
time or other been included in a this force fae.
operations, viz. :— 3

* Seven capital ships,
Three aircraft carriers,
Thirteen cruisers,
Thirty three destroyers.

24. The fact that ships carried out their action
duties correctly and with the minimum of sig-
nalled instructions is a tribute to the soundness
of our tactical training. in peace ‘and, to ‘the ©
“* Fighting Instructions.’’

Decision to discontinue the Chase.

25. My reasons for deciding that a continu-
ance of the chase offered.no reasonable prospect:
of inflicting damage on the enemy and was ‘not
justified are contained in the Narrative. Had:
I ‘received timely ‘ihformation before breaking”
off the ‘action that some-of-the enemy ‘ships
appeared to have sustained damage, I sheuld.:
have felt -justified in continuing the action for’
a short. period. . But: L-was- not prepared to:
hazard the achievement of my main ‘objective, |
the safe passage of the convoy, unless there was -
substantial assurance. I could’ inflict material -
