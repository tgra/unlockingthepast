SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 MAY, 1948 ©

to pass the track of the Zenit Flight* at a tume
when it was least likely to be operating.
ADVENTURE’s departure was accordingly
delayed to conform with the new programme.
This also gave me time to oil SUFFOLK in
addition to DEVONSHIRE, FURIOUS and
the four destroyers, INTREPID, ESCAPADE,
ANTELOPE and ACTIVE.
13. At midnight ACHATES, in tow of
NTHONY, arrived in harbour and berthed
longside DEVONSHIRE. Before sailing next
yy all possible assistance was given to her,
ngements were made for the accommoda-
tign of her ship’s company, and such measuzes
were taken as were necessary until the Salvage
Officer arrived. In this the local military autho-
Titles gave great assistance. :

(26th July.

14. In addition to the destroyer patrol an
A/S air, patrol was arranged, using SUF-
FOLK’s and DEVONSHIRE’s Walruses.

15. ADVENTURE sailed at 1745 on the
26th July with ANTHONY in company. In
view of the possible presence of an enemy
submarine in the neighbourhood I considered it
unsafe to send her unescorted, at 15 knots.
ADVENTURE had orders to send ANTHONY
back after 24 hours. An air A/S patro] from
SUFFOLK was also told off to accompany her
to the limit ‘of its endurance.

16. Force “‘ P’’ sailed from Seidisfiord at
2300 on the 26th July at 20 knots. An A/S
air patrol had been asked for from the Ad-
miral Commanding, Iceland, and on leaving
Seidisfiord this was provided by a Northrop.
The patrol was later to have been taken over
by a Catalina, but as the weather closed down
the Catalina was not seen. . a
27th July. .

17. At 0345 the’ Force ran into fog. This
continued, except for short intervals, until the
afternoon, after which the visibility varied from
two.to ten miles with low cloud’ overhead.
28th July. 3 é

18. Position ““B’’, where ADVENTURE
should have been overtaken, was reached at
0200 on 28th July. Some time previously the
Force had been spread five miles apart with
the R.D.F. cruiserst on the flanks, thus cover-
ing a front of about 30 miles. Nothing was seen
of ADVENTURE until 0550, and the Squadron
proceeded at 15 knots towards Position ‘‘ X’’.
‘During the period of thick fog I had come to
the conclusion that my orders for Force ‘ Q”’
might produce an uncomfortable situation if
there was fog at “.X”’.

I had accordingly at 2012 on 27th signalied
amended instructions to ECLIPSE regarding
the use of D/Ft procedure in such weather
conditions.

Force ‘‘P”’ was a little ahead of its pro--

gramme and I expected to meet Force ‘'Q”’
about 1200. Up till this time no sights had
been obtained; and not only was the position of
Force “ P’’ doubtful but I knew that ‘Force
“Q's ’’ would also be very doubtful.

19. On arrival in the vicinity of Position
““X’’ a search was commenced. While so
doing the sun appeared and sights were
obtained, and the search was re-arranged. The
Squadron was spread to cover a front of about
40 miles, with aircraft patrolling on the wings
and ahead. At 1515 Force ‘‘ Q’’ was sighted
some twenty miles ahead. With Force “OQ”
was Captain (D), 3rd Destroyer Flotilla. in
INGLEFIELD and ICARUS, who had been
sent to replace ACHATES and ANTHONY.

20. Oiling then took place as follows.
DEVONSHIRE gave 60 tons each to ECHO,
and ECLIPSE who had been the escort for’
Force ‘‘Q’’ and had filled up recently from .
BLACK RANGER. SUFFOLK oiled
ESCAPADE and INTREPID with rs0 tons
each, and BLACK RANGER was ordered to
oil ADVENTURE. Oiling commenced at about

-£820 but unfortunately the wind was from the

south-west and the oiling course was therefore
directly opposite to the future course. During
oiling FURIOUS and VICTORIOUS acted
independently and maintained an A/S patrol
in the air.

2gth July.

az. I estimated from the time taken to oil
the first destroyer that SUFFOLK would com-
plete oiling at 0130. ADVENTURE had only
310 tons to take, but at 0022 she reported she
had received only r50 tons and that it would
take another 16 hours at her present rate of
oiling to complete. She put down the slow ‘rate
to the cooling of the oil. The temperature of the
sea was 50 degs. I did not consider that I
could afford this time and I therefore told her
to discontinue oiling at o130. At 0058
FURIOUS reported: fog-ahead and J imme-
diately gave orders for ADVENTURE to cast
off. She was then 130 tons short.

22. At that time the Force was spread about,
DEVONSHIRE was close to BLACK RANGER
and ADVENTURE, SUFFOLK seven or eight
miles away to the south-westward, FURIOUS
and VICTORIOUS with two aircraft up were
five miles to the southward. Thick fog was met
almost immediately. Previous to this ‘thé
carriers and ADVENTURE had been told that
the Force would be turned to 050 degs. at 15
knots at 0130. On entering the fog I made by
syren ‘‘ course 050 degs.’’, and turned to that
course myself. .I also made course and speed
by low power W/T. As I was uncertain of the
reception of this signal, which was broadcast,
I also made a wireless signal to shore addressed
Force “‘P” giving a rendezvous at 0300 on
3oth July in Position ‘“‘C’’, allowing a speed
of 15 knots to that position. ‘ ‘

23. Nothing more was seen of the Squadron
until ogoo on the 2gth when the aircraft carriers
formed up, followed by SUFFOLK and 6
destroyers at 1047... At that time visibility was .

only about x mile but it shortly increased to

about four or five miles. I was glad to learn
that VICTORIOUS had succeeded in landing
on her aircraft. The Force had been largely
kept together by R.D.F.* and this showed’ of
what immense value R.D.F. can be in such a
situation. ADVENTURE was not sighted until
2150 that night by which time visibility had
increased to ten miles. She was some distance
astern. ot
