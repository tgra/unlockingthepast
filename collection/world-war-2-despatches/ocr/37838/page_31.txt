297. The Retreat across Northern France and
Belgium.—Once the enemy had begun his
retreat to the Seine, the fighter and fighter
bomber forces of A.E.A.F. were presented with
some first-class targets. Low flying attacks
inflicted enormous personnel casualties, while
skeletons of burnt-out transport littered every
road and track and were ample evidence of the
effectiveness of these attacks.

298. During this retreat it was reported more
and more frequently that very large columns
of ambulances were moving to the German
rear. I was almost certain that these ambu-
lances were faked and did, in fact, contain
fighting soldiers and equipment. It was a
critical decision to take as to whether or not
these ambulances should be attacked. You
finally decided against attacking them. Although
we were thereby likely to miss some targets, it
was preferable to win the battle without laying
ourselves open to criticism, however unjustified.
In a number of cases, however, it was found
that ordinary vehicles were intermingled with
the ambulances and these were attacked. It
was significant that whenever this happened,
the doors of the ambulances opened and Ger-
man soldiers poured out in every direction and
made for cover with a speed and agility quite
remarkable for wounded men. Occasionally
too, fire was opened on our aircraft from these
ambulances.

299. At this time, reconnaissances began to
show what was in the circumstances, a relatively
considerable enemy movement on the railways
north-east of the Seine, particularly through
Rheims. This rail movement was apparently
to carry up reserves to stabilise a line, prob-
ably on the Seine or the Marne. I therefore
directed a proportion of the fighter bomber effort
against these movements. The United States
Ninth Air Force fighters, and further east, the
United States Eighth Air Force fighters, did ex-
tremely well against these targets, and this
effort, I believe, virtually broke up the enemy’s
last chance of bringing up sufficient forces to
re-form a line in France,

300. Once the remnants of the enemy divi-
sions had crossed the Seine (and in the cross-
ing they had to run the gauntlet of continuous
air attacks on their ferries) they dispersed
rapidly into a widening area. In consequence
there were fewer and fewer large targets offer-
ing themselves for attack. In the main, there-
fore, fighters and fighter bombers reverted to
direct support of the Allied columns and
ve the enemy rearguards just ahead of
them.

301. In general, I would like to emphasise
again the terrific havoc that was created by the
air forces during the enemy’s withdrawal to and
across the Seine. Thousands of vehicles were
destroyed and from this onslaught the enemy
succeeded in getting away only small sections
of his previously very powerful army.

302. The two outstanding days for the tactical
air forces in this period were 18th and 25th
August. The R.P. fighters and the fighter
bombers of R.A.F. Second Tactical Air
Force particularly claimed many victims, and
the fighter bombers of the United States Ninth
Air Force added their quota. The densest con-
gestion of these enemy concentrations was in the

. subsequent assault

67

Trun-Vimoutieres area, and the wreckage later
found in this area is ample testimony to the
effectiveness of these air attacks.

303. On 25th August, the G.A.F. attempted
in force to protect the efforts of the German
Seventh Army to use the river crossing in the
Rouen area. They were met by the fighters of
the United States Ninth 4ir Force. 77 enemy
aircraft were destroyed in combat and a further
49 were destroyed on the ground. On this and
the subsequent three days, approximately 3,000
vehicles were destroyed and several thousand
dead German soldiers were found among the
wreckage in the area of the Seine crossings.

Attacks on Coastal Garrisons.

304. During the last week in August and
through September, strong bombing forces were
used to reduce the enemy garrisons holding on
to the Atlantic and Channel ports. The attacks
on Brest between 24th August and 6th Septem-
ber were shared by the United States Eighth
and Ninth Air Forces and R.A.F. Bomber Com-
mand. More than 6,000 tons of bombs were
dropped on the garrisons of this city. The
attacks on Le Havre, Boulogne and Calais were
R.A.F. Bomber Command operations, and pro-
vided excellent examples of reduction of a town
by air bombing. This was especially so in the
case of Le Havre. The Allied casualties in the
against a strongly fortified
garrison of 11,000 defenders totalled only 400.
Between 1st and r2th September, 2,042 sorties
were flown against Le Havre alone and 11,000
tons of bombs were dropped, 5,000 tons of this
total being aimed in one massive daylight attack
on an extremely small area.

305. This bombing was undertaken at the ex-
press wish of the Army Commanders and un-
doubtedly it succeeded in paving the way for
and in saving the lives of thousands of our
soldiers in the final assault. It must be re-
corded however, that casualties to French
civilians shut up with the German garrisons in
these ports were inevitably high, particularly
so at Le Havre. I feel, that in the broad view,
this bombing effort would have been more pro-
fitably directed against targets inside Germany,
particularly as the disorganisation of her retreat-
ing army was most acute at this time. I should
have been happier to see it used against focal
points in the communications system behind the
enemy frontier, in an effort to delay the move-
ment of reinforcements with which the enemy

.succeeded, in mid-September, in stabilising a

line along the Rhine and the Moselle.

306. It must also be remembered that the
bombing had to be laid on to suit the Army
plan, and in consequence it was sometimes de-
layed or postponed because the Army could not
always be ready to attack at the agreed time or
because of unfavourable weather conditions over
the target. Bad weather over the target areas
coincided som<iimes with good weather over
Germany. Because the heavy bombers had
been committed to, and were standing by for,
attacks on the garrison towns, opportunities for
using them in good conditions against vital
industrial targets in Germany were lost.

307. The following statistics give the weight of
effort against coastal defences and gun posi-
tions during the month of September. This
