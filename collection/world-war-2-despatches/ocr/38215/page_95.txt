APPENDIX “A’”’.

DEDUCTIONS FROM JAPANESE APPRECIATION OF
THE ATTACK ON SINGAPORE 1937. (See Section VI
paragraph 21).

1. The use of territory in Southern Siam by
the Japanese is a contingency which demands
our careful study. It would enable them both
to cut off our food supplies from Siam and also
to establish Air Forces within striking distance
of Malaya. Naval and Air Forces of sufficient
strength to frustrate such an attempt are neces-
sary. In addition everything possible should
be done by diplomatic methods to keep the
Siamese friendly to.us.

2. The defence of the Northern Area
of Malaya and of Johore is assuming
increased importance. The scale of land-
ing attacks, which was formerly confined
to raids by partes of about 200 men,
has now greatly increased. On the other hand,
the defence of the Northern Area, as far as
the Army is concerned, is still entrusted to the
Federated Malay States Volunteer Force,
assisted by certain units of the Straits Settle-
ments and of the Unfederated Malay States,
while the defence of Johore is entrusted to the
Johore Military Forces, assisted by part of the
Johore Volunteer Engineers.

None of these forces can be considered
adequate in all circumstances for the task in
hand. At least one Regular Infantry Bn., with
R.A. and R.E. attached, is required for the
Penang-Province Wellesley Area, and a similar
force must be available to strengthen the forces
in Southern Malaya.

3. Within Malaya itself the threat from the
enemy within our gates is a very real one and
is rapidly increasing. The possibility of
attempts at sabotage by enemy nationals
resident in Malaya has always been accepted.
The number of these nationals compared with
the strength of the garrison is now so great
that it would be within their powers to do
extensive damagé unless proper precautions are
taken to avoid it.

Recently this threat has been increased by the
danger of civil disturbance. Labour in Malaya
is being organised and the present return to
prosperity provides a fruitful field for paid
agitators.

It must be expected that an enemy would
take advantage of all these conditions and that
military operations would be prefaced by
sabotage, and perhaps by labour troubles, on
a large scale. In these circumstances, it is quite
certain that the Police will be unable to assume
the responsibilities under the Defence Scheme
which hitherto they have accepted. Further

1339
responsibilities would fall on the military for
which Infantry would be required. It might

not bé possible to spare them from the present*
garrison.

4. The problem of the defence of Singapore .
has been greatly affected by the new Combined
Operations equipment recently used by the
Japanese on the China Coasts—in particular,
the special landing craft in large numbers, the
landing craft ‘‘ carriers,” the sea tanks,
etc. The effect of this’ is that large
numbers of men could be put into landing
craft out of range of our fixed defences and
thrown in a short space of time on to our
beaches. In particular the beaches between
Singapore Town and Changi have become more
vulnerable than previously.

A strengthening of our Air Forces, of our
local defence Naval Vessels and of our Beach
Defences is required. In connection with the
latter, it is for consideration whether authority
should not now be sought to erect permanent
defences in peace-time in the Siglap, Ayer
Gomureh and Changi Sectors.

§. The Air Forces ayailable in Malaya must
be strong enough to deal with the scale of
attack indicated in the appreciation and must
be certain of being able to prevent the special
landing craft ‘‘carriers’’ from closing our
shores. They are not at present strong enough.

6. The Local Naval Craft, i.e. destroyers
etc., which it is intended to base on Singapore
are badly needed. Their arrival should not be
delayed. :

7. The probable effect of the fixed and
A/M.T.B. defences, when completed, will be
to act as a deterrent against daylight and
M.T.B. attacks. The greater damage is likely
to be landing attacks under cover of darkness.
To counter this danger more Infantry are re-
quired. Singapore cannot be considered safe
unless reinforcements are brought in before the
attack develops. At least two additional
battalions are required in the Island itself.

Further, the efficiency of the Volunteer units
is still impaired by lack of equipment. It is
suggested that a 3-year plan should be worked
out, aiming at all requisites being available at
the end of that period. If the money cannot
be found under the present system, a new
system must be adopted. :

8. In the light of this appreciation and of
recent information, the food supply situation is
not satisfactory. The only really satisfactory
solution will be to ensure that at any given
time the necessary stocks are available within
Malaya itself.
