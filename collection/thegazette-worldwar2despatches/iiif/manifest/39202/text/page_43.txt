SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951

THE MANPOWER SITUATION IN
“SOUTH EAST ASIA

523. The energetic stepping up of operations
in the Pacific directly against Japan, brought
about a wide variety of circumstances which
combined to deny Air Command, South East
Asia that priority in personnel which the
Command had expected would be forthcoming.

524. Demands in Europe and the Pacific for
shipping ; the sudden announcement, preced-
ing the General Election, to reduce the Over-
seas Tour for Army personnel by approxi-
mately 10 per cent; the operation of the Re-
lease Scheme, and the priority accorded to the
Pacific “Tiger Force”, all adversely reacted
upon Air Command, South East Asia.

525. In May, 1945, the establishment and
strength of the Command for British personnel
were as follows: —

Surplus}
Estab. Strength Deficiencies
Ground Officers 8,103 . 7,573 — 530
Other Ranks ... 105,470 110,459 4,989 = —

526. The 64 per cent. deficiency in ground
officers affected principally the branches in
Administration, Code and Cypher, Tech. (EB)
and Catering. On the other hand, the position
as regards airmen was that the technical trades
carried a surplus of 7,100, whilst the trade of
Clerk G.D. was deficient by not less than 36
per cent., equipment assistants by 20 per cent.
and cooks by 28 per cent.

527. By September, 1945, the position had
so deteriorated that an overall deficiency was
shown, although certain trades continued to

carry a surplus. The strength of personnel
was as follows: —
Surplus]
Estab. Strength —_ Deficiencies
Ground Officers 8,116 7,525 _- 591
Other Ranks ... 123,466 114,419 — 9,047

528. The 7 per cent. deficiency in ground
officers was spread over a great many branches.
Physical Fitness carried a deficiency of 36 per
cent. and Code and Cypher a deficiency of
22 per cent.

529. The overall 8 per cent. deficiency in
other ranks, however, clouded the very large
deficiencies carried in the following trades: —

Clerks Acctg. wee ae 36

. 530. The Command had clearly to take
measures to rectify this weakness if it was to
function administratively, and compulsory mis-
employment of surplus tradesmen and aircrew
was therefore introduced. It was fortunate
that, on the defeat of Japan, an opportunity
was offered for a large scale reduction of estab-
lishments and disbandments to begin.

531. The Release Scheme, coming so soon
after: the cessation of the European War, re-
acted very materially against the Command.
It brought further grave losses in the difficult
trades at a time when the efficient administration
of the Command was essential for the prose-
cution of the war against Japan.

532. An even greater disadvantage was the
fact that it withdrew from the Command the
more senior and experienced personnel. Con-
sequently, while the position in a branch or
trade as far as actual personnel were con-
cerned, may have appeared satisfactory on
paper, it was not always so in actual perform-
ance of work, and efficiency thereby suffered.

Reduction in overseas tour for personnel.

(533. On 6th June, 1945, the War Office
suddenly announced a reduction in the overseas
tour of Army personnel. This factor had every
promise of producing serious repercussions in
South East Asia, in which either coming opera-
tions, or morale, or both, might well have been
affected. The fulfilment of the War Office
announcement was rendered virtually impos-
sible by the Jack of homeward personnel ship-
ping and the congestion in transit camps in
India.

534. To avoid a parallel situation with regard
to the Air Force in this Command, I signalled
the Chief of Staff emphasising that any
announcement of a reduction in overseas tour
for the Air Force would be premature and im-
practicable at this juncture.

535. At the same time, I strongly recom-
mended that shipping and air transport should
be found in order to bring into effect, by Ist
December, 1945, a reduction of tour from four
to three and a half years, for all single officers
and airmen. This reduction was agreed upon
in August in principle, but was not fully
implemented until December.

536. Between May and September, 1945,
some 559 officers and 2,263 airmen left the
Command under the Release Scheme. During
the same period 2,201 officers and 12,932 air-
men were repatriated in addition to those des-
patched on release.

537. The celebration of V.E.-Day in the
Command was a sincere enough occasion for
everyone, though it was only natural that it
did not hold the same high spirit of enthusiasm
for those in the East still fighting the last of
the remaining Axis powers. The announce-
ment that the Burma Star had been inaugurated
gave general satisfaction to personnel serving
in Burma—an award well merited—but person-
nel in India and Ceylon felt that the burden
of their overseas service was not sufficiently
recognised by the award of the Defence Medal.

538. The postal voting scheme for the
General Election in July, 1945, was put into
operation successfully during May and June,
and ballot papers for personnel in South East
Asia were flown out from England by trans-
port aircraft. The papers were given priority
over all other mails handled by R.A.F. Post
Staffs. The total number of completed applica-
tion forms for postal voting received by 25th
June at R.A-F. Post Karachi was 33,500. A last
minute supply of forms to the Cocos Islands,
whose original consignment was ‘mislaid in
transit, produced satisfactory results.

539. Altogether, a total of 30,013 ballot
papers was finally forwarded by air to the U.K.
from the Command. .
