only received their cipher training as operations
proceeded. This involved a great strain on all
‘the trained cipher personnel who worked tire-
lessly for very long hours under difficult condi-
tions throughout the operations.

128. The fact that communications func-
tioned even as well as they did is a tribute not
only to the endless work of the experienced offi-
cers and N.C.Os. but also to all ranks,- who
worked hard during real and active operations
to bring themselves up to the standard which
they eventually reached.

129. Medical.

A remarkable feature of the campaign was
the very low incidence of sickness of both white
and native personnel, having regard to the ter-
rain over which the operations took place. In
the pre-war Kenya Military Report the follow-
ing passage occurs:—

Chapter VI., para. 1 (4th Sub-para.).
Active Service Conditions.

‘One of the outstanding lessons of the last
campaign in East Africa was the unsuitability
of other than native troops for employment on
active service in East Africa. British, South

. Adrican and Indian troops alike had a very high
sick rate and were generally unable to adapt
themselves to local conditions.’’

Yet one South African Brigade, many other
South African technical units, and Imperial
white personnel were continuously in the hot,
low-lying Northern Frontier District of Kenya
from August, through the “‘ little ’”’ rains, until
the advance started, and fought on throughout
it. Their sick rate was never abnormal.

130. The following figures are given as an
indication of the health of the force, up to 5th
April, 1941:—

(a) Admission rate all diseases. 500 per
thousand per annum. (This figure was
2,200 per thousand in the rgx6-r918 E.A.
Campaign.

(b) Death rate from. all diseases. Per
thousand per annum: Europeans 1.8, Non-
Europeans 3.8. From malaria only .28 and
.26. (The similar figure for E.A. Campaign
1916-1918 was 42 per thousand per annum.)
‘No one measure adopted to protect the health

of the troops can be given pride of place. It was
appreciated that under active service conditions
a high degree of efficiency is not attainable by
any one means; reliance was therefore placed
not so much on perfecting any single means as
on bringing to bear as many protective
Ineasures as could be reasonably applied.

131. The lessons of the E.A. Campaign 1916-
1918 on both sides showed the necessity of
ample and balanced diet during operations of
Jong duration. Although, therefore, except on
the few occasions when there was time to buy
and butcher fresh meat, during the advance the
staple bully beef and biscuit formed the basis
of the ration, yet throughout the whole period
the hard scale was supplemented by other items
both more appetising and health producing.

The usual anti-malarial and anti-dysentery
protective measures, and the necessity of disease
prevention generally, were stressed. Credit
must be given to the various medical officers,
on the staff and with units, in that they
were able to bring home to individuals the im-

portance of preventive measures, and the C.Os. D

for their efficient co-operation in seeing that
they were adopted.

132. The evacuation of sick and wounded
from a force continuously advancing with great
rapidity is in any country a source of difficulty.
In country such as East Africa it is not only a
source of difficulty, but one of great anxiety,
since apart from geographical conditions,
a conditions have also to be contended
with.

In the first stages, evacuation was only pos-
sible by air for a limited number of the more
serious cases. The remainder had to go by
Motor Ambulance Convoys for hundreds of
miles. Later evacuation by Motor Ambulance
Convoys was only necessary as far as the ports
of Chisimaio, Mogadiscio and Berbera, whence
it was effected by Hospital Ship.

Throughout the operations there was no hitch
in the attention to, and the care and evacuation
of, the sick and wounded.

It will be clear that at all stages of the opera-
tions, for most casualties long and trying
evacuation by bad tracks was unavoidable. I
had continually stressed the need of air ambu-
lances for this particular campaign, but the
demand on production for fighting aircraft pre-
cluded their supply. Had the casualties. not
been low, the lack of air ambulances would
have caused great suffering.

133. I wish to bring to notice the high stan-
dard of work and unfailing devotion to duty
of all the Medical staff and personnel of the
force, and I feel that the very satisfactory
medical situation owed much to the great ex-
perience and practical knowledge of Brigadier
A. J. Orenstein, C.M.G., LL.D., M.D.,
MLR.C.P. the D.M.S. of East Africa Force.

134. Transport.

Right up to the time of the occupation of
Addis Abeba it was necessary to keep open
the whole length of the 1,900 mile road L of C
to the base at Nairobi for use by motorised
units and M.T. convoys who had to move on
all or any part of it.

It will be apparent that with the enormous
distance of road L of C involved, an immense
amount of work was demanded from the M.T.
Companies of the Force. Long and con-
tinuous driving over indifferent roads and sand
tracks in high temperatures must have been a
considerable strain. It was borne by South
African, East African and West African drivers
alike with a willing and cheerful devotion to
duty that is beyond praise.

135. To the mobile and static workshops that
repaired and kept the M.T. vehicles on the
road, praise is no less due. Their work was
never ending and often had to be carried out
under very trying conditions.

Part IV.—Conc.usion.

136. The campaign up to the capture of
Addis Abeba resulted in ‘the occupation or re-
occupation of 360,000 square miles of territory,
the freeing of British Somaliland, and the cap-
ture of the enemy's capital. Forty thousand
prisoners were ieft in our hands, and many
more are still coming in. Reliable information
showed that including desertion and other
causes, at least 75,000 of the enemy’s armed
forces had been rendered non-effective. For
this result I must pay tribute to the Com-
manders and Staffs for their skilful planning
