Enemy Air Activity.

The only air attacks this day were in the
Acip area, There were continuous though
ineffective raids during the night 12th/13th
July, as well as the usual dawn attack. The
most serious incident occurred a little before
noon when two fighter bombers scored hits
on S.S. THOMAS PICKERING in the after
hold. The ship, which had only arrived earlier
in the morning, became a total loss.

Shortly before midnight intermittent attacks
with bombs and torpedoes on the empty per-
sonnel ships from Syracuse caused some con-
fusion but no damage or casualties. _

Augusta.—The naval port party returned
during the forenoon. The town was found
deserted with considerable damage at the
northern end but none at the southern end.
There was no power and a shortage of water.

The conditions in the harbour varied in one
part and another. Only the northern entrance
was open, but there was a four hundred foot
quay with twenty-two feet of water alongside
and ample berthing for all types of landing
ship. The Carlo del Molo harbour and jetties
were, however, found to be completely ob-
structed. The floating dock was undamaged
and, in addition to one large oil carrier and
three small petrol carriers, lighters were
available though without means of towage.

Commando landing—After dark H.MS.
PRINS ALBERT successfully landed No. 3
Commando with little loss near Murazzo
Point, north of Augusta. H.M.S. TETCOTT,
escorting, effectively engaged a battery which
opposed the landing and also sank one of three
E-boats* which attacked.
