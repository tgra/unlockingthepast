tons of H.E. bombs were dropped on the coastal
battery at St. Martin de Varreville, with excel-
lent results. These results, reported by A.P.I.S.
Medmenham, after a photographic reconnais-
sance sortie made on 29th May, were confirmed
by a captured German report made by the
troop commander of the battery. The two
reports are given below for comparison.

Captured German Report,
The position is covered with craters .

Several direct hits with very heavy bombs were
made on No. 3 shelter (casemate) which
apparently burst open and then collapsed.

; The rest of the shelters remain
undamaged.

. . . . the iron equipment hut which con-
tained signals apparatus, the armoury, the
gas chamber and artillery instruments
received a direct hit, and only a few twisted
iron girders remain.

i . . the men’s canteen received several
direct hits and was completely destroyed.
The messing huts, containing the battery
dining room, the kitchen and clerks’ office,
were completely destroyed by near misses.
A concrete-built hot shower bath was com-
pletely destroyed by a direct hit; as well as
the nearby joiner’s shop.

thirty-two of which were in the assault area,
only six sites in the area and sixteen outside
were attacked. Some of the batteries were
allotted to two commands.

ror. In addition to the targets listed in the
plan, many other coastal defence targets in and
out of the area were attacked as targets of
opportunity.

102. During the hours of darkness preceding
the actual assault, a tremendous air bombard-
ment was directed on to the batteries which
could not be destroyed within the assault area,
aimed at neutralising them during the critical
assault period. This the attacks succeeded in
doing. Details of the effort employed are given
in Part III (c) of this Despatch.
