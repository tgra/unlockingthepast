Hitherto the defence of the island had been
considered only on the basis of attack from
the West. But now it was necessary to provide
against a possible attack by an enemy estab-
lished in Turkey. In these changed circum-
stances, General Wavell had determined to in-
crease the garrison of Cyprus, and I decided
to adhere to his plan by reinforcing the troops
there as soon as possible by one division. The
Minister for Defence and the Chiefs of Staff
approved this plan accepting the principle that
measures to ensure the retention of Cyprus being
part of the consolidation of our position in
the North, must come before the offensive in
the Western Desert.

Accordingly on the 12th July I decided to
send to Cyprus the 50th Division (Major-General
W. H. Ramsden), just arriving from England,
and also the 3rd Hussars (less one Squadron)
to replace the 7th Australian Divisional Cavalry
Regiment as a mobile armoured reserve. The
move of these troops and go days reserves of
supplies and munitions was completed by the
2gth August thanks to the efficient arrangements
made by the Royal Navy.

Work on the construction of the defences be-
gan at once and is now approaching completion.

At the end of October the 5th Indian Division
relieved the 50th Division in order to release
a British Division for service in the Caucasus.
This relief took place without incident between
the 2nd and the 8th November, again owing
to the efforts of the Royal Navy,

I wish to record my appreciation of the sound
judgment and energy shown by Major-General
Ramsden in his direction of the preparation of
these defences and of the excellent work done
by the 50th Division in their construction. I
would also like to add my appreciation of the
unfailing help and co-operation of the Governor
of Cyprus, H.E. Sir William Battershill,
K.C.M.G., and of the acting Governor, Captain
J. V. 'W. Shaw, both of whom did everything
in their power to assist the work.

Tran.

13. While the work of consolidation in Syria
was still in its initial stages, it was becoming
increasingly evident that it would be necessary
to eliminate German influence in Iran.

For some time past nationalist feeling in that
country had been rising against Great Britain
and Russia and by the end of 1939 there was a
well organised German community of about
three thousand, almost every one of whom could
be relied upon to give as much of his attention
to the desi; of the Fatherland as to the
technical work on which he was ostensibly en-

The expulsion of the Germans had been the
subject of an-exchange of views between London
and Moscow, and between the War Office, Com-
mander-in-Chief, India, and myself for some
time, when on the 24th July, I received a cable
from the Chiefs of Staff informing me that there
was general agreement that the Germans must
be expelled as soon as possible. If joint British
and Russian diplomatic pressure were unavail-
ing, both Powers were intending to take joint
military action to enforce their demands.

‘The enterprise entailed the loan of troops from
the Middle East as well as the release of the roth
Indian Division from North-eastern Syria. On

SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 21 AUGUST, 1946

the agth July I arrived in England and had the
opportunity of discussing, among other matters,
the méasuréof support the Middle East could
afford. I was reluctant to spare more troops
than absolutely necessary because of the heavy
demands for garrison duties and because it
would upset the re-organisation and re-equip-
ment essential to the early resumption of the
offensive in the Western Desert. But the success
of the operation was of the greatest importance
e the common defence of India and the Middle
ast.

The scale of assistance required from the
Middle East grew, in the first place because
it was feared that trouble might develop in
Iraq and then because it was believed that the
Tranians were likely to offer considerable re-
sistance. First I despatched the 9th Armoured
Brigade (late 4th Cavalry Brigade) still
organised on a truck basis only. The 5th Indian
Division (less the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade
Group and one field regiment) followed.

Fears of serious resistance however proved
groundless, and the 5th Indian Divisional
Column had only reached a point about 50
miles within Iraqi territory when the Iranians
gave in, The march of the column continued,
however, as the Division was needed in Iraq
until another arrived from India.

At dawn on the 25th August Russian troops
entered Iran from the north and, occupying
Tabriz, advanced along the south-western shore
of the Caspian, while our troops entered from
Iraq in the Ahwaz-Abadan area and in two
colurans from Khaniqin. The oth Armoured
Brigade formed part of the northern column
which rapidly overcame opposition in the Paitak
Pass and reached Shahbad on the morning of
the 27th August. The Persians offered little real
opposition either to the British or the Russian
advance, and on the 28th August the Shah
ordered all resistance to cease.

On the 8th October the gth Armoured Brigade
returned from Teheran, and on the 18th October
the last elements of the 5th Indian Division
also reached the Middle East.

TURKEY.

14. Turkey’s reactions to German threats had
always been of the greatest moment to our-
selves, and now that we had a common frontier
her attitude was of even greater consequence.
The end of the Syrian campaign and the pacifi-
cation of Iraq were causes of relief to Turkey
because our forces were now in direct contact
with her southern frontiers. The outbreak of
the Russo-German War, however, caused her
misgiving since our new ally was her traditional
enemy.

It was most important that the Turks should
offer the utmost resistance to a German invasion.
From a purely strategical point of view the
country fell naturally into our defensive system,
as in it the enemy’s communications would be
most vulnerable to attack, and I was anxious
to be able to engage the enemy before he
emerged from the mountains of Anatolia into
the plains of Syria and Iraq. I was therefore
glad when at the end of July, the Chief of
the Turkish General Staff, on behalf of the
President, made a tentative approach, having
as its object the renewal of staff talks on the
lines of those held in the Spring. Unfortunately
this step was abruptly revoked, the Turkish
General Staff having reason to believe that their
