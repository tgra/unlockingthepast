SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 5 FEBRUARY, 10948

had committed the error of throwing his tanks
against well-emplaced anti-tank guns. Our
defensive success was a good omen for the
attack on the Mareth line. Medenine was
Rommel’s last battle in Africa. Shortly after-
wards (before roth March) he handed over com-
mand of the Army Group to von Arnim. The
latter was succeeded at 5 Panzer Army Head-
quarters by General von Vaerst who had com-
manded, without much distinction, 15 Panzer
Division in Africa up to September, 1942.
It seems certain that Rommel’s return to
Germany was genuinely due to sickness, but
no doubt also the German High Command
wanted to run no risk of the capture of a
General with so great a reputation.

In spite of the failure at Medenine the enemy
were unwilling to be forced back on the defen-
sive and on roth March launched a sudden and
violent attack against ‘‘L’’ Force at
Ksar Rhilane. This outpost in the desert west
of the Matmata mountains was assuming
greater importance for, as I shall explain,
we already had plans for passing an
outfanking force through the desert.
The attack was made by the reconnaissance
units of 15 and 2r Panzer Divisions and some
Italian mobile units, assisted by dive-bombers.
General Leclerc’s force, which included a
Greek detachment, stood firm in a style
reminiscent of Koenig’s defence of Bir Hacheim
and, strongly supported by the Western
Desert Air Force, beat off the attack with sub-
stantial losses to the enemy. I think the main
purpose of this attack was to win some offen-
sive success, even a small one, as his persistence
in the north showed, the enemy stil] hoped to
keep us at bay as long as possible by reiterated
attacks * He showed, however, a certain
apprehension about our intentions in the area
between Gafsa and Faid, and drew off the
greater part of his southern group of armour
north of the Gabes gap to watch that flank.

On 14th March I issued a directive on policy
to confirm my previous instructions on the
way in which I wanted the battle in Tunisia
to be fought; it was co-ordinated with a brief
statement on Air Force policy by Air Marshal
Coningham{. I had taken II United States
Corps under direct command on 8th March,
leaving the French XIX Corps under First
Army, so that I was now dealing with three
subordinate headquarters. I proposed also to
form an Army Group reserve to be commanded
by Headquarters 9 Corps which had just
arrived in Africa; it was intended to consist
of 6 Armoured Division, one British infantry
division and specialist troops such as para-
chutists and commandos whom I was anxious
to pull out of the line. I laid particular stress,
for the benefit of First Army, on the policy
of not attempting to hold a continuous line
over all the mountainous areas of the front
but of concentrating on the defence of really
vital positions and leaving the areas in between
to be observed by patrols. This was for the
present defensive phase, which I hoped soon
to be able to abandon, but even while on the
defensive I ordered an offensive spirit to be
shown in small actions to improve our

* In a signal on 12th March, giving my apprecia-
tion of the enemy situation, I concluded ‘‘ For
Rommel’s general intentions see Revelations XII,
zz’, (‘The devil 1s come down unto you, having
great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but
a short time.’’) ¥

positions. It was an advantage that we had
now begun to sort out the troops originally
under General Anderson into thew respective
national units and given a definite sector to
each nationality.

On x5th March I moved my headquarters
fo a tented site on a well wooded mountain
side south of Ain Beda. This was on the main
road from Constantine to Tebessa, well situated
between First and Eighth Armies and close to
Headquarters II Corps, which was near
Tebessa. For the present, operations in the
south were the most important.

The Mareth Line Battles.

As a defensive position the Mareth line was
almost as strong as the enemy line at El
Alamein. The Eighth Army plan, therefore,
called for a deltberate and well organized attack
with all the forces which we could maintain
forward. General Montgomery sent me an ad-
vanced copy of his proposed plan on 27th
February. For PUGILIST, as the operation
was called, Eighth Army was to be organized
for the frontal attack in two Corps, 30 Corps
with 50, 51 and 4 Indian Divisions and zor
Guards Brigade, and ro Corps with r and 7
Armoured Divisions. The plan was that 30
Corps should make a very heavy attack on the
north-eastern end of the hne, near the coast, to
break into and roll up the line from the right, ro
Corps, which would be initially in Army re-
serve, would then be ready to exploit success by
passing through and advancing towards Gabes
and Sfax. There was a difference, however,
between the situation here and at Alamein in
that we had now proved, thanks to the Long
Range Desert Group, that we could move an
outflanking force through the desert west of
the Matmata mountains. Provision was ac-
cordingly made for this in the plan; the out-
flanking troops consisted mainly of the New
Zealand Division but included also 8
Armoured Brigade and General Leclerc’s ‘ L”’
Force and for this reason were designated New
Zealand Corps. The object of this force was
defined as to establish itself across the Gabes—
Matmata road so as to cut off the enemy and
prevent his escape, in order to do this 1t would
have to break through a subsidiary defensive
hne, mainly consisting of minefields, which the

“enemy had constructed between the Gebel

Tebaga and the Gebel Melab.

In the plan as fixed on 26th February
General Montgomery stated that D-day for the
attack would be 2oth March. This apparently
long delay was rendered necessary by his
desire to have all the logistical preparations
perfect. I sent my Major-General, Adminustra-
tion, Major-General Miller, to Tripoh on
6th March to investigate the adminis-
trative situation and his report on his
return on rith March was very  satis-
factory. The port was discharging over
three thousand tons per day, to be shortly
raised to four thousand tons, (on 6th March
seven thousand tons were discharged, but this
was exceptionally good); the ration, petrol and
ammunition situation was therefore good and
we could already assume as certain that the
operation could proceed-according to tme-table.
Eighth Army was anxious to know, however,
what logistical support we could give in the
case that the enemy, after a prolonged
resistance on the Mareth line, broke completely
and we should wish to pursue him for a long
