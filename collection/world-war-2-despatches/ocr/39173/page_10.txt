of a reasonable size presented themselves,
notably Rangoon, Moulmein, Bassein, Insein
and Prome. The Aircraft Factory and Arsenal
at Bangkok received many hits from the 106
tons of bombs aimed at it. When considering
the relative lightness of the attack, allowance
must be made for the distance involved, which
is equivalent to a return flight from London to
Tunis.

65. While I had not originally planned to
use strategic bombers in close support of
ground troops, the Commanders on ali three
sectors of the front requested their help and
were accorded it. I have dealt with these
operations in more detail in the section de-
voted to Army Support, where it will be seen
that the greater proportion were in direct
support of IV Corps in front of Imphal.
Wellingtons were initially employed on this
task by daylight, with fighter escort, since the
Mitchells (B.25) could more usefully be
employed on sweeps along the various
Lines of Communication. Subsequently, when
Wellington crews had to be withdrawn for air
supply duties, the Liberators (B.24) were used
in a similar daylight rdle. This méthod of
employment of strategic bombers was all the
more acceptable to me since monsoon condi-
tions made night bombing wellnigh impossible.
The frequency of these attacks increased, and
by the end of May No. 231 Group alone had
been able to achieve the creditable total of
646 short tons of bombs dropped on Army
Support targets.

66. The above duties of Strategic Air Force

involved the dropping, from January onwards,
of 6,741 short tons of bombs, of which R.A.F.
and U.S.A.A.F. dropped almost equal propor-
ea, The distribution of this effort was as
‘ollows :

67. The Strategic Air Force carried out one
more duty during the period, the reinforce-
ment with crews and aircraft of the transport
squadrons maintaining the life-line to forces
cut off on the Imphal Plain. On 19th May
forty Wellington crews were attached to Troop
Carrier Command to help the over-worked
crews there, and five aircraft and crews were
detailed to carry 250-Ib. bombs to the tactical
squadrons operating at high pressure in the
Imphal Plain. Despite bad weather, 544
bombs were delivered by 31st May. In the
same period, No. 490 U.S. (Mitchell) Squadron
delivered 380 tons of ammunition to the forces
defending Imphal. The offensive power which
these loads represented contributed to the
eventual breaking of the Japanese offensive
and enabled the normal transport aircraft to
concentrate on delivering jother supplies of
which the Army was in urgent need.

IV.—SuprorT OF GROUND Forces

68. Operations on land were renewed and
maintained on a large scale during this period,
so that there were greatly increased oppor-
tunities for giving support to our land forces.

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951

The fact that we possessed and held air
superiority enabled full advantage to be taken
of these opportunities, and throughout the big
battles—first in Arakan and then in Manipur
and around Myitkyina—ground support
reached dimensions which absorbed a large
part of the total effort.

69. The successful provision of direct sup-
port to our armies in this theatre is faced by
two great difficulties. The first of these is the
nature of the terrain over which the fighting
was taking place. Much of it is close, densely
wooded, or covered with thick undergrowth,
so that the recognition of targets presents a
problem to even the most experienced crews.
The second is the nature and characteristics
of the enemy as a fighter on the ground. Three
things distinguish him: his tenacity and
stamina, which enable him to take great
punishment from the air and still retain his
fighting spirit; his skill in camouflaging his
positions and dumps, which makes it very
difficult to locate them from the air or the
ground ; and his beaver-like propensity for dig-
ging himself into the ground by excavations
that range from a number of shallow fox-
holes to hold one or two men to an elaborate
system of bunkers unharmed by all but direct
hits from heavy bombs. By virtue indeed of
the nature of each, the terrain and the enemy
are strikingly suited to each other.

70. The difficult nature of the terrain and
the enemy’s complementary skill in camou-
flage were overcome, to a great extent, by
the intimate knowledge that aircrews came to
have of the country over which they were
operating. Another aid to target recognition
was the use of artillery or mortar smoke shells.
The enemy, however, on several occasions put
down diversionary smoke to mislead our air-
craft. One remedy to this ruse is the employ-
ment of coloured smoke which has recently
arrived in the theatre.

71. The enemy’s capacity for absorbing
punishment from the air without losing his
will to continue fighting was countered by the
application to his positions of a fire-power
or a bomb-load of such a magnitude as would
seem in a European theatre to be out of
proportion to the objects it was hoped to
achieve, having regard to the forces available.

72. Such a concentration of bombs over
any area held -by the enemy also helped in
finding an answer to the gift of the enemy
for camouflage and to the fact that the terrain
lends itself to concealment. An area was
often found to contain more bunkers than

even the most careful and thorough recon-

naissance had disclosed. If these attacks were
confined to pinpoint bombing of those bunkers
whose existence was known, then when the
bombing ceased and ground troops followed
up, other enemy positions were found un-
touched by the bombardment. _ For instance,
at Kyaukchaw, attacked on 17th January by
heavy bombers, it was thought even after
bombing had taken place that there were only
three bunkers, whereas there were actually
eight. Only complete saturation of an area
can ensure a chance of all bunkers being hit
or the troops in them being at least held
down.

73. The problem presented by the strength
and depth of many of the enemy’s bunker
positions was never properly solved. The
