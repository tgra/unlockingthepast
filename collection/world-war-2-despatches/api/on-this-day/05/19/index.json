This meeting discussed (1) Temporary maintenance of the B.E.F. through Dunkirk, Calais and Boulogne, and (2) Evacuation of personnel through Dunkirk, Calais and Boulogne. Under this last item was included, amongst other items, the problem of   the hazardous evacuation of very large Forces.  This was considered  to be unlikely.  (This problem ultimately became that of Operation  \" Dynamo  ),"

The Strategic Air Force carried out one more duty during the period, the reinforcement with crews and aircraft of the transport squadrons maintaining the life-line to forces cut off on the Imphal Plain. On 19th May forty Wellington crews were attached to Troop Carrier Command to help the over-worked crews there, and five aircraft and crews were detailed to carry 250-Ib. bombs to the tactical squadrons operating at high pressure in the Imphal Plain. Despite bad weather, 544 bombs were delivered by 31st May. In the same period, No. 490 U.S. (Mitchell) Squadron delivered 380 tons of ammunition to the forces defending Imphal. The offensive power which these loads represented contributed to the eventual breaking of the Japanese offensive and enabled the normal transport aircraft to concentrate on delivering jother supplies of which the Army was in urgent need."

The bridge was not completed until 2tst May but the attack on the main position was carried out by 1/6 K.A.R. on 19th May. This action was distinguished by the way in which an enemy counter-attack, which was supported by M.II medium and light tanks and armoured cars, was broken up befbre it properly materialised. In spite of having no anti-tank guns and only anti-tank rifles on a very reduced scale, the native troops destroyed the counter-attack with great loss to the enemy, and as a result of a most dashing charge, captured a number of prisoners and tanks. One medium tank was captured single-handed by a British N.C.O. who climbed on to the back of the tank, opened the top of the turret and killed all the crew with his revolver. The other tanks then turned tail, presumably because, as it was afterwards discovered, their commander was killed in the captured tank."

In July, 1939, approval was given for the embodiment of the Reserve; and the outbreak of war with Germany found the Somaliland Camel Corps (still at the strength given in paragraph 1) disposed so that the towns of Burao and Hargeisa were covered by mounted units, while the Sheikh Pass and Tug Gap were held by dismounted companies and machine-guns. In October a very valuable reinforcement of 17 officers and 20 Warrant and Non-Commissioned officers was received from Southern Rhodesia. No other reinforcements reached the Protectorate till 15th May, 1940. The Governor's request to be allowed to enlist 50 additional men in the Camel Corps, made on 15th September, 1939, was not approved till the spring of 1940, some six months later. A recommendation submitted by myself to the War Office on 15th January, 1940, to mechanize two Camel Corps Companies was not approved until 19th May, 1940.*"

Conimunications by road and rail over the Sonime at Abbeville were still holding on 19th May and the town was being placed in a state of defence with such resources as were available, mainly. units of r2th Division. However, there was little doubt that enemy armoured forces in-that area, which at the time I estimated at five armoured divisions, would shortly break through to the coast."

On the night of 19/2oth May they took up positions on the line of the Escaut as far south as Bouchain; but at that point, instead of continuing to hold that tiver towards Cambrai (which according to my information was not held in strength by the enemy) they had drawn back westwards along the river Sens e. Thus in the quadrilateral Maulde Valenciennes Arleux Douai, some nineteen miles by ten, there was assembled the bulk of the French 1st Army, amounting to three Corps of two divisions and two divisions in reserve a total of eight divisions. The Commander of the French 3rd Corps, General de la Laurencie, remained that night in close touch with General Mason-MacFarlane, at the headquarters of Macforce."

On the other hand, the character of the operation had now radically altered with the arrival of German troops in Amiens. The picture was now no longer that of a line bent or temporarily broken, but of a besieged fortress. To raise such a siege, a relieving force must be sent from the south and to meet this force a sortie on the part of the defenders was indicated."
