Italian forces. The 12th Indian Infantry
Brigade was moved up from Nibeiwa to near
the Tummar camps, while the 5th Indian
Infantry Brigade completed the occupation of
Tummar East.

At about 0730 hours the right battalion of
the 16th Brigade; 2nd Battalion Leicester Regi-
ment, engaged a defended Italian camp and
captured it, after a short fight, with about 2,000
prisoners of the 4th Blackshirt Division. Mean-
while the remainder of the 16th Infantry
Brigade continued their advance in a violent
dust storm, ' They suffered some casualtjes from
enemy fire but continued to push on, and were
assisted by the arrival of some Io tanks of the
7th R.T.R. which over-ran some enemy guns.
The 11th Indian Infantry Brigade moved up
on the right flank uf the 16th Brigade.

20. At about 1330 hours the Commander of
the 4th Indian Division was at 16th Infantry
Brigade Headquarters and ordered an attack
on Sidi Barrani, placing part of rrth Indian
Infantry Brigade under Brigadier Lomax. This
attack was launched at 1615 hours by the 2nd
Queen’s on the right and 2nd Cameron High-
landers, on the left, supported by artillery fire,

some tanks of the 7th R.T.R., and by an attack,

by 2nd R.T.R. (cruiser tanks) North of the
Sidi-Barrani-Buq Buq road. The attack was
completely successful, and Sidi Barrani was
in our hands when darkness fell, many
prisoners and guns being captured.

ai. The force organised from Matruh Gar-
rison had advanced towards Maktila camp
and established itself two miles East of Maktila
by the evening of the 8th December. This
force was a composite one, in which the 3rd
Battalion Coldstream Guards was the only
complete unit. Detachments of Royal Artil-
lery, 7th Hussars (light tanks), ist Durham
Light Infantry, Ist South Staffords, machine
gunners from 1st Royal Northumberland Fusi-
jers and ist Cheshires, as well as a number
of dummy tanks, made up the balance. It re-
mained in observation of Maktila camp until
the afternoon of the 9th December, when, learn-
ing that Nibeiwa had been captured, Brigadier
Selby gave orders to move forward and en-
deavour to prevent the withdrawal Westwards
of the rst Libyan Division. Owing to the com-
parative weakness of the force and difficult
going, it was unable to prevent the withdrawal
of the enemy towards Sidi Barrani, but pur-
sued them with all possible speed on the roth
December.

The situation at nightfall on the roth De-
cember was that Sidi Barrani had been cap-
tured and the 2nd Libyan and 4th Blackshirt
Divisions destroyed. East of Barrani, however,
the ist Libyan Division from Maktila was still
of some fighting value, and an enemy camp
at Point 90 had not been attacked and remained
intact.

22. On the evening of the roth December
General O’Connor issued instructions to the
Armoured Division to send a force early the
following day to prevent any enemy withdrawal
from the Sofafi area; to send another force
to Bug Buq to deal with any enemy in that
direction; and in the event of further retreat
to pursue the enemy towards Halfaya, Sidi
Omar and Sollum.

6. Exploitation after Sidi Barrani.
23. I had always intended if possible to
send the 4th Indian Division to reinforce the

SUPPLEMENT to THe LONDON GAZETTE, 26 JUNE, 1946

Sudan during the winter 1940/41, in order to
enable our forces in the Sudan to recapture
Kassala and to take the offensive against the
enemy. I had proposed to relieve them in
the Western Desert by the 6th Australian Divi-
sion as soon as this was ready and equipped.
For several reasons, the principal of which was
the availability of shipping, I had to decide
while the battle of Sidi Barrani was still in
progress whether or not to carry out this relief.
There was an opportunity to do so after the
operations of the r1th December and the
capture of Sidi Barrani, since the supply organi-
sation would only permit of a very limited force
being used for further pursuit of the enemy.
I decided therefore to withdraw the 4th Indian
Division and to replace it by the 6th Aus-
tralian Division as soon as this could be brought
forward. The 16th Infantry Brigade, which
had been attached to the 4th Indian Division,
remained in the forward area available for
pursuit.

I should have liked also to employ the New
Zealand Brigade Group which had been in
the forward area for some time and was avail-
able, but the New Zealand Division itself was
not complete, one brigade being in the United
Kingdom, and I knew that it was the wish of
the New Zealand Government that the divi-
sion should be employed as a whole if possible.

24. From the rrth December onwards the
operations consisted of a pursuit by 7th
Armoured Division, followed up by 16th Infan-

‘try Brigade.

The 7th Armoured Division advanced at
first in two main groups, the 7th Armoured Bri-
gade North of the escarpment towards Sollum
and the 4th Armoured Brigade South of the
escarpment towards Halfaya, Sidi Omar and
Capuzzo, On the afternoon of the 11th De-
cember 7th Armoured Brigade made contact
with a long enemy column between Buq Buq
and Sollum. It promptly attacked and by
dusk had secured 14,000 prisoners, 68 guns and
much other material. By the 15th December
all enemy troops had been driven out of Egypt,
and the 7th Armoured Division had concen-
trated South-West of Bardia. The 4th
Armoured Brigade now cut the Bardia-Tobruk
road while the Support Group engaged the
Western and South-Western defences of Bardia.
Meanwhile, the 16th Infantry Brigade moved
up to the South-East face of the Bardia peri-
meter, to cover our use of Sollum harbour. The
greater part of the Italian army remaining in
Cyrenaica had withdrawn within the defences
of Bardia, which was now isolated. It was
decided to capture Bardia with the 6th Aus-
tralian Division as soon as ready, while 7th
Armoured Division protected their left flank
and prevented any movement along the Bardia-
Tobruk road.

25. This ended the first phase of the opera-
tion, which may be called the Battle of Sidi
Barrani. It had resulted in the destruction of

, the greater part of five enemy divisions. Over

38,000 prisoners, 400 guns, some 50 tanks and
much other war material had been captured.
Our own casualties were only 133 killed, 387
wounded and 8 missing. ‘
26. This outstanding success may be attri-
buted to—
(a) Good co-operation between the three
Services;
(b) Effect of surprise;
