The enemy counter- attacked, but, generally, we retained the ground taken. On the night of the 1st January the assault was resumed, again to the east, of the main road. The enemy resisted stubbornly and inflicted a number of casualties on our tanks which led the attack. This bold night"

During the period, February, 1943, to January, 1944, Royal Engineer work- shops produced inter alia 2,660,000 forty- gallon petrol drums and, including Jerricans, 5,400,000 four-gallon returnable petrol con- tainers. The output of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers\u2019 base workshops was greater in December than in February, 1943, and included over 300 tanks, 600 armoured cars, scout cars or carriers, 3,500 \u2018\u2018 B\u2019\u2019 vehicles and 6,000 \u2018\u2018B\u2019\u2019 vehicle engines. Similarly, the activity in ordnance installations during the quarter ending 31st December, 1943, was greater than during the quarter ending 31st March, 1943. Nearly 150,000 tons of ammuni- tion were received compared with 135,000 tons; 113,000 tons of ammunition were issued com- pared with 102,000 tons; while 173,000 tons of stores were received compared with 148,000 tons."

            "description": "The Buerat position was not particularly strong and could easily ibe outflanked. East of the village was the broad and difficult Wadi Bey el Kebir and west of it the Wadi Zem Zem; it was on the latter that the enemy established his main position, which was less than twenty- five miles in length. It was a subject of con- siderable conjecture at the trme why Rommel should have decided on standing where he did tather than further back, in particular on the naturally very strong line from Tarhuna to Homs. The reason, as it now appears, was that the Axis had decided to evacuate the whole of Tripolitania and concentrate all ther resources on the defence of Tunisia. The de- cision had been made by 31st December. Strategically the intention was sound; the Ger- man High Command believed that it would be possible to hold a permanent bridgehead in Tunisia which could tie down our forces there and continue to maintain the barrier in the Mediterranean communications at the Sicilian narrows. Naturally the more time that could be obtained for the purpose of evacuation the better and the mobile rearguard would there- fore await our attack as far forward as was safe. The Italian infantry divisions began \u2018to move back in the first week in January and shortly afterwards the Trieste Division, includ- ing the remains of all the Italian divisions destroyed at Alamein, and 21 Panzer Division"

            "description": "244. The Directorate of Civil Defence \u2014To- wards the end of December the Cabinet Rep- resentative in the Far East proposed the forma- tion of a Directorate of Civil Defence under a Director General. I was asked if I would be willing to make my Chief Engineer, Brigadier I. Simson, available for the appoint- ment of Director-General. Although ] was loath to lose the services of so important an officer at this juncture, I agreed to make Brigadier Simson available provided he re- tained concurrently the appointment of Chief Engineer. This provision was made in his own interests and for financial reasons. In sending my reply I expressed the opinion that the organization which would result from the proposed new Directorate was faulty because it cut across the existing organization and would lead to a clash of responsibility between the Director General of Civil Defence and the Secretary for Defence. Nevertheless, the Directorate was created on the 31st December, Brigadier Simson being appointed Director- General and Mr. F. D. Bisseker, the General Manager of the Penang Smelting Works and the Senior Unofficial Member of the Legislative Council, Deputy Director-General. Mr. Bisseker, was also appointed Director of Labour and Transport. ."
