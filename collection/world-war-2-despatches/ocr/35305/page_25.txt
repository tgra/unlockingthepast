SUPPLEMENT 10 tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1941 5923

The remaining infantry brigade of 48th
Division (43rd) was later placed under 2nd
Corps, and a pioneer battalion sent to begin
preparations for the defence of Ypres in case

elgian measures for the purpose should prove
inadequate.

The Belgians had at this time one division

- in reserve between Menin and Ypres, and this
was ordered to counter-attack at 2:p.m. “How-
ever it is doubtful whether it was found possible
ever to launch this counter-attack. Orders were
also issued for the Belgian xst Corps to come
into line on the right of their 4th Corps between
Ghelewe and Ledeghem ; this move was carried
out on the 26th May.

Sir John Dill (who had now become C.I.G.S.)
and whom I had asked to visit me, ‘arrived on
the morning of 25th May, and I explained the
pesson to him. He then telegraphed to the
rime Minister and to the Secretary of State,
that there could be no disguising the seriousness
of the situation. He added that in his opinion
the proposed counter-attack to the south could
not be an important affair in view of the enemy
attacks which had penetrated the Belgian
defences. .

General Blanchard arrived during Sir John

- Dill’s visit and took part in our discussions.

During the day the Belgians continued to
withdraw in a north-westerly direction under
enemy pressure. Reports also indicated that a
fresh enemy attack would take place next day
on the northern end of the Lys position.

OPERATIONS—THIRD PHASE
26th-31st MAY

The decision taken, in agreement with the French,
to withdraw behind the Lys. H.M. Government
authorises withdrawal tothe coast. The Dunkirk
perimeter organised by Str Ronald Adam.
The Belgians ask for an armistice. General
Blanchard at first determines to remain in
position but later French 3rd and Cavalry Corps
withdraw to Dunkirk. Occupation of perimeter
completed. Problems of embarkation of British
and French troops. Withdrawal of 2nd and
3rd Corps. G.H.Q. closes and C.-in-C. embarks
for England.

The decision to Withdraw.

43. By 6 p.m. that night (2§th May) I was
convinted that the steps I had taken to secure
my left flank would prove insufficient to meet

. the growing danger in the north.

The pattern of the enemy pincer attack was
becoming clearer. One movement from the
south-west on Dunkirk had already developed
and was being held; the counterpart was now
developing on the Belgian front.

The gap between the British left and the
Belgian right, which had been threatening the
whole day, might at any time become impossible
to close: were this to happen, my last hope of
reaching the coast would be gone. At this
time, it will be recalled, I had no rescrves beyond
a single cavalry regiment, and the two divisions
(5th and S5oth) already earmarked for the attack
southwards. :

The French ist Army, which was not
affected in the same way as the B.E.F,
by the situation which was developing on
the Belgian front, had, it will be remembered,
agreed to provide three divisions and the

Cavalry Corps for this attack. Therefore, even
if no British divisions could be made available,
the possibility of carrying out the operation
would not be entirely precluded. I did realise
however that the French were unlikely to take
the offensive unless British support was forth-

Even so, however, the situation on my northem
flank was deteriorating so rapidly that I was
convinced that there was no alternative but to
occupy, as quickly as troops could be made
available, the line of the Ypres-Comines canal
and the positions covering Ypres. I therefore
issued orders to 50th Division to join and
Corps at once, and shortly afterwards I ordered
5th Division to follow. znd Corps placed

+ 5th Division on its left flank northwards

from Halluin along the Ypres-Comines canal
with soth Division on its left around Ypres. At
this time also, the greater part of the medium
and heavy artillery of 1st and 2nd Corps was
grouped under 2nd Corps, and the successful
defence of the positions on the Ypres-Comines
canal and around Ypres, which was maintained
during the next three days; was greatly assisted
by these artillery units, which remained in
action till they had fired all their ammunition.

The Commander of 3rd Corps, who was no
longer required to take part in the attack
southwards, was now ordered to take over the
command of the front from St. Omer to Raches
from Major-General Eastwood, whom he relieved
on 26th May. .

I immediately communicated my decision to
the headquarters of the Fiench First Group of
Armies, but I was unable to get: into personal
touch with General Blanchard that evening as
he was visiting the Belgian G.Q.G. at Bruges.
However, I went to see General Blanchard at
his headquarters at Attiches early next morning
(26th May), at a moment when the enemy was
attacking at Carvin and had penetrated the
front of a North African Division near Bois
d@'Epinoy. I found that General Blanchard also
feared the collapse of the Belgian Army and felt
that the time for a counter attack southwards
was past. Indeed he had already decided that
the situation on both flanks made it necessary
to withdraw. ,

After an hour’s discussion, we arrived at a
joint plan for the withdrawal of the main bodies
behind the line of the Lys. These arrangements
were subject to there being no further deteriora-
tion in the Belgian situation.

With this decision, there vanished the last
opportunity for a sortie. The layout of the

F. was now beginning to take its final
shape. Starting from what could be described
as a normal situation with Allied troops on

- the right and left, there had developed an

ever lengthening defensive right flank. This
had then become a semi-circular line, with
both flanks resting on the sea, manned by
British, French “and Belgians. Later the
position became. a corridor in shape. The
southern end of this corridor was blocked by
the French ist Army; and each side was
manned, for the greater part of its length, by
British troops. Next to the sea were French
troops on the west, and French and Belgian
troops on the eastern flank.

The immediate problem was to shorten this
perimeter. British and French forces were
together holding a front of 128 miles of which
97 miles were held by British troops, though
