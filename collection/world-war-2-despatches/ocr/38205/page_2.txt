which the Italians claimed to have transformed
into a fortress of a strength to rival Malta.

The greater part of Sicily is mountainous
with many peaks over three thousand feet.
The most extensive plain lies south and west
of Catania, dominated by the conical peak of
Etna. All round the coast, however, except
for a short stretch on the north coast, there is
a narrow strip of low-lying country through
which runs the main road encircling the island.
The coastline is divided into a series of wide-
sweeping bights, separated from each other by
more or less prominent capes. Over ninety
stretches of beach were enumerated by the
planning staff, ranging from less than a hun-
dreds yards to many miles in length, usually
of sand but sometimes of shingle; offshore
gradients were in most cases rather shallow.
These beaches generally admit direct access into
the narrow coastal strip. The main ports,
in order of importance, are Messina in the
north-east, Palermo in the north-west, Catania
and Syracuse on the east coast; none of these
is a first class port and their daily clearance
capacity was reckoned, after making due allow-
ance for possible damage from air bombard-
ment and demolitions, at four io five thousand
tons per day for Messina, two thousand five
hundred for Palermo, one thousand eight hun-
dred for Catania and one thousand for
Syracuse. Manor ports, all reckoned as having
a capacity of about six hundred tons per day,
are Augusta on the east coast (mainly a naval
base with a good protected anchorage), Licata
and Porto Empedocle on the south coast and
Trapani on the west coast.

There were nineteen known airfields in
Sicily when planning started, a figure which was
subsequently raised by new construction to over
thirty at the time of the attack. They fell into
three main groups, in the east, south-east and
west of the island. The first two were mutually
self-supporting but could neither afford fighter
cover to the western group nor be themselves
covered from there. All were situated within
some fifteen miles of the coast. Most important
for the German Air Force was the eastern
group, Catania-Gerbini; there were important
supply and operational organisations here and
the capture of the area would probably mean
that the German Air Force could no longer
operate effectively in Sicily, If we could bring
these airfields into operation we could cover
the Straits of Messina, only sixty-five miles
away, and the German Air Force would be
driven back on Naples and Brindisi, both about
two hundred miles away, for the three small
airfields in the toe of Italy were only suitable
for use as advanced landing grounds.

It was more difficult to calculate the pro-
bable strength of the enemy defending forces.
The greater part of these were known to be
Ttalian and in January there were in the island
three regular infantry divisions and five
“coastal ’’ divisions. The latter were com-
posed of lower quality troops than the ordinary
divisions, had a lower scale of equipment and
were almost entirely non-mobile. Their task
was to man the coastal defences and to form a
covering screen to break the first impact of
an assault and allow time for the intervention
of the ‘‘ field’ divisions. The major interest
centred on the latter. It was reasonable to
expect that the Italians would wish to increase
the garrison of so important and so obviously

threatened a portion of their metropolitan
territory and, to be on the safe side, we calcu-
lated that by July the garrison would probably
have risen to a total of eight mobile divisions,
excluding the coastal divisions. It would be
easy to reinforce, for communications Were ex-
cellent, the train ferries at Messina could move
up to forty thousand men in twenty-four hours
or, in the same period, seven thousand five
hundred men and seven hundred and fifty
vehicles.

We were naturally particularly interested in
the prospects of reinforcement by German
troops. There were already in Sicily extensive
German Air Force establishments, which in-
cluded detachments for the ground defence of
airfields as well as anti-aircraft gunners and the
normal Air Force service troops, and there was
also a fluctuating number of German troops at
various points, particularly in the west, repre-
senting units in transit in Tumsia, Perhaps,
when resistance ceased in Tunisia, it might be
found that the Germans had been able to
evacuate sufficient troops to Sicily to make a
considérable difference to the strength of the
island garrison. In any event it was likely
that Germany would consider it necessary to
reinforce the Italians and it was calculated that
two out of the eight divisions expected as the
strength of the garrison might be German. The
Joint Planning Staff, in their original report,
felt it necessary to state, ‘‘ We are doubtful of
the chances of success against a garrison which
includes German formations.’’ This seemed to
me to be too strongly expressed, but all the
commanders concerned agreed that if the
Italians should be reinforced with substantial,
well-equipped German forces before the attack
the chances of success would be considerably
reduced, not only because of the superior
fighting quality of the Germans but because,
if the German proportion of the garrison
approached parity with the Italian, they would
certainly demand a share, probably the pre-
dominant share, in the direction of the opera-
tions.

The First Plan.

When the headquarters of Force 141 was set
up in Bouzarea on z2th February, 1943, the
basis on which the staff were in the first instance
to work was the plan drawn up for the Casa-
blanca conference. This was accepted by me as
a preliminary and tentative basis of planning,
though I realised, from such attention as I had
been able to give it, that it would undoubtedly
need modification when I should be free to give
my mind wholly to it. Certain elements were
bound to remain constant. It was clear, as
laid down in the plan, that for many reasons
the operation would have to be a joint Anglo-
American undertaking. Each nation would
provide a task force of Army size commanded
tespectively by General Montgomery* and
General Patton.{ Naval and Air forces would
be also jointly provided and commanded by
Admiral Sir Andrew Cunninghamt{ and Air
Chief Marshal Tedder.§ The British assault
force would be mounted mainly from the Middle
