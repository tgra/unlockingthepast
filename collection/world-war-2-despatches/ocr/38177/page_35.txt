SUPPLEMENT to tH: LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 1048

Norrie ordered them to take up positions to the
south of Bir el Gubi, while the Armoured
Brigade sought out the enemy’s armoured
forces. These were very elusive: apart from
two brief appearances in the morning when small
parties of enemy tanks were engaged north-east
and south-east of Bir el Gubi, they were seen
no more until the. afternoon, when_ they
appeared to be forming up to attack the Guards
Brigade west of Bir el Gubi. The artillery of
the Guards Brigade opened fire, and after a
short while the enemy moved away. It was
discovered later that General Neumann-Silkow,
commander of the 15th Panzer Division, was
mortally wounded by a shell which may explain
why the attack never developed. It is more
likely that the enemy intercepted a wireless call
to the Armoured Brigade, and had orders not to
allow themselves to be dragged into an engage-
ment with a force of tanks now manifestly
superior in numbers.

The Support Group had for some days been
ranging the country from Bir el Gubi almost to
Sidi Azeiz, and every day had brought its toll
of enemy vehicles. On the 6th December the
Support Group achieved a- notable success
against an enemy rearguard consisting of five
hundred vehicles and twenty-five light tanks
east of Sidi Rezegh. All the tanks were
destroyed, as well as a battery of medium guns
and many of the vehicles. Thereafter the Sup-
port Group rejoined the 7th Armoured Division.

The Armoured Brigade spent the 7th Decem-

ber attacking enemy tanks protecting Bir el
Gubi and proved unable to outflank or dislodge
them, though it claimed to have done them
much damage. Although the enemy was hitting
out with great vigour, General Ritchie was posi-
tive that he was doing so only to cover the pre-
paration of new positions in rear and decided to
wait no longer. He therefore ordered the 13th
Corps to proceed with their part in the opera-
tion against El] Adem. Some two hours after
dark on the 7th December the 23rd Infantry
Brigade began their advance along Ed Duda
ridge. By daybreak they had captured an
enemy position on the ridge within 2,000 yards
of the Tobruk—E] Adem road and by evening
the whole of the enemy fortifications south-east
of Tobruk had been cleared.

The advance of the 13th Corps came not a
moment too soon, for on the 8th December the
enemy began a rapid but orderly withdrawal
to Gazala. As soon as reports of the withdrawal
were received, the Armoured Brigade was
directed to advance on Knightsbridge in the hope
that this would bring them round or against
the enemy’s western flank, In fact it brought
them against the centre of the position the
enemy rearguard had taken up astride Genadel
ridge. The customary powerful screen of anti-
tank guns was produced, and the enemy tanks
took cover and fired from hull-down positions
when engaged. Repeated attempts to turn the
position on either flank were unsuccessful, and
when evening came the enemy were still holding
the ridge. The early hours of the gth Decem-
ber brought indications that the withdrawal was
continuing. The Armoured Brigade proceeded

along the same axis, and came up against a

‘Tearguard position running north-east from Bir
Harmat covering Knightsbridge. They engaged,
this time with more success, twice forcing the
enemy to give ground. In the evening they
attacked and halted a party of twenty enemy

tanks trying to break back and interfere with
our infantry who by then had occupied El
Adem, During the night the enemy retired once
more, but the Armoured Brigade could not give
chase as the supply system of the 30th Corps
had been stretched to the limit.

Although the progress of our armour was first
retarded by the enemy rearguards and finally
brought to a standstill by lack of petrol, the
momentum of the advance was kept up by
columns of the Support Group and the 4th In-
dian Division. The former were themselves
temporarily held up by a strong enemy position
at Hagfet en Nezha, until the 30th Corps
ordered the 1st South African Infantry Brigade
to relieve them. The Support Group then moved
round by way of Acroma and on the roth
December was in contact with the outposts of
the enemy’s new line running southwards from
Gazala. The 7th Indian Infantry Brigade struck
northwards and made contact with the 23rd
Infantry Brigade at El Adem on the evening
of the gth. The 5th Indian Infantry Brigade
drew level fifteen miles further west, while on
the western flank the Indian divisional motorised
cavalry, reinforced by infantry, engaged the left
flank of the enemy rearguard resting on Bir
Harmat, and secured Hagaig er Raml.

The 13th Corps, working westwards round
the perimeter of Tobruk, continued to roll up
the enemy by the same method of- making an

- outflanking movement along the ridge and then

clearing the positions in the intervening low
ground. On the roth December both corps
carried out a concerted movement against
Acroma. The Polish Brigade broke out before
dawn along the Derna road; the Polish Cavalry
then passed through and, after a_ successful
engagement with enemy rearguards, turned
southwards. The xz6th Infantry Brigade
‘approached. from the south-east and entered
Acroma to find it had already been occupied
by the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade. The 5th
Indian Infantry Brigade came up into line fur-
ther west, securing the western end of Acroma
tidge and all but a small part of another
eminence five miles to the west. Thus the
eight months siege of Tobruk came to an end.

During the period of the siege, the task of
maintaining supplies to the garrison was carried
out entirely by the Royal Navy and the Mer-
chant Navy. Between them they transported 72
tanks, 92 guns and 34,000 tons of stores, re-
placed 32,667 men of the garrison by 34,113
fresh troops and withdrew 7,516 wounded and
7,097 prisoners of war. The cost to the Navy
amounted to 25 ships sunk:and 9 seriously
damaged, and to the Merchant Navy of 5 ships
sunk and 4 seriously damaged, a total casualty
list of 43, ships.

Some of the units forming the garrison of the
fortress and the greater part of the administra-
tive and base personnel had been through the
whole siege, which began early in April. The
remainder, comprising the 7oth Division, the
Polish Carpathian Brigade Group and Cavalry
and a heavy tank battalion had taken over the
defence of the fortress in the late summer. The
new garrison under Major-General Scobie was
most active in harassing the besiegers by cease-
less patrolling and numerous minor enterprises.
The part they played in the Eighth Army’s
offensive has already been described, and there
is no doubt that the task allotted to them proved
much more exacting than had _been anticipated.
Their unyielding determination to- hold the
