He drew attention to the fact that owing to the inevitable confusion, the figures given to him for evacuation varied very greatly. Up to late on the 30th May, he had hoped that the last trip, that of C.S. 15, would result in almost everyone being brought off. The figures, however, suddenly increased by 5,000 on that day."

CREFORCE thought that   an optimistic view   of the fighting troops which could be evacuated, was under 2,000 but.there would be a number of stragglers (CREFORCE 0.672 timed 1310 of 28th May). Tt was deduced from these two signals that the situation in Crete was very bad but that 10,000 troops remained to be evacuated. Of these, only 2,000 would be in organised bodies.- The night 2oth/30th May, would have to be the last night for evacuation."
