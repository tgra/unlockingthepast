SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 APRIL, 1948

Two compames of the Burma Army were
based on Fort Hertz, and were supplied by
air. In addition, there were some seven hun-
dred and fifty Kachin Levies—irregulars with
a few British officers. The Kachins were loyal
and hated the Japanese intensely, They had
much success in patrols and in laying traps for
Japanese troops.

As a reserve in case of emergency one Indian
battalion was kept in North East Assam at
call. The need for it did not arise, which
perhaps was fortunate because it could only
have been taken to Fort Hertz by air, and then
only if the necessary aircraft could have been
spared from other operations.

Dispositions of the levies have varied some-
what from time to time, but generally speaking
they held as far south as Sumprabum, and
a few detachments were east of the Mali Hka.

A complication in North East Burma was

the presence there of certain Chinese whose’

arrival was first reported early in July They
appeared to ibe weak irregular armed forces,
who were apparently, expected to live on the
country. The Kachin country however is
extremely poor, and can barely produce enough
for the Kachins themselves to live on. The
presence of the Chinese was embarrassing.
Indeed, the Kachins were nearly as hostile
to them as they were to the Japanese. Urgent
steps were therefore taken to secure their with-
drawal by representation to Generalissimo
Chiang Kai Shek through H.B.M.’s Ambassa-
dor in Chungking. Eventually, except for a
few small detachments, they left the area and
went back across the Salween to China early
in September.

Subsequently, at the request of General
Cheng Po, the Commander of Chinese Guerilla
Forces, an operational ‘boundary was fixed be-
tween the British and Chinese Forces in North
East Burma. This was done in order to define
the area in which the British and Chinese were
respectively responsible for preventing Japanese
infiltration. The boundary runs roughly in
a north and south direction near the Burma-
Yunnan border, and the arrangement made
was that our Forces would be responsible to
we west, and the Chinese to the east of this
ine.

7. Ceylon Army Command,

There were no active land operations in the
Ceylon. Army Command during the period
under review. The Japanese, however, carried
out several air reconnaissances, and two of their
aircraft were destroyed.

The arrival of the rth East African Division
was completed, and intensive training was
carried out by this formation.

In August a new defence scheme for Ceylon
was approved as a result of a re-appreciation
of the rofe of the Army in that Command. It
included the reorganisation of the garrison on
the arrival of the East African Troops.

On the roth September the Italian warship
Eritrea, acting on the orders of Admiral Sir
Andrew Cunningham, put into Colombo.

On the rst September the shore organisation
of-the Eastern Fleet arrived in Colombo, and
on the {ame date also, the Rear Admiral, Naval

Air Stations, Indian Ocean, set up us Head-
quarters there.

In the Maldive Islands, a new flying boat base
was established during the period at Kalai.
Intensive constructional work at Addu Atoll
continued.

The Japanese about once a month made air
reconnaissances of Cocos Island.

8. Operations of the Royal Indian Navy.

H.M.I. Ships ‘ Jumna’’ and “‘ Sutlej ’’
operated in the Mediterranean with the Royal
Navy dunng the period. Otherwise, normal
escorts were provided for convoys to and from
Aden, the Persian Gulf, Colombo and along
the coasts of India. In the course of these
escort duties a number of depth charge attacks
wee made on enemy submarines with unknown
results.

The monsoon inevitably curtailed operations
in the air, but not to the same extent as on
land. From time to time all-weather runways
were flooded, and throughout the period fair-
weather strips were unusable, Administration
was also hampered by breaking of rail and
road communications and the rupture of signal
channels. .

Nevertheless, unlike the Japanese who prac-
tically discontinued air operations during the
rainy season, we continued to be active in the
air as far as conditions allowed, and we pre-
pared for the dry weather by training and
equipping squadrons, and building up reserves
of supplies.

An important development was the improve-
ment in meteorological services. It was found
possible td establish what can and cannot be
done from the air over North East India and
Burma during the monsoon. In particular,
monsoon conditions were found not so very bad
over central Burma, and it was generally pos-
sible to locate targets on enemy lines of com-
munications. Moreover, given reliable route
forecasts of weather over enemy territory, night
bombing was practicable over a wide area
In fact, unless all-weather airfields are actually
flooded, large scale air operations can be under-
taken safely even at the height of the monsoon.

The extent of our air effort during the period
under review is given under the appropriate
headings in the paragraphs which follow, and
the training and administrative side of it is
dealt with in Part III of this Despatch. .

10. Aircraft Flow and its Effect on Operations.

There was a great increase of aircraft held
in the Command, and obsolescent types were
largely replaced by modern aircraft. In all
there were in India the following aircraft of
all types, 2,453 on 25th June, and 3,699 on
17th November, 1943. ,

The most important development, however.
was the extensive modernisation of, our fighter
defence. Hurricanes rose from 677 to 1,088.
Spitfires incrceased from 13 to 153. They had
a most decisive effect on operations, though
this did not fully develop till later. Spitfires
went into action in November for the first time,
and not being supplied with long range tanks
