swiftly overcome and the whole area cleared.
Surprise had been complete. By the evening
of the 22nd, our leading tanks and infantry
were in Oktwin, eight miles to the south,
where they captured a loaded train (complete
with two engines) which was on the point of
departure. The importance of Toungoo to us
lay in its airfields from which fighters could
operate over Rangoon, distant 166 miles.
Since our captures in Toungoo fortunately in-
cluded an I.N.A. division (some 3,000 strong),
there was no shortage of labour to get the air-
strips into running order. In the 21 days of
continuous fighting since 4 Corps broke out
from Meiktila, it had advanced 170 miles and
killed 4,800 Japanese, of which 1,677 had been
accounted for by 5 Indian Division between
the 12th and 22nd April. These were casualties
actually counted on the ground; the total
enemy killed considerably exceeded this figure,
which does not include the many losses in-
flicted by our armour in quick-moving tank
actions, and by our aircraft.

244, Continuing their dash south, 5 Indian
Division’s armoured column on the 24th April
found the Pyu Chaung, 30 miles south of
Toungoo, held and the bridge destroyed.
Nevertheless, by the 25th, a crossing had been
effected and Pyu succumbed to an artillery
concentration. The progress of 161 Brigade was
delayed by the bridge two miles south of
Toungoo being washed away, necessitating the
construction of a 180-foot Bailey, which was
completed early on the 25th. The Brigade
then pushed forward through Pyu in hot pur-
‘suit of our armour which, on the night 25th-
26th, had reached Milestone 128 from Rangoon,
29 miles north of Nyaunglebin. Incidentally,
17 Indian Division had been scheduled to pass
through 5 Indian Division on the 24th April,
and indignation swept the former when it was
learnt that the latter had invaded what should
have been 17 Indian Division’s area of opera-
tions. I mention this small point as it illus-
trates the fine aggressive spirit which per-
meated not only 4 Corps, but the whole of
Fourteenth Anny in this campaign.

245, The Japanese Air Force was so over-
whelmed by the Allied Air Forces at this time,
and indeed throughout the whole Bunma cam-
paign, that its existence is apt to be over-
looked. Nevertheless, the enemy did on occa-
sions attempt to delay the onward rush of 4
Corps. On the 24th April, for example, twelve
Oscar fighter-bombers twice bombed and
strafed the Tennant and Kalaywa airfields
north of Toungoo, and then attacked the
armoured column to the south. Our
casualties in these attacks were light, whereas
the hostile aircraft were intercepted by Spit-
fires and lost half their number.

“246. The loss of Toungoo must have con-
vinced General Kimura that the situation was
critical. There is no doubt, evidence later
- showed, that the Japanese Commander in-
tended as adast resort to hold a line through
Toungoo and Prome until the coming of the,
monsoon forced us to ease the pressure of our
Offensive. Our break-through at Toungoo
destroyed this last hope. Whether he intended
to hold Rangoon, or whether he meant to with-
draw the remnants of his forces across the
Sittang, it was essential that the road and rail-
way through Pegu—the only land communica-

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

tions link between Rangoon and Moulmein—
should be kept open. Thus the defence of
Pegu now became absolutely vital. Kimura
had apparently no hope of retaking Toungoo
itself, but ihe directed 15 Japanese Division
to accelerate its move west from Mawchi and
block the Toungoo—Mawchi road at the point
where it enters the hills. The object was two-
fold. First, this threat.to 4 Corps might delay
fits advance and cause it to divert troops;
secondly, this position would protect the flank
of those elements of 33 Japanese Army still
north of Mawchi, who were retreating south.
The Japanese Commander’s next step was to
concentrate every available man for the defence
of Pegu. 24 Independent Mixed Brigade was
rushed north from Moulmein to the Pegu—
Mokopalin area. He also formed two new Mixed
Brigades rom the Rangoon garrison, which
were largely composed of administrative and
naval personnel. The Rangoon Anti-Aircraft
Command, the largest in Burma, provided the
guns for this scratch force, all its batteries being
utilised for this punpose. These two brigades
were moved up to Pegu on 27th April with
orders “To destroy the enemy north of
Payagyi and 'Waw ”, which lie 10 and 15 miles
north and north-west of Pegu respectively.
While this was going on, the major portion of
the small detachments guarding the mouth of
the Rangoon River were moved back into
Rangoon “ To cover demolitions ”. With effect
from the 28th April, therefore, Rangoon was
prcieaily denuded of troops, except for 5,000

247. I must make it clear however that it
was not until the Ist May that I received any
indication that Rangoon was going to be evacu-
ated, and it was only after 15 Indian Corps
landed that it became certain. This was another
example of how poor our Intelligence was in
comparison with the European theatre and
how, so often, we were virtually fighting in the
dark. It was known that Pegu was being re-
inforced at the expense of Rangoon, but it
was always considered that Rangoon itself
would be the centre of a desperate resistance.
I need not emphasise how serious the delay
caused by such resistance would have been.

248. On the 24th April, General Kimura and
his Headquarters retired to Moulmein. They
were accompanied by Ba Maw and several
ministers of his puppet Government. With
them went Subhas Chandra Bose—the Com-
mander-in-Chief of the “Indian National
Army ”—leaving behind him several thousand
of his troops, with orders to fight to the last.
They surrendered directly we reached Rangoon,
thereby easing our labour problem. _

249. 19 Indian Division, following up 5 and
17 Indian Divisions, took over the Toungoo
area on the 26th April, the actual locations of
its brigades on this date being 98 Brigade in
Toungoo itself, 62 Brigade at Lewe airfield, and
64 Brigade back in Meiktila. 98 Brigade
immediately began operations to clear the
leading elements of 15 Japanese Division east
of Toungoo, and our artillery engaged the
enemy guns shelling Toungoo. The next week
was spent in mopping up scattered parties of
the enemy in the vicinity; on the 29th April,
for example, 200 Japanese were surrounded
and killed just south-west of the Lewe airfield,
and a further 150 ten miles south-west of
Toungoo. Although it falls outside the period
