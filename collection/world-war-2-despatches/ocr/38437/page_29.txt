SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 20 OCTOBER, 1948

~wooded area in which rockets had been seen
on reconnaissance photographs taken in
December. The Hotel Promenade was attacked
on three occasions, and attacks were also made
on other suspected storage areas at the Hague,
Wassenaar, and the Hook of Holland, as well
as on railway targets. The Second Tactical
Air Force continued to attack communications,
-as hitherto, in the course of their armed recon-
naissance and rail interdiction programmes.

217. Meanwhile, in consequence of the rise
in the scale of rocket attack, towards the end
of January the Air Misery had begun to
press me to intensify my efforts against the
firing and storage areas. Nevertheless they
were still unwilling to see any part of Bomber
Command's effort diverted to the attack of
such targets. On the 26th of the month, how-
ever, the Defence Committee agreed to invite
the Air Ministty to ask Supreme Headquarters
to sanction the. precise attacks on selected
targets by the light bombers of No. 2 Group,
which I had been urging since the previous
autumn. Shortly before this I had arranged to
raise the strength of the force earmarked for
exclusive use against rocket targets from four
squadrons to six, and to equip and use all
six squadrons regularly as fighter-bomber
squadrons.* I now negotiated a new agree-
ment with the Second Tactical Air Force where-
by my area of responsibility was extended as
far east as Amersfoort. On days when the
weather was unsuitable for precise attack on
objectives at the Hague, our fighter-bombers
were now attacking rail targets; and the in-
clusion of Amersfoort in our area would enable
. us to bomb the railway junction there—a bottle-
neck through which all traffic from Germany
to the firing areas in western Holland passed.
Under the terms of the new ement the
Second Tactical Air Force would use any light
or medium bombers that they could spare from
the battle on land to attack rocket targets
chosen from lists provided by my staff.

218. The full effect of the expansion of the
“ Big Ben ’’ fighter-bomber force was seen in
the second half of February, when Fighter
Command made 548 sorties: and dropped 108
tons of bombs—precisely the same weight in
two weeks as in the previous six. At the
suggestion of my Chief Intelligence Officer, who
recommended that we should try the effect of
concentrating our efforts on a single target for
at least a week, nearly three-quarters of this
bomb tonnage was aimed at the Haagsche
Bosch; where severe damage was done, par-
ticularly on the 22nd February, when a film
studio which the Germans used for storage
was gutted. An almost complete cessation of
rocket fire over a period of more than sixty
hours followed this attack; and’ on the 24th
February photographic reconnaissance failed to
reveal a single rocket anywhere in the square
mile or so of wooded parkland that the
Haagsche Bosch comprised. Other evidence
strengthened the inference that the Germans
had been driven from the Haagsche Bosch,
at least for the time being, and suggested that
they had been forced to improvise facilities in
the racecourse area at Duindigt, further to the
north.

* The additional squadrons selected were Nos. 451
(Spitfire XVI) and 124 (Spitfire IX, modified for
bombing).

219. So far as they went, these results of
our new policy of concentrating on one area
were encouraging; but events soon showed that
no lasting effect on the Germans had been
achieved. When firing was resumed
(apparently from Duindigt) on the 26th, no
appreciable decline in its quality or quantity
was apparent. Nor did the first of No. 2
Group’s long-awaited bombing attacks, which
was delivered on the 3rd March, have any
better effect. The attack was delivered by 56
Mitchells, and the target chosen—not without
some misgivings since the continued presence
of the Germans and their gear was doubtful—
was the Haagsche Bosch. ‘Unfortunately the
bombing was not sufficiently accurate, in con-
sequence of which casualties occurred among
Dutch civilians and their property was
damaged. After this unhappy experience, Air
Marshal Coningham decided to make no more
attacks on targets at the Hague.

220. Another counter-measure considered ‘at
this stage was the use of anti-aircraft artillery
to fire at approaching rockets and explode them
in the air. If only bedause the rockets
travelled many times faster than the fastest
bomber and completed their parabolic flight
from Holland in less than five minutes, the
problems involved seemed formidable. In-
deed, proposals in this sense had been care-
fully considered before the attacks began and
found impracticable. General Pile raised the
subject again in December, 1944, when he
asked permission to make an operational trial
of a scheme designed to ensure that the rockets
would pass through a curtain of shell-frag-
ments as they approached the earth. An
essential requirement of the plan was accurate
and timely warning that a rocket was on its
way. Although there were still difficulties in
the way of disseminating such warnings to the
public, for operational purposes reliable in-
formation of this kind was now available.
There were some obvious drawbacks to the
scheme: for example, the expenditure of
rounds required to explode even one rocket was
likely to be extravagant and possibly orien]
to the public. Nevertheless, I was satisfie
that it contained the germ of a successful
countermeasure, which might become important
in the future, and that on purely operational
grounds a practical trial was desirable. I made
recommendations to this effect when submitting
General Pile’s proposal to higher authority.
The committee before whom the scheme was
laid, after taking the opinion of eminent men
of science, one of whom put the chances of a
successful engagement at one in a hundred and
another at one in a thousand, decided that an
operational trial would be premature. They
invited those concerned to seek ways of improv-
ing the scheme, and promised to consider it
again in March.

221. Accordingly General Pile repeated his
request for an operational trial towards the
end of that month. He pointed out that time
was clearly running out: the opportunity of
testing the scheme in practice would soon have
passed. In response, on the 26th March a
panel of scientists were asked to prepare a
theoretical estimate of success. They reported
on the same day that if 400 rounds were fired
against any one rocket the chance of scoring
a hit would, at best, be one in thirty. After
