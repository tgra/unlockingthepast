At 1530 Task Force 57 proceeded, setting course to carry out final strikes. on Sakishima on roth and r1th April: the programme envisaged their returning to Leyte thereafter.

At 1650 the following signal was received:  

C INC PAC (R) CIF 57

From CoM : 5th Fleet ..

On 11-12 April propose  Task Force 57 strike Shinchiku and Matsuyama airfields. Request you arrange SOWESPAC AIR hit Southern Formosa  fields same days; COMSUBPAC assign lifeguards to stations 9, to and, if possible, rx on these. days. .TG 52.1 will maintain neutralisation Sakishima Gunto,

Shortly after, the following signal was also received :- 

CTE 57 and 51. From COM 5th Fleet

 CTF 57 cancel roth April Sakishima operations. TG 52:1 continue neutralisation that day. CTF 57 advise if following not within capabilities. If approved by C INC PAC, CIF 57 strike Shinchiku and Matsuyama airfields Formosa 11-12 April.

These were the first intimation that a change of plan was contemplated for TF 57; it looked an attractive change.

both pilots and aircraft were beginning to feel a strain, the possibility of carrying out a fifth

operational period against Sakishima Gunto was _

acceptable, provided it could be on a light scale. The Formosa operation, involving our maximum strength and flying 50 miles over enemy land, would, I judged, probably preclude  farther operations before the return of the Fleet to Leyte. These extended operational periods bring considerable strain om to the maintenance and haridling crews on the carriers which, together with the operational fatigue factor.  of: pilots, are of considerable importance. . great  deal to be studied in-respect of the personnel in this matter under conditions out

here, and after further experience a eotapter

hensive report will be forwarded.

I informed A.C.1 that -should we undertake - the Formosa operation I, would inform coM

- aircraft, It had already been decided that, although .

There is a-



5th Fleet that the fifth operation period would not take place. - The Fleet would: then arrive back at Leyte on the date as arranged between

C.-in-C., B.P.F. and C IN.C PAC. After

receiving A.C.1's reply at 1817 I made a signal to inform COM 5th Fleet that  we were teady to otal Formosa. ' 

"  Assuming that we  should act in accordance with the above, the Fleet remained to the south during the night instead of proceeding back to

its flying-off position from the Nansei Shoto 

operation, maintaining a moderate speed,  the extra maintenance time being. welcome.

A signal received from C IN C POA confirmed that above assumption had been correct, and approval was finally received from C IN C'PAC in the early hours of the roth April,

* roth Aprib,

The Fleet continued patrolling in n the southern area during most of the day. I received an appreciation and air plin from A.C.x at an eatly hour; at 0845 his Chief  Staff Officer was transferred to KING GEORGE V by destroyer and the various details discussed. After this

 discussion the following signals were made to

inform all concerned of my intentions:  

COM 5th Fleet (R) C IN C POA Both H.Q., CT 50.5, C.-in-C., B.P.F., CTG 52.1, CTF 112 COMAAFSWPA, CINCSWPA. -

 From approximate __ position 196 deg. 30 min. from western tip Yonakuni Jima will strike Matsuyama and Shinchiku airfields xz-r2 April forenoons. CTF 57 originator. . Will replenish Cootie area 13th April. On x6th will arrive Leyte. .

COM 5th Fleet (R) CINC PAC both H.Q.s. CTG 50.5.'. * From CTF 57 . Request Dumbo* aircraft from 0830 to 1130, 11 and 12 April so TF 57-can leav  vicinity Formosa after strikes. Advise and indicate call signs. Fighter escort by TF 57. Rendezvous western point Yonakuni Jima 0830 for. Dumbo and fighters both days:

The plan as finally evolved was to strike Matsuyama | airfield from a dawn fiying-off position 23  58.5  N 122  46  E, retiring to the south. east after strike returned. A  similar strike was planned for the morning of the 12th on  Shinchiki. after which. the Fleet would return to the oiling area: Both the above strikes were to be with the maximum available In. view of the fact that the Fleet would be operating some 50 miles from Formosa, a CAP  of  twenty-with Jacks seemed desirable. : -

During these operations it would at times have been preferable to divide the Fleet in two, so that, whilst one half was sustaining air superiority over our target, the other could be away refuelling; this was however precluded inter alia te the fact that two carriers provide insufficient aircraft to. maintain: the Fleet CAP even on a lessened scale as well as to provide the strike. ' The position is analogous to a Fleet which, although it has enough destroyers to form a A/S screen and a striking force, cannot reasonably operate in two halves because there would then only :be enough destroyers left to nacido one or the .other.
