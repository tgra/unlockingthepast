            "description": "As a site for a base, Dimapur possessed almost every conceivable disadvantage: heavy rainfall ; unhealthy climate ; and uneven ground (which did not become apparent until the dense jungle had been cleared). Moreover, it lies on a narrow tongue of land between two rivers, both of which are liable to overflow during the monsoon. To these local topographical disadvantages must be added the further one of the liability to interruption of the railway to Assam by the rivers and streams which pour down from the huge catchment area of the Himalayas, the foothills of which the railway skirts. In.1942, the railway was cut by floods from the 24th June till the 30th November.",

            "description": "On the 24th June I telegraphed to the Prime Minister, giving him my view of the situation and explaining my future plans. I assured him that it was my firm intention to resume the offensive, immediately our armoured forces were strong enough to’ make this possible with a reasonable chance of success, and that plans for reorganising our forces to make them better fitted for their task were well advanced. At the same time, I informed him that I did not think it safe further to denude the Ninth and Tenth Armies of troops, as in the whole of this huge area there remained only two and one-third infantry divisions, besides some allied contingents not yet fully trained or equipped.",

            "description": "12g. The programme for loading the vehicles of the assault convoy was also successfully carried out. Since the date of the arrival of the L.C.Ts. through the Mediterranean left little margin for loading in Egypt, Benghazi was to be used as the port of embarkation. Assault personnel and vehicles of four brigades (the x5th, r7th, 51st and 231st Brigades) were therefore moved by rail and road from the Delta to Benghazi, where they embarked detween 24th June and 5th July; this involved a total of 2,700 personnel and 850 vehicles. ~",

They were most severe in the centre where the Germans opposed xo and 13 Corps; on the west coast, although the ‘American advance was considerably slowed down, as compared with the first two weeks after the fall of Rome, the Germans were unable to prevent a steady gain of ground. IV Corps on the left, with 36 and xr Armoured Divisions leading, captured Follonica on 24th June and Piombino on the 25th. Then stiffer resistance was met, particularly inland where 1 Armoured Division, opposed by a skilful enemy and difficult country, lost seventy-one tanks in the course of these ten days. The stiffest resistance was at Cecina, at the mouth of the river of the same name; the battle for the town lasted from 2gth June to 1st July and cost 34 Division, which had relieved the 36th, fairly heavy casualties. 16 S.S. Division had been brought in here to strengthen the German defence and fought with skill and fanaticism. The French, directed on Siena, were held up from the 22nd to the 26th June on the River Orcia and were able only to make an advance of some two miles. On the night of the 27th, however, the Germans began to withdraw and only delaying actions were fought south of Siena, which was entered on 3rd July. By the 7th, with the capture of Colle di Val d’Elsa, the whole of Route 68, from its junction with Route 2 to the sea, had been secured.",
