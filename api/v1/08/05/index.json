            "description": "151. The \u2018\u2018 Circus \u2019\u2019 offensive was resumed on 5th August and 26 operations were carried out during the month. Blenheims of No. 2 Group provided the striking force for 24 cf them and Hampdens of No. 5 Group for the other two. As the enemy gained experience in repelling these attacks his opposition grew more effective, and the balance of advantage showed a tendency to turn against us. Ths being so, it was for, consideration whether the scale of the offensive should be reduced, if not at once, at any rate as soon as there was any sign of a more stable situation on the Eastern Front"

On 5th August, after a swift ad- vance across the trackless mountains, with the divisional engineers building a jeep track be- hind them at full speed, 3/5 Mahrattas cap- tured the summit of Monte II Castello. This was 10 Corps\u2019 high-water-mark. The plan for the attack on the \u2018\u2018 Gothic\u201d\u2019 line had now been changed and on 7th August, reduced in strength to 10 Indian Division only, the Corps went onto the defensive. ."
