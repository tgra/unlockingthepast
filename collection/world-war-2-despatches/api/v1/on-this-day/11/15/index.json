It gave details of the reinforcements he might expect to receive up to June, 1942, and instructed him that his primary task was the defence of Iraq and Iran against the enemy advance from Anatolia or from the Caucasus. In the defence of Iraq he was to act throughout in the closest co-operation with the Commander Ninth Army (Palestine and Transjordan)."

The chief cause was the tardy arrival of the 22nd Armoured Brigade from the United \"Kingdom: this formation was expected to reach Egypt between the 13th and 2oth September, but its disembarkation was not actually completed until the r4th October. As a result, the brigade was not fully trained when it took the field."

Quinan, Commander Tenth Army, who had been studying  the problem  for some time and had -been able to visit North Persia and see something of the country. By this time the likelihood of a winter campaign in North Persia was receding, the earliest date by which it was estimated the Germans could reach the River Araxes having already been put back to 15th November."

            "description": "The decision to make a dash for Tunis, though bold, was undoubtedly correct. The advance was pressed by land, sea and air; Bougie was occupied by 11th November, Bone on 12th November, by a British parachute battalion, and by 18th November our advanced forces were operating east of:Gebel Abiud on the coast road and B ja on the inland road, about sixty miles from Bizerta and Tunis respectively. At both points we were in contact with German troops. These had begun to arrive, in the first place by air, on oth November, meeting no resistance from the French authorities in Tunisia. On 15th November a United States parachute battalion occupied Youks Les Bains and Tebessa, in south-eastern iAlgeria, and co-operated with the French detachments at Gafsa in southern Tunisia. Between 17th November and 25th December two main attempts were made to capture Tunis. The first succeeded in advancing, on 28th November, as far as Djedeida, on the road between Tunis and Bizerta and only twelve miles from the former. At this point the enemy counter-attacked strongly with tanks and dive-bombers; the latter were able to operate from good airfieldss only a short distance in rear and our own air forces were ungble to give cover, since the rain had put all their temporary landing grounds out of action. Our forces on the inland road were therefore obliged to withdraw to Medjez el Bab. This town, as its name   the Ford of the Pass   shows, is of great strategic importance. It lies"

On the south the two lines coincided and the German defences utilised the plain forward of the Garigliano, the river, swift-flowing and deep, and the Aurunci Mountains to the west of it which command every part of the plain. To the north are the mountains commanding the Mignano Gap through which Route 6 passes, dominated by Monte Camino to the south and Monte Sammucro to the north; in the gap itself there are three isolated masses of high ground, Monte Lungo, Monte Porchia and Monte Trocchio, rising abruptly like rocks in a fairway. North of Monte Sammucro the mountains rise even higher to the central ridges of the Apennines, impossible country for large-scale operations."

These officers commenced to arrive on the 15th November and they were sent immediately to distressed areas. , On the 15th November, within a fortnight of the inception of the project, military aid had already achieved very satisfactory and promising results. The output of relief supplies from Calcutta to the districts had been doubled, public confidence  in the efficacy of relief measures had been partially restored and, in consequence, the price of food-grains in the districts had been substantially lowered."

            "description": "Secondly, I must again draw attention to the factor of the weather, During the monsoon, say 15th May to 15th November very roughly, we had to expect all fair-weather routes to be out of action ; even all-weather roads were subject to wash-outs and damage. Although flying was certain to be intermittent and hazardous, air supply became often the only practicable means, but it was entirely dependent on allweather airfields. Al] administrative planning had to include provision for the continuance of adequate maintenance under monsoon conditions. The absolute importance of completing the construction of all-weather airfields for supply aircraft before the monsoon was therefore obvious."

In mid-November, a reorganization of the chain of command took place, which had been planned by General Giffard with the object of freeing the Commander, Fourteenth Army, from the control of operations in Arakan, and from the responsibility of administering the long and difficult lines of communication in Assam. In this way he would be enabled to concentrate his full attention on the coming offensive across the Chindwin River into Central Burma. Accordingly on the 15th November, Lines of Communication Command was formed under Major-General G. W. Symes, with its H.Q. at Comilla. It comprised 202 L. of C. Area (H.Q., Gauhati), consisting of four sub-areas and the Fort Hertz Area, and 404 L. of C. Area of four sub-areas; it included a very great number of Base and L. of C. units. The policy was to be that the rear boundaries of Fourteenth Army and 15 Corps would be adjusted as the progress of operations allowed, in order to free them from rearward responsibilities. On the 16th November, 15 Corps was separated from Fourteenth Army and came direct under my command. I thus had under my command three major formations im contact with the enemy, 15 Corps, Fourteenth Army and Northern Combat Area Command, with the L. of C. Command in the rear up"
