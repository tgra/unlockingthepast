On 16th February, when one company of the Frontier Battalion was approaching his area, Colonel Torelli, commanding the nine battalions in Dangila, withdrew to Piccolo Abbai, and thence after a short rest at Meshenti, to Bahrdar Giyorgis. He lost several hundred deserters en route and was harried by patriots and by a Bimbashi of the S.D.F. with one mortar and 20 regular troops, but his casualties to fire were not large. In the following weeks he was able to withdraw all the outlying garrisons of Alefa and Achefer, Zeghie, Debra Mai and Addiet, without great loss, to Bahrdar, where he was invested by   Beghemder Force   consisting of one company of the Frontier Battalion and an Operational Centre of 180 men acting under the G.S.0.2 of Mission ror. The role of this small force, which it successfully accomplished, was to prevent Torelli from breaking  back and attacking the rear of the Frontier Battalion and 2 Ethiopian Battalion once the Italian Commander understood the midget from which he had run. Dangila had meanwhile been looted by the patriots."
