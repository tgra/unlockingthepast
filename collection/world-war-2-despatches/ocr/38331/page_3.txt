SUPPLEMENT to tus LONDON GAZETTE, 23 JUNE, 1048

x16. In the meantime LEGION, ESKIMO and
PRINCESS BEATRIX had reached position E
at 0540. Landing craft were lowered and led
inshore to Ports A and B by LEGION and
ESKIMO respectively. Disembarkation pro-
ceeded in accordance with the timetable and
landings were made at 0645.

17. At o610, shortly before the arrival of
BEDOUIN and QUEEN EMMA at position F,
SOMALI parted company to proceed to Ports
A and B to see if the landings were being
effected satisfactorily there. On passage, an
armed trawler, later found to be the KREBS,
was sighted steering away from Port X. Fire
was opened at a range of 3,000 yards at 0620
and the enemy very quickly hit. Our fire was
returned by three rounds fired from a small gun
in the bows of the trawler, but no hits were
obtained on SOMALI. Immediately afterwards
three shells were observed to be effective, one
apparently exploding the ready-use ammuni-
tion, another bursting in the wheelhouse and
the third in the boiler 'room. A considerable
volume of smoke was seén to be coming from
the trawler which was clearly out of control.
Fire was accordingly checked. Five survivors
were then seen to be swimming in the water;
they were picked up by 0655.

18. At this time gunfire could be heard at
Port X. As W/T communication with the
landing places had not yet been established
and the Brigadier was anxious to find out if
any landings had been opposed, SOMALI left
the now helpless trawler, which had run

aground on a small island, and proceeded to .

ascertain the state of affairs at Ports X, B
and A.

1g. At 0710 SOMALI. made the negative
W/T silence sign and from then on, throughout
the operation, satisfactory W/T communica-
tions were maintained with all landing places.
V/S* communication was also established at
each landing place.

20. At each port, operations were proceeding
according to plan and by 0735 reports had been
received that at all four ports landings had been
effected successfully without jopposition and
that relations with the Norwegian population
were most cordial. From this time onwards,
reports came in from all military landing parties
that allotted tasks were being carried out suc-
cessfully and the Brigadier, from his position
on SOMALI’S bridge, was kept in continual
touch with the progress of operations.

21 By now the local Norwegian fishing fleet
had put to sea; there were literally hundreds of
little fishing smacks and small puffers begin-
ning to fish in the adjacent waters. It quickly
became clear to them that our operations were
directed against the Germans and that they were
not to be molested. They showed their friend-
liness and enthusiasm by cheering and waving
and hoisting Norwegian flags.

22. From Port A SOMALI then proceeded
back to Port X. Durmg the passage the trawler
KREBS, still burning, was seen to have re-
floated and to be drifting towards the centre
of the fjord As SOMALI closed, a white flag
was seen being waved and at ogro a boarding
party was sent over in a Norwegian fishing boat
who volunteered their services. The survivors
consisted of five ratings, all of whom were

wounded by gunfire, two seriously. The balance
of the crew, consisting of the captain and
thirteen ratings, had been killed an the action.

23 The boarding officers, Major A. R.
Aslett, Lientenant Sir Marshall G. C.
Warmington, Bart, R.N, the Signal Officer
on my staff, and znd Lieutenant L. M. Harper-
Gow, searched the ship so far as was possible.

24 The wheelhouse was found to have
received a direct hit and nothing could be
recovered from there, other than a number of
charts. The captain and one rating were found
dead by the wheel; one or two bodies which
could not be identified were also in the wheel-
house,

25 The ship was still on fire below and no
entry could be made into the fore-peak or the
engine room.

26. The search of the KREBS occupied three
quarters of an hour and while SOMALI was
stopped numbers of fishing craft took the op-
portunity to come alongside and throw their
fish on board as gifts to the ship’s company.
The fishing boat which took the boarding party °
was rewarded with gifts of food and cigarettes.

27. At ror5 the KREBS was sunk by gun- |
fire after an unsuccessful attempt had been
made to destroy her by depth charge fired from
the port thrower. She finally disappeared at
1030. Her armament consisted of a 3 or 6-pdr.
gun forward, a 2-cm Madsen machine-gun aft
and eight depth charges in two chutes.

28. A summary of the happenings at the
various ports is given in the ensuing paragraphs.

2g. At Port X an important success was the
destruction of the HAMBURG by gunfire from
TARTAR. This was a ship of 9780 tons which
had been specially converted into a fish-refri-
gerating and factory ship. From the report
of the officer in charge of the naval demolition
party at Port X it appears that a plan was
made to take possession of this ship and to
steam her as a prize to England and that this
plan was frustrated by TARTAR opening fire
and destroying her. I consider that the Com-
manding Officer, HMS TARTAR, was justi-
fied in the action he took, having regard to the
general instructions for the conduct of the
operation and to the fact that no information
of the plan to seize the ship had been communi-
cated to him Nor was I, myself, aware of it.

30 In addition,, TARTAR sunk the
PASAJES, 1996 tons, and completed the
destruction of the FELIX HEUMANN, 2468
tons, which was still floating after partial des-
truction by the naval demolition party. The
latter, from H M.S. NELSON, under the com-
mand of Lieutenant D. D. Bone, R.N., sank
the EFLENAU, 1404 tons, the trawler RISSEN
and, as stated above, commenced the destruc-
tion of the FELIX HEUMANN.’ The work
performed by this party was most creditable.
It is believed that the large majority of the
crews of all these ships were made prisoners
by the military landing parties and brought
back in QUEEN EMMA.

31. At 1035 the Norwegian trawler MYR-
LAND, whose crew wished to proceed to
England and asked for instructions, was
directed by TARTAR to proceed independently
to Skaalefjord in the Faroes. This was re-
ported in my signal timed 1444 of 6th March,
She arrived safely today, 8th March.
