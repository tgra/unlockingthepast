following transport aircraft would be avail-
able :—
1-10 June—
8 R.AF. Squadrons—240 C-47
4th C.C. Group—100 C-46
11 June-31 July—
8 R.AF. Squadrons—240 C-47
197. On such a basis, the capacity for the
daily lift om long tons of squadrons was
estimated as under :—
1-10 June—
1,474 long tons
11 June-31 July—
800 long tons
198. This capacity measured against the
_Army’s requirements of 14th May, 1945,
showed the following situation in tons :—
ALFSEA Capacity to

I~ 8 June 1,310 1,474
9-10 ,, 1,070 1,474
H—-i8 4, ... 1,070 880
19 June—8 July. 840 880
931 July 600 880

199. On calculation, therefore, a total sur-
plus capacity of 2,120 tons existed from 1-10
June, and a deficiency of 1,520 tons from 11-18
June, giving a surplus airlift. The surplus air-
lift from 1-10 June, it was calculated, could
be stock-piled to offset the deficiency from
11-18 June. From these calculations, there-
fore, it was considered that the transfer of the
US.A.AF, squadrons could be accepted with-
out detriment to any foreseen operations. Un-
fortunately, a variety of factors militated
against this target which had been so carefully
planned.

Some Difficulties with the Army over Supply.

200. On ith June, Advanced HQ.
ALFSE.A. signalled direct to the Supreme
Allied Commander that the short fall in air
transport for the first nine days in June totalled
955 long tons, and asked, therefore, for the
retention of No. 238 Squadron already overdue
to go to the Pacific,

201. I proceeded to Rangoon to discuss this
matter more fully with Lieutenant General Sir
Oliver Leese, C.-inC, ALFS.E.A. and
Major-General Bastyan (Major-General Ad-
ministration), A.L.F.S.E.A.

202. The Army had come fully briefed, and
it was obvious that any detailed discussion
in Rangoon without a full knowledge of all
factors would place the Air Force at a dis-
advantage. Accordingly, I signalled Air Com-
mand to take all possible measures to lessen
the short fall and, for this purpose, to allocate
22 additional Dakotas at once. Upon my re-
turn to Command, at Kandy, I held a full
discussion on the problem.

203. The varied aspects of the problem are
worth detailing since they illustrate the many
links upon which air transport depended at
the time, and also the strong disinclination of
the Army to accept responsibility for break-
downs in air supply. Factors which had upset
the air supply target planned in the middle of
May included the following :—

(a) The reinforcement flow had not been
sufficient to equip the squadron up to a

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951

Unit Equipment of 24 plus 6 as planned and,
in consequence, aircraft strength was 12 per
cent. deficient.

(6) Ramree airfield, which had been built
by the Army for the express purpose of
monsoon air supply operations, was often
so waterlogged that aircraft could not get

off.

(c} There had been an epidemic of main
bearing failures in Dakota aircraft engines
which had caused an appreciable drop in
serviceability ; one squadron needed 26 new
engines.

(d) Although we hada margin of surplus
lift available in May, the Army could not
take advantage of it in June, owing to
shortage of transport.

{e) Army demands remained high because
they could not withdraw sufficient troops
through Rangoon due to shipping and com-
munication difficulties.

204. It was decided to take the following
steps :—

(i) Inform B.AF.S.E.A. that the allot-
ment of 24 aircraft to each squadron was
of the greatest urgency.

(ii) Press the Army for better drainage of
Ramree airfield.

(iii) Transfer as soon as possible one or
two transport squadrons from Ramree to
Akyab.

{iv) Give the squadrons a target of 100
short tons per day. This was desirable, for
it provided a goal that could be reached,
and’ prevented the frustration that had so
often been felt in the past at being given a
target impossible of achievement. Any
margin above the stated figure would be in
the nature of a bonus and have a stimulating
moral . effect.

(v) Withdraw one of the two squadrons
engaged from airborne training and employ
it on transport. This would give a total
of 810 long tons a day against the Army
requirements of 880. The difference was so
small that it could surely be made up by
inland water transport or other means and
would certainly entail no drastic cut in
rations or amenities.

205. Even then, air transport problems were
not solved. There were still in Burma tactical
squadrons whose speedy withdrawal for refit
and training in preparation for “‘ Zipper/Mail-
fist’? Operation could not be effected through
the overloaded land and sea lines of communi-
cation. The only method of withdrawing
these units in sufficient time was to fly them
out. I decided, therefore, that such a task
held priority over the airborne training 96
Squadron was accomplishing at that time, and
accordingly I received the Supreme Allied
Commander’s agreement to 96 Squadron’s
temporary withdrawal to enable air lift to be
provided for R.A.F. personnel and equipment
of the units already mentioned.

Transport Preparations for “ Zipper|Mail-

206. An important step was taken in July
when I directed that Air Force representation
should be made available for Army planning
bodies in order to prevent the Army supply
authorities from budgeting for airlift which
