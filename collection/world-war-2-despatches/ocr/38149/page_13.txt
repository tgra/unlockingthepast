SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 18 DECEMBER, 1947

1940 had not proved as successful as had been
‘hoped; the spacing of lights proved too great
for continuous engagement so that night fighters
still failed to intercept with searchlight
‘assistance; low-flying raiders were often able
to slip through unobserved and the anticipated
increase in the range of beams was not
noticeable. : .

In September, 1941, therefore, lights were re-
deployed on single sites’ The basis of the
-redeployment was a mathematical conception
known as the Fighter Box; this was the area
.within which a night fighter with nothing to
aid him except his own eyes and the visual in-
dication of searchlight beams could intercept a
‘bomber which entered that area. After trials
‘had been carried out the size of the box was
established as being 44 by 14 miles. The Box
system remained the basis of searchlight de-
ployment for the rest of the war.

The country was divided into a complete
system of boxes around the various Gun
Defended Areas. In the centre of each Box
was a stationary vertical searchlight beam
around which a night fighter circled until he
received an indication that a bomber was
entering the Box. At the ends of each Box
searchlights were spaced at about 6 miles in-

_ tervals and in the middle the spacing was about
“3% miles. A series of boxes placed side by side
thus created a continuous belt in which lights
were thin at the edges, where they constituted
an Indicator Zone and dense in the centre
which was the Killer Zone.

Later, when enemy ‘penetrations became so
/shallow that they often failed to reach the
Killer Zone altogether the Indicator Zone spac-
ing was thickened and the orbit beam was
moved forward if it was thought to be
necessary. 4

28. Just as in March, 1941, the responsibility
for fire control had largely passed from Gun
Operations Rooms to the gun sites themselves,
so now the responsibility for searchlight con-
trol tended to shift from Sector Operations
Rooms to the searchlight sites. The old form
of contro] had done much to destroy initiative

and it was only by degrees that it was possible

to instil into the junior officers the sense of
responsibility necessary for the successful opera-
tion of the new system. In addition there was
at the outset a shortage of S.L.C. Radar equip-
ment. :

Consequently there developed a distrust of
searchlight-assisted interceptions among R.A.F,
night fighter crews and Commanders .who pre-
‘ferred ititerceptions ordered on the findings of
their own G.C.I. radar. It was towards the
successful co-ordination of the two methods of
interception that all our energies were now
bent, and co-operation became steadily closer
and more satisfactory as time went on.

29. Though the main use to. which search-
lights were put was naturally the illumination
of night raiders, they were also employed for
a number of other special purposes through-
out the war, in an anti-minelaying réle, to
illuminate balloons for our bombers and to

make meteorological observations of cloud bases -

at night. Especially worthy of mention was the
system of homing beacons for friendly aircraft
which operated from the end of 1939; figures
were only kept for a period between September,
’ 1942, and August, 1943, but in that time 525
aircraft were saved from imminent disaster,

5985

600 were homed to alternative airfields and 184
were helped to base.
Re-organisation.

30. The organisation of Anti-Aircraft Com-
mand into three Corps and twelve Divisions
remained until October, 1942, when a further re-
organisation took place. This was' prompted ‘by
a number of reasons; the desire to economise in
manpower, the need for fewer intermediate
formations between Command Headquarters
and units allowing a quicker dissemination of
orders, the need for still closer co-ordination
with R.A.F. Groups and the desire ta achieve
a better balance of responsibility since the
shifting of the emphasis in defence southwards
had over-loaded 1st Anti-Aircraft Corps.

Corps and Divisions were therefore abolished
altogether and were replaced by seven Anti-
Aircraft Groups. There were three grades ac-
cording to the operational commitments in the
Group area and establishments appropriate to
each grade were worked out. The system was
extremely flexible since the grade of any one
Group could be chapged to meet current needs.

31. The seven groups were situated as
follows : — :

1st. . London.

and: The Solent, south-east England and
southern East Anglia (these two Groups
coincided with xz Group R.A.F.).

3rd. South-west England and __ south
Wales (coinciding with 10 Group R.A.F.).

4th, North Wales and north - west

England (coinciding with 9 Group R.A.F.).

5th. Northern East Anglia and ‘the East

Coast as far as Scarborough (coinciding with

12 Group R.A.F.).

‘6th. North-east England and Scotland
(coinciding with 13 Group R.A.F. (except
Northern Ireland) and 14 Group R.A.F.).

7th. Northern Ireland.

The defences of the Orkneys and Shetlands
remained a separate onganisatién, responsible
in operational anti-aircraft matters direct to
Anti-Aircraft Command Headquarters, :

In the. ‘ater stages of the war there were
at times concentrations of defences in certain
areas quite beyond anything visualised in
October, 1942, and the local Group Head-
quarters was not sufficient to deal with the
tremendous increase of work. In these circum-
stances, group boundaries were altered to per-
mit the insertion of an extra Group in the
affected area.

Thus, 6th Anti-Aircraft Group took over the
Solent area during the preparations for invasion,
Scotland becoming the responsibility of a new
8th Group. 6th Anti-Aircraft Group was dis-
banded when its responsibilities in the South
had ended.

The progressive reduction of defences in the
North and West in 1944 enabled me to disband
the 3rd, 4th and 7th Anti-Aircraft Groups and
to extend the responsibilities of the 2nd and
5th Groups westwards into their areas.

A oth Anti-Aircraft Group was especially
created in southern East Anglia when, there
was a heavy concentration of equipment there
in the later stages of the flying bomb batile.
