SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 JANUARY, 1948

Navy personnel and damage being caused at
the last named.

By the end of the day more than half of the
pill boxes along North shore from Lyemun to
Bowrington had been knocked out. Moves to
alternative positions were carried out during
the night (sixteen were now prepared ‘but were
not yet on the telephone system). The main-
tenance of communications to the North shore
pill boxes, and on other subsidiary routes there,
was proving extremely difficult on account of
repeated breaks from hostile fire.

55. One enemy plane was seen at 0930 hours
r6th December to crash into the sea (three
sources confirmed) near Tatong, hit by the
3-7-in section at Wong Ne Chong

At 1030 hours a fighter-bomber was hit by
the Brick Hul 3.7-in. gun and crashed in a
gulley (two sources corroborated),

56. Civilian morale improved somewhat.

The arrest this day of a prominent Chinese
merchant for defeatist talk was expected to
have a salutary effect—which in fact it did.

Fifth columnists were still active. Their
methods consisted of shining lights to ‘bring
shell fire to bear on concentrations of trans-
port, etc., sniping, spreading false rumours,
inducing desertion from ‘“‘ essential services ’’
and inciting to riot. They also again attacked
the isolated A.A. searchlight position at
Shaukiwan.

57. During the hours of darkness and early
hours of 17th December mortar fire from Kow-
loon Peninsula continued on to the North shore
pillboxes.

A force of 14 Army light bombers made two
separate attacks at about 0930 hours 17th
December—the first on Shaukiwan and
Wanchai, and the second on the Peak Wireless
Station, Garden Road, and Central District in
Victoria. These were followed by a short but
relatively severe artillery and mortar bombard-
ment on Central District.

Shortly afterwards two Japanese launches
flying a white flag crossed the harbour. The
delegation brought written proposals for sur-
* render, similar to those of 43th December. It
‘was thought that the Japanese supposed our
morale to be shaken. The proposals were
signed by Lt.-General Sakai and the Naval
‘C.-in-C  Vice-Admiral Niimi. The envoys
appeared genuinely surprised and disconcerted
when the proposals were again summarily re-
jected. They left with the hint that future
‘bombardments might not be so discriminate.

This second delegation coming within four
-days of the first suggested that either (2) they
‘disliked the prospect of attacking across the
water or (6) that the Chinese threat in their
‘rear was taking effect, or (c) that 1t was an
attempt to undermine our morale by thoughts
of peace and quiet. The Japanese delegation
announced on arrival that there would be no
hostilities until 1600 hours by which time they
expected a reply. Advantage was taken of
this very welcome lull to repair communica-
‘tions, etc,

Considerable activity seawards was reported
‘during the afternoon of the 17th December, in-
cluding a 2,000 ton freighter operating in the
‘shelter, westward of Lamma, On the mainland
there was activity round Kai Tak aerodrome,
both launch and motor transport and at

911

Bailey’s yard the following were seen—three
ferry vessels, three ‘barges, one large water
boat, one steam tug, one motor boat.

During the 17th December our artillery
suffered no damage or casualties for the first
tume for many days. Our counter battery fire
silenced hostile artillery on Devil’s Peak, Gun
Club Mill, and also three mortars on the
Kowloon waterfront.

58. Aircraft identified to date were of the
following types; Navy Reconnaissance Flying
Boat, type 94—-Heavy Navy Bomber, type 96
—Army light Bomber, type 98 —Amny Fighter,

97, unidentified fighter, now known to be
the Navy O. Heaviest bomb dropped, identi-
fied, 250 Ibs.—but from deduction (fuze caps,
size of crater, etc.) it was considered that some
of 500 Ibs. were also dropped.

59. Morale of civilian population continued
fo improve and the rice distribution was getting
better.

60. At 2100 hours 17th December hostile
artillery fire started a severe fire at the large
paint works at Braemar, causing a heavy smoke
pall. Owing to its proximity the ammunition of
the 18-pounder Beach Defence section nearby
had to be moved to an alternative position, and
at about midnight the guns themselves were
forced to follow to the same position behind
the Police station in that vicinity.

The shelling of the North East sector was
particularly heavy and lines were being con-
Stantly cut and repaired. At 2000 hours many
pill boxes were still out of touch and field
cable had to be substituted for the buried system
that night.

At about ,o100 hours Aberdeen came under
shell fire from seawards and the Industrial
School (HQ of the Aberdeen portion of the
R.N. Dockyard) was hit.

61. (a) At first light r8th December a Japan-
ese destroyer was sighted sixteen miles South
of Aberdeen.

(b) A considerable movement of small craft
between the Kowloon wharves and piers was
observed,

(c) In the early hours a 60-pounder gun
which; had been brought up into the North
Point’ under cover of darkness (Lt. J. S.
Vintner commanding) attempted to sink three
freighters in Kowloon Bay suspected of being
used as observation posts or being prepared as
‘jumping off places ’’ for an attack. Only
shrapnel was available but by obtaining hits
on the water line one 4000 ton ship was holed
and settled down.

62. At Iooo hours an air raid of consider-
able intensity developed on the Central Dis-
trict, Victoria. The Anglo-Persian Com-
pany’s petrol and oil Stor ge ‘tanks at Notth
Point were set on fire and’ subsequently shelled
at intervals throughout thé day. The attack
seemed to be directed particularly agairist the
Government Offices, where theSecrétariat was
hit, and many casualties were caused in the
neighbourhood. During the early afternoon
Causeway Bay area was very heavily shelled,
the water front from that place to Lyemun now
becoming a tangle of fallen tramwires and stan-
dards and almost impassable for vehicles and
despatch riders.
