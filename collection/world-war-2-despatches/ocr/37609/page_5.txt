SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON

Egyptian frontier; but our small force continued
to dominate the situation and to inflict con-
siderable casualties.

30. During the remainder of July operations
continued on the same lines. The enemy
continued to suffer heavy casualties but
gradually moved forward his camps and estab-
lished a force of at least four divisions within
easy reach of the Egyptian frontier. During
this period the 8th Hussars relieved the 7th
Hussars, who went back for a rest, and H.Q.

of the 7th Armoured Brigade relieved H.Q..

4th Armoured Brigade. All vehicles were
beginning to show considerable signs of wear,
and replacement was difficult owing to the
distance from railhead and the almost entire
absence of spares in Egypt for the armoured
fighting vehicles. For this reason about the
end ot July I gave instructions that track
vehicles should be withdrawn from the frontier
for overhaul and refit, as I was afraid that
otherwise when the enemy advanced our
armoured fighting vehicles would be very
largely out of action. Of 306 tanks on the
War Establishment 200 were normally avail-
able with units, the remainder being under
fepair in workshops. There was no reserve of
tanks to meet war wastage.

3x. After the withdrawal of the Armoured
Brigade the frontier was held by a force
under the command of the Support Group of
the Armoured Division, consisting of the 3rd
Coldstream Guards from the Matruh garrison,
the 1st K.R.R.C., 2nd Rifle Brigade, 1xth
Hussars, one squadron ist Royal Tank Regi-
ment and two batteries of Royal Horse Artil-
lery (one of anti-tank guns, one of 18-25 pdrs.).
A section of the 7th Medium Regiment was also
brought forward to harass the enemy. This
small force was distributed over a front of
some 60 miles from Sollum to Fort Maddalena.
The troops continued the same policy of active
patrolling, but the enemy’s numbers were now
very much increased, his artillery was
numerous and active and the opportunities for
effective action were fewer. Nevertheless this
small force continued to inflict heavy casualties
on the enemy with practically no loss to itself,
and to hold in check a force of four or five
divisions for a further six weeks. A skilful
use was made of dummy tanks to deceive the
enemy.

32. By roth September it became obvious
that an enemy advance across the frontier was
imminent. All preparations had already been
made for the withdrawal of our frontier force
and the first stage of this was now put into
execution. On 13th September the enemy
advance began, a large force being deployed
under heavy artillery preparation against the
escarpment above Sollum, which had for some
time past been held only by a platoon and
had by now been evacuated. At the same time
time another enemy column advanced on the
Halfaya Pass down the escarpment towards
Sollum. Both these columns were engaged by
our artillery, which inflicted considerable losses
on them.

It had been uncertain whether the enemy
would make his main advance along the coast
road, or would attempt a wide movement south
of the escarpment. There is some reason to
believe that the latter may have been the
enemy’s original intention, but in the event his
advance was made on a narrow front along

the coast road with two divisions in the front
line and two in support, and one more and a
Mobile Force (Maletti Group) in close reserve.
He was supported by a numerous artillery and
by about 200 light and medium tanks.

The part of our covering force which was
north of the escarpment and on which this
attack fell consisted of the 3rd Coldstream
Guards, one battery 3rd Royal Horse Artillery
and one section of the 7th Medium Regiment.
It was subsequently supported by a detach-
ment of the rst K.R.R.C. and a company of the
French battalion.* The remainder of our
covering force was south of the escarpment to
provide against an sg movement from that
flank. The 1st Royal Tank Regiment, which
was south of the escarpment, was moved to the
northern flank when the direction of the enemy
advance became evident, but for various reasons
arrived too late to take any part in the actions
during the withdrawal.

33. For four days, from 13th September to
16th September, our small force withdrew along
the coast road from Sollum to the east of Sidi
Barrani. The enemy reached Sidi Barrani,
which is merely a collection of a few houses and
a landing ground, on 16th September and there
halted.

Although the enemy had large numbers of
medium and light tanks with his forward troops
and the leading infantry was in M.T., his ad-
vance was slow and unenterprising. He made
little attempt to use his immensely superior
numbers or his mobility to outflank and over-
whelm our small force. His artillery was boldly
used, even in front of the leading infantry, but
their fire, though reasonably accurate, was in-
effective. His tanks were mainly used for the
protection of the infantry columns, and only on
one occasion, on xr6th September, was any
attempt made to use them to outflank our
troops; and even on this occasion their timidity
and hesitation lost them an opportunity.

34. The withdrawal of our small force was
effected with admirable skill, and there is no
doubt whatever that very serious losses were
inflicted on the enemy, both by the artillery,
which was boldly and effectively handled, and,
whenever opportunity offered, by machine gun
and small arms fire. Our own losses were
under 50 men and a small number of vehicles,

The greatest possible credit is due to Brigadier
W. H. E. Gott, M.C., commanding the Support
Group, and to Lieut.-Colonel J. C. Campbell,
M.C., commanding the Artillery, for the cool
and efficient way in which this withdrawal was
carried out, also to the troops for their endur-
ance and tactical skill. %

Since their advance to Sidi Barrani the enemy
has remained practically stationary for the last
two months. Small mobile columns formed
from the 7th Armoured Division have continu-
ally engaged and harassed the enemy in the
same manner as on the frontier and with similar
success. The enemy has, in the same way as
on the frontier, placed his troops in a number
of defended camps with all round perimeters,
from Maktila on the coast, x0 to 15 miles east of
Sidi Barrani, to Sofafi on the escarpment south-
west of Sidi-Barrani. He is undoubtedly suffer-
ing considerable administrative difficulties and
it is at present uncertain whether he will con-
tinue his advance.
