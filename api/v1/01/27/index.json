Like Bardia and Tobruk, Derna had already been regularly and heavily bombed for a con- siderable period and was not, therefore, sub- jected to concentrated bombing attacks imme- diately prior to the assault. Fighter patrols, however, provided constant cover for the troops and continued to harass the enemy on his lines of communication throughout the operations."

At 0745 hours on the 26th January our air reconnaissances reported two transports and some smaller craft escorted by two cruisers and twelve destroyers closing the shore at Endau. This convoy was twice attacked during the day by Hudson, Albacores and Vickers Vildebeeste aircraft escorted by Hurricanes and Buffalos. Each time a large force of Japanese Navy Zero fighters operating from Kuantan was met and there was much air fighting. A minimum of 13 enemy fighters were destroyed while we lost 1 Vickers Vildebeeste, 2 Hurri- canes and 1 Buffalo. Both enemy trans- ports were hit, but the landing was not pre- vented. Our Air Striking Force in Malaya, even such as it was, had now vanished. On the night 26th/27th January H.M. Australian destroyer \u2018\u2018 Vampire \u2019\u2019 and H.M.S. \u2018\u2018 Thanet \u201d were sent to sweep up the coast and attack the Japanese transports.

The first major development during the period under report was the switch of an air supply base from Agartala to Chittagong on the 27th January, 1945, when No. 3 R.A.M.O. was moved across and reopened as No. 7. This was the first step in bringing the air bases forward to keep up with the advance of Fourteenth Army. Chittagong airfield had originally been designed for the operation of \u2018light bombers, and considerable engineering effort was required to adapt the installation to take continuous traffic imposing much heavier loads. Nevertheless C. 46 aircraft started to operate on this route on the 2nd February. No. 7 R.A.M.O., incidentally had no Air Des- patch Company allotted to it but, using pioneer labour only, achieved the very fine average of over 700 tons per day in April."

By the 3ist January, 7 Indian Division was seven miles east of Pyinchaung, after forcing the double crossing of the Yaw Chaung against unexpectedly light opposition. 28 (East African) Brigade was operating to the south, covering the right flank of the Corps. 75. On the 8th February, the joint Four- teenth Army/221 Group R.A.F. Headquarters opened at Monywa. This now included the Rear Headquarters, 221 Group, which had been left behind at Imphal when Army Headquar- ters moved forward, only a small operations staff then accompanying the Army Head- quarters. 221 Group Headquarters, under Air Vice-Marshal \u00a7. F. Vincent, and Headquarters Fourteenth Army maintained a joint Head- quarters for the remainder of the campaign."
