Conclusion,

84. I am greatly indebted to my staff, so admirably led by Rear-Admiral G. E. Creasy, for their magnificent work and outstanding devotion to duty throughout the long planning period and later during the operation. No Commander-in-Chief has ever been better served

and I count myself fortunate in having had .

the services of so fine a company of officers.

85. I desire also to record my complete satisfaction and admiration for the manner in which the ships of our Allies have carried out their

. arduous duties, and which has contributed so much towards the liberation of their countries.

86. Finally, I cannot close this letter without expressing my deepest admiration for the

I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Signed) B. H. Ramsay, Admiral.  GENERAL Dwicat D. E1sznHower, U.S. Army, Supreme Commander,
