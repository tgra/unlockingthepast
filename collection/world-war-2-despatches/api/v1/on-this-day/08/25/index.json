After 25th August, 1943, supply convoys, which hitherto had come from North Africa and Middle East, began to arrive direct from the United Kingdom and United States. This shifting of the base back to the producer countries meant that it was necessary to submit long-term forecasts of requirements sometimes weeks before arrival. The effect was a loss of flexibility with a consequent waste of shipping and congestion of ports, due to convoys arriving with stores which were not immediately needed, or in excess of current requirements."

The plan of the attack, as given in orders issued on 13th August, Provided for a simultaneous assault by three Corps in line. 2 Polish Corps, on the tight, was to attack and seize the high ground north-west of Pesaro; this was all the Poles could do in their present weak state and after completion of this task they would revert to Army reserve, x Canadian Corps, in the centre, was to attack on the left of the Poles to capture the high ground west of Pesaro and from there, squeezing out the Poles, to reach the main road at Cattolica and drive up the road along the coast directed on Rimini. 5 Corps, on the left, was to advance on an axis to the west of Rimini, directed on Bologna and Ferrara. The movement across to the east coast began on r5th August on a heavy scale and was completed by,a triumph of organization, by 22nd August. 25th August was decided on as D-day. It was not expected that we should be in contact with the   Gothic   line on that date but this was no disadvantage as we intended to press up to and through the line in one motion. This would be of assistance in the matter of surprise. 13 Corps came under command of Fifth Army on 18th August. Between its right and the left of 5 Corps the mountainous central sector was the responsibility of ro Corps, commanding only ro Indian Division and a scratch brigade group, mainly of dismounted armoured car regiments."

In the eastern halt there are only the two roads which lead to Forli and Cesena and both these run northeast instead of due north. Lateral communication is infinitely better on the northern side of the mountains than on the southern. On the latter movement from east to west is limited to a few poor roads across the mountains but on the Germans  side the Via Emilia, Route g, runs along the whole length of the position. It is a broad, straight road on the flat, with numerous short roads leading  off it into the mountains, for the crest line is nearer the southern than thea northern edge and the secondary road system on the latter is therefore much more developed. This is an enormous advantage to the defender, for in the defence of a line it is vital to be able to move forces rapidly from one sector to another where the threat is greatest.   The original German plan for Italy, as Hitler told Mussolini at the Feltre conference in July, 1943, was to hold nothing south of the line of the Northern Apennines so that the preliminary reconnaissances for the   Gothic   line were probably carried out about that time.  Work appears to have begun in September, 1943. The first work was done at the two ends, in the coastal plain south of La Spezia and behind the Foglia river on the Adriatic, and in the centre, where elaborate defences were constructed on the Futa Pass. Italian forced labour and a Slovak Technical Brigade were used; but as the winter of 1943 progressed most of the labour force was diverted to work on the   Gustav ,   Hitler ? and   Caesar   lines, and it was not until the fall of Rome that priority was restored to the  * Gothic   line and the work was pushed ahead at the highest pressure. It was principally to gain more time to allow for the   Gothic   line to ber completed that Kesselring fought the battles of Lake Trasimene and Arezzo. At one time it was expected that it would be ready by 30th June but in fact our attack on the Adriatic on 25th August found many of the defences on the Foglia still unfinished while in some of the more inaccessible mountain sectors they were only in the early stages of development. The total length of the line of defences was about two hundred miles. In the west the . approaches to La Spezia and the valley of the Magra were barred by a system of anti-tank defences in depth with two artificial obstacles seven miles apart; this was the only example of defence in depth in the system. From the tegion of Carrara the line swung south-east"

The opening stages were silent but a barrage was fired at midnight to cover the advance from the bridgeheads over the Metauro river. By dawn on the 26th all the five assaulting divisions were deep across the river, more or less without nepoasien. It soon became obvious that we had caught the Germans in the middle of a fairly complicated withdrawal and regrouping movement; their intention was to pass 278 Division back through x Parachute Division and bring it across to the western flank of LXXVI Corps where it would relieve 5 Mountain Division which was to move to the French frontier to relieve 90 Panzer Grenadier Division. The enemy was, therefore, prepared to yield ground and the fact that he was fallang back voluntarily as we advanced made it difficult for him to detect the greater weight of our attacks on this occasion compared with tthe following-up attacks by which the Poles had up to now been pressing him back up the Adriatic coast. Eighth Army's secret concentration had completely escaped his notice; the presence of some new troops in the former Polish sector had indeed been established but, having overestimated the Polish casualties in"
