On the left the New Zealanders and 7 Armoured Division felt with some caution round the southern end of the enemy's anti-tank screen. By the evening we had reached the Wadi Zem Zem and seized the main crossing at El Faskia. The battle of the Buerat line was now over in a day and the enemy began to withdraw on his whole front, making for the hilly country covering Tripoli on the south-east. His maim anxiety throughout was for  his desert flank, since his left, retreating by the road, had to make a fairly wide circuit through Misurata and Zliten He went back fairly slowly, therefore, on his right, pivoting on Bem Ulid until 90 Light Division on the coast had teached Homs; then he drew his southern forces back to Tarhuna and by the rgth was again facing south-west on the general line Homs Tarhuna. The two divisions on our left found great difficulty in coming to grips with the enemy for the country was very difficult and, in the early stages, strewn with mines 51 Division, on the coast, met less enemy resistance but was delayed by heavy demolitions and mines all along the road. It was not until the early hours of 18th January that the division entered Misurata and the evening of the igth when it entered Homs. We were now in close contact with the enemy all along his new position, By this time too our fighter aircraft had been installed on new landing grounds at Bir Dufan, south-west of Misurata, where they could attack the enemy in the hill country all the way to Tripoli."

As a result, ro Armoured Division never could muster its full establishment of tanks, and both divisions were short of artillery. In addition to these two formations, further German Marsch battalions were brought over at regular intervals, some of which continued to be employed as independent infantry battalions, and were not broken: up as reinforcements. These independent battalions were used either to bring up the original impromptu force to the strength of a division, which was originally called Division Broich and latterly Division Manteuffel after its commanders, or were used to reinforce the Italian Superga Division which had been stationed on the enemy's left flank in mountainous country south of Zaghouan. In addition, the Bafile and Grado Battalions of the Italian San Marco Marine Regiment and a Bersaglieri Battalion were also brought over, The most significant arrival at this time was 501 Heavy Tank Battalion with 43 tanks, of which 20 were the new Mark VIL, which first went into action against the French 19 Corps on the 18th January, 1943."

If, however, new expeditions are located threatening the east coast of Malaya or endeavouring to pass south of Singapore, all available air effort should be directed to destroying such targets .

            "description": "47. Co-operation with A.V.G. and the American Aty Force. I took the earliest opportunity of meeting Colonel (now BrigadierGeneral) Chennault in Kunming on the 31st January. At this meeting we discussed and agreed the principles on which the A.V.G. Squadron in Burma would be used in air-battle. As always, his primary requirement was good warning. He was quite clear that if I was unable to provide this for the A.V.G. the Squadron would have to be withdrawn to China. I have to record my appreciation of the way in which General Chennault wholeheartedly maintained the Squadron at the highest practicable level in pilots and P.40's from his fast dwindling resources in China. On the 18th January so bad were these that he issued instructions for the Squadron to be withdrawn to China. The Supreme Commander was informed and the Generalissimo, Chiang Kai-Shek, after the representations of the combined Chiefs of Staff, agreed to the retention of the A.V.G. in the defence of Rangoon. Elsewhere I have remarked upon the admirable gallantry and fighting characteristics of the 3 Pursuit Squadrons of the A.V.G. who fought over Rangoon in turn an admiration felt not only by the R.A.F. but by the Army also. The co-operation between the A.V.G. and the Hurricanes was close and cordial."

            "date": "18th January",
            "description": "The Japanese were in-occupation of Victoria Point and it was known that patrols were working up towards Mergui. With the possibility of Tavoy falling into the hands of the enemy Mergui would be in a very precarious position. Consequently on the 18th January, it was decided, during my absence in Kengtung, to evacuate Mergui while there was yet time and to transfer the troops to Tavoy and to make every endeavour to hold the aerodrome at that place. I confirmed these orders on my return."
