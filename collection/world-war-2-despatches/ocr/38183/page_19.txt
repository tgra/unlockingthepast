SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 22 JANUARY, 1948

1940, an estimate was made of the total armed
forces required on the supposition that 582 air-
craft would be available for the defence of the
Far East. The estimate was as follows: —

26 infantry battalions, including 3 for

Borneo. :

5 field regiments.
3 light tank companies,

In‘addition anti-tank units, troops for local
defence of aerodromes, volunteer units and an-
cillary troops. This figure of 26 battalions was
agreed to by the Chiefs of Staff in January,
1941. ‘

On his arrival, General Percival . went
thoroughly into the question of the strength of
the Army and, in August, 1941, sent his esti-
mate of the strength required, which he sum-
marised as:—

48 Infantry Battalions.

4 Indian Reconnaissance Units.
g Forward Artillery Regiments.
4 Light A.A. Regiments.

2 Tank Regiments.

3 -Anti-Tank Regiments.

2 Mountain Artillery Regiments.
12 Field Companies. .

This was based on my forecast of the strength
which our Air Forces would reach by December,
I94I, namely 186 first-line aircraft as against the
accepted figure of 336. I was asked for obser-
vations and my general conclusion was that no
drastic reduction in General Percival’s estimate
was acceptable until the strength of the Royal
Air Force was materially increased not only in
numbers but in quality of aircraft and in re-
serves of air crews and aircraft. Also that
before General Percival’s new target was
reached in Malaya, the question of increasing
forces in other areas of my command, especially
Burma, would have to be considered. The
Chiefs of Staff commented: ‘‘ We accept esti-
mate by General Officer Commanding, Malaya,
as reasonable figure for land forces required in
present circumstances. Nevertheless, this tar-
get cannot be fulfilled in foreseeable future.”

gi. In December,’ 1941, while the actual
strength of the Royal Air Force (see Appendix
J) approached very closely to my forecast, the
Army strength (see Appendix E) fell far short
of the figure which it had been agreed was re-
quired to compensate for the deficiency in air-
craft. The main deficiencies were: —
17 Battalions;
4 Light A.A. Regiments; and
2 Tank Regiments.
The strength in A.A. weapons in the Far East
on the 7th December, 1941, is given in Appendix
92. The fact that we were entirely without
tanks in Malaya was a serious handicap to any
offensive land operations, whether on a small
or a large scale. There were also very few
armoured cars. Many efforts were made to
obtain both tanks and armoured cars from vari-
ous sources. On the rqth August the War
Office offered forty light tanks from the Middle
East. These tanks were at the time being em-
ployed for aerodrome defence, and they were
offered to the Far East on the condition that
they would be employed in an operational role,
and that we could man them from local re-
sources. Some delay occurred at Singapore in
finding the best method of meeting the latter

condition. Eventually Australia agreed to pro-
vide the necessary men and to train them up to
aereasonable standard in Australia, this training
to be completed by the ist January, 1942. On
the 13th November, 1941, however, Middle
East reported to the War Office that they could
not provide forty tanks for the Far East except
at the expense of operational requirements.
After war had broken out, War Office ordered
Middle East to send fifty light tanks to India,
their subsequent destination to be decided later.

With regard to armoured cars, a model uf
an armoured vehicle mounted on an American
chassis was obtained from the Dutch and six
were made in Singapore, chiefly at the Naval
Base; drawings were also made and sent to
Burma. No more, however, could be made
owing to a shortage of boiler plate, which was
used for the armouring. By the 24th Novem-
ber, r94z, a total of 84 Marmon-Harringtom
armoured cars had been shipped from South
Africa for Singapore. Some of these arrived:
a few days before war broke out, and the
drivers had not become accustomed to them
before they had to go to the front.

The number of anti-tank weapons had im-
proved considerably by the time war broke
out, but there was still a shortage of the 0.5
anti-tank rifle in infantry units,

The lack of mobile A.A. weapons was serious,
especially in view of the shortage of fighters.
A constant anxiety to the General Officer Com-
manding, also, was the continual drain on the
Army for men to protect aerodromes. Indiam
State troops were brought over to assist, but it
would have been a great help if we had had
more armoured cars or even tanks of an obso--
lete pattern for this duty. This would have en-..
abled us to have a mobile defence and to.
substitute mechanical vehicles for a large pro-
portion of the men required. The reserve of.
small-arms ammunition was well below the
authorised figure. In November, 1941, General
Headquarters informed the War Office that,
with releases. in sight, we should be short of
our authorised holding of 150 million rounds
by 57 million on the Ist January, 1942. Aus-
tralia, who were already sending us 3 million
rounds per month, agreed to increase this to
8 million.

X.—Events LEADING UP TO THE War.
Lhe Problem of Japanese Intentions.

93. As the Japanese spread South into Cam-
bodia and Cochin ‘China, the potential danger
to Burma, Malaya, the South China Sea, and
even the Philippines, increased; this danger had
been realised from the start, and was referred
to in a telegram in December, 1940. But it
was difficult to judge whether this movement
signified definite plans for an offensive against
us in the near future, whether it was merely
the acquisition of a strategic asset to be used
in negotiation, or whether it was the first step
towards occupation of Siam. This applied even
to the construction of aerodromes, of which
we were kept fairly well informed; what we
were particularly on the look-out for was any
indication of movements of long-distance
bombers, or of the Zero-type fighters fitted with
detachable petrol tanks. These, of course,
could be concentrated on the aerodromes at
short notice. :

94. Another difficulty in getting any long
warning of the Japanese intention was due to:
the restriction on exports to, and imports from,
