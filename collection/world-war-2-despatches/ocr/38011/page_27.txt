SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 10 JULY, 1947

gi. Troops in contact in the Narvik area were
embarked on the last day into six destroyers
under the control of Commander Hubback,
R.N., who supervised with the assistance of
certain British officers, the embarkation of the
2,500 French troops.

Losses and Casualties.

92. The total losses apart from Naval and
Air Force casualties, incurred during the period
13th May-8th June were approximately 235 all
ranks killed, 535 wounded and 200 missing.

Of the above French casualties amounted to
170 killed and 360 wounded and missing.

Concluston—Lessons of the Operations.

93. The predominant factor in the recent
operations has been the effect of air power.
In the operations which culminated in the
evacuation of Bodo the enemy had complete
initiative in the air, and used it, first, io sup-
port his troops: —

(@) By low-flying attacks.

(6) By bombing.

(c) By surprise landings of troops by
parachute and from seaplanes.

(d) By supplying his advanced detach-
ments by air.

And secondly, to deny us the use of sea
communications in the narrow coastal waters
in the theatre of operations. ~

94. The actual casualties caused to troops
on the ground by low-flying attacks were few,
‘but the moral effect of continuous machine-
gunning from the air was considerable.
Further, the enemy made repeated use of low-
flying attacks with machine guns in replace-
ment of artillery to cover the movement of his
troops. Troops in forward positions subjected
to this form of attack are forced to ground,
and, until they have learned by experience its
comparative innoccuousness, are apt not to keep
constant watch on the enemy. Thus the enemy
were enabled on many occasions to carry out
forward and outflanking movements with
impunity.

The second effect of low-flying attacks was
the partial paralysis of headquarters and the
consequent interruption in the exercise of
command.

Thirdly, low-flying attacks against transport
moving along narrow roads seriously interfered
with supply, though this was never completely
interrupted.

95. Bombing was not effective against
personnel deployed in the open, but this again
interfered with the functioning of headquarters
and the movement of supplies.

The enemy’s use of aircraft in these two
methods of offence was obviously most closely
co-ordinated with the action of his forward
troops, and showed a very high degree of co-
operation between his Air Force and his Army,
particularly in view of the fact that his aero-
dromes' were distant from the actual fighting.

96. Surprise landings from aircraft had far-
reaching effects owing to the ability they con-
ferred on the enemy to outflank positions or
take them in the rear.

The action on the Hemnes Peninsula, South
of Mo, provides an outstanding example of
these tactics. The sequence of this action was
first bombing and low-flying attacks on our
*xoops holding the position. These attacks were

followed almost immediately by landings trom
seaplanes in two places on each flank of the
peninsula. Once these landings had been
secured they were promptly reinforced by small
coastal steamers and further reinforcements
were brought up to the outflanking detachments
by seaplanes on succeeding days. In addition,
seaplanes were used to ferry troops for further
outflanking movements. Bicycles, mortars and
motor cycles were carried in the seaplanes for
this purpose.

The possibility of the enemy carrying out
such outflanking movements caused continuous
dispersion of the troops trying to hold defensive
positions during the withdrawal and prevented
sufficient concentration to enable any of the
positions selected to be held successfully.

97. The enemy’s ability to supply detach-
ments by air enabled him to neglect or over-
come many of the obstacles put in his way by
demolitions.

The outstanding example of the supply by
air is the maintenance of the German detach-
ments in the Narvik area. In this area his
troops to the number of three or four thousand
have been successfully supplied by air for many
weeks, partly by seapianes landed on the
Beisfjord, partly by aircraft landed on frozen
lakes or small landing grounds, and partly by
the dropping of containers attached to
parachutes. ;

From the reports received, the enemy operat-
ing in the mountainous country 12 to 15 miles
North of Narvik were plentifully supplied with
all their requirements. A large number of
cardboard containers were found in Narvik,
and it is reported that large quantities of perish-
able foodstuffs, such as vegetables, eggs and
butter from Denmark, were successfully
dropped in Narvik from the air.

g8. As regards the control of sea communi-
cations, the enemy's supremacy in the air made
the use inshore of naval vessels of the type co-
operating with this force highly dangerous and
uneconomical. Though it might have been
possible to use high speed coastal motor bo: ts
atTmed with small guns to prevent movement
of enemy craft in these waters, the use of
trawlers, owing to their extreme vulnerability
to air attack, was not considered practicable.
On the other hand, the inshore waterways were
used at will by the Germans, who constantly
employed local boats and steamers to ferry
their troops about thus entailing more dis-
persion of the defending forces on land.

In an attempt to send considerable reinforce-
ments and wheeled vehicles to Bodo, the Polish
steamer Chrobry was sunk before she
reached port. The unloading of large supply
ships which, owing to the limited facilities
available, would have taken many hours, had
to be ruled out as impracticable and reinforce-
ments to Bodo could therefore be sent only by
destroyer or by small local craft. Thus the
provision of adequate reinforcements in guns
and vehicles was made extremely difficult.

99. The second main factor which has
affected the operations in this theatre has been
training. It has been brought out that for
operations of this nature thoroughly trained
soldiers only are of any real value, and that
ere officer and man must be physically hard
and fit.
