SUPPLEMENT 10 tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

men of this Regiment were still in the recruit
stage and none of them had had any training
on guns. When hostilities opened there were
60 Heavy Anti-Aircraft guns in the Singapore
area out of the 104 which had been authorised.
These consisted of two 4.5 in., thirty-eight
3.7 in, and twenty 3 in., the majority of which
were static. Every effort had, however, been
made to make as many as possible mobile and
to train in mobile operations. Outside Singa-
pore Island, authority had been received for the
‘preparation of positions for the defence of
Penang and of the aerodromes at Aior Star,
Sungei Patam, Kota Bharu and Kuantan, but
only those at Sungei Patani had been com-
pleted when hostiuties opened. Temporary
positions were, however, occupied by such 3 in.
guns as could be made available for defence of
the Alor Star and Kota Bharu aerodromes. One
battery of:the Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment
from Singapore, on a mobile basis, was placed
under orders of the Commander, 3 Indian
Corps, for expected operations in North Malaya
and was located at Alor Star. There were no
guns available for the defence of cities on the
mainland such as Kuala Lumpur and Ipoh.

At the time of my arrival in Malaya the anti-
aircraft artillery was under the orders of the
Commander, Singapore Fortress. Having in
view, however, the increase in the scale of anti-
aircraft defence and its extension to other parts
of Malaya, I decided to bring the anti-aircraft
artillery directly under my own command,
except for purposes of administration, and to
reorganize it under the Commander, Anti-Air-
craft Artillery, into two brigades, one for Singa-
pore and one for North Malaya. This re-
organization had not been completed when
wat broke out. Command of the Anti-Aircraft
Artillery in North Malaya was delegated to the
Commander, 3 Indian Corps.

39. In 1940 the Active Air Defence was
strengthened by the arrival of fighter aircraft.
A proportion of these was always retained at
the Singapore bases for defence of the im-
portant objectives in that area, the remainder
being allotted to the northern area, which
appeared to be the most vulnerable to attack.

40, With the arrival in Malaya in the summer
of 1941 of Group Captain Rice, who had had
much experience, in connection with the Air
Defence of Great Britain, the task of building
up a coordinated Air Defence scheme for
Malaya was energetically pushed forward. The
fighters allotted to the defence of the Singapore
area were placed under the command of Group
Captain Rice. This officer was also authorised,
as tegards the Singapore area, to co-ordinate
the action of the fighters and the anti-aircraft
artulery and, during hostile attacks, to issue
orders direct to these two formations. A con-
trol station was established near the Kallang
aerodrome.

4r. As part of this Air Defence scheme an
efficient Warning System was essential. An
organization of civilian watchers had already
been started. Efforts were now made to extend
this organization and provide it with better
equipment. There were two main difficulties.
Firstly, there was the difficulty of finding suit-
able people in the less developed parts of
Malaya to complete the chain of watchers.
Secondly, and more important still, was the
paucity of communications. The civil telephone
system in Malaya consisted only of a few

1255

trunk lines, which followed the main arteries
of communication, and local lines in the popu-
lated areas, This was quite inadequate fog,a
really efficient Warning System, as it was im-
possible to allot separate lines for this purpose.
A plan was worked out, in conjunction with
the civil authorities, for the duplication of this
system and for extensions where required. A
start was made with the limited amount of
cable available but only small progress had
been made when war broke out.” There were
a few radar sets available but efforts to supple-
ment the system with wireless communication
met with only partial success owing to the un-
reliability of wireless in the difficult climatic
conditions of Malaya, Nevertheless, in spite of
these difficulties, an organization was built up
which proved of great value during the sub-
sequent operations, though it should be pointed
out that it covered South Malaya and the
Singapore area only, and that there was no
adequate Warning System for North Malaya.

The organization of Passive Air Defence will
be expiained later when dealing with Civil
Defence.

42. Defence of Aerodromes.—As a result of
experience in Europe, and especially in Crete,
the C.-in-C. Far East laid down that the
defence of aerodromes was to take precedence,
as regards A.A. weapons, over everything else
except the defence of the Naval Base. A scale
of Heavy and Light A.A. Guns for each aero-
drome was laid down but, owing to lack of
Tesources, it was never approached. Such guns
as were available, however, were allotted for
this purpose. In addition, small infantry
garrisons, drawn from Malayan Volunteer units
or Indian State Force units, were provided.
There were also a few heavy armoured lorries
specially constructed for this purpose. In no
case, however, was the strength of the garrison
really adequate for the defence of the aero-
dromes, the perimeters of which varied between
3 and 5 miles.

43. Borneo.—The large Island of Borneo,
partly British and partly Dutch, was clearly
of great strategical importance, lying as it
did between the main routes linking Japan with
Malaya and Sumatra on the one hand and
Java and the Southern Areas on the other, and
containing large supplies of oil arid other raw
materials. Unfortunately neither the British
nor the Dutch were able to find adequate
garrisons for this island.

The British portion of Borneo consisted of :—

British North Borneo a territory controlled
by the British North Borneo Company,
whose headquarters were in London. The
Govertior and officials of British North
Borneo were in the employ of that Company.

Labuan Island.—A British Colony admini-
stered by a Resident. ‘

Brune:.—A British Protected State with
its own Sultan.

Sarawak.—A Malay State which had for
many years been governed by members of
the Brooke family. In September 1941, how-
ever, the ruling Rajah made over much of
his responsibility to a Council. He then left
Sarawak for a holiday and was in Australia
when hostilities broke out. His efforts to
return to Sarawak were unsuccessful.

There had for some time been a project to
open up air facilities in British Borneo. Aero-
drome sites had been selected and surveyed.
