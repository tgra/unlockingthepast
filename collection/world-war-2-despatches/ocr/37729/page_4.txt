Wellington operations included attacks on aero-
dromes in Tripolitania and on shipping at Sirte
which the Germans were developing as a
forward base.

1g. A brief appreciation of the air situation,
dated the 6th March, was prepared for the in-
formation of the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Eden,
who had arrived in Cairo in company with the
C.1.G.S. on r1gth February. A copy is
attached—Appendix ‘“‘D”’ (not reproduced).

It was at this time, particularly, that the
weakness in number of modern aircraft at my
disposal, chiefly Hurricanes and Blenheims,
caused me the gravest concern. It had been
anticipated that with the defeat of the Italian
Air Force in Cyrenaica a quiet period on that
front would justify considerable reduction in
air strength. This proved to be far from the
case, and it became apparent that air reinforce-
ments would have to be sent to Cyrenaica
immediately to prevent the enemy thrust from
developing into a serious threat to Egypt.

We were already heavily committed in Greece
and more help had been promised. Squadrons
were awaiting mew aircraft in replacement of
wastage, yet the promised arrival in Egypt of
large air reinforcements from home both via
Malta and Takoradi, in spite of periodical
emergency ferrying operations by Aircraft
Carriers, did not materialise and it was not
until the latter end of April that the situation
in this respect began to improve. Moreover,
though ships were arriving via the Red Sea
at Suez quite regularly, there was no steady
supply of cased aircraft by this route during
the whole of January, February and March.

American Tomahawk fighters, which were
beginning to come over from Takoradi, were at
this time suffering from various “‘ teething
troubles ’’ and were not yet ready for effective
operation.

Not only was the Air Force at my disposal
insufficient for the commitments which had
arisen, but the rate of replacement, either actual
or within reach, was not sufficient to keep
pace with wastage. Whereas the losses from
all causes from the rst January, ro41 to 3rst
March, 1941 were 184, during the same period
the actual arrivals in Egypt via Takoradi and
Malta were 147 and 19 respectively, or a total
of 166.

As will be seen Jater in this Despatch, during
the whole of March and April this factor of
waning resources had to be taken into account
in deciding how to employ the Air Force at
my disposal economically and to the best
advantage. .

20. Early in March, increasing numbers of
enemy M.T. were observed by air reconnais-
sances to be moving eastwards along the coastal
roads, and by the roth March large enemy
concentrations were located in the area
immediately West of Agheila. Simultaneously
the enemy established forward landing grounds
at Tamet, Syrte and El Makina.

‘By the middle of March it was estimated that
the German forces in Libya had been built up
to two divisions, one of which was armoured.
With this increase of strength in personnel
and equipment, the enemy forces gradually
assumed an offensive role. At the same time
enemy aircraft reconnoitred our forward posi-
tions apparently with the object of ascertaining
the strength of our forces,

On roth March an enemy patrol ocoupied
the landing ground at Marada, about 80 miles
South of Agheila. This move was a forerunner
of increased activity by strong enemy patrols
which- necessitated the withdrawal of our out-
posts from Agheila, the enemy occupying the
fort there on 24th March. Italian infantry,
supported by German armoured forces and
dive-bombers, moved East of Agheila on 30th
March, and on 3Ist March our forward troops
were compelled to fall back on Agedabia.
Blenheims of No. 55 Squadron bombed and
machine-gunned enemy M.T. concentrations,
while the landing ground at Misurata, from
which enemy aircraft were operating in support
of their advance, was successfully attacked by
Wellingtons and Blenheims. The superior
weight of the enemy enabled him to continue
his advance, however, despite the opposition
of our troops and aircraft.

21. On 2nd April, the enemy continued to
advance in Cyrenaica, compelling our forward
troops to withdraw from Agedabia. The situa-
tion in Benghazi thus became precarious, and
orders for demolitions were issued. Prepara-
tions were made for the withdrawal of all
R.A.F. Units from that area, and Benina was
evacuated during the early evening of znd April,
all demolitions having been completed.

Although handicapped by the frequent moves
of the ground echelon necessitated by rapid
withdrawal, squadrons continued to operate
in direct support of the Army. Blenheims of
No. 55 (B) Squadron, reinforced by No. 45
Squadron, provided reconnaissances, attacked
concentrations of enemy M.T. and A.F.V’s.,
and ibombed forward enemy aerodromes.
Hurricanes of No. 3 Australian Squadron and
No. 73 (F) Squadron maintained constant
patrols, covering our troops as they withdrew
to new positions and making many effective
attacks om enemy M.T. concentrations.
Wellingtons also made night attacks on enemy
M.T. in addition to maintaining their offensive
against Tripoli whilst they mere still within
striking range of that objective. No. 6 (A.C.)
Squadron continued to operate directly under
the control of the Army and provided such
tactical reconnaissances as were possible with
their limited capacity and under conditions in
which their ground echelons, like those of the
other squadrons, were constantly on the move.

22. For the next few days complete details
of the movement of our own and enemy troops
remained somewhat obscure. At times it was
difficult for Army Co-operation aircraft to keep
track of the movements of the particular force
with which they were working. For instance,
on April 2nd, both the Flight of No. 6 (A.C.)
Squadron and the H.Q. of No. 2 Armoured
Division with which they were operating spent
the night at Antelat, but on the morning of
the 3rd April the Flight discovered that Div.
H.Q. had left and no information was forth-
coming as to their movements. The Flight
subsequently moved to the landing ground
at Msus where Free French troops were unable
to give any information concerning our troops
in the area, nor did they know where Div.
H.Q. was situated. It was not until noon
that a message was received from Second
Div. H.Q. which gave their position at that
time as 30 miles West of Msus. A tactical
reconnaissance about this time, taken by an
aircraft of this Flight from Msus, reported
