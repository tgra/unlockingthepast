No, 84 (B) Squadron.

697. This unit arrived as a reinforcement
much strung out after a long flight from the
Middle East. Its crews set a fine example of
throwing themselves into the fight at once under
many handicaps. Particular credit is due to
the Commanding Officer, the late Wing Com-
mander J. R. Jeudwine D.S.O., O.B.E.,
D.F.C., whose leadership and courage were a
great inspiration to others. He led a small
party which escaped from Java in an open boat
across the Iooo mule crossing of the Timor Sea
to Australia, a typical example of his spirit.

MVASF.

698. At a critical time of the fighting in
Southern Malaya, a number of successful
reconnaissances were carried out by this unit
to locate bodies of our troops who had been
cut off by the enemy, and to locate the enemy’s
infiltrating forces. These reconnaissances were
performed in unarmed Moth aircraft (originally
the property of Malaya’s flying clubs) at tree
top height over a battle field dominated by
Japanese Zero fighters. Their value was great
to the Army, then closely engaged with the
enemy. Pre-eminent in this work was the late
Flight Lieutenant Henry. Dane, M.V.A.F.,
whose qualities as a leader and a man were a
byword amongst those who knew him. His
example was largely responsible for the excellent
work done throughout by the M.V.A.F.

Techmcal Personnel.

699. A word of recognition is due to the
Technical Personnel of the Command.

700. Before war broke out they handled great
quantities of stores and equipment which arrived
in Malaya greatly in excess of the new stations’
power, and that of the Command’s backward
maintenance organisation, to absorb them.
Many aircraft were erectéd'and rapidly passed
into commission and many others were ovei-
hauled during the period of the Command’s
expansion.

7or. During the war itself, technical personnel
worked untiringly in most difficult circum-
stances. Aircraft and equipment had to be
dispersed as a protection against bombing,
mostly to improvised dispersal points in rubber
plantations or scrub, There they were erected,
overhauled and serviced with little or no
protection against tropical downpours.

702. An example of such work was the erec-
tion of the first 50 Hurricanes which. arrived
in Singapore in mid January 1942; it was a
particularly fine feat. Within a few days all
were ready to take the air, the first in under 43
hours: during that time they had been unloaded
in crates at the docks, conveyed many miles
by road to scattered hide-outs in rubber planta-
tions, and there rapidly erected despite tropical
rain, blackout conditions at night and a great
shortage of specialised tools,

03. Ie ‘would be invidious to select any
particular unit for special mention. Suffice it
to say that most meritorious technical work
of all kinds was performed by units throughout
the command at all stages of the operations in
Malaya and the N.E.I. under very severe con-
ditions. Not least of these handicaps was an
almost complete breakdown of the backward

maintenance organisation of the command
which was brought about by circumstances that
first overloaded and then disrupted it.

704. I will mention only one name, that of
the late Wing Commander E. B. Steedman,
whose unflagging efforts did much to inspire
others to overcome their difficulties. He sub-
sequently lost his life as a prisoner of war for
refusing, it is believed, to divulge technical
information about Spitfires. His spirit remained
unbroken to the end.

Personnel in the N.EI.

705. Those who landed in unavoidable dis-
organisation in the N.E.I. were required to
teorganise into a fighting force within a few
days with very limited resources indeed, I wish
to express my gratitude to them for the very
loyal manner in which they gave their best
services, in particular to our squadrons who had
to face a well organised enemy in overwhelming
numbers. Their behaviour is particularly
creditable, coming as it did after many reverses,
and was in the best tradition of the Service.

Finally, I am indebted to all those who, at
the end, were willing, despite shortage of arms,
lack of training, and lack of most essentials,
to fight in the hills in a form of warfare
about which they knew nothing, namely in
infantry warfare and in the jungle at that, and
to do so against an enemy whom they knew
to be well-equipped and highly trained in this
form of fighting. That they were unable to put
their willingness to the test was no fault of
theirs. I wish to place on record my gratitude
for the loyal response they gave to the call made
upon them. Their conduct deserves the highest
praise.

SUMMARY.

706. One can summarise in a few words the
reason for the initial reverses in the Far East.

707. We lost the first round there because
we, as an Empire, were not prepared for war
on the scale necessary for’the purpose. When
war broke out in Europe it absorbed the
Empire’s resources to such an extent that only
a fraction of the strength could be deployed
which had been calculated to be necessary for
withstanding Japanese aggression in Malaya—
navy, army, air force and civil organisation
alike being much below the required mark.
When Japan attacked she proved to be even
more formidable than had been expected, the
result being that she swamped our under-
developed defences before they could be
supported.

708. Mistakes undoubtedly occurred, as they
always do in war when the unexpected happens
on the scale that it did in the Far East. But
credit should be given to those on the spot
who did thei ‘best to take the first brunt of
the enemy’s- ‘overwhelming strength with in-
adequate means, and who gained thereby the
necessary time for other forces to be collected
to prevent’ his further advance towards
Australia and India.

Aw Vice-Marshal.
