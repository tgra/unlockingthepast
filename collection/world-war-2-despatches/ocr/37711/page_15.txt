munication crossing the axis of the two.Ameri-
can armies. Moreover, it was foremost in my
mind that as soon as the German attack had
been defeated the business of the Rhineland
batle should be returned to as quickly as
possible.

The battle of the Ardennes was won primarily
by the staunch fighting qualities of the Ameri-
can soldier, and the enemy’s subsequent con-
fusion was completed by the intense air action
which became possible as weather conditions
improved. Sixth S.S. Panzer Army broke
itself against the Northern shoulder of the
salient, while Fifth Panzer Army spent its drive
in the fierce battle which centred on Bastogne.
Regrouping of the First and Ninth U.S. Armies,
assisted by British formation, made possible the
rapid formation of a reserve corps of four U.S.
divisions under General Collins. The action of
this corps, co-ordinated with the drive from the
south by General Patton’s Third U.S. Army,
pinched the enemy forces out of the salient and
began the bitter struggle which was to push
them out of the Siegfried Line.

The enemy had been prevented from crossing
the Meuse in the nick of time. Once the Meuse
crossings were secure it became increasingly
apparent that the opportunity had come to turn
the enemy’s position to our advantage. Hitler’s
projected counter-offensive ended in a tactical
defeat, and the Germans received a tremendous
battering. As soon as the situation had been
restored I was able to order the British divisions
north again to the concentration areas which
had been made ready in December.

The Battle of the Rhineland. ;

The main objective of the Allies on the
Western front remained the Ruhr. Once the
Ruhr had been isolated from the rest of Ger-
many, the enemy’s capacity to continue the
struggle would quickly peter out, Beyond this,
the object of our operations was to force mobile
war on the enemy by developing operations into
the northern plains of Germany. It was
necessary first to line up on the Rhine; then to
bridge the river and gain a suitable jumping
off position for a mobile campaign in the
Spring.

The enemy was in a very bad way; he had
suffered another major defeat with heavy losses
in men and equipment. Moreover, the great
Russian winter offensive was now under way,
and we did not wish to give the enemy the
chance to switch forces to the east.

The Supreme Commander’s orders to 25
Army Group provided for a line-up on the
Rhine from Diisseldorf northwards. Ninth
U.S. Army remained under my operational
control.

First it was necessary to eliminate the enemy
salient west of the R. Roer between Julich and
Roermond. Second Army completed this task
by 28 January. The divisions concerned, less
defensive troops left holding the river line, im-
mediately started north to join the concentra-
tion for the Rhineland battle.

The battle of the Rhineland was based on
two converging offensives between the Rhine
and the Meuse, with the object of destroying
the enemy forces masking the Ruhr. It was
intended, by interdiction from the air and by
employing the maximum available forces on
the ground, to prevent the enemy withdrawing
to the east bank of the Rhine; in this, success
was largely achieved. - ,

First Canadian Army was ordered to launch
an attack S.E. from the area of the Nijmegen
bridgehead to meet the Ninth U.S. Army,
whose thrust was developed from the Julich-
Roenmond sector northwards.

It -was originally planned to launch the two
operations almost simultaneously, but the
southern thrust was delayed. In the event this
proved to our advantage.

The date by which the Ninth U.S. Army
could attack was dependent on the rate at
which U.S. divisions could be released from
other sectors of the Allied front, as the strength
of that Army was to be increased to 12
divisions. ‘Release of these divisions depended
on the situation on the rest of the front.

‘Twelfth U.S. Army Group was still involved in

the Ardennes, particularly in thrusting towards
the system of dams on the River Roer which
control its flood waters. As long as the enemy ©
held these dams he was in a position to impose
flood conditions likely to impede the crossing
of the river. Further south, the heaviest fight-

* ing was in the Saar and in the Colmar pocket

—in both areas the enemy had achieved local
successes.

The weather remained an anxious uncer-
tainty. The thaw was beginning and, apart
from the floods, it was playing havoc with our
road communications.

‘The concentration of divisions for the
Canadian Army attack was completed in the
first week in February. Elaborate arrange-
ments were made to assemble the forces em-
ployed into the very confined concentration
areas, and also to mislead the enemy about our
intentions.

On 8 February the northern wing of the
pincer movement started. 30 Corps, under
command of First Canadian Army, launched
‘its attack into the Reichswald Forest and the
northern extension of the West Wall, on a
front of five divisions, supported by. very con-
siderable Air Forces and over 1,000 guns. This
began the memorable battle which, in intensity
and fierceness, equalléd any which our troops
have experienced in this war. -

The Germans quickly built up to about eleven
equivalent divisions, including four parachute
divisions and two armoured divisions; in par-
ticular their paratroops fought magnificently.

Meanwhile the situation was improving in
other parts of the Allied Front. Operations in
the Colmar area had been successfully con-
cluded and the Germans thrown back across
the Rhine at the southern extremity of the Allied
front; the Saar sector had been stabilised. More
important still, Sixth S.S. Panzer Army was
transferred to the eastern front, to oppose the
mounting Russian offensive. The concentra-
tion of American divisions into the Ninth U.S.
Army was achieved remarkably quickly, over
long distances, using shocking roads and tracks,
and in appalling weather.

The launching of the American thrust had
been planned to start between roth and 15th
February but at the last minute, before aban-
doning the Roer dams, the enemy carried, out
demolitions which loosed the flood waters.
There followed an anxious period of waiting,
with all the troops teed up for the battle, while
the water subsided sufficiently to enable the
crossing to be launched. On 23rd February the
Ninth U.S. Army, under command of General
