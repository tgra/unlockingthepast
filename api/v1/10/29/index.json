            "description": "' 15. The convoy should have rendezvoused with the destroyers \u2018ESCAPADE, ISAAC SWEERS and MARNE in position 45\u00b0 50\u2019 N., 26\u00b0 08\u2019 W. at 0800 G.M.T. on 31st October. These destroyers had sailed from Ponta Delgada on 29th October and were joining as additional escort. Owing to the \u2018incorrect receipt of a cypher message, the rendezvous was, however, missed, and ROTHER was detached a.m. 31st to look for them but was unsuccessful. \u2018At 1815 on 1st Novembet, H.M. Ships CLEVELAND, ALBRIGHTON and ESKDALE were sighted northbound to join K.M.S. 2 and they reported having seen ESCAPADE earlier in the day steering south-east. ISAAC SWEERS and ESCAPADE eventually joined the screen at 1200 on 2nd November, and MARNE at 0800 on 3rd November."
