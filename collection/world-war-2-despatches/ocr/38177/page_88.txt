balance of strength hardly justifies a German
offensive, unless we make a serious mistake
and leave an opening. He may, however, be
reinforced in the second part of August, though
nothing is known to be scheduled. On the
other hand the Axis may make great efforts to
strengthen Panzer Armee in the shortest time.

3. Land Forces—Numbers and Morale.—
Broadly speaking, though all our forces have
been through hard times, their morale is high.
German morale is probably a little lower and
Italian morale not more than 50 per cent. In
view of the known inefficiency of the Italian
forces, any offensive action taken by the Axis
forces in August would have to be 80 per cent.
German.

4. Material_—The Eighth Army has some 60
Grant tanks now and will receive another 60
Grant tanks early in August, but there will be
no more coming until September. The deduc-
tion is that it is necessary to husband our
armonr carefully in view of the fact that during
August the enemy may build up to between
150 and 200 German tanks.
_ Eighth Army’s deficiencies in transport are

mounting. A summary of the-present state of
equipment of the major formations of Eighth
Army is attached as Appendix X.* It is also
necessary to husband our ammunition re-
sources. These stand at present as shown in
Appendix B* attached. The enemy has how-
ever similar deficiencies and his reinforcing
division is ‘notably deficient in anti-tank
weapons and transport.

5. Training—None of the formations in
Eighth Army is now sufficiently well trained
for offensive operations. The Army badly
needs either a reinforcement of well trained
formations or a quiet period in which to train.

6. Fighting value with reference to air forces.
—At present we have such air superiority that,
while our troops are relatively free from moles-
tation, the enemy is continually attacked by
night and day. Our land forces are consider-
ably heartened by this, and a large measure of
tactical freedom and security accrues from it.
Unless the enemy is strongly reinforced and our
air forces are correspondingly reduced, ‘this
superiority will assist our offensive or defensive
and gravely impede the enemy. Our air
superiority is a very considerable, if somewhat
indefinable, asset.

7. Vulnerable Points.—To us the two vulner-
able points are Cairo and Alexandria. Occupa-
tion of the Cairo area by the enemy would even-
tually dry up the Sweet Water Canal besides
securing an important area for air and land
maintenance. Alexandria is useful as a naval
base and port of ingress for supplies. The
present position of Eighth Amy at El Alamein
denies direct access to either place by road and
flanks any attempt to by-pass. The defences
of Alexandria—Cairo—the Delta proper, east
of the Nubariya canal and the Wadi Natrun
area will be well forward by r4th August and
should be complete, in so far as defences are
ever complete, by the end of August. Bottle-
necks exposed to air action are the Nile cross-
ings at Cairo and northwards, these are being
supplemented by two floating bridges south of
Cairo and by improving the routes from these

bridges eastwards, All arrangements for demoli-
tions in the Delta are being made. The enemy
has few really vulnerable points. There are
bottlenecks at Sollum and about Matruh and
Bagush, and his long L. of C. is vulnerable
to attack by raids from the air or inland or
from the sea. But otherwise the enemy is not
physically vulnerable, except to direct assault.
Morally his Italians are always vulnerable.
The soft sand areas of the country east of El
Alamein, notably the ‘‘ Barrel Track ’’ axis,
the Wadi Natrun, the sand area to its north,
are all added difficulties for the enemy’s move-
ment, particularly as they cannot be widely
known to him,

8. Ground.—The armies are now in close con-
tact over a forty mile front between the sea
and the Qattara Depression. Most of the area
is open and can be largely controlled by artillery
fire %

The front divides into three main sectors:—
A. From Tel Eisa to exclusive the Ruwei-
sat Ridge. This area is held by two divisions
(five infantry brigade groups). The Tel
Eisa salient has considerable offensive value,
but is not essential to its defence, unless the
Miteiriya Ridge is also held by us. Most
of the area is difficult for wheeled move-
ment. It is on our side strongly defended
by the fortified locality of El Alamein and
_ the mined positions to the south. This area
is well supported by strong prepared. locali-
ties to a depth of twenty-five miles. The
enemy lies in open flat country. His posi-
tions lack any well defined features and are
covered by extensive minefields. At El Daba
he has dumps.

B. From inclusive the El Mreir depression
to inclusive the Bab el Qattara depression.
This area is held by two divisions (four
brigade groups) supported by the equiva-
lent of one armoured brigade. We hold the
high ground in this area at Pt. 63 on the
Ruweisat Ridge. This position is naturally
strong and has been fortified to considerable
depth. The enemy holds strongly a series
of depressions which give good cover. His
front has been well mined and has some
wire.

In sectors A and B both the enemy and
ourselves have attacked in turn without suc-
cess.

C, From exclusive the fortified locality in
the Bab el Qattara depression to inclusive
the complete obstacle of the great Qattara
Depression. The enemy. is well posted on
strong ground at Kelat and Taqa in positions
which he has prepared for defence. The.
object of these positions is to protect his
southern flank from being turned by our
mobile troops. We have no defences in
depth opposite this sector, which is. lightly
covered by mobile troops. . “

9. Time and Space—Had the enemy the
available resources, Italy and Germany are far
nearer to E] Alamein than is anywhere in the
United Nations. The enemy should therefore
be able to reinforce quicker than we. On the
other hand, apart from distant Bengasi, he has
only two serviceable sea ports, Tobruk and,
much less useful, Matruh. He may also make
use of the railway to a limited extent. He
is faced with long road hauls and a sea passage
vulnerable to air and submarine attack. This
