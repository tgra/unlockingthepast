Group, established his Base Map Depot close
to Bayeux, and the Chief Engineer, Communi-
cations Zone, a depot not far from the two land-
ing beaches ‘‘ Utah’ and ‘“‘Omaha’”’. The
Assistant Deputy Engineer, Ninth U.S.A.A.F.
placed his depot first at Carentan and later at
Rennes, in order to be close to the main
American Base Map Depot. These depots
formed the normal source of supply for the
allied air formations then gathering on the
Continent. Some loss of maps by enemy action
occurred during the stocking of depots, but this
loss was made good from reserves held in the
United Kingdom.

464. Squadrons of both air forces had carried
with them overseas sufficient maps to cover any
operations they might undertake during the
fortnight after their landing, and ground
personnel were similarly equipped. It
was expected that the depots would, by
that time, be able to meet any demands
made upon them. Both British and
American systems of map supply had been well
practised in the United Kingdom and there was
no reason to suppose that they would not work

* successfully overseas; yet late in August,
Headquarters, British Second Tactical Air Force
complained of delays in filling their demands,
and the map depot of the Ninth U.S.A.AF.
was also unable to obtain all it required from
Communications Zone base depots. In both
cases the difficulty had to be overcome by flying
supplies from the United Kingdom,

465. The rapid advance of the Allied armies
through France and Belgium during August
and the beginning of September created an em-
barrassing situation in regard to the supply of
maps. In the planning stage, it was not
expected that by D+g0, the Allied Armies
would have passed beyond the River Seine.
By that date they were, in fact, virtually along
the line of the River Scheldt. Thus there arose,
long before the forecast planning date, an
immediate demand for maps of all kinds and
scales covering Belgium, Holland and Germany,
most of which were then either concentrated in
the base depots, in the United Kingdom or in
transit from America.

466. The problem was acute. To move
stocks already in the base depots would have
taken too long. To print in the field the full
quantity required was not practicable except
for certain large-scale topographic maps pro-
duced on mobile presses. There was, therefore,
no alternative but to draw upon reserve stocks
in the United Kingdom and fly them as rapidly
as Possible to where they were most urgently
ny .

467. Moreover, the rapidity of the advance
had deprived the printing agencies of three
valuable months. Reserve stocks of certain
sheets, notably those of Germany on a scale of
I/100,000 were extremely low and since they
were being demanded in quantity by armies no
less than by air force, new stocks of these sheets
most urgently required had to be printed as
rapidly as possible in the United Kingdom by
as many reproduction agencies as could be
pressed into service.

468. The air lift for these maps was arranged
by CATOR and the maps were flown to airfields
close to Paris and Brussels where they were
distributed direct to air formations, often within
a few hours of their having been printed, and
almost before the ink was drv upon them.

469. Although the crisis was surmounted
satisfactorily, I have little doubt that a serious
hitch might have occurred, and I feel that very
careful consideration should be given to the
question of whether some modifications in the
map supply organisation should not be made
(see paragraph 473 et seq.).

470. By an arrangement between the United
States and British forces, the “ lion’s share ’’ of
the design, production and supply of general
and special maps for use by the air forces under
my command fell to the Directorate of Military
Survey, War Office and the various Survey
Directorates working in conjunction with that
office. Their indefatigable co-operation, and
also that of the reproduction agencies of both
countries was of the utmost assistance. British
resources were augmented in the United
Kingdom by those of the 660th Engineer Topo
(Avn) Battalion, United States Army and the
942nd Engineer Topo (Avn) Battalion, forming
part of the Eighth United States Army Air
Force, which produced special maps for all
pommands within the Allied Expeditionary Air

orce.

471. The Map and Survey Section of the G-3
Division of your Headquarters also extended
their help to me, and on one occasion supplied
additional staff from No. 13 Map Reproduction
Section of the packing and distribution of ‘‘ Top
Secret ’’ maps.

472. The theatre policy for the supply of
maps to a “United States Army Air Force is
described in Appendix VIII of the Survey Staff
Manual, issued by the Chief of Engineers,
United States Army, Washington, dated 1st
June, 1944. It stipulates as a requirement, in
amplification of United States Army regulations,
300-15, a map depot for an air force, such as
the Ninth United States Army Air Force, which
would draw its maps in bulk from the Engineer,
Communications Zone.

473. In the light of experience it is clear that
this depot should have been stocked, before
leaving the United Kingdom, with sufficient
maps to last for a much longer period of the
campaign than its initial phases. It would then
have been less dependent upon the ability of
the Engineer, Communications Zone, to meet
immediately such demands as were made upon
him, Alternatively, had some of the bulk
stocks held by the Engineer, Communications
Zone, been marked before shipment for
immediate delivery to the Ninth United States
Army Air Force Base Depot, the storage would
not have been so great.

474. The British Second Tactical Air Force
was dependent for its map supply on the Map
Depots controlled by the Director of gnurvey,
2t Army Group. In particular, Nos.’ 83 and
84 Groups, Royal Air Force, drew their map
stocks from the map depots of the British and
Canadian Armies to which they were respec-
tively affiliated. By the middle of August, the
Air Officer Commanding British Second Tac-
tical Air Force had decided to form a map
depot at his headquarters from which these
groups, in an emergency, drew those maps they
required, which could not be supplied by the
armies. In October, the Director of Survey,
zi Army Group, in conference with all con-
ceed, supported this change of policy, and

recommended also that the Groups, too, should
