SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 SEPTEMBER, 1946

(b) A few outside units to be maintained
at operational strength and to be available
as Unit Reliefs in cases where this was un-
avoidable.

(c) The remaining Squadrons of the Com-
mand, which would be stripped of their
operational pilots, for ‘the benefit of the A
Squadrons, down to a level of 5 or 6. These
C Squadrons could devote their main ener-
gies to the training of new pilots, and,
although they would not be fit to meet Ger-
man Fighters, they would be quite capable
of defending their Sectors against unescorted
Bombers, which would be all that they would
be likely to encounter.

178. The necessity for resorting to such
measures as this indicates the strain which had
been put on the Fighter Command and the
Pilot Training organisations by the casualties
which the Command had suffered in this
decisive Battle.

179. In the early stages of the fight Mr.

+ Winston Churchill spoke with affectionate rail-
Jery of me and my ‘‘ Chicks.”’ He could

have said nothing to make me more proud;

every Chick was needed before the end.

180. I trust that I may be permitted to
record my appreciation of the help given me by
the support and confidence of the Prime Minis-
ter at a difficult and critical time.

181. In the early days of the War the ques-
tion of the provision of Operational Training
Units (or Group Pools, as they were called at
that time) was under discussion, It was re-
ferred to in the correspondence which I have
mentioned in paragraph 17 of this Despatch.
At that time I was so gravely in need of addi-
tional Fighter Squadrons that I was willing to
do without Group Pools altogether while we
were still at long range from the German
Fighters.

182. The functions of these Group Pools, or
0.T.Us., was to accept pilots direct from Fly-
ing Training Schools or non-fighter units of
the Royal Air Force and train them in the

handling of Fighter types, formation fiying, -

fighting tactics, and R/T control and intercep-
tion methods. [I realised that the Fighters
in France could not undertake this work and
must have a Group Pool allotted primarily to
meet their requirements, but I felt that, so long
as we at Home were out of touch with Ger-
man Fighters, I would prefer to put all avail-
able resources into new Squadrons and to
undertake in Service Squadrons the final
training of pilots coming from Flying Training
Schools, provided that they had done some for~-
mation flying and night flying, and had fired
their guns in the air.

183. Of course, when intensive fighting
‘began, final training of pilots in Squadrons
could no longer be given efficiently, and at the
time of the Battle three O.T.Us. were in exist-
tence. It was found that three weeks was
about the mimimum period which was of prac-
tical value, but that a longer course, up to six
weeks, was desirable when circumstances
permitted.

184. During the Battle the output from the
‘O.T.Us. was quite inadequate to meet the
casualty rate, and it was not even possible
to supply from the Flying Training Schools the
necessary intake to the O.T.Us.

4555

185. The lack of flexibility of the Training
system, therefore, proved to be the “‘ bottle-
neck '’ and was the cause of the progressively
deteriorating situation of the Fighter Com-
mand up till the end of September. This state-
ment is in no sense a criticism of the Flying
Training Command: The problem, as I state
it here, can have no ideal solution and some
compromise must be adopted. ~

* 186. Assuming that in periods of maximum
quiescence the Fighter Squadrons of the Royal
Air Force require an intake of x pilots per
week, in periods of intense activity they require
about ten times the number.

187. It is necessary to start the flying train-
ing of .a pilot about a year before he is ready
to engage Enemy Fighters, and therefore the
training authorities should be warned, a year
ahead, of the incidence of active periods. This
is obviously impossible. If they try to be ready
for all eventualities by catering for a con-
tinuous output to meet a high casualty rate,
the result is that, during quiet periods, pilots
are turned out at such a rate that they cannot
be absorbed, or even given enough flying to
prevent their forgetting what they have been
taught. If, on the other hand, they cater for
the normal wastage rate, Fighter Squadrons are
starved of reinforcements when they are most
vitally needed.

188. The fundamental principle which must
be realised is that Fighter needs, when they.
arise, are not comparative with those of other
Commands, bfut absolute. An adequate and
efficient Fighter force ensures the Security of
the Base, without which continuous operations
are impossible. .

189. If the Fighter defence had failed in the
Autumn of 1940, England would have been in-
vaded. The paralysis of their fighters in the
Spring was an important factor in the collapse
of the French resistance. Later, the unavoid-
able withdrawal of the Fighters from Crete
rendered continued resistance impossible. ‘

190. Day Bomber and Army Co-operation
aircraft can operate when their own Fighters
are predominant, but are driven out of the s!
when the Enemy Fighters have a free hand.

191. I submit some suggestions by which
the apparently insuperable difficulties of the
problem may be reduced.

(a) Start by aiming at a Fighter output
well above that needed in quiescent periods.

(5) Ensure that at Flying Training -
Schools, pupils earmarked for other duties
may be rapidly switched over\to Fighter
training.

(c) Organise the O.T.Us. with a
“Normal’’ and an  ‘‘ Emergency ”
Syllabus, the latter lasting for three weeks
and the former twice as long.

(@) Fill up the Service Fighter Squadrons
to a strength of 25 pilots, or whatever the
C.-in-C. considers to be the maximum which
can be kept in flying and operational’ prac-°
tice.

(e) Form Reservoirs, either at O.T.Us. or
in special units where surplus pilots may
maintain the flying and operational standard
which they have reached.

(f) When the initiative lies in our hands
(as, for instance, when we are planning to
deliver an offensive some time ahead), the
