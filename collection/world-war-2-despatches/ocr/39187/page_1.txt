12TH NOVEMBER, 1944.

NOTE.—A set of maps for this Despatch is on separate sale at 1s. Od. net. This set of
maps also covers the operations described in the other Army and Air Despatches of the
Burma Campaign from 16th November, 1943 to 12th September, 1945.

The following Despatch was submitted to the
Secretary of State for War on the 14th
August, 1945, by GENERAL SIR GEORGE
J. GIFFARD, G.C.B., DS.O., A.D.C., Com-
mander-in-Chief, 11 Army Group, South-
East Asia Command.

Part I.—OPERATIONS.
Introduction.

1. My first Despatch* covered the period
from the formation of 11 Army Group, 16th
November, 1943, to the re-opening of the
Kohima - Imphal road on the 22nd June, 1944,
when at 1245 hours, at Milestone 109, the lead-
ing troops of the 2 British Division (33 Corps)
met the forward troops of 5 Indian Division
(4 Corps), and thus shattered the Japanese
dream of conquering India. This Despatch
describes the operations from the 23rd June,
1944, to the 12th November, 1944, when I
handdd over command of 11 Army Group to
Lieuti-General Sir Oliver Leese.

2. The re-establishment of our communica-
‘tions with Imphal opened a new phase in the
campaign. The Japanese invasion of India had
been stopped ; it remained to throw the enemy
back whence he had come. In the words of
the Prime Minister, the defence of the Imphal
Plain and our subsequent successful offensive
“constituted the greatest collision which had
yet taken place on land with Japan and has
resulted in the slaughter of between 50,000 and
60,000 Japanese. The climax was the final
eviction of the Japanese from India with the
‘almost total loss of five of his best divisions.”
My earlier Despatch dealt with “The defence

of the Imphal Plain”; this Despatch deals
with “Our subsequent successful offensive”
which drove the enemy back, not merely across
the Indo-Burmese frontier, but across the
Chindwin River, and opened the way for the
re-conquest of Central Burma.

3. In the operations I am about to describe,
the Japanese retreat began as a well-planned
and orderly withdrawal. Gradually, as our
pressure grew, the pace of the withdrawal in-
creased until the enemy forces were split up
into small, disorganised parties. Hungry,
harassed, beaten; abandoning their wounded,
their guns and their transport, and even desert-
ing in small, but increasing numbers; the
Japanese were -driven in defeat over the
border, down the far side of the mountain
wall, and back over the Chindwin, which they
had crossed in triumph and with such high
hopes less than five months earlier.

Topography and Climate

4. The formidable nature of the terrain was
one of the features of this campaign. Battles
were fought at 5,000 feet and over, often in
almost impenetrable jungle ; and troops, loaded
with full equipment, struggled up from nullahs
2,000 feet below in the face of heavy small
arms, grenade and mortar fire. Yet, hazar-
dous and difficult as the nature of the country
made every movement or operation, tanks often
proved the decisive factor in the fighting up
and down these mountain ranges, where they
climbed almost precipitous slopes to blast
Japanese bunkers at a range of ten yards.

5. As if still further to test the magnificent
fighting spirit of the troops, another enemy was
advancing steadily upon us: the torrential
monsoon rain that turned tracks into leech-
