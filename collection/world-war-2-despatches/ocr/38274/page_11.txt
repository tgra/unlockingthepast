SUPPLEMENT 1o tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 29° APRIL, 1948

the coast of Burma or near the Andaman and
Nicobar Islands were also attacked with suc-
cess.

As a result of continued reconnaissance and
attacks on shipping, enemy tse of the port of
Rangoon practically ceased during the period.

During the whole penod U.S.A.A.F. ‘bom-
bers shot down twenty-four enemy aircraft,
probably destroyed eighteen and damaged
thirty-one.

16, Tactical Bombing.

The 4th Corps was effectively supported ‘by
attacks on the Japanese bases at Kalewa,
Kalemyo and on other similar targets. In
August light bombers co-operated with land
forces in raiding operations, thereby obtaming
useful experience of co-operation in jungle
country. In this it was found that our existing
ground to air radio telephony contro] arrange-
ments were inadequate, and methods such as
the use or smoke mortar bombs to indicate
enemy targets close to our own troops and
positions were developed.

By the middle of September, Vengeances
almost entirely replaced Blenhemms for day
tactical bombing, and the pilots of these
machines rapidly became skilled in the identi-
fication and bombing of small camouflaged
targets.

17. Fighters and Fighter Bombers employed
offensively,

Aircraft were deployed to support both the
4th Corps front from Assam to the Southern
Chin Hulls, and the 15th Corps front in the
Arakan. Weather conditions, however, re-
stricted land activity; and fighters were con-
fined to answering calls for support from our
land patrols, and to attacking enemy forward
positions and their lines of communication
immediately in rear,

On the 15th Corps front our offensive air
operations made the enemy progressively more
cautious in the siting of his monsoon quarters
Our attacks also considerably reduced his free-
dom of movement, and often he was only able
to move by night or in bad weather,

The enemy reacted strongly to our attacks
by placing light anti-aircraft defences at or near
all likely targets, and thereafter this type of
attack proved more expensive for our own air-
craft. The damage inflicted upon the enemy,
however, fully justified such losses as we
incurred. a

18 Maintenance of Air Superiority.

We were ready for the enemy when towards
the end of the period he resumed operations in
the air. The results, however, of our efforts
to intercept his raids were disappointing be-
cause of advantages the enemy aircraft had over
the Hurncanes which formed the bulk of our
defensive force. Whenever contact was made,
however, attacks were carried out with vigour,
and losses as high as,could ‘be expected were
inflicted by the Hurricanes. ,However, as
already mentioned, the first appearance of our
Spitfires altered this.

During the whole period our air superiority
was definitely unchallenged, and with the ex-
pansion and re-equipment that has been carried
out it should remain so. . .

19. Fighter Reconnatssance.

Hurricanes accomplished a particularly
satisfactory task in their reconnalssances in
support of the 4th and r5th Corps. Their
assignments included photographic , recon-
naissance of the enemy’s forward positions,
tactical reconnaissance in tracing enemy move-
ments in the immediate rear of their forward
positions, and continual survey of the rearward
lines of communication, Bengal Command
was also responsible for seaward reconnaissance
to a depth of twenty-five miles from the coast
along the whole Sunderbans and Arakan coast-
line, from Calcutta to Pagoda Point. This
work, done as it was in the worst part of the
monsoon weather, was of great merit.

20. Air Supply.

Isolated radar and Observer Corps posts cut
ofi by the monsoon rains were supplied by air.
Also the almost daily service to and from the
forward areas transported essential spare parts,
the lack of which was keeping operational air-
craft on the ground. bd

The main tasks however, of the squadron en-
gaged on this work were for the Army. It
followed up its successful work in supplying
the Long Range Penetration Brigade in its raid
during the spring of 1943 ‘by supply dropping
in inaccessible country where, without its aid,
land detachments could not have been main-
tained. It carried out 1,100 sorties, and almost
1,200 tons of supplies were dropped.

ax. Air Openations for the Defence of India’s
Coastline and Ceylon.

Two+ groups comprising twelve squadrons
were allocated to this duty. Operational con-
trol of all general reconnaissance in this sphere
was vested in the headquarters of one of these
groups under the strategical direction of the
Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, modified
from time to time by mutual agreement, with
the Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Fleet

Control of operations in the Arabian Sea was
also strengthened, and a Naval Air Operations
Room- established at Bombay.

The threat of seaborne attack against India
and Ceylon receded, and we should get at least
two or three months warning of any such enter-
prise. We relied therefore on our existing
strength im coastal areas for immediate air
defence, while taking all necessary measures for
expansion and reinforcement that did not
actually involve the holding of aircraft, ¢.g.,
organisation of fighter control, installation of
communications, etc.

22. General and Photographic Reconnaissances.

The strengthemng of our island bases at
Addu Atoll and Diego Garcia and the retention
of Cocos Island, extended the range of our
general reconnaissances.

Considerable development of photographic
reconnaissances also took place. Strategical
photographic reconnaissances of enemy occu-
pied territory in Burma, China, Assam and
the Andamans were carried out. jo;

The main task, however, was greatly in-
creased intelligence cover of Sumatra, Malaya,
the Andamans and Nicdbar  Islands.*
Mosquitos were only able to cover the Northern
Andamans, and it was therefore necessary to
use Liberators also, based in Ceylon and on
the East coast of India.
