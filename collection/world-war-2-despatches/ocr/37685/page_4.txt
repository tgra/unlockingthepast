to release troops who had come from Palestine
and Transjordan,

ar. On 18th June Lt.-General Quinan
assumed command of all Jand forces in Iraq
which were ‘still under General Headquarters,
Middle East.

Advance into Syria

22. It was decided that assistance in the
Syrian Campaign should take precedence over
all other tasks in Iraq, and that this assistance
should consist of :—

uy) Protection of the railway from Iraq to
Turkey where it ran through Syrian Terri-
to:

e) The advance into Syria from Iraq of
two Indian Infantry Brigade Groups. _
Arrangements were put in hand for Haditha

to be stocked with 15 days supplies and petrol

for two infantry ibrigade groups (lorry-borne),
one armoured car regiment, and one squadron

Royal Air Force.

rders were issued for the 21st Indian Infan-
try Brigade Group at Baghdad, the 25th

Indian Infantry Brigade Group and the 13th

Lancers at Basra to advance up the Euphrates

Valley and the 21st Brigade (Brigadier C. J.

Weld) to protect the Line of Communications

Haditha-Deir-ez-Zor.

The operation forward of Haditha was to be
controlled by the General Officer Commanding
Palestine and Transjordan, and to facilitate this
the roth Indian Division was ordered to provide
an Advanced Headquarters.

The governing factor was the provision of
motor transport for tro ing and for
maintenance. Only one and a half General
Purpose Transport Companies were available
and these were employed together with the
and Line Transport of all infantry brigades
except the 24th Indian Infantry Brigade at

sta.

Three more General Purpose Transport Com-
panies were due to sail from India on 25th
June. Neither Headquarters Palestine and
Transjordan nor the Royal Air Force in Iraq
could assist with motor transport, strenuous
effort was therefore made to hire the necessary
civilian transport to make up the serious
deficiency until the arrival of the three com-
panies from India. It was now necessary to
get troops into Deir-ez-Zor as soon as practic-
able, and orders to this effect were given to
Lt.-General Quinan.

23. The situation at the time was that the
2ist Indian Infantry Brigade, less two
battalions, had arrived in Baghdad via the
Tigris route on 1gth June. Of the other twa
battalions of that Brigade one was in Mosul,
and the other en route Basra-Baghdad. Orders
had been issued on 2oth June for the move
by road of 25th Indian Infantry Brigade to-
gether with the 13th Lancers from Basra to
Baghdad, using all available motor transport.

Every effort was therefore made to accelerate
the concentration of one brigade group of the
toth Indian Division at Haditha. A battalion
of the 20th Brigade was sent forward to Mosul
iby road and rail to relieve the other battalion
of 21st Brigade, which was to proceed to
Haditha.

In order to facilitate stocking at Haditha and
to achieve surprise it was essential to keep
back the 21st Indian Infantry Brigade Group
in the Baghdad-Habbaniya area,

- advance began.

SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 14 AUGUST, 1946

24. On 22nd June, one Infantry Battalion,
less one company, and one Squadron 13th
Lancers moved to Haditha with orders to cap-
ture Abu Kemal, known to be occupied by
some French troops and rebel Iraqis. The
transport situation made a move forward from
Abu Kemal before 29th June impossible.

aist Indian Infantry Brigade was concen-
trated at Abu Kemal by 30th June, including
and Battalion 4th Gurkha Rifles from Mosul
and the 13th Lancers. The advance from Abu
Kemal began on ist July with 21st Brigade
Group leading.

Advanced Headquarters roth Indian Divi-
sion arrived at Abu Kemal on the evening of
30th June and operational command of the
column passed to the General Officer Com-
manding Palestine and Transjordan at 2400 hrs,
3oth June.

25. Meanwhile a small force had been pre-
pared at Mosul for operations in the Bec du
Canard to clear the area Qamichliye—Hassetche
—Ras el Ain of Vichy troops and secure the
use of the railway as far as the Turkish frontier
near Nisibin. The operations were designed
to attack the northern flank of the French
troops in the Jezireh and to establish a threat
towards Aleppo,

Another column, consisting of one infantry
battalion and detachments of other arms,
moving from Mosul arrived at Souar on the
River Khabur, 30 miles North-East of Deir-
ez-Zor, as roth Indian Division approached
the latter town,

The 20th Indian Infantry Brigade, less two
battalions (and Battalion 7th Gurkha Rifles in
the Kirkuk area and 2nd Battalion 8th Gurkha
Rifles with detachments at Baghdad, Rutbah

and on the pipe line) was already in Mosul’

with the 1st Battalion King’s Own Royal
Regiment under command. As it was essential
for security reasons to leave at least one
battalion in the Mosul area and to protect the
pipe line and oil installations, the 17th Indian
Infantry Brigade (Brigadier D. D. Gracey)—
less one battalion—was moved to Mosul from
Basra, leaving the equivalent of one infantry
brigade in the Basra area. The move began
on 25th June and concentration at Mosul was
completed by 6th July.

A column consisting of two companies 1st
Battalion 12th Frontier Force Regiment and
one section 3rd Field Regiment and three Royal
Air Force Armoured cars, under command of
Major P. T. Clarke, 1st Battalion 12th Frontier
Force Regiment, moved forward from Mosul
on the night 2nd/3rd July with orders to
occupy Tell Kotcheck, seize the railway and
rolling stock up to that station and prevent
sabotage of the railway line. Complete sur-
prise was achieved and the French Garrison
of Tell Kotcheck decamped.

On 4th July, the remainder of rst Battalion
zath Frontier Force Regiment reached Tell
Kotcheck and on the night 4th/5th July the
a Tell Aalo together with its
garrison was captured without loss on 5th July.
