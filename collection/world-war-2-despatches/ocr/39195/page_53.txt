SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

eral Giffard, in his Despatch.* I will therefore
only deal with the more forward communica-
tions which immediately affected the campaign.
These were three in number : the Northern line
of Communication, the Southern Line of Com-
munication and the Air Line of Communica-
tion.

304. The Northern L. of C. was made up, at
its fullest and longest development, of three
main sections from the Manipur Road rail-
head. The first was 320 miles of road from the
railhead, via Imphal and Tamu, to Kalewa.
It was in part a mountainous route, and the
stretch from Tamu onwards could at first only
be called a road by courtesy, though subse-
quently brought up to all-weather standard.
The second section was by river from Kalewa
to Myingyan, about 240 miles downstream, in
Inland Water Transport craft. During the dry
weather there was also the fair-weather road
from Kalewa via Pyingaing to Shwebo and
thence on by the Central Burma all-weather
road system, but our engineer resources never
allowed the conversion of this stretch to higher
standard. The third section was by a combina-
tion of railway and road from Myingyan south-
east to Thazi and thence south to Rangoon,
about 430 miles. In addition, a secondary
LW.T. L. of C. ran down: the ‘axis of the Irra-
waddy. Demolitions and bombing had cut the
railway into sections, which were operated to
a limited extent with motor transport bridging
the gaps. The Northern L. of C. is thus seen
to total nearly a thousand miles, using road,
rail, and water transport. The resources to
operate this immense and complicated L. of C.
had either to be brought in by road form the
Manipur Road railhead or be flown in. The
limitations and development of this L. of C.
will be described later.

305. On the Southern L. of C. maintenance
was initially by sea from the main base ports
in India to Chittagong and to small river ports
such as Cox’s Bazaar and Maungdaw. After
the capture of Akyab and ‘Ramree Islands the
bulk of this maintenance was sent direct to
Akyab and Kyaukpyu. The latter were how-
ever capable of only limited development, with
the harbour-craft which we had available.

The Southern L. of C. could, by land and by
coastal craft, only serve the Arakan operations.
There were only two overland routes from the
coast inland to Central Burma, one a rough
track via An, incapable of development as a
road L. of C. without thorough and expensive
construction, for which we had neither the
time nor the resources. The other was the fair-
weather road from Taungup to Prome. The
reasons why this route was never opened up
have been discussed fully in Part J of this
Despatch. It is sufficient here to say that it
could not have been developed to a sufficient
capacity in time to be any use, even if we had
had the engineer resources available. Thus the
only way the Southern L. of C. could feed Cen-
tral Burma and Fourteenth Army was by
air transport, and this is what it did. The
development of this L. of C. will be described

later.

306. At the start of the offensive, the air
supply organization was based on groups of air-
fields near Imphal in the north, Comilla,

Agartala and Chittagong in Eastern Bengal.
With the limited land lines of communication
and no access to Central Burma by sea, air
supply was the only way of getting in sufficient
maintenance for Fourteenth Army’s operations.
That is, when all other means were being
worked to absolute maximum capacity, there
remained a large essential tonnage which could
only be brought in by air. Were this essen-
tial tonnage reduced, I would be forced to cut
down my forces. The total tonnage which
could be lifted by air, however, depended not
only on the number of available transport air-
craft squadrons ‘but on the location of the trans-
port airfields at economic ranges from the
delivery airfields. In the case of the C 46 and
C 47 aircraft which were being used, this was
about 250 miles. It was not long therefore
before the advance of the Army took it beyond
the economic range of the air bases mentioned
above. To move these bases forward on the
Anmy’s L. of C. was impracticable owing to the
undeveloped nature of the country and the
limitations of the L. of C. itself. The air bases
near Imphal were already uneconomical since
everything for them had to be moved by road
from the Manipur Road railhead to Imphal.
The desired result could, however, be achieved
by opening new and improved air supply bases
on the coast, where the material of war could
be delivered by sea. This showed at once the
vital importance to the maintenance of
Fourteenth Army of Akyab and Ramree Islands,
where airfields could ibe constructed, and where
there were ports capable of development, even
if limited. From these bases, aircraft could

ate at economic range to Central Burma
and the Irrawaddy and road {railway axes south
to Rangoon, It was a question of capturing
the areas in time to allow their development
and stocking before the monsoon.

307. There was one other route into Burma,
the road from Ledo, via Myitkyina to join with
the Burma Road to China. This was under
construction under American control (as has
been said already). Northern Combat Area
Command in their operations down this road
axis towards Lashio were almost entirely sup-
plied by American air transport, operating from
the Chabua group of airfields north-west of
Ledo.

» 308. Two factors should be considered when
the Ls. of C. are under examination. First,
land Ls. of C. in an undeveloped country like
Burma and with a determined enemy like the
Japanese are liable to be cut by hostile action.
On the other hand, our complete air and sea
supremacy made transport iby these elements
secure.

Secondly, I must again draw attention to the
factor of the weather, During the monsoon,
say 15th May to 15th November very roughly,
we had to expect all fair-weather routes to be
out of action ; even all-weather roads were sub-
ject to wash-outs and damage. Although flying
was certain to be intermittent and hazardous,
air supply became often the only practicable
means, but it was entirely dependent on all-
weather airfields. Al] administrative planning
had to include provision for the continuance
of adequate maintenance under monsoon condi-
tions. The absolute importance of completing
the construction of all-weather airfields for
supply aircraft before the monsoon was there-
fore obvious.
