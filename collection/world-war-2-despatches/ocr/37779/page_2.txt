second Brigade Group of 78 Division was in
floating reserve. The whole operation was
under command of Major-General Ryder,
United States 34 Infantry Division.

Although nominal opposition was offered in
some quarters the landing was on the whole
unopposed, and by 1600 hours envoys were
received to discuss terms: after that time only
sporadic fighting continued. On gth November
Algiers harbour was opened and the unloading
of ships hegan.

Once this landing had been completed under
American auspices, the réle allotted to First
Army was to establish a base at Algiers and to
occupy Eastern Algeria and Tunisia as speedily
as possible.

So, on gth November, iI left Gibraltar by air,
landed at Maison Blanche airfield with a very
small skeleton staff and took over command,
immediately directing Major-General Evelegh
(Commander Britisli 78 Division) to carry out
the prearranged plan for the capture of Bougie
port and Djjidjelli airfield with 36 Infantry
Brigade Group, assisted by naval forces under
pommand of Captain N. V. Dickinson, D.S.C.,

And, on the final cessation of French opposi-
tion on roth November, it became possible to
redispose the forces available for the advance
east. Orders were therefore given for all
troops of 78 Division and the two Commandos
to revert to command of 78 Division, while all
other British troops were placed temporarily
under command of 34 United States Division,
which was charged with the security of the port
of Algiers and the vital airfields at Maison
Blanche and Blida.

If I was to forestall the Axis in Tunis and

’ Bizerta, speed was quite vital.

Previous to leaving the United Kingdom I
had prepared three alternative plans to meet
the case of:—

@ French resistance on a considerable

scale.
(b) Short-lived resistance followed by non-
co-operation or at least a period of confusion,

or
(c) Active collaboration.

The same governing principles held good in
each case—namely, seizure of coastal airfields
and immediate installation of fighters, as a pre-
liminary to the successive capture of the ports
of Bougie, Philippeville, Bone and La Calle;
together with the most rapid advance of my
land forces by motor transport, landing craft
and troop-carrying aircraft.

I must state here that when in the planning
stage it was decided that no assault landing
should be made East of Algiers, then, in my
opinion, my chance disappeared of reaching
Tunis before the Germans, unless the French
put up a stout resistance to Axis entry into
Tunisia.* In actual fact, the French resisted

* General Anderson refers, in this passage, to
plans which were discussed, but eventually aban-
doned, for landings at Bone and Philippeville in addi-
tion to that at Algiers. The principal arguments
against landing so far to the eastwards were based
upon—

(a) The need to concentrate the relatively small
forces which could be landed; and

{b) The danger of venturing without air cover
into ports which the German bombers could reach.

The reality of the bombing danger was ved
by the shipping losses incurred at Bougie. Further
to the east still heavier losses might have been
expected, with proportionately serious results.

us in Algiers (feeble though their resistance
was, yet its consequent repercussions caused
delay and doubt) and did not resist the Axis
in Tanisia. The first German landings at El
Aouana airport on gth November were not
opposed.

36 Brigade landed unopposed at Bougie
on 11th November and took over the port.
The battalion destined to seize the airfield at
Djidjelli and stock it with petrol was, however,
unable to land by sea owing to the swell and
went on by road from Bougie, not reaching
Djidjelli until 13th November, This delay
unfortunately prevented our fighters operating
from the airfield and, as a result, the enemy
bombers sank several ships in Bougie harbour
before air cover could be provided. Losses in
personnel were not high but in equipment were
considerable, and the infantry were, for some
time to come, operating only with what they
could and in the clothes they wore when
they left their ships.

The distances covered and the feats achieved
by the brigades of 78 Division (in particular 36
Brigade) operating with a very reduced scale of
first and second line transport, and with no
third line, were one of the features of the
early stages of the campaign. Similarly, owing
to convoy limitations, aggravated by losses at
sea, it was not possible to provide adequate
transport for port clearance and other line of
communication duties. This had serious reper-
cussion on maintenance; ships could not be
cleared, congestion occurred on the quays, and
depots could not be kept filled to meet
demands. Furthermore, an immensely long
line of communication was created by the rapid
advance eastwards, with very meagre railway
resources that could not be properly co-
ordinated or developed owing to limitations of
staff, All these factors contributed to a situa-
tion that gave rise to great anxiety for some
time.

The campaign can henceforth be divided
into three main phases: —

(a) A race for Tunis and Bizerta, under-
taken by a small force on assault or light
scales and consequently much understrength
in men and equipment.

We just failed to win this race, after
some bitter fighting in bad weather which
gave us our first experience of Tunisian mud.
This phase ended soon after Christmas, 1942.

(b) The period 28th December, 1942, to
27th March, 1943, during which both sides
were building up their forces and attempting
to hold on to or seize ground important for
the future, while we also struggled incessantly
to improve our immensely long communica-
tions. We were mainly on the defensive,
suffered from an acute shortage of infantry,
and were often very hard pressed in the
mountainous country. I was forced to use
the infantry battalions of 6 Armoured Divi-
sion on ordinary infantry tasks of holding a
sector of the front, away from the armoured
brigade; and this misuse of the armoured
‘divisional infantry continued up to the end
of February, 1943. It is some consolation
to know that the Germans had to do exactly
the same with the infantry of ro Panzer
Division. Our greatest asset was our pre-
ponderance in artillery, and the front
seemed at times largely held by artillery fire
alone. The term “‘ front ’’ is deceptive. We
