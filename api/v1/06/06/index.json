When this programme had been completed, it was envisaged that the opera- tional side of O.K.M. should be disbanded completely and the administrative side reduced to four or five departments."

The landings in Normandy on the 6th June, 1944, took the Germans tactically by surprise and found them still not ready to use the flying bomb. Thereupon LXV Army Korps, apparently on Hitler\u2019s instructions, peremptorily ordered Flakregiment 155 (W) to begin operations on the 12th June. The precise grounds of this decision are never likely to be known. The opportunity to use the long-range weapons to delay the Allied assault had gone, if indeed it had ever existed. But the Germans may still have hoped to gain time by exploiting the harassing effect of the bomb and hamper- ing the flow of reinforcements and supplies. Moreover, it is improbable that we, need look very far for the motive that prompted such a natural reaction to events. At moments of crisis the impulse to retaliate against an England which had upset all Hitler\u2019s plans by perversely refusing its allotted role was never far below the surface. The Germans quickly publicised the flying bomb as \u2018\u2018 revenge weapon No. 1 \u2019\u2019: and their propaganda may well have contained a hint of their real purpose. With the \u2018\u2018 west wall \u2019\u2019 in jeopardy and defeat on the horizon, Hitler may have seen no more than the need to strike back and hope for a miracle."
