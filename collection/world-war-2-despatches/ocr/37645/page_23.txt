SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON

Weather.

The weather throughout these operations had
been bad and was getting worse. The ground
was sodden, movement of M.T. difficult. Nights
were cold and usually wet. Bivouacking on
sodden ground in soaked blankets was a daily
occurrence and the troops suffered much dis-
comfort,

Subsequent Operations.

The next problems were frst to evacuate the
prisoners and to protect them from patriot
attentions during their move to Dessie, and
secondly to reconnoitre towards Gondar and
make contact with the commander of a party of
patriots known to be some miles further-to the
west. ‘One troop, Skinner’s Horse, and a sec-
tion of Sappers and Miners, moved off from
Debra Tabor and by 8th July had reached a
point 42 miles to the west having surmounted

considerable difficulties of bad and blogked -

roads. The whole force was successfully con-
centrated back in Dessie by 14th July, Debra
Tabor being left in charge of officers of 101
Mission and the patriots.

Part V.

Advance against Gondar from Gallabat.
Own troops. ws

On 3rd March 3/12 Frontier Forcé Regiment,
less one company, was withdrawn to 'Gedaref to
join oth ‘Indian Infantry Brigade, before
moving to Keren. One company 3/12 Frontier
Force Regiment and 21 Field Company, Sap-
pers and Miners, was left to continue the pursuit
along the Gallabat-Gondar road. This force
patrolled forward until finally stopped by the
enemy holding the escarpment a few miles west
of Chelga. On 5th April they were joined by
3 Ethiopian Battalion and C Troop Light Artii-
lery Battery, S.D.F. By x5th April, the
company 3/12 Frontier Force Regiment and 21
Field Company, Sappers and Miners, were
withdrawn to rejoin 5th Indian Division and
a force known as Kerforce, comprising 3 Ethio-
pian Battalion and a Composite Battalion made
up of companies from various S.D.F. units,
took over operations on this sector.

Enemy positions.

Opposite the Composite Battalion the enemy
was holding the western edge of the escarpment.
His forward line of defended localities was some
eight to ten miles west of the escarpment, and
was held in strength. The escarpment itself
is between five and ten miles west of Chelga.
A flanking movement was the only possible way
of a ian at Chelga or the communications
behind.

Administration.

"Administrative difficulties were considerable.
The road Metemma-Gondar is only a dry-
weather track, and becomes impassable by
wheels during the rains. It is seriously inter-
rupted some 25 miles east of Gallabat by the
unbridged Gandwa River. Movement by M.T.
off the road in the Chelga area is not practic-
able. The country had been burnt. There was
not sufficient grass for camels, nor could they
have been used in the steep hills in that area.
Mules and horses belonging to the Composite
Battalion were below strength and in poor con-
dition as a result of previous strenuous cam-
paigning. Rain began to fall by 15th April.

GAZETTE, 10 JULY, 1946 ‘3549

Neither time nor resources admitted the con-
struction of an all-weather road. The decision
was made to operate against Chelga for as long
as possible, and if success had not been achieved
to withdraw this force to the Sudan when rain
made its further maintenance impossible. The
Composite Battalion was assisted by various
bands of patriots. On 22nd April an action
took place near Tankal, a village on the edge
of the escarpment, eight miles south of Chelga.
The enemy attempted to drive off our forces,
consisting of one company and some patriots.
They were unsuccessful and Tankal was held.
Enemy casualties were eighty dead.

This thrust against Gondar from the west
contained a force of enemy greater than itself,
and kept it watching in both directions during
the time of the operations against Debra Tabor.

Operations on 18th and 19th May.

‘On 18th May the Composite Battalion worked
its“-way round on to the plateau, establishing
itself on a ridge 1,000 yards north-east of
Chelga Fort. In getting there they captured
five officers and 300 other ranks.

On roth May the enemy, strongly reinforced,
attacked the Composite Battalion inflicting
fairly severe casualties. Rain and the im-
passability of the tracks prevented further
operations north of Chelga, and, on 22nd May
the Composite Battalion returned to Amanit,
on the road west of Chelga. Except for har-
assing tactics and a minor offensive by two
companies to cover the withdrawal, no further
operations took place on this front. By 30th
June the Composite Battalion was concentrating
at Gallabat, with forward posts on the Gandwa.
As a result of this withdrawal, the enemy was
able to move forces from the Chelga area
across to the south-east of Gondar, where they
were established some 36 miles south-east
of Gondar covering the road to Debra Tabor.

Part VI.
Operations against the Wolchefit Pass.

By 12th April No. x M.M.G. Group, S.D.F.,
pursuing the enemy retreating towards Gondar,
crossed the Tacazze River with little opposition.
By 13th April it had reached the Wolchefit Pass,
but, in attempting to patrol wp it, two vehicles
were ambushed and destroyed.

Topography—The Wolchefit Pass.

The Wolchefit Pass is not in the true sense of
the word a Pass. It is an ascent from a lower
level on to a plateau 4,000 feet higher. The
road from Debivar zigzags up the face of
Green Hill. Before it reaches the top of Green
Hill it turns sharply, being carved out of the
sheer cliff face along the ‘western side. To
construct this portion of the road, the Italians
had been forced to suspend men by ropes over
the top of the cliff. The top of Green Hill
itself is a ledge still a considerable distance
below the level of the plateau proper. The
toad from half way up Green Hill is covered
by machine-gun and mortar fire. The original
garrison on the top of the Wolchefit was esti-
mated as 3,000 white and 2,000 native
troops, with thirty guns, machine-guns and
mortars. There were also reported to be a few
light tanks but these have never been confirmed.
The natural strength of the Wolchefit is twice
that of Amba Alagi and five times that of Keren.
Exhaustive reconnaissances have proved that
there is no feature in the area of Debivar from
