            "description": "In order to develop their full strength for the decisive blow First Army had to be more con- centrated and reinforced. For the former purpose I had already decided to relieve 46 and 4 Divisions on its northernmost flank with two divisions from II Corps. On 3rd April I ordered General Patton to be prepared to despatch his 9 Infantry Division to take over from 46 Division as soon as Eighth Army had broken through the Wadi Akarit line and to follow as rapidly as possible with the rest of II Corps. 9g Division, after regrouping and re- fitting, assumed command of the northernmost sector on 14th April and on 1gth April 1 United States Infantry Division began to relieve 4 Division; on the same day II Corps assumed command of the area north of the Oued et Tine. I intended that simultaneously with First Army\u2019s offensive and Eighth Army\u2019s holding attack II Corps should also develop operations down the Sedjenane road and the B\u00e9ja-Mateur road to contain the enemy there and, if possible, to accelerate the capture of Bizerta. I must mention here that the way in which four United States divisions were transferred from one end of the lne to the other, crossing at nght angles the lines of com- munication of First Army, was a considerable triumph of staff work. Reinforcements for First Army could only come from Eighth Army. On rrth April I informed General Montgomery that the main effort in the final phase of opera- tions would be by General Anderson and ordered him to make available to join 9 Corps as soon as possible an armoured division and an armoured car regiment. 1 Armoured Divi- sion and the King\u2019s Dragoon Guards were nominated, being well placed on the Faid- Sbeitla road for such a transfer."

            "description": "43. Meanwhile the Army had stubbornly held the Mount Olympus-Aliakmon Line until 14th April when it was turned by the Germans forcing the Kleisoura Pass. Our forces started to fall back on the Thermopylae Position on x5th April, completing the withdrawal by the 2oth April. This new situation necessitated the withdrawal of all R.A.F. Squadrons to the Athens Area on r6th April and from that date onwards they were controlled directly by H.Q., B.A.F., Greece. Eastern and Western Wings were consequently disbanded."
