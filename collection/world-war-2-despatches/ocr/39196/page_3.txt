advances made exceeded all planned expecta-
tions. This can be attributed to the following
main causes :—

i) The magnitude of the Japanese defeat
z Imphal, which was not realised until much
ater.

Gi) The virtual elimination of enemy air
opposition resulting in complete pre-
dominance and liberty of action of our
offensive and air transport forces.

ii) The steady growth of air supply re-
sources and improvements in their organisa-
tion.

(iv) The occupation of Akyab and
Ramree, which had been decided upon to
provide advanced air supply bases. This
enabled us to reorient and shorten the supply
lines in relation to the advance southward
of Fourteenth Army.

4. By February, 1945, the possibilities of
a more ambitious plan were becoming evident,
and Fourteenth Army and 221 Group sub-
mitted a plan for vigorous exploitation of the
favourable set of circumstances then obtaining.
G.O.C. Fourteenth Army considered that if the
enemy elected to stand and fight around
Mandalay, there was every hope of destroying
the Japanese Army in the open plains of
Central Burma, thereby opening the route for
a swift advance upon Rangoon by highly
mobile columns. The plan aimed at encircle-
ment of the enemy forces on the Mandalay
Plain to be completed by air attack on such
lines of communication as remained open to
him. In conjunction with a direct thrust by
33 Corps towards Mandalay, 4 Corps were to
carry out a wide encircling movement directed
towards Meiktila which would cut the main
line of communication southwards. Méeiktila
itself was to be secured by a small air trans-
ported force who would consolidate our
position athwart this vital route.

15. This bold plan was highly successful,
and as a result the Japanese Army in Burma
suffered heavy casualties in a costly and bloody
killing match to which the Air Forces contri-
buted in large measure. Notwithstanding its
success, the battle of extermination took longer
than had been contemplated, and the time-table
for the dash to Rangoon by 4 Corps was in
jeopardy. The prospect of a race against a
reduced time limit caused considerable anxiety
in the mind of C.-in-C. Allied Land Forces,
South East Asia (ALFS.E.A.). In_ his
opinion the overland advance by highly
mobile forces might not have the necessary
impetus to overcome opposition en route, to-
gether with the final opposition estimated from
the defenders of Rangoon, reinforced by the
remnants of field formations extricated from
Central Burma. (Upon his urgent recom-
mendations, the capture of Rangoon before the
monsoon was made more certain by the mount-
ing of a modified “ Dracula” by sea and air.

16. To carry out this operation, it would be
necessary to utilise forces which were ear-
marked to seize concurrently with the capture
of Rangoon a springboard on the Malay Penin-
sula. In the event, this modified “ Dracula”
proved to have been unnecessary, as the
following pages will show. Nevertheless the
capture of Rangoon entailed such a large
expenditure of effort and resources that plan-
ning has had to be conducted since then on

the premise that large-scale refitting, re-
deployment and marshalling of forces is neces-
sary before the next step is undertaken. The
occupation of Rangoon therefore constitutes a
milestone in the history of South East Asia,.
marking the end of a well-defined period.

Part Two.

THE OPERATIONAL BACKGROUND,
JUNE, 1944—MAY, 1945.

17. When, on 22nd June, 1944, an overland
junction was effected on the Imphal-Kohima
toad between the garrison of the Imphal plain
and the relieving ground forces which had.
advanced from the north, a major crisis had
been resolved, and our land forces, despite the:
monsoon, were able gradually to turn more and
more both tactically and strategically to the
offensive.

18. The Fourteenth Army, with its head--
quarters beside those of the Third Tactical.
Air Force at Comilla, controlled the Allied
units on the southern two-thirds of the front.
On its coastal section, 15 Corps held the port
of Maungdaw and a monsoon line along the
Maungdaw-Buthidaung road; its left flank
was thinly covered by the Lushai Brigade whick
operated in guerilla fashion over the desolate:
hill country as far north as Haka and the valley’
of the Manipur River. In the Imphal Valley,
although 4 Corps had linked up with 33 Corps:
advancing from Assam, the Japanese were still
holding tenaciously to their positions among
the hills east of Palel overlooking the plain;
further to the north-east, however, the position
was more favourable, and elements of 33 Corps
were pressing forward towards Ukhrul.

19, Beyond the operational area of the Four-
teenth Army, Special Force, which had beer
boldly launched into the heart of enemy held:
territory in March, was fighting both the
weather and the enemy in the general area of
the railway corridor east and south-east of Lake
Indawgyi. It was controlled by the Northern
Combat Area Command under General Stilwell,
and had effected a junction with the Chinese
and Amer‘can forces now investing the
Japanese garrison of Myitkyina, where the
main airfield had passed into their hands.
Further still to the north-east, a Chinese army
based on Yunnan was fighting in the upper
Salween valley.

20. The front remained static, dur‘ng the
period of the monsoon, only in the coastal area.
On the Imphal sector, 33 Corps—which took
over from 4 Corps when the latter was with-
drawn from the line for four months—remained
on the offensive. In the course of July the
enemy was finally driven by combined air and
ground bombardment from his tenac‘ously held
positions, on the perimeter of the Imphal plain,
and with the capture of Tamu in early August
the Allied forces had re-established a foothold:
in the Kabaw Valley and were ready to push
southwards towards Yazagyo and Kalemyo and
eastwards to the Chindwin.

21. On the right flank, a series of Japanese
delaying positions on what was euphemistically
called the Tiddim Road, was overcome during
