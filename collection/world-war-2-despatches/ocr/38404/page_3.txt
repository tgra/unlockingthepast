SUPPLEMENT to tHz LONDON GAZETTE, 16 SEPTEMBER, 1948

(b) Operations, November and December,
1940.

1g. During the first two weeks in November,
London had continued to be the enemy’s main
target, and was visited by at least Too German
bombers nearly every night. Then, in the
middle of the month, came a change. On the
night -of 14th November, by the light of the
full moon, nearly 500 German aircraft delivered
an attack on Coventry which lasted from about
eight o’clock in the evening until half-past five
the following morning. The attack began with
the dropping of large numbers of incendiary
bombs by a Unit called K.Gr.r00, which was
known to speciahze in this form of target mark-
ing. More incendiaries, hundreds of high ex-
plosive bombs and a number of parachute-
mines followed. The raid wrought great havoc
in the centre of the city, severely damaged 21
important factories, wrecked gas and water-
mains and cables, blocked the railways, and
put four or five hundred retail shops out of
action. Three hundred and eighty people were
killed and 800 seriously injured. The Civil
Defence Services did excellent work, and,
though shaken, the citizens of Coventry re-
mained undaunted.

20. The defences were not unprepared for
this move. The A.A. guns put up a tremen-
dous volume of fire, and 123 fighter sorties
were flown, day squadrons as well as night
squadrons taking part. A few enemy aircraft
were seen and some of them were engaged, but
none of these combats was conclusive. The
A.A. gunners claimed the destruction of two
bombers.

az. Another such raid on Coventry soon
afterwards might have created a serious situa-
tion. Fortunately the Germans did not con-
sider a second raid necessary, and on the next
night London was once again their main objec-
tive. But, for the rest of the month and
throughout December, provincial towns and
cities, including Southampton, — Bristol,
Plymouth, Birmingham, Sheffield, Liverpool
and Manchester, competed with London for
their attention. Clearly they had passed to
a new stage in their programme and were now
seeking to dislocate our means of production
and supply.

22. Although this phase of the offensive did
not come as a surprise, the ability of the Ger-
mans to reach and find their targets in wintry
conditions was disturbing. With the help of
radio beacons, directional beam systems, and
blind-landing devices, the bombers were able
to operate effectively in weather which seriously
hampered and sometimes precluded fighter
operations. As yet the new methods of inter-
ception which depended on radar were not
perfected, and the less elaborate methods
which we had hoped would tide us over this
intervening period were largely defeated by this
factor: of bad weather. Inasmuch, however,
as the enemy bomber crews were mainly reliant
upon radio beams and beacons for navigation
and bomb aiming in conditions of bad visi-
bility, they were correspondingly vulnerable to
radio counter-measures against those aids.
There had grown up since the beginning of the
war an extensive organisation which had de-
veloped a most effective technique for inter-
fering so subtly with radio beams and beacons
as to leave the enemy almost unaware of the
fact that his own aids were leading him astray.

This organisation had been consolidated shortly
before I assumed command, in the form of
No. 80 Wing, whose invaluable services were
almost entirely at my disposal. Operating in
association with other forms of decoy, No. 80
Wing was responsible for deflection of a great
number of enemy bombers from their targets,
while the information it gathered as to the
orientation of enemy radio beams from time.
to time proved a valuable guide to the air
defences as to the enemy’s intentions. Indeed,
until our might fighters were to become a
weapon of any significance against the enemy
bombers in March of the following year, radio
counter-measures were to contribute as much
as any other defensive arm towards reduction
of the impact of the enemy bomber offensive.

23. On the night of roth November, a pilot
and crew of No. 604 Squadron, using their
A.I. in- conjunction with searchlight indica-
tions and instructions from their Sector Con-
troller, had succeeded in engaging a large air-
craft over Oxfordshire. The crew of a Ju88
which crashed later in Norfolk reported that
they had been attacked by a fighter on their
way from the South Coast to Birmingham; and
it seems probable that this was the aircraft
engaged over Oxfordshire. If so, this was
the first enemy’ aircraft whose destruction was
attributable to a fighter carrying A.I. and be-
longing to a first-line squadron, although as,
long ago as July a success in active operations
had been claimed by the Fighter Interception
Unit.

24. Up to the end of the year fighters claimed
the destruction of only three more night
bombers, and none of these ‘successes was
atiributable to A.I.

25. Many novel and unusual means of deal-
ing with the night bomber were suggested about
this time and subsequently. The more prac-
ticable of these included the release ofa free
balloon barrage, other forms of aerial mining,
and the use of searchlights carried by aircraft.
These are dealt with below under the appro-
priate headings.

26. On a number of occasions 1 arranged for
fighters carrying equipment which responded to
the ‘‘ beam ’’ transmissions which the Germans
used to find their targets to be sent to ‘‘ hunt in
the beam,’’ but the German crews seem to have
anticipated this move and were wary. Fighters
sent to patrol the points at which the bombers
were ‘expected to cross the French coast on
their homeward journey, burming their naviga-
tion lights, were no more successful.

27. On the night of 1xth December, I tried
out for the second time, a measure which had
previously been given an inconclusive trial over
Bristol. Twenty Hampden bombers were sent
to patrol at various specified heights over
Birmingham during a concentrated attack on
that city. The crews reported seeing a large
number of enemy aircraft, but the Hampdens
were too unwieldy to bring any of them to
action. This experience proved, however, that
in suitable circumstances interception by purely
visual means was possible.

28. Meanwhile we were taking every pos-
sible step to improve the chances of intercep-
tion by more orthodox means. Up to this time
such G.L. sets as were available to assist the
fighters had been grouped close together in the
Kenley Sector. In consultation with General
