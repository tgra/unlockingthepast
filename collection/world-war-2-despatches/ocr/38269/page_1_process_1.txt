Narrative

8. The Japanese had developed a strong defensive position guarding the beaches near Thames Point.  Their main body was established near Ramree Town. A landing a: ,Kyaukpyu was unexpected and tactical surprise was achieved.

9g As soon as our bridgehead was consolidated, the 71st Indian Infantry Brigade was ordered to advance rapidly southward down the west coast road, leaving the 4th Indian Infantry Brigade in defence of the Kyaukpyu Area.

ro. The advance of the 71st Indian Infaniry Bngade was supported by destroyers and sloops.

11. It was expected that the Japanese wouid fight a strong delaying action near Mount Peter and Black Hill, 1o enable their remforcements

- to reach the Leiktaung area where a narrow

defile, through which our troops must pass, offered a natural defensive position.

xz, As events transpired, determined -esistance in the Mount Peter Black Hill area was

 not as protracted as expected and after some

brisk fighting our troops drove the enemy off and passed quickly through the Leiktaung Gap and reached the Yan Bauk Chaung* on 26th January, where they were brought to a halt by a strong Japanese force entrenched on the south bank of the Chaung.

13. In the meantime Force WELLINGTON consisting of Royal Marines from the East Indies Fleet, with naval support under command of Rear-Admiral A. D. Read, Flag Officer Force 65, had occupied Cheduba Island on the 26th January (Operation  Sankey  ) without meeting any opposition.

14. On 30th January, Force WELLINGTON was reheved by the 2 AJMER Battahon Group from the 4th Indian Infantry Brigade (Force CACTUS). On the same day, the 8/x3th Frontier Force Rifles Battalion Group of the 36th Indian Infantry Brigade (Force MARTIN), occupied Sagu Kyun (Operation  Pendant  ) also without opposition, under cover of naval and air bombardment. The task of this Force was to establish a Naval Landing Craft Base as a springboard for  combined landings on South Ramree Island.

15. On 1st February a company of the 8/13th Frontier Force Rifles from Force MARTIN landed without casualties on the south tip of Ramree Island, under cover of naval and air bombardment. The task of this company was to guard the entrance to the Kaleingdaung River.

16. It was the original intention of the Commander 15th Indian Corps, Lieutenant-General Sir A. F. Philip Christison, Bart, K.B.E, C.B,DS.0O., M.C., to capture only as much of Ramree Island as was necessary for the development of airfields to supply the 14th Army during the monsoon, and to launch at an early date a major operation against the mainland in the Taungup area mounted from Kyaukpyu.

17. On the 4th February, however, a directive was received from the Joint Force Commanders to the effect that the maintenance difficulties precluded the major operation against the mainland.and the following operations were to be undertaken in lieu:  

(a) The whole of Ramree Island to be captured.

(6) Raids and such mmor landings as could be supported administratively to be carried out on the. mainland between Taungup and An Chaung with a view to facilitating the eventual capture of Taungup itself.
