OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST FROM 7tH FEBRUARY, I941
To 15TH JULY, 1941

The following Despatch was submitted to the

Secretary of State for War on 5th
September, 1941, by GENERAL SIR
ARCHIBALD P. WAVELL, G.C.B.,
C.M.G., M.C., Commander-in-Chief, in the
Middle East.

OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
7th FEBRUARY, 1941, TO 15th JULY, 1941.
Situation after Capture of Benghazi.

1. While the operations in the Western Desert
and Cyrenaica, described in mydespatch cover-
ing the period 7th December, 1940, to 7th Feb-
ruary, I94I, were taking place, a campaign
which was to prove of almost equal importance
to the fortunes of the British Forces in the
Middle East was being fought in Greece and
Albania.

The unprovoked and treacherous attack of the
Italians on Greece which had begun at the end
‘of October, 1940, had been repulsed by a swift
Greek counter-stroke, and the Italians had been

driven back into Albania. During the winter.

of 1940/41 the Greeks, in spite of appalling
conditions of weather and in most difficult
country, gradually forced the Italians back in
Albania and had hopes of driving them out of
Albania altogether. A small British air force
‘with certain army units for its protection and
‘service, had been in Greece since November.
2. At first the senior partner of the Axis had
‘seemed to be disinterested in the Italian mis-
fortunes in Albania as well as in Libya, but
early in 1941 German troops were fully estab-
lished in occupation of Rumania and it became
clear that a further movement south-east was
impending. The attitude of Bulgaria, obviously
to be the next victim of German aggression, did
not long remain doubtful, and it soon became
fairly certain that her rulers did not intend to
resist a German advance through Bulgaria,
which might be directed either at Turkey or at
Greece, our only two remaining allies in Europe
-who were likely to resist German aggression.
3. In the middle of January, while operations
against Tobruk were still in progress, I had been

ordered by the ‘War Cabinet to visit Greece and
to make an offer to the Greeks of armoured
troops, field artillery, anti-tank artillery and
anti-aircraft guns to assist their forces in the
defence of Salonika and Macedonia against
possible German aggression. I was in Athens
from 13th to 17th January and had a series of
conferences with the Greek Premier, General
Metaxas, and the Greek Commander-in-Chief,
General Papagos. As a result, the offer of the
British Government was declined, mainly on the
grounds that the landing of further British
forces in Greece was likely to provoke German
aggression without being strong enough to
check it. Had this offer been accepted, it is
improbable that it would have been possible to
continue the operations in Cyrenaica beyond
Tobruk. After the refusal of assistance by the
Greeks, an offer was made by the Prime Minis-
ter of assistance, especially by air forces, to
Turkey, which was also declined on similar
grounds,

4. Immediately after the fall of Benghazi on
7th February, I received a telegram from the
Chiefs of Staff setting out a new policy for the
forces in the Middle East. General Metaxas
had died towards the end of January and the
new ‘Greek Government had sent a request on
8th February for information as to what help
we could afford them in the event of a German
attack. The War Cabinet accordingly directed
that no operations were to be undertaken
beyond the frontier of Cyrenaica, which should
be held with the minimum possible force neces-
sary to secure the flank of our Egyptian base,
and that it was essential to be able to send the
largest possible army and air forces from the
Middle East to assist the Greeks against a Ger-
man attack through Bulgaria, At the same time
the operations against the Italian Dodecanese,
which were in preparation, were to be pressed
on and «undertaken at the earliest possible
moment.

5. The Chiefs of Staff’s telegram stated that
the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Eden, and the Chief
of the Imperial General Staff, Genera] Sir John
