SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 FEBRUARY, 1948

-sighted, and the cool and calculated way in
which he carried out his. attack and then en-
sured the safety of his crew.

Lieutenant Place, undaunted by encounter-
ing unexpected obstacles, carried on with cool
determination to worm X.7 under the nets
under the very eyes of those on board
TIRPITZ to carry out his successful attack.
Then, when again caught in the nets and with
the time drawing close for the explosion to take
place, rather than bring his craft to the surface
and so compromise the operation and thereby
jeopardise the chances of other craft who
“might be attacking, he proceeded coolly to
extricate his craft and remained submerged
after the explosion, although fully aware of
the danger, for sufficient time to ensure that
other craft who might be attacking were clear
of the area.

The acts of these two officers speak for them-
selves, They can seldom have been surpassed
in the history of the Royal Navy. The pro-
ceedings of the two Commanding Officers
would have been of no avail had they not been
supported by, the undaunted spir#t of their
crews.

24. It is very much regretted that. insufficient

evidence is available to assess the part played
by Lieutenant Henty-Creer and the crew of
“X.5, but, from the position in which their
craft was found, it is clear that they, too,
showed courage of the highest order in pene-
trating the fleet anchorage, and that they lived
up to the highest traditions of the Service.

Finat Report oN OPERATION “‘ SouRCE ”’.

Be pleased to lay before Their Lordships the
following final-report on operations by X-craft
against the German main units (Operation
“Source ’’),

. 2. The return from Germany of the Com-
,manding Officers of X.6 (Lieutenant D.
Cameron, V.C., RN.R.) and X.7 (Lieutenant
,B. C. G. Place, V.C., D.S.C., R.N.), and the
receipt of their patrol reports, together with the
release of certain information from captured
-German documents (notably the deck log of
TIRPITZ and portions of the German High
Command War Diary), have brought to light
; new facts which, as is to be expected, are in
_some cases different from those that had been
inferred in my predecessor’s submission of 2nd
February, 1944.

The opinions expressed by my predecessor in
, paragraphs 23 and 24 of that report, however,
remain with added force. i

damage inflicted on TIRPITZ by X.6 and-X.7
may yet become available from German official

report in continuation of my predecessor’s sub-
mission of 2nd February, 1944.

4. The following is the sequence of events
from the time of slipping the X-craft from
their parent submarines to the conclusion of
the attack. No reference has been made to
X.10, as her movements were fully covered in
my predecessor's report of 8th November, 1943,
and have no bearing on the approach and
attack of the other three X-craft.

20th September, 1943 (All times are G M.T.)

All three X-craft slipped from their towing
submarines between 1845 and 2000, all being in
good lieart and trim. X.6’s starboard charge
had flooded since 11th September, but experi-
ments with stores and spare gear “had put the
ship into a working trim, provided that the
inland waters of the fiords were sufficiently
saline. -

The minefields reported off Soroy were
negotiated on the surface successfully, although
X.6 sighted a patrol vessel at 2200.

At 2315 X.7 sighted another X-craft and ex-
changed shouts of good luck and good hunting.
Although not definitely identified, the other
X-craft was certainly X.5. X.5 now, unfortu-
nately, passes out of the picture until her sight-
ing and destruction on 22nd September.

ast September

X.6 and X.7 both dived between 0145 and
0215, each finding trimming difficult.

During the passage through Stjernsund, X.7
had to dodge several vessels and X 6 started a
defect on her periscope which was to prove a
major handicap throughout, but a triumph of
mind over matter to her crew.

The advance through the fiords toward the
agreed waiting and charging positions in Alten
Fiord went according to plan, neither X-craft _
experiencing any difficulty in the calm weather
prevailing, and at 1245 X.7, taking advantage
of a freshening breeze, was able to ventilate the
boat through the induction trunk.

An occasional A/S patrol vessel, and a soli-
tary aircraft had to be dodged, but at 1630
X.7 sighted a large vessel in the lee of Aaroy
Island, This vessel is noted in X 7’s report as
“believed to be SCHARNHORST ” and was
thereafter disregarded. All thoughts were
centred on TIRPITZ, which, under Plan No. 4,
was the target for X.5, X.6 and X.7.

X.6 was first into her waiting billet, arriving
at 1845 x mile north of Brattholm where she
spent a rather disturbed night, charging,
making good defects (particularly to her peri-
scope) and dodging traffic. This traffic became
so trying that the Commanding Officer surfacea
to continue his charge at 2145, endeavouring
to make contact with other X-craft during the
night. F

On inspecting the clock settings of his fuzes
at 2300, it was discovered that the port (un-
flooded charge) clock was defective. To guard
against any hold up, both ro point plugs were
released and the charges set to fire at one hour
from release.

X.7 had also reached her waiting position and
spent the night charging and making good
