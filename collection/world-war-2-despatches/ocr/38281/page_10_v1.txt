(b) The Eastern group of cruisers,  had closed to about 8 miles from the  battlefleet at 1240 and thereafter probably  followed astern of them. When attacked by the second T/B Striking Force at 1520 they were onan Easterly course, South of Sardinia and at that

_ time were screened by 4 destroyers. After the attack it seemed probable that one  cruiser becamie detached and may have proceeded to



- Cagliari. .One ship  of this group had -been + cheavily hit -aft by 6-inch fire. (c) When the action ceased the Western -Broup were.a considerable distance to the North  and: West of their own battlefleet and the .Eastern group, due to the  dir ction -of their retirement. It is probable that they . then, turned  towards Cagliari and rejoined their battlefleet, but their movements are'very .  uncertain.
