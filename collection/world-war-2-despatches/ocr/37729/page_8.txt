34. Owing to enemy fighter activity Blen-
heims taking part in these operations were on
most occasions escorted by Gladiators or Hurri-
canes. Several combats with large enemy
fighter formations took place, to the marked
advantage of our own fighters. As an example,
during a particular week of activity ending
3rd March, 33 Italian fighters were destroyed
and a further 8 probably destroyed, against
which our own fighter losses were only 1 Gladia-
tor destroyed, the pilot being safe, and 2 other
fighters damaged. Such successes were by no
means limited to this period and further refer-
ence is made later to the activities of our
fighters.

By the beginning of March the continued
arrival of enemy reinforcements by sea and
air had built up the strength of Italian forces
in Albania to an estimated total of 29 divisions.
The Greeks, however, retained the initiative,
repeatedly repulsing counter-attacks and in-
flicting heavy losses on the enemy. On the
gth March, the Greeks, taking advantage of
improving weather conditions, resumed their
offensive against Tepelene, again assisted by
our bombers which with fighter escorts con-
tinued their attacks against enemy troop posi-
tions and lines of communication. The Greeks

_made local progress.

35. The Italians launched their counter-
offensive on the 9th March on a front of about
20 miles, extending from Tepelene in the
Southern Sector to the Greek lines West of
Corovode in the Central Sector. The enemy
forces, which were.estimated at about 10 divi-
sions, supported by large numbers of bomber
and fighter aircraft, made continuous attacks
until the 14th March, but the Greeks, defend-
ing resolutely, repulsed all attacks and inflicted
very heavy losses on the enemy. The Italians
were unable to gain any ground and on the
14th March the Greeks made a successful
counter-attack, taking some prisoners.

Throughout these operations, which con-
tinued at maximum intensity between the oth
and 14th March, Blenheims escorted by fighters
made 43 sorties against enemy troops, gun
positions and M.T. columns, concentrating
largely on objectives in the Buzi-Gilave area.
At the same time Hurricanes and Gladiators
engaged on escort duties and offensive patrols
made 15 and 122 sorties respectively. They
fought several successful combats with enemy
fighters during which they destroyed 35 enemy
aircraft and probably another 9, with a total
loss of 2 Gladiators and 1 Hurricane, the pilots
of which escaped.

By the 15th March the Italian offensive was
reduced in intensity, although the enemy con-
tinued to make local attacks without success
until the 27th March. Air operations continued
against enemy positions and lines of communi-
cation in all sectors although on a somewhat
reduced scale as the result of a further de-
terioration of weather conditions.

36. During the period under review, Welling-
tons made 4 sorties and Blenheims 30 sorties
against shipping and port facilities at Valona.
Against Durazzo ‘Wellingtons made 11 sorties.
This effort was augmented by F.A.A. Sword-
fish operating from Paramythia which made
bomb and torpedo attacks against shipping
at these objectives, comprising 7 sorties against
Durazzo and 12 against Valona. A feature of
these operations was the effectiveness of the

SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 SEPTEMBER, 1946

F.A.A. Swordfish torpedo attacks in which five
direct and two probable hits were claimed on
shipping. Much damage was inflicted on port
facilities, warehouses, mili buildings and
barracks by the Wellingtons and Blenheims.
In Southern Italy, Brindisi was twice attacked
by Wellingtons, the railway station being the
objective on the first occasion and the aero-
drome on the second. A further attack in
the Brindisi area was made when fighter Blen-
heims successfully machineigunned grounded
aircraft at the aerodrome at Lecce (S. Italy).

37. One of the most outstanding features of
the campaign in Albania was the marked
superiority which our fighters gained over those
of the Italians. In a series of combats during
the first three months of the year (1941) our
fighters destroyed 93 enemy aircraft and prob-
ably destroyed another 26, the greater pro-
portion of the total being fighters. Against
this our own fighter losses in combat amounted
to 4 Hurricanes and 4 Gladiators destroyed,
from which 6 of the pilots escaped by para-
chute.

Enemy aircraft operating from aerodromes
in the Dodecanese periodically mined the Suez
Canal and also attacked our sea convoys sail-
ing to Greece. It became necessary, therefore,
to divert a portion of the available bomber
forces in Greece to attack aerodromes in the
Dodecanese, with harbours and shipping as an
alternative.

The main objectives were the aerodromes at
Rhodes, viz. Maritza, Cattavia and Calato,
against which 20 Wellington sorties and 25 by
Blenheims were made from Greece. Blenheims
also made a further 9 sorties against the aero-
drome at Scarpanto and shipping at Stampalia.
Many fires were started at the aerodromes, and
damage was caused to aerodrome buildings and
dispersed aircraft. Direct hits were also
obtained on one ship at Stampalia.

Other attacks on the Dodecanese were made
by Wellingtons operating from Egypt, the total
effort from Greece and Egypt combined during
the period under review amounting to 70
Wellington sorties and 34 Blenheim sorties.

38. A further operation of note was the com-
bined Naval and R.A.F. action against enemy
Naval forces at the Battle of Matapan on 28th
March.

Acting on Sunderland reconnaissance reports,
Blenheims operating from Greece made five
attacks comprising 24 sorties against. enemy
warships, reporting direct hits with S.A.P.
bombs on two cruisers and one destroyer. One
cruiser which was hit with a 500 Ib. S.A.P.
‘bomb was apparently seriously damaged. At

ing appreciation by the Board of Admiralty on
the part played by the R.A.F. in this action

39. Towards the middle of February it had
become clear that the German infiltration into
Roumania was likely to develop into a
‘drive’ through Bulgaria, with Salonika as
the preliminary objective. The Greek Govern-
ment recognised this as a very real threat, but
they were anxious to avoid any action originat-
ing from their territory which might precipitate
events. Though they were continually calling
for more air support, they did not accept the
offer of British Troops until 22nd February
when at a Conference held at Tatoi, attended
by the King of Greece, Prime Minister Korysis
(who had succeeded the late General Metaxas),
