In January, 1940, the Northern flank of our continuous Defence organisation was on the Forth, and the South-Western flank was at Tangmere in Sussex (with the exception of an isolated station at Filton for the local defence of Bristol and the mouth of the Severn), On the 2nd and 4th February I wrote two letters pointing out these limitations, and asking for an extension of Aerodrome facilities, Intelli- gence cover and communications."

The land communications of 7th Indian Division were soon cut and those of 5th Indian Division im danger, and it was only by supply dropping that the encircled forces could be expected to stand their ground and turn a potential catastrophe into a decisive victory. Japanese preparations for an offensive had been ob- served, however, and the possibility of en- circlement envisaged, so that when supply by air was called for on 8th February, there was no delay."

The Hurricanes were maintained from Sumatra at an average daily strength of ro aircraft, This average was maintained firstly by the arrival \u2018on 2gth January of No 258(F) Squadron with r5 Hurricanes. This squadron was one of several which had been convoyed from the Middle East (where they had just arrived as reinforcements from England) to the Far East an H M.S. Indomrtable. They had been \u2018\u2019 flown \u2018off\u2019 south of Java and had proceeded by air via Batavia and Sumatra, No 258 thence flying on to Seletar. They had had a long and varied passage from England, involving a sea voyage to Sierra Leone, followed by a long flight across the whole breadth of Central Africa to Port Sudan, where they had embarked in H.M.S. Indomitable. They came into action on 1st February after a delay caused by the necessity for removing all guns to clear them of anti- corrosion grease with which they had had to be protected for the journey, This squadron was relieved by 232(F) Squadron on 3rd Feb- ruary, also ex H.M.S. Indomitable The latter remained in Singapore until the withdrawal of the last of our aircraft."
