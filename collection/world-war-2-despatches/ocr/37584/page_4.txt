by dense fog. During the nights 30th/xst and
ist/2nd evacuation was successfully carried out
from Andalsnes. On Ist May thick fog off
Namsos Bar the ships entering the har-
bour. e whole evacuation of Namsos was
however successfully carried out on the
night of the 2nd/3rd, the last ship leaving at
0220 hours, and a total of 5,400 having been
embarked during that night, an operation for
which the greatest credit is due to the Naval
forces employed.

tz. During the whole of the 3rd the convoy
was continually bombed on its passage across
the North Sea. It has been reported to me
that one German aeroplane continually
shadowed it whilst relays of bombers came up,
presumably directed by the shadowing aero-
plane. That the losses were not heavier than
they were is evidence of remarkable luck. The
presence of some long range fighters during the
day would have been invaluable, but none were
available owing to question of range.

PART II.
OPERATIONS AT NaAMSOS.

12, On 14th April Major-General Carton de
Wiart was informed by the War Office that it
had been decided to land an allied expedition
in Central Norway, and that the operation was
to be carried out independently of the landings
already begun in the Narvik area.

13. Major-General Carton de Wiart was given
written instructions (Appendix “‘C ”’) on 14th
April appointing him in command of the Allied
forces being despatched to Central Norway, and
his role was defined as “‘to secure the
Trondheim area.’’ He was informed that the
Royal Navy were making preliminary landings
in the Namsos area with landing parties about
300 strong in all, in order to seize and hold
points at which disembarkation of Allied forces
might subsequently take place.

The written instructions suggested the initial
landing of army formations should be in the
Namsos area and that this should be carried
out by 146th and 148th Infantry Brigades and
Chasseurs Alpins, after the Royal Navy had
cleared the Trondheim fjord of German vessels.

It must be mentioned here that at the time
these instructions were issued 146th Infantry
Brigade was at sea with orders to land in the
Narvik area; that 148th Infantry Brigade (less
one battalion) was diverted to Andalsnes; that
147th Infantry Brigade never sailed from the
United Kingdom.

14. On the evening of 15th April General
Carton de Wiart, with a junior staff officer,
arrived at Namsos in a flying boat to confer
with the naval landing parties who had already
established a footing there. The flying boat
and the destroyer ‘‘Somali’’ lying in the
Namsen Fiord were repeatedly attacked by
German aircraft with bombs and machine-
gun fire, and Generai Carton de Wiart’s staff
officer was wounded. Meanwhile 146th Infantry
Brigade had been ordered, while at sea, to go
to Namsos instead of Narvik, but it was evident
that the landing of these troops direct from
transports was not a feasible operation at
Namsos, and that they would have to be
transferred to destroyers at Lillesjone and then
taken to Namsos on two successive days.

15. On 16th April the first battalion arrived
and were disposed to cover Namsos and

Bangsund, the remainder of 146th Infantry
Brigade getting ashore during the 17th April.
By the roth April, this brigade having moved
Southward from Namsos, was disposed as
follows:—

Advanced Brigade
Steinkjer.
One battalion—about Steinkjer.
One battalion—in the area South of
Steinkjer including Verdal and Stiklestad.
One battalion—in the area North of
Steinkjer including Bangsund.
These dispositions gave General Carton de
Wiart control of the roads and railways leading
Northwards from Trondheim, and placed him
in a favourable position to co-operate with any
direct attack on Trondheim which might be
developed from seaward.

16, During the night of rgth/zoth April the
5th Demi-Brigade of Chasseurs Alpins arrived
in Namsos under General Audet, but with the
indifferent port facilities there it was impossible
to clear the two small jetties during the hours
of darkness. Consequently on the following
morning the large quantity of supplies, muni-
tions and stores lying at the jetties was spotted
by enemy aircraft, and for two hours the quay,
station and western half of Namsos town were
heavily bombed. The station and most of the
town were destroyed, and one of the two jetties
was badly damaged.

The French Demi-Brigade was put into
billets and bivouacs close round Namsos, and,
while they were settling in, General Carton de
Wiart visited the headquarters of 146th Infantry
Brigade at Steinkjer and met there the com-
mander of the local Norwegian forces. So far
no British troops had been in contact with
German land forces.

17. At about o600 hours on a2zst April an
enemy detachment of some 400 men landed
at Kirkenesvaag and began to advance on
Sandvollan and Strémmen. Other German
landings were carried out at Hylla and Trones-
tangen, and an attack was directed on Verdal.
The enemy land forces were supported by war-
ships operating in the Trondheim fiord.

These German landings presented a serious
threat to the flank and rear of 146th Infantry
Brigade who were severely hampered by having
no artillery and by their inability to move any-
where off the roads on account of the deep
snow.

During the afternoon of 2zst April enemy
aircraft’ were also active; Steinkjer was bombed
and reduced to a flaming mass of ruins, and the
roads from Steinkjer to Verdal-and Stiklestad
were machine-gunned and bombed.

18. In view of these events and the inability
of the British infantry to operate off the roads,
General Carton de Wiart decided to withdraw
146th Infantry Brigade into a position north of
Steinkjer where its flanks could not be
threatened, and issued orders to that effect.

During the withdrawal a German destroyer
was very active with its gun fire, and enemy
mortar and light artillery fire was directed upon
the British battalions. In addition 4 Lincolns
were attacked about Steinkjer by German ski
troops and had somewhat heavy casualties.
By 24th April the Brigade was established in its
new position north of Steinkjer, having carried
out the withdrawal in very trying conditions.
