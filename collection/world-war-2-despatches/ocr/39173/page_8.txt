transport squadrons available that the target
figure was reached and surpassed in June.
But by the end of May it was clear that the
enemy’s disregard of air transport as a major
factor in the battle was to render his ambitious
and costly offensive a failure.

The Advance from Ledo.

52. Throughout the whole period the supply
of the Chinese-American forces operating from
Ledo under General Stilwell had been pro-
ceeding. These troops were advancing down
the Hukawng and Mogaung Valleys and
thereby gradually bringing the opening of an
overland route to China nearer realisation.
Each advance took them further from their
bases, and consequently their calls for air
supply were increasing, necessitating up to
100 sorties per day. Landing grounds were
constructed wherever possible along the path
of the advance, and light aircraft were
employed with good effect. The Dakota
(C.47), however, remained as the greatest single
factor in maintaining the advance. In April
the entire 50th Chinese Division, numbering
almost eight thousand men, was flown from
Sookerating to Maingkwan, while by then all
the combat troops in North Burma, both
American and Chinese, had become dependent
upon air supply. In May, a fast moving
column of American troops, known as Galahad
Force and supported entirely by air, made a
considerable detour and caught the enemy
unawares, seizing the main airfield at
Myitkyina on 17th May. All units of Troop
Carrier Command in the north had been
standing by to carry in those forces which
General Stilwell believed adequate to defeat
the expected enemy counter attack. Brigadier-
General Old was waiting at Shinbuiyang to
conduct the initial glider operation in which
troops and engineering equipment were to be
conveyed, and himself towed the first glider
into Myitkyina. Transport aircraft followed
the gliders almost at once. In the course of
thirty-six hours of intensive operations by both
day and night, during which ground fire was
continually encountered, and one enemy air
attack was successful in shooting down a
Dakota (C.47) and destroying others on the
ground, there were landed a complete Chinese
Regiment, six light anti-tank batteries, twelve
Bofor guns and crews, one airborne engineer
company and a Chinese mortar company.
Many loads of ammunition, food and stores
were also conveyed. Before the end of the
month further troops, in numbers equivalent to
a division, had been taken by air to Myitkyina,
and the first stage of the reconquest of Burma
and the reopening of the Burma Road was
completed.

Evacuation of Casualties.

53. It would be incomplete to close this

account of the operations of transport aircraft
under my command without some mention of
a further aspect of their work. During the first
five months of 1944 the aircraft of Troop Car-
rier Command flew no less than twenty-three
thousand sick and wounded back to safety. It
may safely be said that but for the provision of
air transport the greater proportion of these
would have had little hope of survival. The
alternative was many days’ journey by sam-

pan, mule and ambulance, and perhaps rail,
to the nearest base hospital. Moreover, a pro-
portion of the casualties evacuated were from
the columns of Special Force fighting in enemy
occupied territory. The 2,126 casualties evacu-
ated from the division by the end of May
would have been a total loss had they not been
flown out by air.

54. Although evacuation of casualties by air
was no new phenomenon in this theatre of war,
nevertheless it first assumed considerable pro-
portions during the Arakan battle in February
and reached its peak during the struggle for
Imphal in April. Transport aircraft, when
they landed to deliver supplies frequently re-
ceived casualties for the return journey. When,
however, supplies were dropped, the interven-
tion of light aircraft was necessary for the
journey from a small advanced landing ground
to a strip further back where a Dakota might
land. But since neither heavy nor light aircraft
could be spared throughout this period speci-
fically for the evacuation of casualties, the
removal of sick and wounded remained an
“ad hoc” matter arranged on a basis of ex-
pediency and improvisation. R.A.F. medical
personnel at airfields were insufficient to deal
with the load of casualties which, due to opera-
tional exigencies, might be entrusted to them
with little or no warning by a flight of trans-
port Dakotas. And so, although the care of
all wounded at airfields was officially an R.A.F.
responsibility, nevertheless help in this matter
was gladly accepted from the Army.

CONCLUSION.

55. Thus air transport played a decisive part
in the three great battles of the period. By
the end of May the reconquest of portions of
northern Burma was in sight, and the garrison
of Imphal was still an offensive force. The
events related above make a reiteration of the
importance of transport aircraft unnecessary.
In connection with the operations, however,
certain lessons were learned which I would
emphasize. First, it is essential that Army
Commanders should not be allowed to regard
air transport as an auxiliary arm upon which
they can call without reference to the appro-
priate Air Force Commander. Secondly, the
Army must be impressed with the necessity for
the quick turn-round of aircraft; during in-
tensive operations loads must be ready for the
aircraft as they land. Too often crews wasted
valuable hours waiting at an Army Supply
Base because their freight had not been
assembled ready for loading. Thirdly, when the
Army are the main customers of air transport
forces, the fullest day-to-day liaison and dis-
cussion of problems must be combined with
clear statements as far in advance as possible
of what they require in the way of air trans-
port, and for what purpose, in order that
priorities may be allotted.

56. It is to be noted that the inadequacy.
of the Army ground organisation for supply by
air operations became recognised by the Army
as and when these operations became large-
scale undertakings. Steps were taken to im-
prove the ground organisation in the light of
the experience gained during the operations.
The first step was to provide Indian Air Sup-
ply companies at supply loading airfields. A
further important development was to create
Army staff organisations both to control the
