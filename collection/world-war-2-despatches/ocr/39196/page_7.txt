SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

late September the Japanese Air Force began
a series of reconnaissances with disastrous
results. Cover was attempted of the Manipur
Road, Silchar, Chittagong and battle areas.
Four Dinahs were destroyed during this brief
spell and since then no reconnaissance over
the India border has been attempted. On
Christmas night three bombers attempted to
penetrate to the Calcutta area; of these, two
were destroyed by Beaufighters and the third
returned in a damaged condition. Enemy
attempts to interfere with shipping off Akyab
in January were decisively dealt with by the
Spitfire squadrons who moved in five days
after its occupation, No. 67 Squadron destroy-
ing five out of six attacking Oscars in one
lay.

44. Thereafter, the enemy effort degenerated
into a series of sporadic and infrequent attempts
to disrupt our forward columns. The
ineffectual nature of these attacks was evident
to all who flew over the battlefield and noted,
on the enemy side no signs of activity, but,
behind the British lines, long lines of trans-
port moving in uncamouflaged safety, supply-
dropping parachutes in use as tents, and all
the apparatus of war left in full view by
troops whose immunity from air attack was
scarcely ever violated even by fast-flying
fighters, for the enemy dared not send a
bomber over the Allied lines by daylight.

45. It is unnecessary to recount in detail
the enormous advantages accruing to both
ground and air forces when the enemy air
arm is small and misemployed, and when our
own squadrons are superior in performance,
training and control. It is, however, worth
pausing to consider the results had enemy air-
craft been allowed unrestricted use of the sky.
The air supply on which the whole land cam-
paign hinged would have been impossible, the
attrition rate of our close support squadrons,
which worked with accuracy and effect, would
have been prohibitive, and the disuption caused
by our strategic bombers to the enemy’s com-
munications far to the rear could not have
been such as to have materially influenced
the battle.

Part Four.

TRANSPORT SUPPORT OPERATIONS
AND DEVELOPMENT.

46. The Burma campaign has proved beyond
all doubt that once air superiority has been
achieved, the air maintenance and supply of
forces in the field is governed primarily by the
availability of airfields and of transport air-
craft. The supply and maintenance of the
Army, in the field and engaged in intensive
operations together with a tactical air force in
support, is a major problem under most favour-
able conditions. It should be borne in mind,
however, that supply bases were some 250 miles
distant, and that the intervening country com-
prised vast stretches of impenetrable jungle and
a formidable mountain barrier rising up to
10,000 feet. In addition, weather conditions
were by no means favourable, and experience
‘has shown that monsoon cloud develops a

degree of turbulence which has been the cause
of a number of fatal accidents.

47. Despite these many difficulties, the success
of the air supply operations in the Burma
campaign has been fully testified, It is fair to
say that without air supply the Burma campaign
could never have been fought on its present
lines. It was in fact a decisive factor of the
land campaign. Admittedly mistakes occurred,
sometimes due to miscalculation but more often
due to unforeseen contingencies, Even so the
air supply operations in Burma will probably
rank as one of the greatest, if not the greatest,
of air supply achievements in this war.

48. The organisation and operation of air
supply is a problem which calls for mutual
understanding of each other’s difficulties by the
respective Services. In this respect it cannot
be too strongly emphasised that it is the opera-
tors and not the consumers who determine the
most efficient method of delivering the goods.
Moreover, it is up to the consumers to state
precisely what is required, in a given order of
priority. It is their responsibility also to
deliver these goods in the required quantities
and at the right time to the air supply heads.
The swift and unco-ordinated growth of the
air transport organization did not allow of a
full appreciation, by either the Army or the Air
Force, of the importance of the ancillary ser-
vices necessary to promote the full effectiveness
of the machine. As the campaign advanced,
this tendency has been progressively eliminated,
and the situation is now that only a lack of
resources prevents the air transport organisa-
tion from incorporating all the lessons that have
been learnt, and giving it the full effectiveness
with which experience can endow it. From this
observation, the air supply organization that has
developed within the area of Northern Combat
Area Command and Tenth Air Force is
excepted. There, a realisation of the import-
ance of firm backing to the supply system was
evident from the outset, and resulted in a very
high standard of operating efficiency,

49. In June, 1944, there were in Air Com-
mand eleven transport squadrons engaged on

: air supply, four British and seven American. By

May, 1945, these figures bad risen to nine and
sixteen respectively, an increase which still left
the air supply force with little or no margin
of reserve. The growth of air supply during the
period can well be imagined.

50. At the beginning of the period, attention
was still centred upon the critical position of
4 Corps besieged in and around the ancient
capital of Manipur. There were still twenty-
three days of June to go before the road to
Imphal was to be re-opened. Working to
supply the garrison and to build a stockpile to
exploit the anticipated Japanese retreat, as
much as 700 tons were being flown in on a
single day under monsoon conditions. When
the road was re-opened, effort was not allowed
to drop and for the remaining days of June the
squadrons flew at maximum effort in order to
build up stocks and ascertain the peak air lift
that could be achieved. The wisdom of this
was doubtful ; all concerned were already ex-
hausted, and experience has illustrated the value
of retaining a margin of effort in reserve, and
of not over-straining a complicated machine
without urgent necessity.
