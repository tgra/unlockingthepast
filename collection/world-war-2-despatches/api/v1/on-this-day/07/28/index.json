            "description": "8. When I was appointed to the command of the Anti-Aircraft defences on 28th July, 1939, I was faced with the most grave shortage of equipment. At the outbreak of war the total number of Heavy Anti-Aircraft guns under my command was 695, many of which were of old and obsolescent types and a number of which were only on loan from the Royal Navy. The approved and recommended total at this timie was 2,232. :"

            "description": "While Second British Army was switching its main weight to the Caumont sector, the progress of the break-out operation proceeded apace. On 28th July, 4 and 6 U.S. Armoured Divisions passed through the infantry on the western sector and thrust South towards Coutances. The town was captured in the afternoon and firm contact was established there between VIII and VII Corps. To the SouthEast, troops of VII and XIX Corps had got to within five miles of the main Avranches Caen road. All reports indicated that West of the River Vire to the coast the enemy was completely disorganised. Avranches was taken on 31st July."

            "description": "The last week of July was characterised by a comparative lull on the Eighth Army front and the transference of the American effort to the axis of the north coast road and the road running parallel to it to the south. General Montgomery wished to rest his troops and await the arrival of 78 Division before resuming the offensive. I fixed on rst August as the date at which both Armies should be ready to recommence active operations and I expected that after that date the process of clearing the island would be fairly rapid. The Germans had now four divisions in Sicily, Hermann  Goering, 15 Panzer, 29 Panzer Grenadier and i Parachute, but they were not all complete and the first two had already suffered heavy casualties General Hube, a man in whom Hhiler was reported to have great confidence, had arrived to command them from the XIV Panzer Corps Headquarters I moved my own headquarters over to Sicily and opened in a dusty but well-concealed site m an almond grove near Cassibile on 28th July."
