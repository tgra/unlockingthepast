The R.A.F. occupied Benina aerodrome on Ioth February and found 87 unserviceable and damaged enemy aircraft there, which, together with those found at other aerodromes, notably El Adem and Gazala, were an indication of the effectiveness of the numerous bombing attacks made on enemy air force objectives and accounted very largely for the virtual collapse of the Italian Air Force during the latter stage of the advance."

At 0930 hrs. on the 6th February our air reconnaissance sent out from Palembang in Sumatra reported one cruiser, four destroyers and four merchant ships at anchor in the Anambas Islands some 250 miles north-east of Singapore. We concluded that this was a seaborne force assembling for an attack either on Singapore or on some objective in the N.E.1."

            "description": "48. From an early hour on the 6th February the enemy main columns began to appear, and severe fighting occurred throughout the day as successive enemy groups, including a large number of tanks, attempted unsuccessfully to break through the 4th Armoured Brigade, later reinforced by 7th Armoured Brigade (rst R.T.R.) as more and more enemy tanks continued to appear 84 were put out of action during the day's fighting. By nightfall the situation was unchanged. The enemy's position was desperate, with a confused mass of vehicles almost 20 miles in length pinned to the roads between our Armoured Brigades in the South and the Northern detachment in the Soluch area, now beginning to turn South-West. Certain enemy groups had, however, managed to evade the 4th Armoured Brigade by moving through the sand dune area between the main road and the sea. One group in particular, consisting of tanks strongly supported by infantry, repeatedly attacked the Southern detachment, now reinforced by a third R.H.A. battery, during the night 6th/7th February and early morning 7th February, In all nine attacks were delivered against 2nd Rifle Brigade, and"

Previously, on the 6th February, the Corps Commander had by wireless directed 6th Australian Division to send a detachment, made mobile from divisional resources, along the coast road to Ghemines, in order to complete the encirclement of the enemy. This detachment, comprising the equivalent of a Brigade Group, pressed on with great resolution and received the surrender of Benghazi, but did not reach Ghemin's until about noon on the 7th February, by which time all fighting had ceased."

The difficulties of this operation will be appreciated when it is realised that throughout the entire battle the enemy had the high ground, and all movements, whether in M.T. or on foot, were clearly visible to his O.Ps. O.Ps. on Fort Dologorodoc and M. Sanchil have the road almost in enfilade for miles. O.Ps. on M. Samanna and M. Amba overlooked all administrative areas of the forward brigades. During the night 4/5th February, 3/14 Punjab Regiment went through 2 Camerons on Cameron Ridge and occupied Brigs Peak, but were driven off on the afternoon of the next  day.  1/6 Rajputana Rifles occupied the extension of Cameron Ridge south of Brigs Peak, and although severely counterattacked, held on. Throughout all this early period of the battle, the enemy wes being rapidly reinforced, and was counter-attacking"

A special security route had  been chosen for him running east-south-east by compass-bearing to the north-western slopes of Belaya, but this proved too difficult for M.T. and he eventually reached Belaya by horse on 6th February. In the meantime Colonel O.C.  Wingate had been appointed commander of the forces in Gojjam, and Brigadier D. S. Sandford became Political and Military Adviser to the Emperor."

            "description": "The first step in this retreat was taken before our regular forces could intervene. On 16th February, when one company of the Frontier Battalion was approaching his area, Colonel Torelli, commanding the nine battalions in Dangila, withdrew to Piccolo Abbai, and thence after a short rest at Meshenti, to Bahrdar Giyorgis. He lost several hundred deserters en route and was harried by patriots and by a Bimbashi of the S.D.F. with one mortar and 20 regular troops, but his casualties to fire were not large. In the following weeks he was able to withdraw all the outlying garrisons of Alefa and Achefer, Zeghie, Debra Mai and Addiet, without great loss, to Bahrdar, where he was invested by   Beghemder Force   consisting of one company of the Frontier Battalion and an Operational Centre of 180 men acting under the G.S.0.2 of Mission ror. The role of this small force, which it successfully accomplished, was to prevent Torelli from breaking  back and attacking the rear of the Frontier Battalion and 2 Ethiopian Battalion once the Italian Commander understood the midget from which he had run. Dangila had meanwhile been looted by the patriots."
