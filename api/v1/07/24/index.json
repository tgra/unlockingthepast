The policy to be adopted in view of the unsatisfactory attitude of the Iranian Government to the representations made regarding the expulsion of Axis nationals from Iran had been under consideration by His Majesty's Government and the Soviet Government during the early weeks of July and on 22nd July Lt. General Quinan was instructed to be prepared to occupy Abadan and Naft-i-Shah and at a Tater date the oilfields in South West Iran. On 24th July intimation was received that His Majesty\u2019s Governm\u00e9nt had approved of the proposals for the application of Anglo-Soviet diplomatic pressure backed iby a show of force on the Iranian Government in order to secure the expulsion of Axis nationals \u00a2rom their country; should diplomatic pressure fail force was to be used."

            "description": "150. Up to this time 46 \u201c\u2018 Circus \u2019\u2019 operations had been carried out since 14th June. In those six weeks escort and support had been given to 374 bomber sorties and over 8,000 fighter sorties flown. We had lost 123 fighter pilots but it was hoped that many more German fighters than this had been destroyed. In addition, over 1,000 fighter sorties had been flown in support of 32 bomber operations against shipping, including the operations against the German capital ships on 24th July and an attack on the docks at Le Havre on roth June. Fighter sweeps without bombers accounted for approximately another 800 sorties, and operation \u2018\u2018 Rhubarb \u2019\u2019\u2014resumed on 16th July after a month\u2019s pause\u2014for a further 61. Altogether the six weeks\u2019 intensive effort had meant the expenditure of nearly 10,000 offensive sorties by my Command. This was an impressive total, but to preserve perspective it must be remembered that the effort devoted to defensive purposes was still greater, approximately this number of sorties being expended during the same period on the protection of shipping alone. :"

            "description": "98. We had concluded an economic agreement with the Vichy French authorities in IndoChina, and they professed themselves anxious to develop friendly relations. In spite of this an agreement between them and the Japanese was announced on the 24th July, 1941. Its terms allowed the Japanese to maintain forces in the South of Indo-China. A Japanese convoy began to arrive at Saigon on the 26th, and by the end of July Hig Japahes were well established in that town. More important still, this movement gave the Japanese complete control of Camranh Harbour, and they quicklw started to make or improve aerodromes to the South and West of Saigon. As was expected, the Japanese did not limit themselves for long to the terms of the agreement, and the French authorities made practically no effort to oppose either the original terms or the successive encroachments. The effect of this expansion on the defence of the Far East is indicated below (paras. 93 et seq.)."

The outline plan was that M.T. /Stores ships were to begin loading at Beirut, Haifa and Alexandria early in June. Personnel ships were to load at Suez at the beginning of July. Half of the L.S.Ts. (tank-landing ships, with a capacity of fifty vehicles, or twenty-two tanks and twenty vehicles) were to load half at Suez and half at Alexandria. L.C.Ts. (tank-landing craft, with a capacity of ten vehicles or six tanks) were to load at Benghazi. The M.T./Stores convoys were planned to arrive as follows: the assault convoy on roth July, first follow-up convoy on 13th July, amd second follow-up convoy on 24th July. Thereafter reinforcements and maintenance convoys would be sailed every fourteen days until 22nd August, when they would be sailed every ten days."

The opening of 23 Indian Division\u2019s offensive down the Tamu road in the middle of July began another phase of the campaign to drive the Japanese forces across the Chindwin. The situation on the 24th July was that one brigade, after making a wide turning movement via the Sibong track, had outflanked the enemy\u2019s positions, established blocks on the Tamu road south of Sibong and in the Lokchao bridge area, and achieved complete surprise. The enemy was thus caught between these blocks and the two brigades advancing on them from the north which, on that date, had captured the strong Japanese positions at Tengnoupal after severe fighting. The enemy\u2019s defence in this area disintegrated and they withdrew, abandoning much heavy equipment, including some guns. By the 25th, we had cleared an enemy block at Milestone 49 and were exploiting to the south-east."

This force, of roughly divisional strength, was made up from five American Light Anti-Aircraft battalions, a British Light Anti-Aircraft regiment, an American Tank battalion, part of two Tank Destroyer battalions, part of a divisional reconnaissance battalion and some miscellaneous service units; it was divided into three regiment-sized groups. Up to 24th July these units were still. being employed in their original r\u00e9les, and had only a very short period of intensive training before taking over part of the line on the Arno from 34 Division. \u2018The success of this remarkable effort at. conversion was very encouraging and \u2018\u2018 Task Force 45\u2019\u2019 remained for many months a valuable part of Fifth Army\u2019s order of battle, used for holding defensive fronts."

If joint British and Russian diplomatic pressure were unavailing, both Powers were intending to take joint military action to enforce their demands."
