APPENDIX ‘' F;”

NOTE ON THE OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE
EQuipMENT OF AIRCRAFT.

x. The general principle of developing the
maximum possible fire power, which is
accepted in all Armics and Navies, must pre-
sumably be applicable to Fighter Aircraft, pro-
vided that this can be done without unduly
sacrificing Performance and Endurance.

2. The 8-gun fighter may be said to
exemplify this principle, and at the beginning
of the war its results were decisive against Ger-
man Bombers, which were unarmoured at that
time.

3. Our Fighter pilots were protected against
the return fire of Bombers by their engines, and
by bullet-proof glass and armour, for their
heads and chests respectively.

4. Furthermore, at this time the return fire
from German Bombers was negligible. They
had concentrated on Performance as the prin-
ciple means of evasion (a false lesson drawn
from the low speed of the Fighters used in the
Spanish War) and the few guns which they
carried were manually controlled, and so badly
mounted that they were practically useless.
These facts, in combination with the fire power
and armour protection of our own Fighters,
made the latter virtually immune to the fire
of unescorted Bombers, and their casualties in
Home Defence fighting up to the Spring of
1940. were quite negligible.

5. The German Bombers had good self-seal-
ing tanks, and this was perhaps the only im-
portant particular in which they were ahead
of us. In our development work we had
demanded that tanks should be ‘‘ Crash
Proof ’’ as well as self-sealing, and the drastic
conditions, which our experimental tanks had
to meet had made them unduly heavy and
cumbrous.

6. So far as our Fighters were concerned,
the wing tanks in the Hurricane were removed
and covered with a fabric known as ‘‘ Linatex ’”
which had fairly good self-sealing _charac-
teristics. The reserve tank in the fuselage was
left uncovered, as it was difficult of access and
it was thought that it would be substantially
protected by the armour which had been fitted.

ring the Battle, however, a great number
of Hurricanes were set on fire by incendiary
bullets or cannon shells, and their pilots were
badly burned by a sheet of flame which filled
the cockpit before they could escape by para-
chute.

7. The reserve tanks were therefore covered
with Linatex as a matter of the highest priority,
and a metal bulkhead was fitted in front of the
pilot to exclude the rush of flame from the
cockpit. : ,

8. The Germans soon began to fit fuselage
armour to protect their pilots and crews, but
for some unexplained reason neither side had
fitted armour behind the engines of their
Bombers. The back of the engine is much more
vulnerable to rifle-calibre bullets than the front,
owing to the mass of ancillary equipment which
is there installed. While the back of the engine
lies open to attack, the rifle-calibre machine
gun remains a useful weapon, and the fact is
a fortunate one for us.

9. The application of armour to Bombers did
not, of course, come as a surprise to us, and
its implications had long been discussed.

to. Excluding devices such as hanging wires,
exploding pilotless aircraft, etc., I have always
thought that the courses open to the Fighter,
when rifle-calibre machine-gun fire from astern
becomes ineffective, may be summarised as
follows :—

(A) Deliver fire from ahead or from a flank.

(B) Pierce the armour.

(C) Attack the fuel tanks with incendiary
ammunition.

(D) Destroy the structure of the aircraft by
means of direct hits from explosive shells.

(E) Use large shells with Time and Per-
cussion fuzes.

Discussing these in order: —

11.—(A) Fire from ahead or from a flank is
effective but difficult to deliver accurately at
modern speeds. Fire from ahead proved very
effective on occasions during the Battle, but
relative speeds are so high that the time avail-
able for shooting is very short, and Fighters -
generally find themselves in a position to de-
liver such an attack more by accident than
by design.

12. Beam attack is very difficult to deliver
accurately, owing to the amount of deflection
which had to be allowed. The deflection ring
on a Fighter’s sight allows for an enemy speed
of roo m.p.h., and therefore a full diameter
outside the ring must sometimes be allowed.

13. The method is effective against forma-
tions, when the aircraft hit is not always the
one aimed at, and certainly the Gladiators in
Norway developed this technique with great
success. On the whole, however, Fighters
which were constrained to this method of attack
would have a very limited usefulness.

14.—(B) The simplest reaction for the
Fighter is to pierce the armour, but it entails
the use of bigger calibres. Jt must be remem-
bered also that it is not. sufficient merely to
pierce the armour, but the bullet must have
sufficient remaining velocity to do lethal
damage thereafter. High velocities, in addition

‘to bigger calibres, are therefore necessary. -
