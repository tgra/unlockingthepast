Until then our chances of putting the enemy to flight and even of destroying him had seemed good. But even after the attack had failed, it did not at once become necessary to evacuate the Gazala line or to abandon all hope of eventually making Our tank force was believed to ibe still equal in number to the enemy’s and our prospects of obtaining reinforcements as good as if not better than his. But before we could take the offensive again we needed time to reorganise, and the enemy’s powers of rapid recuperation seemed greater than our own.",

On the following day (5th June) the Germans launched a powerful offensive against the whole front held by the Seventh and Tenth French Armies, from St. Quentin to the sea. The 51st Division was by this time in an exhausted condition, after 12 days of continual movement and battle, and was holding too wide a front to be able to resist effectively. The Tenth Army Commander, when asked to relieve the Division from the front, replied that he had no reserves available. The Division fought bravely, but was forced back by German infiltration between its widely scattered posts. Owing to the extent of its frontage the division had no depth in its defences, and had no time to organize rearward defences, nor any reserves with which to counter-attack. It was forced back to the line of the river Bresle, the next natural obstacle, 15 miles in rear.",
