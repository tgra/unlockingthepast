Chief among them was the great vulnerability of aircraft if caught by accurate H.A.A. fire when in close formation. A good instance of this occurred in an action on the 8th September, when a geschwader of 15 Do. 17s, flying in formation at 15,000 feet, approached a gun site South of River Thames. The opening salvo from the four 3.7-inch guns brought down the three leading aircraft, the remaining machines turning back in disorder, scattering their bombs on the countryside in their flight to the coast. -",

The urgency was such that this delay was unacceptable, and one battalion was ordered to embark in motor launches and Royal Air Force launches for transit to Rhodes, while preparations for the mounting of the remainder of the brigade went on as fast as possible. It was, however, imperative that we should have a guarantee of unopposed entry into the port of Rhodes and an unopposed occupation of an airfield either at Marizza or on Cos before the expedition could be launched, since a landing against opposition was out of the question. Before anything could be done, the German commander, Von Kleeman, had taken advantage of Campicne’s weakness and indecision, and the Germans assumed undisputed control of Rhodes.",

The assault convoys for Salerno were at sea north of Sicily steering a northerly course preparatory to turning east after last light. x Airborne Division was concentrated at Bizerta on its warships, ready to sail for Taranto when Badoglio’s announcement should have confirmed that the Italians were ready to surrender, The troops of 82 Airborne Division were at Licata in Sicily, oy SS emplane for the drop on Rome. In Calabria 1 Canadian Division on the right had entered Locri, Cittanova and Polistena without contact with the enemy; 5 Division on the left had reached Rosarno and: the line of the River Mesima; 231 Infantry Brigade, supported by Commandos, made a landing at Pizzo, the same morning, which was intended to get in behind the enemy’s rear ibut which actually made contact with his last elements retreating more rapidly than had been expected. Meanwhile a new crisis was brewing at Bizerta where at rz00 hours a conference of Commanders-inChief, presided over by General Eisenhower, was in progress.",

Moreover, in the course of the withdrawal Kesselring still further weakened his centre, from which he had already removed 29 Panzer Grenadier Division, by relieving 356 Infantry Division and sending it over. to the Adriatic. I decided, therefore, that the time was almost come for the Fifth Army attack to go in. I visited Eighth Army front on 8th September and it was clear to me from what I saw there that we could not continue our advance on to Rimini until we had driven the enemy off the Coriano ridge. This would need full preparation and would probably take two or three days more. I explained the situation in a signal next day, 9th September, and concluded by saying that for these reasons I had decided to unleash Fifth Army who would now go ahead with their offensive in the centre.
