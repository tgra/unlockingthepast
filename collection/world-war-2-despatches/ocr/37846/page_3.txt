to him the operational disadvantages of the
existing situation and that, unless suitable run-
ways were provided near the front, the support
that we could give to the Greek nation during
the winter months would be severely limited.
He agreed fully with my recommendations and
arranged for the construction of runways to
proceed immediately. After consulting with
the head of the department concerned, he in-
formed me that the runways would be com-
pleted by the end of January, 1941. (NotE.—

and shortages of material, this forecast proved

Arrival of the Force:

1x. Units of the force continued to arrive
throughout the months of November and
December and by the end of the year the con-
centration was complete and the whole com-
mand functioning smoothly. When the com-
position of the force was being considered in the
Middle East, it was decided that all the ancillary
services such as hospital, works, rationing,
etc., should be provided by the Army, with
appropriate Army officers on my Headquarters
staff to deal with them. This arrangement was
particularly successful. Although, even in our
Tespective services, few of us had served to-
gether before, officers of this combined staff
soon settled down and worked with the greatest
enthusiasm and co-operation. This happy
atmosphere which existed at the top had, I
consider, a beneficial effect on the relationship
between the operational units and the actual
services themselves who at all times provided
our requirements in spite of countless difficulties
occasioned by .weather and terrain. Similarly,
the liaison that existed between the British
forces in Greece and the Greeks was at all
times close and cordial. Every evening I
attended a conference with the Commander-in-
Chief and the Greek General Staff to discuss
the day’s land and air operations and to plan
the programme of work for my force and for
the Greek air force for the following day. These
nightly meetings which were attended fre-
quently by His Majesty the King and General
Metaxas, when matters of higher policy were
freely discussed, were carried on throughout the
whole of my stay in Greece and were invaluable
from a co-operation point of view.
Progress of Operations:

iz. As regards the actual operations them-
selves, the Greeks had by now taken the offen-
sive'on land and, although handicapped by
severe weather conditions and shortage be equip-
ment, had managed to drive all the Italian
forces off Greek territory and in some sectors
had even advanced into Albania. In the air,
our continued bombing offensive against the
ports of Valona and Durazzo and the focal
points on the enemy’s rearward system was

aving a serious effect on his supply organisa-
tion. In addition, during moonlight periods, our
bomber effort was being extended to targets on
the mainland of Italy by means of Wellington
aircraft detached from Egypt for the purpose,
and considerable damage was being inflicted on
ports on both sides of the Adriatic. Similarly,
our fighter aircraft were establishing a definite
atmosphere of moral if not of numerical
superiority, in this theatre,

JANUARY-FEBRUARY, I941.

Operational Difficulties.

13. The new year opened with a deterioration
in the weather conditions. Heavy falls of snow
and much low cloud made flying conditions
difficult and dangerous. A further handicap now
appeared in the form of severe icing conditions
which were experienced by our aircraft over the
mountainous country between their bases and
the targets in Albania. To avoid this serious
state of affairs, we were forced to route our
bomber aircraft by way of the coast. Over the
sea, the flying conditions were considerably
better, but this longer route limited the opera-
tional radius‘ of action of our aircraft and
militated against effecting surprise. Further-
more, enemy aircraft opposition was now
becoming increasingly stronger, and large
numbers of modern enemy fighters were being
encountered constantly over the targets. These
reinforcements were undoubtedly being brought
over in an effort to reduce the scale of our
attacks on the enemy’s rearward communica-
tion system, which were obvioysly causing him
growing embarrassment. t it was com-
forting to think that our bomber offensive was
presumably having the desired effect, this
addition to the enemy’s fighter strength in-
creased considerably our operational difficul-
ties. It was now necessary to make full .use
of cloud cover and to adopt a system of fighter
escorts for our day bomber raids if heavy
casualties were to be avoided. Our lack of
modern fighter aircraft and the difficulties
encountered in arranging for bombers and their
escorts to meet, owing to the distance between
our bomber and fighter aefodromes, badly
connected iby communications, with weather
conditions constantly changing, all tended to
reduce the operational effort of my bomber
force and it became increasingly obvious that,
until the fine weather came and more aero-
dromes were made available, there would be
little opportunity for any decisive action on our

‘part.

14. I would here like to pay a tribute to the
magnificent spirit in which the pilots and air
crews carried out their work during an exceed-
ingly difficult period of operations. Based as
they were in the Athens area, every raid carried
out by the bomber squadrons involved a pre-
liminary’ flight of at least 200 miles to the
theatre of operations in weather conditions
which «were at times quite indescribable.
Throughout the journey, the pilots and air
crews were fully aware that they would meet
strong fighter opposition over the targets, and
would ‘have to engage the enemy before they
were able to deliver their attacks. The number
of lucrative targets in Albania was strictly
limited and the Italians had iby this time been
able to concentrate a high soale of anti-aircraft
artillery to defend them, and it was seldom
that our aircraft came through «unscathed.
Having carried out their task, the long and
arduous journey home had to be completed.
Direction’ finding aids existed but the very
nature of the country made their results un-
reliable and much ‘had to be left to the skill,
judgment and determination of the individual
pilots. In spite of all these difficulties, how-
ever, squadrons cheerfully abcepted all the
tasks I gave them and maintained a scale of
effort far beyond that which is normally
