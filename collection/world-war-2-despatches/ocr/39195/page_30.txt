movement. The Division moved swiftly,
reaching Thandada, six miles south-east of
Thayettabin, by the 22nd December. The
enemy had been out-witted and the majority
of his force, including all his guns, were still
north of Thayettabin, expecting to fight in
the area which they had selected.

157. The next few days were spent by 81
(West African) Division in establishing a firm
base in the hills south-east of Thayettabin. The
Japanese pulled back and concentrated west
of Point 317—an isolated feature which runs
parallel to, and just east of, the road
Thayettabin—Myohaung. Despite three days of
saturation bombing, from the 29th to 31st
December, and vigorous ground attacks sup-
ported by further air strikes, the new enemy
positions in this area were not carried till the
9th January, and then only in the face of a
determined defence.

158. At this stage, 4 Brigade of 82 (West
African) Division came into the picture. This
Brigade, moving via Kanzauk, reached
Apaukwa on the 9th January and came under
command of 81 (West African) Division, on the
10th, for the operation to capture Myohaung.
Myohaung and Minbya were now the enemy’s
concentration areas and there were good
reasons for anticipating that he would defend
this zone strongly. It included the only road
fit for vehicles ; it covered the flank of their
activities 180 miles to the east ; and finally, the
Dalet—An—Minbu track was not yet ready for
traffic, and further time was required to com-
plete its construction. The somewhat abnormal
amount of artillery known to be in the area
also indicated the probability of determined
resistance. Before, however, describing what
actually happened on this front, it is necessary
to revert to the operations which took place in
the coastal sector.

Section X (paras. 159-185). CAPTURE OF
AKYAB AND SUBSEQUENT EXPLOITATION

Modified plans for the capture of Akyab:
The enemy’s withdrawal: The Myebon and
Kangaw operations: The battle for Myo-
haung: Operations of the West African
divisions.

159. For the past two years planning teams
had fbeen studying how best to recapture the
island of Akyab by amphibious assault. On
the 10th December, I had issued an Operation
Instruction, based on plans made and instruc-
tions received before I took over command,
for the mounting of an amphibious operation
from Chittagong. 26 Indian Division (Major-
General C. E. N. Lomax) was earmarked for
this assault, which was scheduled to take place
about the 15th February but it looked as if
it might have to be made later, since the land-
ing craft of Naval Assault Force “ W” were
only partially assembled. In this original plan
the choice of a landing beach caused a good
deal of anxiety. The tests recommended by
the Scientific Advisers to the Supreme Allied
Commander had not yielded any conclusive
results on the consistency of the ‘beaches, and
inland swamps and waterways limited the land-
ing places from which deployment was practic-
able. It was, however, decided that a beach
on the south cost of the island, between

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

Fakir Point and Akyab Town, showed most
promise. It was, however, narrow—about 900
yards—and looked like restricting the assault
to a one brigade front. The garrison of the
island had been some 2,000 infantry, supported
by artillery. As usual our Intelligence of the
enemy garrison was very poor and we later
found out that the Japanese had started to
thin out in the autumn, and by December only
about a battalion remained.

160. As described in the last section, our
offensive in Arakan had opened well, and un-
expectedly fast progress had ‘been made. It
was essential to maintain this momentum and
take full advantage of the enemy weakness.
Thus the situation demanded that quicker, and
therefore simpler, ways of capturing the island
be devised than the original fairly large-scale
amphibious operation in mid-February or later.
Accordingly Lieutenant-General Christison,
with Rear-Admiral Martin and Air Commodore
the Earl of Bandon, prepared new plans. These
were considered by the Supreme Allied Com-
mander, with the Naval and Air Commanders-
in-Chief and myself, at a conference at my
Advanced Headquarters at Barrackpore on the .
21st December. From the outset it was realised
that, in the event of the enemy weakening
further, even these new plans would be too
slow and elaborate, and it was agreed that if
circumstances allowed it, emergency plans for
the quickest possible occupation of the island
—known as Operation “ Lightning ”—should
be carried out. The plans for a fully opposed
landing were, nevertheless, very carefully
examined. It should be remembered that this
operation was the first combined operation to
be undertaken in the theatre, and the import-
ance of its complete success, as affecting the
subsequent larger ones we were going to under-
exe pa very much in the minds of all con-
cerned.

161. This revised operation took the form of
a river crossing operation using combined
operations technique, by 25 Indian Division,
on ‘to the north-west corner of the island,
followed by the capture of Akyab town from
the landward side. The method to be adopted, -
and the concept of subsequent operations, may
be summarised as follows. The initial landing
was to be made by 3 Commando Brigade, half
of which was composed of Royal Marines,
mounted in the Naf River, to be followed by
74 Brigade of 25 Indian Division from Foul
Point. Full air and naval support would be
available. Meanwhile 53 Brigade of 25 Indian
Division was to clear Kudaung Island, which
lies-to the north of Akyab, and exploit to
Akyab Island and also eastwards through Ale
Chaung to Ponnagyun on the Kaladan River,
about 14 miles from its mouth. 25 Indian
Division was then to exploit success, seizing
all commanding ground on the Boronga Islands,
and on the Pauktaw Peninsula to their north.
It was then to advance by way of the rivers and
establish a base south-east of Minbya, prior
to attacking Myebon. 82 (West African) Divi-
sion, after relieving 81 (West African) Division,
was to clear the area south of Kyauktaw and
join 25 Indian Division at Minbya.

162. It must be remembered that, when the
above revised plan was decided on, our offen-
sive, though going well, was still in its early
stages. On the 21st December, when the
