of sight. If they have torpedoes they are

in a position of great advantage. HERO and

BEDOUIN ammunition almost exhausted.

1520.””

I thereupon signalled BEDOUIN :—

“ The torpedo menace must be accepted.
Enemy must be destroyed without delay.
Take KIMBERLEY, FORESTER, HERO
and PUNJABI under your orders and
organise attack sending most serviceable
destroyer first. Ram or board if necessary.
1540.”’

39. Meanwhile WARSPITE’S aircraft was
recalled and hoisted inboard and preparations
were made to carry out an indirect bombard-
ment of the ships at the head of the fiord,
should this be necessary. On its return WAR-
SPITE’S aircraft reported sinking a submarine
anchored off Bjerkvik, in Herjangs Fiord, by
Pontbing: This sinking was accepted as a
fact.

40. While I was in communication with
BEDOUIN, HERO, ICARUS and KIM-
BERLEY proceeded up Rombaks Fiord and,
as soon as the targets could be observed in the
smoke, opened fire on the destroyers at the
head of the Fiord. No reply was made, how-
ever, and fire was checked. The enemy had
abandoned the ships, of which there proved
to be three. One was already scuttled, one
sank forthwith and HERO and ICARUS sent
away a boarding party to the one remaining.
BEDOUIN, on arrival, ordered boarding par-
ties to return, and the enemy was sunk by a
torpedo from HERO. HERO states the boarded
destroyer was the HANS LUDEMANN.

41. As the destroyers had successfully dealt
with all enemy forces at the top of the Fiord,
indirect bombardment by WARSPITE was not
necessary and it was decided to return to Narvik
Bay to investigate the state of affairs there.

42. COSSACK was still grounded on a wreck
and had been under spasmodic fire from a shore
gun of small calibre. Although not definitely
located, the COSSACK silenced it by retalia-
tory fire in its direction.

FOXHOUND, standing by, had sent her
Medical Officer to COSSACK and was picking
up survivors from the German destroyer
abandoned on fire off Narvik.

43. At 1742 I made the following report of
the situation.

““WARSPITE, COSSACK and FOX-
HOUND in Narvik Bay. Little opposition.
All German destroyers sunk, three of them
after retiring up Rombaks Fiord. One sub-
marine sunk by WARSPITE’S aircraft.
Parties of men, possibly soldiers retreating
over hills. One field Howitzer silenced by
COSSACK. Enemy aircraft have been
sighted. Damage to own ships so far
Teported:_-ESKIMO bows blown off by
torpedo. COSSACK damaged and ashore in
Narvik Bay. PUNJABI one boiler out of
action, 1742.”

44. I thereupon considered the landing of a
party to occupy the town as the opposition
had apparently been silenced.

* Admiralty footnote: It has since been confirmed
that this submarine was sunk by WARSPITE’s air-
craft.

SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 3 JULY, 1947

With the force available only a small party
could be landed and to guard against the in-
evitable counter-attack it would be necessary
to keep the force concentrated close to the
water-front and to provide strong covering gun-
fire. In fact I considered it would be necessary
to keep WARSPITE off Narvik.

45. A signal was then received from FOX-
HOUND that the Officer prisoners taken had
reported the presence of several German sub-
marines in the Fiord.

46. At 1800 twelve enemy aircraft were
sighted approaching from the westward.

47. Apart from the above considerations I
felt, that, to place, at the end of a long and
strenuous day, a party of less than 200 tired
seamen and marines in the midst of a force of
not less than 2,000 professional German
soldiers, would be to court disaster, even allow-
ing for the moral effect which the day’s
engagement must have had on the enemy.

48.. The cumulative effect of the roar of
WARSPITE’S fifteen inch guns reverberating
down and around the high mountains of the
Fiord, the bursts and splashes of these great
shells, the sight of their ships sinking and burn-
ing around them must have been terrifying to
the enemy. But such an effect cannot be of
a lasting nature to the soldiers on shore, and
I felt that to be taken full advantage of, it
would thave required a trained, organised
military force, ready to land directly the Naval
engagement had ceased. If such a force had
been present, I believe that they would have
succeeded in establishing themselves so strongly
in Narvik that its eventual capture would only
be a matter of time and reinforcements.

49. I thereupon decided against keeping
WARSPITE stopped in the Fiord off Narvik,
subject to submarine and air attack.

50. At 1832 I signalled: —

“General from BC. One.* Am _ with-
drawing. KIMBERLEY is to guard
COSSACK withdrawing her if possible from
Narvik harbour. PUNJABI to guard
ESKIMO.”

51. HOSTILE (Commander J. P. Wright)
and IVANHOE (Commander P. H. Hadow),
based on Skjel Fiord, had been placed at my
disposal by your signal. I ordered these
destroyers to proceed to Narvik and reinforce
those to be stationed there. IVANHOE had
been ordered to patrol the entrance to the Fiord
and was therefore in the vicinity.

52. I proceeded down Ofot Fiord with
FOXHOUND ahead. BEDOUIN, HERO and
ICARUS followed withdrawing from Rombaks
Fiord. FORESTER was delayed embarking
the majority of ESKIMO’S crew.

53. At 1840 when close to Hamnesholm Light
(67° 25’ North 16° 36° East) FOXHOUND
obtained a submarine contact and counter-
attacked. This submarine was apparently
escaping out of Ofot Fiord. A later report
received from the Hamnesholm Lighthouse
keeper confirms this. I have since come to
the conclusion that a submarine navigating sub-
merged in the narrow waters of a fiord would
find himself in a not very enviable position
with Anti-submarine destroyers operating over-
head and his desire to get out of it is there-
fore understandable,
