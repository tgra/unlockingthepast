D.S.O., Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean.

OPERATION “TORCH ”—REPORT

OF PROCEEDINGS.

I have the honour to render the following
Teport on Operation “Torch” .covering the
period 22nd October to 17th November, 1942,
from the sailings of the assault convoy from the
United Kingdom until the occupation of Bone.
This report deals mainly with the British naval
assaults, since the naval operations of the
Western Naval Task Force have already been
teported in the Commander, Task Force 34’s
letter of 28th November, 1942 to the Com-
mander-in-Chief, United States Atlantic Fleet.*

2. The early stages of the operation prior to
D day were remarkable for lack of incident.
This was indeed fortunate since, in the course
of this vast and complex movement, delays
caused by casualties or stress of weather would
have rendered the timely delivery of the assaults
improbable.

3. The movement of the assault convoys and
Force “H” through the Straits of Gibraltar

on the S5th/6th November and the continuous
entry and: departure ofall classes of ships for
‘fuelling placed a heavy strain on the resources
and organisation of Gibraltar. The manner in
which. this strain was withstood reflects credit
on the Vice-Admiral, Gibraltar and Com-
modore Superintendent, Gibraltar and their
staffs.

4. Itis also a tribute to the skill and seaman-
ship of individual Commanding Officers that
this continuous flow of movements and berth-
ing in a congested harbour and anchorage in
the dark was accomplished with but a single
minor collision.

5. The only major incident inside -the
Mediterranean before the assaults was the
torpedoing of United States Ship THOMAS
STONE at 0535 on 7th November. A notably
courageous decision was taken by Captain
O. R. Bennehoff, United States Navy to send
on his escort and boats to the assault, leaving
his ship defenceless ; tenacity and seamanship
was displayed by His Majesty’s Ship
WISHART (Commander H. G. Scott, Royal
pee in towing United States Ship THOMAS
STONE to Algiers.

6. Reconnaissance by submarine and Folbot*
parties prior to the assaults was in the main
successfully carried out. Inshore recon-
naissance by Folbot teams had always been
viewed with misgiving as endangering security.
That these fears were well grounded was
proved at A Beach when two officers were
captured. Fortunately they kept their heads
and imparted no information concerning the
- projected operation. The work of Lieutenant-
Commander Willmott, Royal Navy, both in
