Casualties from Sicily had been less than was anticipated, and the arrangements had worked smoothly. Casualties from Italy continued to be received in Middle East, by sea an air, up to the end of October, and although at one time the shortage of hospital ships for further transportation to the United Kingdom caused some anxiety and a danger of accumulation, the facilities proved adequate. Between toth July and 7th January, forty-four hospitals and expansions amounting to 13,800 British, Dominion, Indian and African beds and 5,500 beds for convalescents were despatched from the Middle East to Italy.",
