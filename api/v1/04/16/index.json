Transports had to lie at considerable distances\u2014ro miles and more\u2014from the harbour and signal communi- cation between ship and shore was impossible. Air attacks, against which my force had no defence, complicated the operation. However disembarkation of the first flight of the force was completed on the evening of 16th April."

From the gth to 16th April, when the battle raged at full intensity, the Tactical medium fbombers were able to devote little attention to their customary railway targets; from the latter date until the 27th (when bad weather grounded the mediums for the rest of the month) the offensive was continued against Brenner line targets and a smaller effort was directed against the north-eastern routes and two bridges in southern Austria and north- west Jugoslavia. The total sorties flown by the Tactical mediums during \u2018April against railway communications amounted to 1,374 in the course of which 2,688 tons of bombs were dropped. Seventy-seven per cent. of these sorties were flown against Brenner line targets. Results of the interdiction policy during April."

As rain had already com- menced falling it was decided to abandon the Aselle road and transfer the 22nd Brigade effort to the Moggo-Adamitullo road where it was hoped the going was better. Steps were taken to repair the bridges blown by the enemy on that road, and by 24th April 22nd Brigade were advancing south of Ponte Machi."

The remaining nine ships, with most of the escort, continued their \u201cpassage. .The delay had probably disorganis\u00e9d to some extent the German arrangements for attack, but the convoy was sighted by enemy aircraft on 13th April and attacked by U-boats east of Bear Island on 16th April, one ship being sunk."

            "description": "238. While Yamethin was being finally cleared, an armoured column and 161 Brigade Group had advanced and contacted the enemy on the 15th, astride the road and railway on the general line of the Sinthe Chaung, 27 miles from Yamethin and three miles north of Shwemyo. While this portion of the enemy was being subjected to successful air strikes which caused them heavy casualties, an armoured column operating west of the road and railway crossed the Sinthe Chaung and broke into Shwemyo itself, which it completely cleared the same day (16th April). Meanwhile the engineers, though harassed by enemy artillery fire from the Shwemyo Bluff, bridged the Sinthe north of Shwemyo and bulldozed a by-pass over difficult ground. This enabled 161 Brigade Group to outflank the Japanese positions north of the town, and harbour south of it for the night 16th-17th. In their efforts to establish a bridgehead across the Sinthe Chaung the next day, however, this Brigade was held up."

Stocks held amounted to 1,000,000 gallons of petrol and 89,000 gallons of lubricants. By the 28th March production was at the rate of 1,100,000 gallons of spirit per month which was likely to rise to 1,600,000 gallons by the 16th April and 2,000,000 gallons by the first week in May. Requirements were estimated at 1,300,000 gallons a month. Provided the oilfields could be held the petrol and oil situation was satisfactory."
