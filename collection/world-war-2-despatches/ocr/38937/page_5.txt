SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

. be possible to rely on Eighth Army, assaulti
across the Straits of Messina, niet that would
depend on what shape it was in after the Sici-

lian campaign. It would be better to have

fresh forces available for exploitation, if at all
possible, and our two spare Corps Head-
quarters, of 5 and ro Corps, could plan the

operation, since Eighth Army was not in a

Position to do so. It was therefore proposed

to study two operations, both to be mounted

from North Africa: against Reggio by 10 Corps

(Operation BUTTRESS) and against Cotrone*

by 5 Corps (Operation GOBLET). These two

headquarters came under my command on 5th

June, together with one armoured and four

infantry divisions.t The Cotrone landing was

intended to hasten the capture of the airfields
in that area, the only useful ones in Calabria,
and would take place about a month after
the original landing. Target dates were rst

September and 1st October respectively. The

operation against Sardinia (Operation BRIM-

STONE), only to be undertaken if success on

the mainland appeared unlikely, was entrusted

_ to the United States Fifth Army under General
Mark W. Ciark. He was ordered on roth June

to prepare a plan for this operation, employ-

ing VI United States Corps of two infantry
divisions and the British 5 Corps, composed
as for the Cotrone landing. General Giraudt
on 15th June was asked, and agreed, to nomi-

nate a commander and staff to prepare a plan’

for the capture of Corsica (Operation FIRE-
BRAND). I kept in touch with all this plan-
ning activity for. operations which, if mounted,
I should be required to command, but could
do little more since this -was now the critical
Period just before the Sicily invasion.

A clearer conception of the detailed implica-
tions of future operations is Set out in a memo-
randum from the Executive Planning Section of
Allied Force Headquarters dated 30th June.
This represents the stage to which Allied
strategic thought and planning had deen
brought before the actual experience of the in-
vasion of Sicily alleen modification in a more
optimistic direction. @ possibility of such a
future modification is fully realised in the open-
ing paragraph: experience alone would show the
value of the Italian forces, the extent.to which
Germany was prepared to reinforce Italy and
what Allied resources, particularly in landing
craft, would still be available and when. In
the circumstances appreciation of Allied capa-
bilities could scarcely be over sanguine.
Exploitation into Calabria was estimated as
likely to be slow, since the first assaulting force
was not expected to be within striking dis-
tance of Cotrone, only eighty air miles: from
the original landing point, by the end of the
first month and a subsidiary landing was there-
fore planned to seize that port thirty days
after the original Janding. Even if these two
operations should be successful the terrain and
the weather were likely to offer severe difficul-
ties to our advance, while the number of land-
ing craft available would be so diminished as

a result of them that further amphibious
operations on a scale large enough to seize
a major port such as Naples or Taranto would
be impracticable. The maximum number of
divisions we could maintain in Calabria was
reckoned as six. There were, therefore, now
two reasons for invading Sardinia: one, if it
was decided that resistance on the mainland
would be so strong as to make any landing
impracticable, and the second if it was appre-
ciated that, though a landing could be made,
the result would be to lock up six divisions in
the Toe of Italy without prospect of being able
to exploit rapidly either towards Naples or
Taranto. I was, however, most reluctant to
be forced back into so unproductive a course.

More optimistic possibilities were, of course,
considered, based on the possibility of an
Italian “* collapse’, a term never specifically
defined. It was the view of the Joint Intelli-
gence Committee that, although Italian morale,
both civilian and military, was then low and
would sink still further as a result of the loss
of Sicily, no complete collapse was likely until
the Allied forces had landed on the mainland
and had made a considerable advance north-
wards.* However, it was necessary to be
prepared for such an eventuality. If Italian
Tesistance ceased, our aim was to move rapidly
overland on Naples with the minimum force
necessary to seize the airfields and port, to
build up our forces to a strength of six divi-
sions and forty-three squadrons of the Tactical
Air Force and then to exploit: to seize Rome.
Subsequent operations could be either into
North Italy or across the Adriatic. The timing
envisaged on the ‘‘ most optimistic '’ develop-
ment, which gave us Naples by rst October,
hit on the right day with an accuracy rare in
the forecasts of the best inspired oracles. On
the timing considered more likely, that date
would see us just assaulting Cotrone and, in
the worst case, we should be just appearing off
the coast of Sardinia.

Effect on Planning of the Progress of Opera-
tions in Sicily.

The result of the first few days fighting in
Sicily brought a breath of actuality into the
process of planning, hitherto tentative and
tather academic, and with it a full gale of
optimism. Two of the questions which had
dominated previous p! were answered:
what was the value of the Italian forces on
their own soil and what would remain of our
own resources after the reduction of Sicily.
Both answers were more favourable than we
could have hoped. The Italian coastal divi-
sions, whose value had never been rated very
high, disintegrated almost without firing a
shot and the field divisions, where they were
met, were also driven like chaff before the
wind. Mass surrenders were frequent. More-
over, the civilian population seemed well dis-
posed and, when once we were firmly estab-
lished, were prepared to welcome the Allies as
liberators. On the other hand our casualties
in men and equipment, and particularly in
the all-important categories of landing craft and
assault’ equipment generally, were much
lighter than had ‘been expected. We were,
however, fully prepared -to exploit this

*This was a correct reading of popular feeling,
which was marked by complete apathy and inertia, but
had failed to allow for a ‘‘ palace revolution ”.
