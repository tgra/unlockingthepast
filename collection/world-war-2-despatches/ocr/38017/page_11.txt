SUPPLEMENT To taz LONDON

41. Meantime the Vice Admiral, Dover, had
been much exercised regarding the possibility
of the continued use of Dunkirk Harbour for
personnel vessels and’ was anxiously awaiting
the report from VANQUISHER, who had been
sent to investigate the reported obstruction.
VANQUISHER’S report was received at o6r0
stating entrance was practicable but that
obstruction exists towards outer inside end of
the Eastern Aqn. Pending amplifying reports,
the sailing of personnel vessels to Dunkirk was
resumed, although at this time there were still
4 personnel vessels presumed to be in the
vicinity of Dunkirk Harbour, whose movements
and whereabouts throughout the night still
remained obscure.

The Vice Admiral asked R.A. Dover, who
was in HEBE, whether personnel ships could,
in fact, still use Dunkirk. In the meantime a
series of signals from Rear Admiral, Dover,
and destroyers off the coast, were received,
stating that the beaches were filling up rapidly
and more ships and boats were urgently required
there. Although it was known that the
destroyers could use Dunkirk, it appeared at
this time that the best division of transport was
to send the great majority of destroyers to the
beaches, where urgent demands could not be
ignored, and the personnel vessels to Dunkirk
Harbour, only an occasional destroyer being
sent to Dunkirk from the reduced number now
available for the operation.

42. At Dunkirk there were no air attacks in
the early morning and all was quiet. Later,
when ships began to arrive in quantity, in view
of the massive target presented by a number of
ships alongside the East Pier at a time, the
S.N.O. Dunkirk ordered destroyers alongside
only one at a time. At about o800 a store ship
arrived at Dunkirk with provisions but no
water, This caused so much congestion on the
pier that unloading was abandoned when half
complete, and the store ship filled with troops.
A certain amount of water was obtained from
destroyers.

43. During the forenoon the Military con-
structed a long pier of lorries with deck
planking, into the sea off Bray. This was an
excellent piece of work, but was insufficiently
stable for use by such craft as paddle steamers,
nor even smaller power craft in a lop. It was
invaluable later for embarking troops into small
boats. As regards general embarkation off the
beaches, it was later learnt that it was a com-
mon occurrence for processions of small boats
loaded with troops to be cast adrift when
empty and allowed to float away to seaward,
owing to the lack of sufficient naval ratings as
boat-keepers. For the same reason many of
the smaller pulling boats were swamped and
sunk due to overloading by uncontrolled
“rush ’’ of soldiers. Both these faults were
remedied later.

44. Matters proceeded smoothly throughout
the day owing to the mist and there being a
big smoke cloud over Dunkirk which prevented
the enemy bombers attacking the ships in large
numbers.

In order to increase the rate of embarkation
through the bottleneck of the East Pier gang-
way, the troops were urged to quicken their
pace and eventually thousands of troops, tired
and without food and water for days, broke into
the double and kept it up the whole length of
the pier for more than two hours.

45. The attempt to maintain an adequate rate
of lift using only the older destroyers was by
now shown to be impracticable. The destroyers
were lifting about 17,000, personnel vessels
about 9,500 in the 24 hours. Remaining vessels
were estimated to be worth about 15,000 per
day. This gave a total lift of about 43,000 per
day. The situation called for a lift of at least
55,000 per day. Verbal representations being
made to the rst Sea Lord, authority was received
for the return to the Dover Command of the
modern destroyers released the night before.

Accordingly Commander-in-Chief, Nore, at
1531 gave orders to HARVESTER, HAVANT,
IVANHOE, IMPULSIVE, ICARUS and
INTREPID to proceed at once to Dunkirk,
Subsequently some of these destroyers were
diverted to the beaches.

46. Arrangements for the final evacuation of
the Rearguard of the B.E.F. During the fore-
noon representatives of the Commander-in-
Chief of the B.E.F, and staff attended a con-
ference with the Vice Admiral.

The Military officers explained the Com-
mander-in-Chief’s plan and gave daylight on
Saturday, Ist June, as the latest reasonable date
up to which the B.E.F. might be expected to
hold the eastern perimeter, the size of the
corresponding force ‘being about 4,000.

‘By that date and time the Vice Admiral knew
that he should be in possession of ocean-going
tugs, ships’ lifeboats and ships’ power life-
boats which he could specially reserve for the
climax of this critical operation. Accordingly,
agreement was reached on the following:—

(2) That evacuation should proceed with
the utmost vigour to ensure that by o130 on
1st June, the British Forces ashore should
have been reduced to the rear guard of
4,000.

(b) That special boats and tugs should be
accumulated and held aside to ensure them
being available in the early hours of rst

une.

(c) That the plan should provide for lifting
a rear guard of 4,000, plus R.N. beach
parties, in one or more flights between o130
and 0300 on the ist June.

(a) Final decision based on the progress of
the evacuation of the main body to be made
by the Vice Admiral at 1400 on Friday, 31st
May, as to the possibility of adhering to the
plan.

Other technical details were settled at the meet-
ing and the Military staff were given the assur-
ance that the ever increasing rate of lifting
showed every promise of enabling an affirma-
tive decision to ibe given at the critical hour
of 1400/31st May. After the conference the
Military officers communicated the plan both to
the ‘War Office and the Commander-in-Chief,
B.EF.

47. Remarks. The organisation of traffic to
and from the beaches was recovering from the
setback it had received when all resources had
to be thrown upon the beaches and Dunkirk
Harbour when the outflanking and forcing back
of the B.E.F. was thought to be imminent con-
sequent upon the surrender of the Belgian
forces, Furthermore, a number of organised,
and freelance groups of small power boats,
were commencing to arrive off the coast, who,
by seizing the abandoned and drifting pulling
boats, were able to do much to increase the
rate of lifting from the ‘beaches,
