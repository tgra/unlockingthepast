SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 20 OCTOBER, 1948

107. Here my practice of sharing actively.
and frequently in the fighter operations stood
me in good stead. Trying to shoot down a mis-
sile travelling at six miles a minute while fly-
ing at the same speed and a height of perhaps
a thousand feet across a narrow belt of undu-
lating country bounded by balloons and guns
was a business whose subileties were not readily
appreciable from an office chair, I found that
a practical acquaintance with this business had
its uses. Not only did it help me to acquire
a fund of tactical knowledge that I could hardly
have gained in any other way; above all it
enabled me to talk on a basis of common
understanding and endeavour with the pilots
whose devotion it was my task to foster.

To8. An incidental advantage of the abolition
of the inland gun-belt was that it gave the
searchlights, which remained when the guns
had gone, more scope to assist night fighters.
Another unlooked-for benefit of the move was
that it brought the headquarters of the A.A.
Batteries close to the bases from which’ our
fighters were operating. Immediate and per-
sonal contact between Battery Commanders
and Station Commanders suddenly became pos-
sible and even easy. I found during my first
visits to stations after the move that advantage
was not always being taken of this proximity.
I was shown—as I had been shown for the
last five weeks—aircraft whose pilots alleged
that the guns had fired at them; I was shown
marks of damage said to have been thus in-
flicted, and fragments of shell-casing which
appeared to have entered aircraft or fallen on
airfields. In each case I suggested that the
Station Commander concerned should pocket
the more portable of these exhibits and, armed
with this evidence, go and discuss his griev-
ances, real or imaginary, with the local Battery
‘Commander.

Iog. The hint was taken. The consequences
were profound and striking. As a result of
these meetings between Station and Battery
Commanders, the first requisite of understand-
ing between two parties whose interests must
occasionally conflict—the realisation that the
other side also has a viewpoint—was attained.
The mists of suspicion whose gathering had
troubled me so much were dispersed almost
overnight. -On subsequent visits to the same
stations I was again shown aircraft that had
suffered minor damage from anti-aircraft fire.
But this time, instead of having to listen to
grievances against the ners, I was told of
pilots who had flouted discipline and good
sense by venturing too near the guns. In short,
pilots and gunners were beginning to under-
stand one another’s problems and work to-
gether. Unity was restored. The process
reached its climax towards the close of the
main attack. Flying towards the south coast
on the 28th August, I could see over Romney
Marsh a wall of black smoke marking the posi-
tion of the ‘‘ Diver ’’ barrage. From time to
time a fresh salvo would be added to repair
the slow erosion of the wind. On the far side
of the barrage fighters were shooting down
flying bombs into the Channel; on the nearer
side more fighters waited on its fringe to pounce
on the occasional bomb that got so far. The
whole was as fine a spectacle of co-operation
as any commander could wish to see.

110. That day 97 bombs approached these
shores. The defences brought down go* and
only four reached London.

rz. Some weeks before this the fact that
we were gaining mastery over the flying bomb
had become clear to ourselves and also to the
Germans. During the second week after the
re-deployment of the guns, the defences brought
down a higher proportion of the bombs that
came within their compass than in any previous
week; and only a little more than a quarter of
the total got to London.

112. In the following week there was a spell
of bad weather, and the fighters did not do so
well; but the gunners, whom this factor affected
much less, again did better than before. For
the first time since the beginning of the attack
they maintained a higher rate of destruction
than the fighters over a full week. About this
time the Meteor, our first jet-propelled fighter,
came into service, and I decided to match jet
against jet by trying it out against the flying
bomb. At first only a few of these aircraft
were available, and various problems, includ-
ing that of limited endurance, had to be over-
come before we could get the full benefit out
of the Meteor’s great speed.

113. As the month went by, all concerned

‘gained further experience and new equipment

began to yield results. Soon the overall per-
formance of the defences, and that of the gun-
ners in particular, surpassed all previous
achievements. In the middle of August we
reached the stage of beingsure that, whatever the
weather, we could bring down from one-half to
three-quarters of all the bombs that approached
this island. Indeed, it has been calculated
that during the last three weeks of this phase
only one out of every seven bombs that the
enemy launched actually reached London.
Shortly afterwards the enemy High Command
permitted the publication in the German press
of the significant pronouncement that the Allies
had found a counter-measure to the flying
bomb, In the last few days of August only
an occasional bomb eluded the defences and
got through to its target. Thus it is fair to
claim that almost complete ascendancy over
this novel and ingenious weapon had been
gained when, at the beginning of September,
the capture of the launching areas by our

Armies ended the main attack. .

from Holland (9th July to 5th September).

114. Meanwhile, as early as the 8th July,
flying bombs had started to approach London
from a new direction, namely from the east.
No launching sites were known to exist in
Belgium; and after a few weeks it was estab-
lished that these bombs, which came only at
night, were being launched by specially-
equipped He. 111 aircraft operating wholly or
mainly from bases in Holland.
