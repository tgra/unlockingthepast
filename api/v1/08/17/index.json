            "description": "A critical shortage of artillery ammunition was among the other difficulties of this period. To a force which relied so much on artillery, the only effective superiority we possessed for a campaign in an Italian winter, this was a most serious matter, the more so as it was not an isolated phenomenon but a world-wide shortage both on the British and United States side. It had naturally been aggravated by our hea expenditure during the ‘“‘ Gothic” line battles. The root cause, however, as I was informed by a signal from the War Office on 17th August, was a reduction in ammunition production all over the Allied-controlled world. This was a condition of affairs which could not hastily be improved and, although I was on 20th October authorized to draw on the Supreme Allied Commander’s reserve up to the full extent which the operational situation might necessitate, there was a serious danger that not only would current operations be severely limited but there might not be sufficjient stocks on hand for the spring offensive. I drew this conclusion in a letter to General Wilson on 13th November: .",

            "description": "The military situation on 16th August was thus clearly defined. The final decisions as to the manner of the invasion of the Italian mainland in Calabria and at Salerno had been taken and the planning of the operation was in an advanced stage. On the next day we received the news that the political situation had once more undergone a sudden change. On 15th August a General Castellano, of the Italian Commando Supremo,* presented himself at the British Embassy in Madrid; he was travelling under an assumed name as a civil servant and had no written credentials but he claimed to be an accredited representative of Marshal Badoglio and bearer of a message on the latter’s behalf. The Marshal stated that when the Allies invaded Italy the Italian Government wasprepared to order the immediate cessation of hostilities against the Allies and to join them forthwith, with all available forces, in the fight against Germany. This was the news we had been awaiting since 25th July, when Mussolini fell. The delay had been caused, not by any reluctance to accept the formula of ‘‘ unconditional surrender,’’ ‘but because Badoglio was anxious to establish himself firmly in power and also because this was the first good opportunity which had presented itself to get in touch with the Allies unknown to the Germans. The cover employed was that Castellano was going to Lisbon as one of the party sent to meet the Italian ambassador returning from Chile. However, the date was well chosen since Mr. Churchill and Mr. Roosevelt were at that moment conferring in Quebec, accompanied by the Combined Chiefs of Staff. They were able, therefore, immediately they were notified from Madrid of this new development, to direct General Eisenhower, in a signal received on 17th August, to send two representatives to Lisbon where a further meeting with Castellano had been arranged at the British Embassy. The two emissaries, Generals Smith and Strong, Chief of Staff and Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2,f of Allied Force Headquarters, left on 18th August and returned to Algiers on the zoth.",

Any feasible short term measures for expansion were als) to be examined, and an account of these as well as the results of the examination by the Long Term Planning Committee will be found in Part III. On the 17th August, my Quarter Master General’s Staff (Transportation Directorate) produced two documents on the provision of Transportation Stores in India for 1944-45.
