SUPPLEMENT to tazE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 AUGUST, 1948

35. 2230 to 2350.—Force W was searched
for by two flare-dropping aircraft.

36, At about 2315 I received a signal from
Vice-Admiral, Malta reporting 2 enemy cruisers
and 4 destroyers leaving Palermo at 2125. This
report necessitated an immediate decision
whether to reinforce Force X by sending one
or both of the cruisers in Force W. My reasons
for not doing so were:—

(i) I did not consider the Italian force
would go west and attack the convoy by
night, or that

(ii) they would go into the area in which
the convoy would be by the following dawn,
as I have always understood the Italians
avoid this area owing to the danger of air
attack from Malta.

(iii) Judging from past encounters with the
Italians, the convoy escort was large enough
to deter them from doing any harm to the
convoy, and, with the added danger of air
attack, they would keep clear. The original
intention was that Force X should consist
only of destroyers. I had the CATRO added.

(iv) Force W would, by dawn on 5th
June, still be only 130 miles from the air
base in Sardinia, which is within easy striking
distance. Also, torpedo bomber attack dur-
ing the night was quite probable. EAGLE

and ARGUS would be extremely vulnerable

without the gun support of the cruisers.

{v) By midnight Force W was 162 miles
from where the convoy would be by day-
light and cruisers would, to be of any use,
have to average about 24 knots on courses
which included a stretch of quite tricky navi-
gation, in itself a hazardous undertaking-
With the force available, a decision either

way was a gamble. If the LIVERPOOL had
been present there would have been no doubt
in my mind.

Monday, 15th June.

37. Force W was shadowed continuously but
only two very half-hearted approaches by
torpedo bombing aircraft were made. One
SM.79 was shot down by Hurricanes and other
aircraft were chased away.

38. 1600 to 1700.—Reports indicated that
the Italian surface ships were retiring north-
wards and at 0130/16 these ships were reported
near Marittimo still going north.

Tuesday, 16th June.

39. 0800.—Having taken Force’ W clear of
air attack, I ordered MALAYA, ARGUS,
WISHART, WRESTLER, VIDETTE and
ESCAPADE at 0850 to Gibraltar and remained
in KENYA with EAGLE, CHARYBDIS,
ONSLOW and ICARUS in a position from
which I could cover the,oiling of Force X from
BROWN RANGER if required further east on
the 17th or 18th. EAGLE’s escort was short
of fuel and at 17r0 I decided to send her to
Gibraltar with ONSLOW and ICARUS to com-
plete with fuel and be ready to sail agam if
fequired.

Wednesday, 17th June. +

40. Force X, still being intermittently
bombed, was met at 2017, and I returned to
Gibraltar with them. 4

41. Reports of the proceedings of Force X’

while detached are being forwarded direct to
Admiralty by CAIRO.*

Remarks. vae

42. Merchant ships.—The ships in convoy
behaved in an exemplary manner dunng
periods of attack, but the fact that the convoy
could not be relied on to keep station at more
than 124 knots added to the difficulties of keep-
ing up to tme. With the limitations imposed
by darkness on the last 36 hours’ run every
Tevolution counted.

43. Motor Launches.—I consider the deter-
mination of the Captains and crews of these
boats worthy of high praise. They had ample
excuse for turning back, yet not one of them
did so and all arrived safely. They had a
few very close shaves with bombs and one
torpedo when dropped very nearly landed on
one of them.

44. Fighters —The number of fighters in the
air never exceeded 6 Hurricanes and 2 Fulmars.
This number is quite madequate and the
Hurricane is not sufficiently strongly armed to
deal with types such as the JU.88. Twenty
fighters armed with cannon in the air would
‘have made a vast difference.

The achievements of the pilots of EAGLE
were magnificent while the ground staff deserve
high praise for the way in which they managed
to keep aircraft in the air in excess of the
numbers it had been thought possible to
operate. t

45. Forces employed.—If further operations
of this nature are undertaken, interference by
surface craft must now be considered as prob-
able between the time of the main force parting
company and the arrival of the convoy at
Malta.

On this assumption there should be sufficient

- ships in Force X to deal with surface attack,
leaving the Fighter Directing Ship and some

A.A, screen with the convoy.

Further it is essential to have only really
reliable fast ships in the convoy. This will
very materially increase the chances.of success.

46. I cannot speak too highly of the conduct ©

of all ships under my command. Many were
sorely tried and none found wanting. CAIRO
and the destroyers of Force X, and EAGLE
and LIVERPOOL were outstanding I saw as
many of the ships of my force as I could at
Gybraltarbefore sailing, and greatly admired the
spirit and enthusiasm I found. I know how
pleased they must have been to receive Their
Lordships’ signal of congratulations.

appendix to this despatch

+ The 16 Hurricanes and 6 Fulmars operated by
HM Ships EAGLE and ARGUS shot down 13 and
damaged at least 11 Itahan and German aircraft on
the 13th, 14th and r5th June, 1942. This was no
mean achievement, especially in view of the persistence
of the enemy air attacks and the fact that 1t was not
possible to mamta more than four Hurnecanes (six
for short periods) and two Fulmars im the air at a time

Our total fighter losses from all causes were three
Hurncanes and four Fulmars, few of which were lost
1m air combat
