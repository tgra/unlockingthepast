            "description": "rx. The first hostile move by the Iraq forces occurred on 30th April, when two infantry brigades of the Iraq Army, supported by Artillery and some armoured cars, began concentrating around Habbaniya and training their guns on the Camp, thereby constituting a direct threat to the British Cantonment there. A demand for the withdrawal of these troops was refused by the Iraqi Commander, who stated that no normal training was to be carried out from Habbaniya, and that fire would be opened on aircraft or troops leaving the Camp. Hostilities broke out on 2nd May and the Royal Air Force station was shelled inter- mittently until 5th May. The Camp was also bombed and machine-gunned by the Iraqi Air Force. The Royal Air Force bombed the Iraqi Positions gcoring many direct hits on their guns, armoured cars and machine gun posts. During this period also the Royal Air Force, despite the fact that the aerodrome was often under heavy fire, successfully evacuated by air to Basra a large number of women and children, who had been sent from Baghdad to Habbaniya when the situation at the former place became threatening. (The remainder of the British population of Baghdad were accom- modated either in the British Embassy or the American Legation throughout the period of Operations.)"

It was considered that the submarine sical did not warrant the risk of LORRAINE taking part in Operation \u2018\u2018 Jupiter,\u2019 and DUQUESNE and the pens, \u2018only took part. DUQUESNE had previously embarked at Casablanca a full outfit of ammunition for herself and replenishments for the destroyers, and the assault on the Ile d\u2019Oleron was carried out on 30th April with the French ships bom- barding gun batteries and other targets throughout the day. Twenty-four L.C.V. (P) were used as lift for assaulting troops and by nightfall all the southern portion of the island was in French hands, and only one of the L.C.V. (P) was lost."

The enemy positions at Jefna were particularly strong and \u2018before they could be grappled with there were many outlying positions, on the hills either side of the road, which had to be cleared. Manteuffel\u2019s parachutists fought as well as usual and by 2nd May we were still held up at the immediate approaches to Jefna, though to the north we had outflanked it by some three miles. Heavy fighting continued on 1 Infantry Division front both on Gebel Sidi Meftah and to the north of it but in anti- cipation of its fall IE Corps were now bringing up x Armoured Division to operate on the ex- treme right of the Corps in the valley of the Qued et Tine. This valley leads direct to Mateur; no road follows it but it is practicable for armour once the left flank is freed by secur- ing Gebel Sidi Meftah. 78 Division to the east of the Oued had gained ground north of Gebel Ahmera and north-east of Heidous. On 30th April 34 Division scored its most note- worthy success with the capture of Gebel Tahent (Point 609). This commanding dome- shaped hill, east-north-east of Sidi Nsir, was defended by parachutists from the Barenthin Regiment, perhaps the best German troops in Africa. :"

            "description": "78. The Air Force station at Habbaniyah lies on low ground near the River Euphrates, and is completely overlooked and commanded by high ground to the west between the station and Lake Habbaniyah. This ground is 150 ft. high and only some 1,000 yards from \u2018the station. The small force of levies at Habbaniyah was quite insufficient to occupy this high ground, on which the Iraqi mechanized force of approximately a brigade, with several batteries and a number of tanks and armoured cars, in- stalled itself on 30th April. While the Ambas- sador at Baghdad was trying to secure the withdrawal of this Iraqi force by diplomatic means, its numbers were increased, till by the evening of Ist May, the total was about 11 battalions with some 50 guns, over 9,000 men in all. Their attitude became so threatening that the Air Officer Commanding Iraq, Air Vice-Marshal Smart, decided that it was essen- tial to attack these troops without further warn- ing. Accordingly, in the early morning of and May, an improvised air force, made up mainly from the machines in the training school attacked the Iraqi forces. It was hoped that the effect of air bombing might shake the morale of the Iraqi troops and cause them to withdraw. The attacks did not, however, have the desired effect, the Iraqis finding good con- cealment in broken ground and maintaining their positions, although the ultimate result of this bombing must have contributed to their subsequent defeat and further air attacks on reserves prevented effective reinforcement."

            "description": "New Zealand troops which had been landed in Crete by the infantry of the 6th Division, so as to enable the 6th Australian Division and the New Zealand Division to be reorganized, in Palestine and Egypt respectively, as soon as possible. During the early part of May, how- ever, the Royal Navy was fully engaged in the operations necessary for the passage of the convoy mentioned in para. 51 above through the Mediterranean, and was unable to provide the necessary escorts for any large shipping movements between Crete and Egypt. Later, it became obvious that there would be no time to effect reliefs before the German attack developed and that it would be necessary to meet that attack with the troops already in Crete and to defer any question of relief until the German attack had been repulsed. Further, the German attacks on shipping to Crete were so intensive as to make it difficult and dan- gerous for shipping to approach the island. I visited Crete on 30th April and placed Major- General Freyberg in command. I instructed him to organize the defence of the island with the troops available and with such additional resources as I was able to send him from Egypt."

This anxiety was also shared by the Senior Officers of the other services, There was the proba- bility of heavy air attack at any moment and the possibility of an attempt to take Crete and, interference by enemy surface forces. I therefore proposed sailing G.A.15 via Kaso p-m. 2oth April\u2019 or a.m. 30th April after the final evacuation on the night of 28th/zgth. The route through the Kaso Strait was selected as interference from \u2018Italian forces and attack by the German air force was less likely and cover by the battleships possible. This course of action was approved i in your o917/ 28th and 1444/28th April."
