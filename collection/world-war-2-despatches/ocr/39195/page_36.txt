attempt ended in complete disaster. Thirty-
six vessels were intercepted and sunk by our
light naval forces. Four actually got through,
but were sunk on the return trip with all hands.
By the 15th February, all organised resistance
on Ramree Island had ceased, but mopping up
continued for some time.

193. Earlier, on the 25th January, I had
issued orders to the Commander, 15 Indian
Corps, extending his tasks in accordance with
be has been discussed earlier in paragraph
186.

I directed him now to: —
(@ Clear the Japanese out of Northern
and Central Arakan.
(b) Establish a bridgehead at Taungup.
(c) Open the road from Taungup to Prome
if possible.
(@) Develop the air bases at Akyab and
Kyaukpyu.
The last task had precedence over the others
and I laid down that their accomplishment was
not to interfere with this commitment.

As already pointed out, the construction had
to include both fair-weather airfields to meet
our present needs, and all-weather fields to
allow air supply to continue during the
monsoon. These requirements not unnaturally
conflicted. The target for all-weather con-
struction was accommodation for three trans-
port squadrons at Akyab by the end of April
and three at Kyaukpyu by mid-May. In fact
we managed to get three squadrons working
from all-weather bases in each place in early
May. The fair-weather bases were wanted as
early as possible and by the 20th March there
were two transport squadrons working from
Akyab, with two more eleven days later. During
April, half a squadron operated from Kyaukpyu
for the supply of troops in Arakan only. I
make no apology for going into this matter
of airfields in some detail, as the responsibility
for their construction, as of the great majority
of the others in the theatre, rested with the
Army, as did their stocking and subsequent
supply. 2

194. It will be noticed that in the instructions
given in the preceding paragraph, the Com-
mander, 15 Indian Corps, was ordered to open
the Taungup—Prome road if possible. This
looked an attractive-enough project on the map,
as it appears to give direct access from the
sea to the Irrawaddy Valley. In practice, how-
ever, it was a very doubtful proposition. It
was only a fair-weather road, the greater
part passing through the thickest bamboo
jungle. Taungup, the sea terminal, was no
port, merely a village up a narrow winding
creek, ‘with a landing place on a bend in the
creek. Ships bringing supplies would have to
anchor a long way off and the passage up the
creeks would be made by lighters and other
harbour craft. The latter ‘were not available
in the quantity required, after the needs of
Akyab and Ramree had been met. The road
itself required very extensive engineer work and
the time factor alone precluded the road paying
any dividend before the monsoon ; moreover
unless the road was made all-weather before
the rains, it would be closed for the whole
period of the monsoon. . In actual: fact, our
troops did not pass over this road until after
tthe 1945 monsoon. Finally, if the road was

to be opened, the operations necessary to do
this in a reasonable time had to be given some
air supply ; this we could not do.

195. By early February, the Japanese main
forces had been split up into two groups. The
Northern Group was in the Dalet Chaung—An
area, covering the An Pass. The Southern
Group was in the Taungup area, covering the
Taungup Pass. The enemy also had troops
in the Sandoway area, in the Bassein delta,
and in the Prome—Henzada area, which were
within reach of the Arakan front. Our own
troops at this time (early February) were located
as follows. 25 Indian Division was engaged
on the general line Kangaw—Myebon, with 82
(West African) Division driving the enemy
south on to this line. 3 Commando Brigade
was concentrated in Myebon, after five weeks
hard fighting. 26 Indian Division, with 22
(East African) Brigade under command, was
clearing up Ramree Island, and, in addition,
raiding the Japanese road communications
between the An Chaung and Taungup, with a
view to ascertaining the intentions of the
Japanese garrison in that area.

196. As indicated above, the operations of
15 Indian Corps were directed, not merely to
clearing Arakan, but to containing the enemy
and to preventing them from crossing the
Yomas and interfering with the advance of
Fourteenth Army. It was, by this time, almost
certain that the Japanese were using the An
Pass road and that they intended to withdraw
their Northern Group (54 Division) by that
route. General Christison’s task was, there-
fore, to frustrate this plan, and, also, to threaten
the Taungup Pass to prevent the enemy’s
Southern Group (55 Division) being diverted
to fight Fourteenth Army. this task, the
R.A.F. were to assist by intensive bombing of
the Taungup—Prome road with the object of
producing landslides in certain vulnerable
mountain sections of it. I may add here that
this was successfully achieved, the road being
rendered impassable for long periods.

197. My intention was that 15 Indian Corps
should destroy 54 Japanese Division in the An
area and contain 55 Japanese Division by
thrusting inland from Taungup on the axis of
the Taungup-Prome road. Unfortunately, as
will appear later, the,plan to destroy 54 Japan-
ese Division had in the end to be abandoned
owing to shortage of transport aircraft.
Encircling operations—the only type which
could sucessfully destroy the enemy in the thick
Arakan jungle country—were only possible if
supplied. by air, which would enable our forces
to be independent of a land L. of C.

198. General Christison decided first to
destroy the Northern Group, in the Dalet
Chaung—An area, by a pincer movement of 25
and 82 Divisions, then to eliminate the
Southern Group, in the Taungup area, by a
similar pincer movement of 82 (West African)
Division from the north and 26 Indian Divi-
sion from the coast. The exploitation up the
Prome road could then follow. To ease the
maintenance problem and assist the vital build-
up of air bases, 81 (West African) Division and
50 Tank Brigade (less two squadrons) were to
leave Arakan at once, and a provisional pro-
gramme for the evacuation of other formations
was prepared. co
