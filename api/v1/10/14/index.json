            "description": "* 98. On 14th October, 1944, that is as soon as the deployment was complete, a decision was taken about providing winter quarters in the area. Events at the approaches to Germany had shown that the war was likely to continue through the winter; and the extreme wetness . of the autumn weather made living conditions in the already marshy land extremely uncom- fortable. The Mixed batteries were offered the opportunity of leaving the. Strip for better quarters inland but unanimously they asked to remain."

The weather did not permit; rain was continuous and of extraordinary violence, paralysing any movement in the plains. In the higher ground on the left the effect was not so sefious and Io Indian Division was able to exploit its bridge- head over the Fiumicino and to capture on 7th October Monte Farneto. This started a series of manceuvres which were to characterize the next period: ground was gained on the left flank in order to turn from there the series of Tiver lines. It was natural that this policy should commend itself to General McCreery, for he had recently been operating with very small forces in these mountains. while commanding ro Corps, and had found them less of an obstacle to an advance than the continuous water lines of the deceptively attractive plains. The Germans were also surprised by our successes here and moved across 29 Panzer Grenadier Division to this sector from north of Route 9.
