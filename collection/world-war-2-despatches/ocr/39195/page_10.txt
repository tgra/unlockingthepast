1890

268 Indian Brigade (Brigadier G. M. Dyer)
now consisted of six battalions, The two lead-
ing battalions, advancing from the Chindwin,
via Pantha, reached Indaw and an area 15
miles to the east-north-east by the 15th Decem-
ber. They then pushed on a further 20 miles,
through the Japanese advanced elements, and
occupied two villages east of the escarpment,
thereby blocking the road south-west from
Pinlebu. The remainder of the Brigade crossed
the Chindwin and followed up this advance,
operating in the gap between 2 British and 19
Indian Divisions. It was transferred back to 33
Corps on the 26th December.

38. 19 Indian ‘Division (Major-General T. W.
Rees) advanced from the Sittaung bridgehead,
through Wuntho. 62 Brigade, advancing
rapidly from the bridgehead, occupied Pinlebu
on the 17th December after overcoming some
opposition along the escarpment nine miles
west-south-west of Pinlebu. Wuntho, on the
Myitkyina-Mandalay railway, was reached on
the 19th, and Kawlin on the 20th December.
Further north, 64° Brigade, passing through
Pinbon on the 15th December, made a rapid
advance of over 60 miles in seven days and
occupied Banmauk on the 17th, making con-
tact with 36 British Division and thus estab-
lishing a continuous front with Northern Com-
bat Area Command. After concentrating about
Wuntho, 62 and 64 Brigades conformed with
the main southerly axis of advance, and, by
the 23rd, they reached Kokkogon, 25 miles
south-east of Wuntho.

39. This advance of 192 miles in 20 days
was a wonderful achievement for troops who
were in action for the first time. Not only did
they overcome the scattered but desperate
opposition of enemy rear parties, but they sur-
mounted tremendous physical difficulties,
cutting a road through steep, jungle-covered
hills, and manhandiing their guns and vehicles
over long distances. On one occasion, they
even had to cantilever the track out on timber
supports round a cliff face. Two of the three
columns were accompanied by their motor
vehicles, though it was often necessary to winch
them up the hills. In spite of all these diffi-
culties it is much to the credit of the R.E.M.E.
mobile workshops that these two columns only
lost 29 vehicles between them. This loss was
compensated by the addition to the divisional
motor transport of 47 broken down and aban-
doned Japanese vehicles which we successfully
repaired.

40. On the 26th December, the Division
passed under command of 33 Corps, with 62
and 64 Brigades in contact with the retiring
enemy on a 20 mile front. 64 Brigade pushed
on, smashing an enemy rearguard at Kanbalu
on the 2nd January, and, with 2 British Divi-
sion, assisted in the capture of Shwebo on the
10th January.

41. 7 Indian Division (Major-General G. C.
Evans, who had succeeded Major-General Mes-
servy on the 12th December) which had been
rehabilitating at Kohima, was now entering the
forward zone. Its leading brigade relieved 98
Brigade of 19 Indian Division, which had been
employed on road construction along the
Thanan-Tonhe track, in the middle of Decem-
ber. By the end of the month, 7 Indian Divi-
sion was concentrating six miles south-west of

Tamu, ready either to be flown in to the
Schwebo area or to follow 19 Indian Division.

42. 28 (East African) Brigade concentrated
in December near Sunle on the Tamu-Kalewa
road. When the change of plan described in
the next section took place in the second half
of December, this Brigade was ordered south
up the Gangaw Valley, in rear of Lushai
Brigade. By the end of December, it had
reached Myintha, 29 miles north of Gangaw.

43. On the Northern Combat Area Command
front in Northern Bunma, 36 British Divi-
sion had been advancing down the Railway
Corridor. Following on the capture of Pinwe
on the 30th November (already mentioned in
para. 23), Naba, Indaw and Katha were
occupied in quick succession by the 10th
December, and consolidation of the area pro-
ceeded without enemy interference. The situ-
ation at the end of the month was that 29
Brigade was concentrating at Tigyaing on the
Irrawaddy, while 72 Brigade had crossed the
river south of Katha and reached a point 25
miles south-west of Shwegu, on the south bank
of the Shweli River. At this time 26 Indian
Brigade joined 36 British Division and moved
up to Indaw. Up till now, the Division had
comprised only the two British Brigades men-
tioned above.

44. Two regiments from 50 Chinese Division
proceeded from behind 36 British Division and
crossed the Irrawaddy to concentrate at
Kontha, 24 miles south-east of Mawlu. By the
30th December, one regiment had reached
Shwegu and the other a point 30 miles south-
east of it. 5332 (United States) Brigade
(“ Mars” Brigade) was operating over a
widely separated area from Bhamo to the south-
east of Shwegu. 38 Chinese Division captured
Bhamo on the 15th December after a siege of
four weeks. The remnants of the Japanese
garrison, some 300 strong, succeeded in break-
ing out south of the town, but suffered severe
casualties in doing so. After mopping up in
the Bhamo area, 38 Chinese Division supported
30 Chinese Division in the advance on
Namhkam. On the 28th December, one regi-
ment crossed the Sino-Burmese frontier and
occupied Loiwing (five miles north-north-east
of Namhkam), together with its two all-
weather airfields. .

45. 30 Chinese Division met vigorous opposi-
tion 20 miles north-west of Namhkam in its
initial advance down the Bhamo-Namhkam
road, but, with the assistance of 38 Chinese
Division and elements of Mars Brigade, it
fought its way to within seven miles of
Namhkam by the 31st December. The Japanese
had recently reinforced this front and it was
evident that a determined effort was being made
to check our advance in this area, to permit
of the withdrawal of their 56 Division from
Wanting towards Hsenwi and Lashio.

46. 22 Chinese Division, advancing south
from the Bhamo area, occupied Siu, 48 miles
to the south, on the 10th December, and cap-
tured Tonkwa, seven miles to the south-west,
on the 12th against determined resistance. After
this, 22 Chinese Division was concentrated in
the general area of Sikaw, and began its fly-
out to Kunming on the 22nd December. The
removal of this Division, and of 14 Chinese
Division which had preceded- it, will be
