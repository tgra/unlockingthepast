            "description": "the railhead was handling 2,000 tons daily. As many as 3,400 tons were unloaded in a single day; this was a remarkable feat and reflects much credit on the East African Labour Group working under Lieutenant-Colonel P. Matthews. On the 3rd April work began on the extension of the railway to Belhamed. Road construction was tackled with much energy, and in particu‘lar the roads up the escarpment at Sollum and through the Halfaya Pass were greatly improved.",

Having inspected the position the Corps Commander reported that it could not be carried by assault with his present forces and General Montgomery decided to wait until he could bring up stronger forces in infantry. His plan was to assault with three infantry divisions, 50th, 51st and 4th Indian, attacking through zo Corps as now disposed; after a breach had been made ro Corps would pass through, with the New Zealanders leading It would take about a week for the attack to be prepared. This would give me time to coordinate Eighth Army’s offensive with two other thrusts which I had planned. I issued a plan of operations on 3rd April. My object was still ‘‘to seize and secure airfields and potential airfields from which we can develop the full weight of our great superiority in the air, thereby paralysing the enemy’s supply system to an extent which will greatly facilitate the rapid advance of our ground forces.’’ The first phase was to drive the enemy from the Gabes gap iby a frontal attack by Eaghth Army and flanking pressure by II Corps. ‘When this operation was completed II Corps would be pulled out and transferred to the extreme northern flank. The second phase was to coincide with Eighth Army’s advance towards Sousse. I had organized an Army Group reserve under the recently arrived Headquarters",

            "description": "In order to develop their full strength for the decisive blow First Army had to be more concentrated and reinforced. For the former purpose I had already decided to relieve 46 and 4 Divisions on its northernmost flank with two divisions from II Corps. On 3rd April I ordered General Patton to be prepared to despatch his 9 Infantry Division to take over from 46 Division as soon as Eighth Army had broken through the Wadi Akarit line and to follow as rapidly as possible with the rest of II Corps. 9g Division, after regrouping and refitting, assumed command of the northernmost sector on 14th April and on 1gth April 1 United States Infantry Division began to relieve 4 Division; on the same day II Corps assumed command of the area north of the Oued et Tine. I intended that simultaneously with First Army’s offensive and Eighth Army’s holding attack II Corps should also develop operations down the Sedjenane road and the Béja-Mateur road to contain the enemy there and, if possible, to accelerate the capture of Bizerta. I must mention here that the way in which four United States divisions were transferred from one end of the lne to the other, crossing at nght angles the lines of communication of First Army, was a considerable triumph of staff work. Reinforcements for First Army could only come from Eighth Army. On rrth April I informed General Montgomery that the main effort in the final phase of operations would be by General Anderson and ordered him to make available to join 9 Corps as soon as possible an armoured division and an armoured car regiment. 1 Armoured Division and the King’s Dragoon Guards were nominated, being well placed on the FaidSbeitla road for such a transfer.",

For instance, on April 2nd, both the Flight of No. 6 (A.C.) Squadron and the H.Q. of No. 2 Armoured Division with which they were operating spent the night at Antelat, but on the morning of the 3rd April the Flight discovered that Div. H.Q. had left and no information was forthcoming as to their movements. The Flight subsequently moved to the landing ground at Msus where Free French troops were unable to give any information concerning our troops in the area, nor did they know where Div. H.Q. was situated. It was not until noon that a message was received from Second Div. H.Q. which gave their position at that time as 30 miles West of Msus.

Regular reconnaissances of Massawa, Dahlak Island and Assab and the Eritrean Coast were therefore maintained, and a constant check kept on the movements of Italian ships and Naval units. After the occupation of Massawa on the 8th April this threat was greatly reduced, since Assab was the only port then remaining to the enemy. Thereafter operations in the Red Sea were largely confined to reconnaissances of the port.",
