39. Progress on the east coast was less spec-
tacular and more costly. Augusta was entered
by the army on the evening of 12th July (D+2),
after a rather exasperating day in which our
destroyers alternately entered the harbour
triumphantly and were evicted by enemy shell
fire to which they could not reply owing to
inability to distinguish our own troops; but
the situation did not really become cleared up
and the port rendered safe for democracy until
the morning of the 13th when the Port Party
was finally installed and a valuable protected
anchorage made available for our use.

Two small commando operations from two
L.S.L(H)* contributed to the capture of this
port. From this time onward, however, no
use was made by the 8th Army of amphibious
opportunities. The small L.S.I.s were kept
standing by for the purpose at the call of Rear-
Admiral McGrigor (Flag Officer Sicily) and
landing craft were available on call: but the
only occasion on which they were used was
on 16th August, 1943, after the capture of
Catania, when a commando landing was made,
but fell short of the flank of the retreating
enemy.

40. There were doubtless sound military
reasons for making no use of this, what to me
appeared, priceless asset of sea power and
flexibility of manceuvre: but it is worth con-
sideration for future occasions whether much
time and costly fighting could not be saved
by even minor flank attacks which must neces-
sarily be unsettling to the enemy. It must
be always for the General to decide. The
Navy can only provide the means and advice
on the practicability from the naval angle of
the projected operation. It may be that had
I pressed my views more strongly more could
have been done.

41. Much use was made of naval gunfire
to support the seaward flank of the 8th Army.
Reports showed that such support was satis-
factory and effective. Only on one occasion
was heavy ship gunfire employed, when WAR-
SPITE carried out a brief bombardment of
Catania on the evening of the 17th July.

The End of the Operation.

42. The operation concluded with the entry
of Messina on the 17th August, the U.S.
7th Army, thanks to their amphibious tactics
and some prodigious road engineering feats,
beating the British 8th Army by a short head
for the prize.

Conclusion.

43. These remarks contain criticism where,
in my view, criticism is due. Where possible
the criticism is constructive and designed to
avoid a repetition of such mistakes as were
made. It is a cause for congratulation of all
concerned that the criticisms are so few and the
triumph so great.

44, I count myself indeed fortunate that, in
the planning and execution of this, the greatest
seaborne operation so far known in history, I
met with a co-operation so complete and cordial
as was accorded me by my colleagues General
Alexander and Air Chief Marshal Tedder, and
their subordinates.

45. Of the Navies, I can only say that I never
wish to command better, and I count it a great

honour that, through the person of Vice-
Admiral Hewitt, I was privileged to command
so large and efficient a force of the United
States Navy. Both the Western Task Force,
under Admiral Hewitt, and the Eastern Task
Force, under Admiral Ramsay, performed their
unaccustomed tasks in a manner befitting the
highest tradition of any fighting service.

[ have the honour to forward herewith the
report of proceedings of the Eastern Naval
Task Force during the initial phase of opera-
tions for the capture of the Island of Sicily,
Known as Operation “ Husky”. These opera-
tions were wholly successful, but considering -
the large force involved and the time allowed
for preparation, any other result could only
have been most unexpected and disappointing.

2. By reason of the weakness of the Italian
opposition, the success of the assaults in
“Husky ” cannot be considered as a reliable
guide to what may be attempted or achieved
elsewhere. Nevertheless, valuable experience
was gained which will be of inestimable assist-
ance in future operations, notably in regard to
maintenance through the beaches, handling and
serviceability of landing ships and craft, open-
ing of captured ports and in the use of naval
armaments in support of the army in subse-
quent operations along the coast.

3. Casualties to shipping and amongst land-
ing craft were considerably less than had been
anticipated and allowed for. This was gratify-
ing and is considered to be due to: — °

(a) the very high degree of air superiority
achieved ;

(6) the efficiency of the A/S* organi-
sation ;

(c) the unexpected attainment of a con-
siderable degree of tactical surprise. That
tactical surprise was effected is considered to’
have resulted from a combination of circum-
stances, such for example as the adoption of
a waxing moon period for the assaults, the
lack of enemy air reconnaissance on D-1
day and a prolonged period of “alert”
preceding D day, all of which, together with
the unexpected high wind which got up p.m.
on D-1, lulled the enemy coast defences
into a false sense of security. >

4. The performance of landing ships and
craft was uniformly good and, in the majority of
cases, creditable seamanship was displayed by
those in charge of them, having regard to their.
necessarily restricted training and lack of pre-
vious experience. The advantage enjoyed by
the personnel of the flotillas which were sent to
the Middle East in advance of the operation
was very marked and much credit is due to
