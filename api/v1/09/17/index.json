            "description": "52. There were indications that the Persians did not intend to satisfy our demands for the surrender of Axis nationals and on 14th Sep- tember the War Office intimated that a joint Anglo-Russian advance to Teheran would begin as soon as mutual arrangements with the Russian Commander had been campleted. The Russians agreed to a simultaneous entry into Teheran at 1500 hours on 17th September by the British from the South and the Russians from the East and West. This was carried out according to plan, relations between our troops and the Russians were most cordial."

            "description": "bases and shipping was limited by the weather and the temporary unserviceability of our Cyrenaican landing grounds owing to rain. The enemy, on the other hand, taking full advantage of the proximity of his air bases, was able to make our reinforcements of Leros difficult. The dropping of flares at night hin- dered unloading operations on certain occa- sions, and the laying of minefields also added to our difficulties; in spite of all this enemy activity the strength of the Leros garrison was built up to the strength of a brigade. The original garrison, which had arrived between the 17th September and the 2nd October, was the 234th Brigade Headquarters, and the 2nd Royal Irish Fusiliers, with a company from the 2nd Royal West Kents, the remainder of the battalion being on Samos. This was re- inforced by 4th November by the 4th Buffs, although their Headquarters Company was lost at sea, and early in November the Ist King\u2019s Own completed the Brigade."

Bomber Command attacked with 200 Lancasters and 23 Mosquitoes, four airfields at Leeuwarden, Steewijk-Havelte, Hopsten and Salzbergen. These enemy airfields were those from which fighters could attack the transports and gliders carrying the airborne forces. Nearly goo tons of bombs were dropped with good to excellent results on these airfields. On the same night, 54 Lancasters and 5 Mosquitoes dropped 294 tons of bombs on flak positions at Moerdijk, also with good results. On the following morn- ing, 85 Lancasters and 15 Mosquitoes dropped 535 tons of bombs on coastal defence batteries in the Walcheren area. For these daylight epeaioons Spitfires of A.D.G.B. provided escort."
