            "date": "16th July",
            "description": "150. Up to this time 46   Circus   operations had been carried out since 14th June. In those six weeks escort and support had been given to 374 bomber sorties and over 8,000 fighter sorties flown. We had lost 123 fighter pilots but it was hoped that many more German fighters than this had been destroyed. In addition, over 1,000 fighter sorties had been flown in support of 32 bomber operations against shipping, including the operations against the German capital ships on 24th July and an attack on the docks at Le Havre on roth June. Fighter sweeps without bombers accounted for approximately another 800 sorties, and operation   Rhubarb  resumed on 16th July after a month's pause for a further 61. Altogether the six weeks  intensive effort had meant the expenditure of nearly 10,000 offensive sorties by my Command. This was an impressive total, but to preserve perspective it must be remembered that the effort devoted to defensive purposes was still greater, approximately this number of sorties being expended during the same period on the protection of shipping alone. :"

            "date": "16th July",
            "description": "The enemy showed the value he attached to this ground by attacking the 5th Indian Infantry Brigade once more on the following day. But his tanks and lorried infantry were heavily engaged by our 2nd Armoured Brigade and by a powerful concentration of artillery and failed to gain a footing. In order to relieve the pressure on our centre, I ordered both Corps to press the enemy on the northern and southern flanks. Accordingly, on the night of the 16th July, the 9th Australian Division captured the low ridge of El Makh-Khad, eight miles west of El Alamein railway station, with 500 prisoners, thereby enlarging our salient, which throughout this period was the scene of continuous fighting. Further attacks against the 5th Indian Division on the Ruweisat Ridge on the 18th and roth July were repulsed."

The call forward of personnel and vehicles after the initial assault presented some difficulty, and quick turn-round of craft was maintained only at the expense of a certain amount of discomfort to the troops and congestion at the quayside. This arose because the number of craft available for the next flight was seldom known sufficiently early,"

            "date": "16th July",
            "description": "On 16th July .I issued a second directive to both Armies. In it I laid down three axes of advance for Eighth Army: northwards through Catania; from Leonforte to Adrano to sever communications this side of Etna; and via Nicosia-Troina-Randazzo to sweep round the northern slopes of Etna. I was already concerned with the problem of the Messina peninsula. It is a long, mountainous, isosceles triangle with the great mass of Etna almost fillmg its base. The southern slopes of the mountain dominate the plain below and give perfect observation of any attack we could mount on the Gerbini airfields or the port of Catania Our attack to drive the Germans from the island must therefore be canalized either side of Etna, in difficult country with few and bad roads. I hoped that Eighth Army would be able to mount a rapid attack on this formidable position before the Germans could assume a good position of defence Seventh Army was ordered to protect the rear of this attack by seizing the central rectangle of roads around Enna and cutting the east-west road at Petralia. If it were found possible without involving heavy casualties General Patton was to capture Agrigento and Porto Empedocle, which would be useful for maintenance."

By the end of June, 5 Indian Division had finished mopping up on both sides of the southern sector of the Kohima- Imphal road and had concentrated at Imphal, except for one brigade which had been sent to join 17 Indian Light Division in its operations in the Bishenpur area. During the first week in July these two Divisions cleared the area north of the Silchar-Bishenpur track. To the south, enemy resistance showed signs of weakening  many positions being evacuated in the face of our continued frontal pressure and attacks against his flanks. 33 Japanese Division was, however, reinforced by tanks and a composite regiment drawn from their 53 and 54 Divisions and made a determined stand between the 12th and the 16th July on hills overlooking the track from the south. After sharp fighting, 5 Indian Division pressed southwards through these hills and reached an area three miles west of Ningthoukhong. By the 18th, one brigade had established itself three miles west of Milestone 24 on the Tiddim Toad."
