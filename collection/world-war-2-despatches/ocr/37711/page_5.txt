SUPPLEMENT 1o tus LONDON GAZETTE, 4 SEPTEMBER, 1946

the programme of intensive air action against
the enemy defences was to begin with opera-
tions by Bomber Command, while airborne
forces were to be dropped on the flanks of the
assault area. At H Hour, supported by naval
bombardment and air action, and by the guns,
rockets and mortars of ¢lose support craft, the
leading wave of troops was to disembark and
force its way ashore. —

The total initial lift in the assault and follow-

-up naval forces was of the order of 130,000

personnel and 20,000 vehicles, all of which
were to be landed on the first three tides. In
addition to the basic eight assaulting brigades /
regimental combat teams, a variety of attached
troops were required in the assault including
special assault engineers, amphibious tanks,
and other detachments which varied for the
different beaches according to the specific
““menu” (i.e., composition of the assault
wave) decided upon by the subordinate forma-

_ tions,

Priority of air lift was given to American air-
borne forces owing to the vital tasks of securing
the beach exits and facilitating deployment
from the Utah beach. Main bodies of both
82 and ior United States Airborne Divisions
were to land in the general area of Ste. Mére
Eglise on the night D—1/D, the latter to assist
the seaborne. assault on the Utah sector and
the former to guard the landward flank and
prevent the movement of enemy reserves into
the Cotentin peninsula. The remaining air lift
was allotted to Second British Army for 6 Air-

- borne Division (less one brigade) which was to

land before H Hour east of Caen, with the
tasks of seizing the crossings over the Orne at
Bénouville and Ranville and, in conjunction
with Commando troops, of dominating the area
to the east of Caen in order to delay the
movement of enemy forces towards the town.

American Ranger units were to land in the
assault on the west of Omaha beach, and had
the task of attacking enemy defences on the
east side'of the Carentan estuary. One British
brigade of two Commandos was to link the
assaults on the Juno and Sword sectors. A
second Commando brigade was to land behind
the assaulting division on the Sword Sector
and while one Commando dealt with Ouistre-
ham, the remainder of the brigade was to cross
the Ome at Bénouville and attack the enemy
coast deferces of the river up to Cabourg
inclusive.

The Assault Technique.

Prolonged study and numerous experiments
had been devoted to the development of the
technique of assaulting a defended beach. As
a result, various types of specialised military
equipment were available by D Day, including
assault engineer tanks, tank-carried bridges for
crossing anti-tank ditches, mat-laying tanks
for covering soft clay patches on the beaches,
ramp tanks over which other vehicles could
scale sea walls, flail tanks for mine clearance,
and amphibious assault tanks. These devices
were integrated into the specially trained
assault teams which led the assault forces.

The development of under-water obstacles
on the assault coast has already been men-
tioned, and it was necessary to include in the
assault some teams of sappers and naval
obstruction clearance units trained in clearance
of this type of obstruction. These obstacles

also affected the decision on the tidal conditions
required at the time of commencing the assault,
because no extensive clearance could take place
whilst they were covered by the tide.

The Joint Fire Plan.

The purpose of the Joint Fire Plan was to
allocate tasks to the resources of the three
Services, with the object of assisting the Army
to get ashore. The chief requirements were to
destroy or neutralise the enemy coast artillery
batteries which might interfere with the
approach of the naval convoys or bring fire
to bear on the anchorages, and to neutralise the
enemy strong points and defended localities
that were sited for the immediate defence of
our assault beaches, ‘

It has been shown that preliminary air
attacks were delivered against enemy coast
defence batteries in the preliminary operations
prior to D Day. The Bite Plan proper -was
to begin on the night preceding the assault,
when the heavy bombers of Bomber Command
were to attack in great strength the ten most
important batteries; this operation was to be
timed as late as would be consistent with the
return of the aircraft to England by daylight.
Following the Bomber Command operations,
attacks were planned by medium bombers,
using special navigational devices, on a further
six coast defence targets; this phase was to
begin at civil twilight, and about the same
time the naval bombardment directed by spot-
ting aircraft and culminating with close support
fire from assault craft carrying various types
of armament was to commence, and about half-
an-hour before H Hour* the heavy bombers
of the Eighth United States Air Force, and
medium bombers of the Ninth United States
Air Force, were to begin action against coast
defence artillery and enemy beach defences and
localities. Included in the naval assault forces
was a variety of specially fitted craft carrying
4.7 inch guns, 4 inch mortars, barrages of §
inch rockets, Centaur tanks fitted with 75
millimeter howitzers, 17 pounder anti-tank
guns, as well as ordinary self-propelled field
guns of the’ assaulting divisional artilleries
which were to be embarked in’ tank landi
craft and to work as regimental fire units.

The Fire Plan aimed at building up the
supporting fire to a tremendous crescendo which
would reach its climax at the latest possible
moment before the leading troops wad
ashore, in order to give the defenders the mini-
mum time to recover before being set upon.
The heavy air bombardment was timed to com-
mence on the beach frontages to within ten
minutes of H Hour, and from this time fighters
and fighter-bombers were to take up the air
offensive, and in particular undertake the task
of neutralising the enemy field batteries located
inland. Air support tentacles were to accom-
pany the assulting troops, and fighter-bomber
squadrons were to be at hand to answer calls for
close support, while the medium and heavy
bombers returned to their bases to refuel and
te-arm in readiness for further missions. No
fewer than 171 Allied fighter squadrons were to
be employed in the overall assault phase, and in
the event the Allied Air Forces flew some 11,000
sorties on D Day.

*On the day ultimately selected H hour varied
between 0630 ye the Western Task Force to 0745
on the Eastern sectors.
