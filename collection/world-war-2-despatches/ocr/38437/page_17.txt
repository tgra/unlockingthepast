SUPPLEMENT To THs LONDON GAZETTE, 20 OCTOBER, 1948

ordered; and by the middle of October no less
than 498 heavy and 609 light gums were
deployed in the ‘‘ box ’’ and “‘ strip ’’.*

125. The changed direction of attack
brought new problems. For various reasons,
of which the chief -~were the intermittent
character of the attacks and the geographical

‘ position of our own bomber airfields, I could

not give the gunners the same freedom of fire
as they had enjoyed in the south-east during
the summer. Although I was able to establish
the principle that flying over the ‘‘ box ’’ or
‘* strip '’ below 6,000 feet should be prohibited
in normal circumstances during the hours of
darkness, I was forced to defer to the needs
of Bomber Command to the extent of permitting
their aircraft to fly over the “‘ strip ’’ (though
not over the ‘‘box’’) at any height they
pleased provided they gave prior warning to
my headquarters. This concession entailed a
corresponding restriction of gunfire; and I also
had to reserve the right to restrict gunfire at
any other time in order to safeguard friendly
aircraft which, for one reason or another, were
unable to avoid flying low over the “‘ strip ’’
to reach their bases.

126. Another problem for the guns arose out
of the fact that, instead of maintaining a height
of 2,000 or 3,000 feet during the greater part
of their flight, the bombs launched from air-
craft often approached the coast as low as
1,000 feet. A new type of equipment for con-
trolling low-angle fire was coming into service,
but only in small quantities; consequently
General Pile had to get over the difficulty by
siting the rest of his equipment so as to give
the best results against low-flying targets. This
meant sacrificing some of its capacity to give
early warning.

127. Despite these limitations, the perform-
ance of the gunners was beyond all praise. Out
of 576 bombs which approached the coast
between the 16th September, 1944, and the 14th
January, 1945, without being shot down into
the sea by fighters or the Royal Navy, 321
were brought down by anti-aircraft fire. One
hundred and ninety-seven of these fel] into the
sea and the remaining 124 on land.

128. For the fighters the chief problem arose _

out of the fact that all activity was now at
night. There was a natural tendency to sup-
pose that interception at night would be easier
than in daylight simply because the tongue of
flame emitted by the bomb was so conspicuous
in the dark. Unfortunately, seeing the bomb
was not enough: pilots had also to estimate
its range, and this proved extremely difficult,
as anyone who has tried to judge his distance
from a light on a dark night will understand.
Sir Thomas Merton, the distinguished spectro-
scopist, designed a simple range-finder which
eventually proved of great value to pilots; but
individual skill and experience remained the
biggest factor in overcoming this difficulty.
Some pilots showed remarkable aptitude for
this work, so baffling to many; for example,
one Tempest pilot, Squadron Leader J. Berry,
shot down more than 60 bombs at night before
being himself shot down while on an offensive
sortie,

and Lowestoft were incorporated in the “ strip’ and

tag. During this third phase of the attack
we used two types of fighters against flying-
bombs at night: Mosquito night fighters in front |
of the guns, and Tempest day fighters piloted
by specially-trained night-fighter pilots between
the guns and London. Although the Mosquito
was too slow to catch a flying bomb except
in a dive, these aircraft brought down a total
of 21 bombs during this phase. The Tempests,
which had been outstandingly successful dur-
ing the main attack in the summer, now
operated with the aid of a searchlight belt
extending from Saffron Walden and Sudbury
in the north to Southend and Brightlingsea in
the south.* They brought down 50 bombs,
most of which fell harmlessly in open country.
Thus, throughout the four months of this phase,
only 205 bombs eluded the defences out of
608 seen or detected on their way to the
capital; and of these only 66 reached Greater

London.

130. To supplement these orthodox measures
of defence my staff worked out a scheme where-
by Mosquito night fighters were sent to the
area from which the He. 11x aircraft of the
German air-launching ‘unit despatched the
bombs, in order to shoot these aircraft down.
This was not a simple undertaking. The
German aircraft flew low, rising to a height of
2,000 feet or so for only a short time while they
teleased their bombs. Thus the night fighters,
too, had to fly only a few hundred feet above
the sea. For the fighter as for the bomber
this was a hazardous proceeding; and at such
Jow altitudes the radar normally employed by
night fighters to make contact with their targets
was not at its best. Furthermore, the radar
stations on land which were used for controlling
the fighters were often unable to detect ‘the
bombers except when the latter gained height
to launch their bombs.

131. As a step towards overcoming some of

these difficulties we modified the equipment of

several radar stations and also tried the ex-
periment of controlling the fighters from the
naval frigate H.M.S. Caicos and from an air-
craft equipped with A.S.V. Mark VI. But
these measures bore little fruit until the air-
launched attacks were nearly over. All the
more credit is due, therefore, to the skill and
perseverance of the night-fighter crews, who
claimed the destruction of sixteen launching
aircraft, the probable destruction of another
four, and damage to four more, between the
16th September, 1944, and the 14th January,
1945. There is evidence that these losses,
coming on top of the natura] hazards incurred
by heavily laden aircraft operating almost at
sea-level, imposed no little strain on the,
‘German unit responsible for air launching.

- 132. Nevertheless, the Germans seem to have
remained unaware how small a proportion of
the bombs launched were reaching London, or
else to have resigned themselves to receiving
a poor return for their efforts sé long as some
sort of offensive could be continued against
this country. For they not only persevered
with the operations, but even took steps during
the winter to increase their scope. This fact,
of which our intelligence service was aware,

* At first these searchlights were deployed at
intervals of 3,000 yards. perience showed that
so thick a spacing tended to dazzle pilots and we

altered the interval to the normal 6,000 yards.
