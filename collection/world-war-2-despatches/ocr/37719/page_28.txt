15. The .5-inch gun appeared, at first sight,
to be the natural successor to the .303 inch, but
experiments showed that the type available to
us in the Autumn of 1940 was practically de-
feated by the 8mm. armour carried in the
M.E. 109. It was true that the bullet would
pierce 20-mm. or more of armour in the open,
but it was found that the minute deceleration
and deflection of the axis of the bullet, caused
by its passage through the structure of the fuse-
lage, exercised a very important diminution on
its subsequent penetrative powers.

16. Experiments carried out with .5-inch
guns of higher velocity in America have given
encouraging results, and it is not at present
possible to dogmatise on the subject. It would,
however, be foolish to adopt a gun which could
be defeated by a slight thickening of the armour
carried by the Bomber and the aim should be
to defeat the thickest armour which it is prac-
tically possible for the enemy to carry.

17. We have at present no gun of a calibre
between .5-inch and 20-mm, (.8 inch). The
latter was originally adopted by the French be-
cause it was of about the right size to fire an
explosive shell through an airscrew of a Hispano
Suiza engine, and was adopted by us from
them. If, therefore, it proves to be of the best
weight and calibre for an armour piercing, that
is due to accident rather than design.

18. A study of available data might. lead one
to suppose that a calibre of about 15-mm. would
be the ideal, and I understand that this size
has recently been adopted by the Germans; but
we cannot now start designing a new gun for
this war, and we must choose between the
-5-inch and the 20-mm. We shall soon get
reliable data from American Fighter types in
action. They have faith in the .5-inch gun.

19. The Armament of the Royal Air Force
is not its strongest point, and in my opinion
we should do our own Design and Experimental
work, and satisfy our requirements without
being dependent on Woolwich and Shoebury-
ness,

20.—(C) Incendiary ammunition may be
fired from guns of any calibre and Bomber tanks
have been set on fire by .303 inch ammunition.
’ The bigger the bullet, however, the bigger the
hole, and a small bullet stands a good chance
of being quenched before it can take effect.
In any case, the fuel tanks of a Bomber con-
stitute so small a proportion of the whole target
that they cannot be made the sole objective of
attack; and it seems that the adoption of a
large-calibre gun and the use of a proportion
of incendiary ammunition therein will afford
a satisfactory compromise.

21.—(D) It was assumed by the French that
the 2o-mm. shell would be effective against the
structure of modern aircraft. I do not know
what trials they carried out, but the tests done
by us at Shoeburyness and Orfordness indicate
that the effect of a 20-mm. shell explading
instantaneously on the surface of an aircraft is
almost negligible, except in a small percentage
of lucky strikes. The normal effect is that a
hole of about 6-inch diameter is blown in the
surface, and that the effect at any distance is
nil, since the shell is blown almost into dust.
Occasionally the fuze penetrates and does some
damage, but this is slight in comparison with
the total weight of the shell. Even the big
37-mm. shell, though it may be spectacular

damage, will not often bring a Bomber down
with a single hit. Greater damage is done if
the fuze is given a slight delay action, so that
it bursts inside the covering of the aircraft, but
small delay action fuzes are unreliable in opera-
tion and difficult to manufacture, and, on the
whole, it seems doubtful if explosive shells are
as efficient as armour-piercing and incendiary
projectiles, especially as they will not penetrate
armour. Another point must be remembered,
viz., that a drum of explosive shells is a very
dangerous item of cargo: if one is struck and
detonated by a bullet it is not unlikely that
they will ali go off and blow the aeroplane
to pieces.

22.—(E) The use of large shells (comparable
to Anti-Aircraft types) from Fighter aircraft is
practically prohibited by considerations of
weight if a gun is used. The gun itself must
be heavy dnd the structure must be
strengthened to withstand the shock of recoil.
The walls and base cf the shell al.o have to
be made uneconomically heavy to withstand the
discharge. -All these difficulties, however, can
be overcame if the Rocket principle is used.
It is true that a Rocket can be discharged
only in the direct line of flight, but that is no
particular handicap to a Fighter. It can have
a light firing tube, there is no recoil, and the
shell can be designed for optimum fragmenta-
tion effect. (I have been told that a 3-inch
Rocket shell develops the same explosive and
fragmentation effect as a 4.5-inch Anti-Aircraft
gun shell). It also starts with an advantage

“over the terrestrial rocket in that it has an

initial velocity of atout 300 m.p.h. through the
air, which gives it enhanced accuracy. For
this weapon a ‘‘ Proximity Fuze’ would be
ideal, but, pending the development of this,
there is no reason why the Rocket should not be
used with a Time and Percussion Fuze used in
conjunction with a range-finder in the Aircraft.

23. This item was put on the programme
about 7 years ago, and I think it a great pity
that it was allowed to drop. True, unexpected
difficulties may be encountered, and nothing
may come of the project, but it is an important
experiment, and our knowledge of what is and
is not possible will not be complete until it
has been tried. :

a4. I think that our decision to adopt the
20-mm. gun is probably the wisest which we
could have taken, but to carry increased load
efficiently something bigger than the Hurricane
or Spitfire is needed. The Typhoon with
2,000 h.p. should be ideal when it has been
given an adequate ceiling.

25. In the meantime the Hurricane must be
somewhat overloaded with 4 Cannons, and
mixed armament (2 Cannons and 4 Brownings)
in the Spitfire is merely a compromise neces-
sitated by loading conditions. ight not the
high-velocity American .5-inch prove a
suitable armament for the small fighter?

26. As regards ammunition for the 20-mm.
gun, the so-called ‘‘ solid ’’ bullet was merely
a cheap steel bullet produced by the French for
practice purposes. Its mass and velocity have
enabled it hitherto to smash through armour
to which it has been opposed, but an improved
design will probably be needed before long;
doubtless the matter is receiving attention.
understand that the incendiary bullet—the
equivalent of the de Wilde .303-inch—has been
giving good results. .
