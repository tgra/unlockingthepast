SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

was to attack north, directed on Rome. Both
attacks were to be assisted, if at all possible,
by amphibious flank attacks, on the east in the
strength of about a brigade group and on Fifth
Army’s front of at least an infantry division
with some armour. Since landing craft were
so short the latter attack would have to wait
until those used in the former had been brought
round to the west coast; even then they might
not be sufficient for the scale of attack I
proposed. The signal to the Combined Chiefs
of Staff therefore concluded: ‘‘ it is certain
that more landing craft will be required for a
limited time if we ate to capture Rome in the
near future and avoid a slow, painful and
costly series of frontal attacks.’’

A further review of the situation produced
more definite proposals. On 31st October,
General Eisenhower again approached the
Combined Chiefs of Staff with a full review
of the need for landing craft and the resources
necessary to meet those needs. The tasks for
which the craft were required were threefold.
The first was the build-up of auxiliary units
to complete formations already in Ltaly.
Secondly it was essential to be able to mount
an assault behind the enemy lines in the
strength of about a division, probably on the
west coast. Thirdly it was necessary to meet
the demands of the Strategic Air Force, which
included not only the move of the operational
formations themselves but also large numbers
of airfield construction and servicing units.
The Foggia airfields, though the principal base
in South Italy for the Italian Air Force, were
not all-weather and very large quantities of
steel plank had to be transported. The require-
ments of the Strategic Air Force had also been
largely increased by the decision, communi-
cated on 23rd October, to set up the XV
United States Air Force in Italy. With our
present resources, that is adhering to the
existing programme of returning craft to the
United Kingdom, the first of these tasks would
not be completed before 15th December and
there would remain only sufficient lift for one
brigade or regimental combat team, which
would be quite inadequate. If, however, we
could keep until 15th December all the British
Landing Ships, Tank (between forty-eight and
fifty-six) and twelve United States, it would be
possible both to complete the build-up of pre-
sent formations and to mount a divisional
amphibious assault. Even then only about a
third of the task of establishing the Strategic
Air Force in Italy would have been carried
out; but if the craft could be retained for a
further three weeks, until 5th January, the
whole programme could be completed.

Another Commanders-in-Chief conference
was held at Carthage on 3rd November.
confirmed the plan presented at the previous
conference with the proviso that Eighth Army
would have to make a short pause after the
capture of the Pescara line before exerting
pressure south-westwards down Route 5.
Fifth Army was to press on up Route 6, the
Via Casilina, and attempt to break through
the enemy opposition on that axis coincident
with Eighth Army’s drive on Rome; it was
hoped that it would retain sufficient impetus
to reach the Frosinone area. At this point
we would, if we had the means, launch an
amphibious assault south of the Tiber and
subsequently other assaults north of the

.of mountains forward of the Sangro.

Tiber. In order to carry out these contem-
plated manceuvres it would be necessary to
move in for Fifth Army two French divisions
plus the necessary services and non-divisional
troops in order to maintain the impetus of the
attack: the bulk of the troops in Fifth Army
had been fighting continuously, and heavily,
since 9th September. Moreover, their mobility
and maintenance were severely hampered by
the fact that about two thousand five hundred
urgently needed vehicles were still held up at
Bizerta awaiting landing craft to move them.
In reply to a signal sent at the conclusion of
the conference we were authorised by the
Combined Chiefs of Staff to retain the sixty-
eight landing craft until x5th December.
With’ this, planning could go ahead with greater
confidence.

Advance to the Winter Line.

After the advance to the Termoli-
Vinchiaturo line Eighth Army continued active
patrolling while they reorganised for the attack
on the Winter Line. 5 Corps took over the
tight flank on r1th October with 78 and 8
Indian Divisions under command; the latter
was a new formation, though of experienced
units, but distinguished itself in this its first
action. 78 Division managed to seize a bridge-
head over the River Trigno, on the axis of
Route 16, on the night of the 2znd-23rd, and
by the next night all the enemy in the Corps
sector were back behind the river. The main
position here was on the San Salvo ridge, a
dominant feature overlooking the west bank.
The Trigno near the coast is a broad stream,
liable to very sudden flooding and the ground
on either bank is a very heavy clay soil in
which it was almost impossible to construct a
firm track. The first attack on San Salvo, on
the night of the 27th, was frustrated largely owing
to these difficulties, aggravated by a heavy -fall
of rain, and a full-scale attack was therefore
necessary. This opened on the early morning
of 3rd November, when 78 Division attacked
San Salvo and 8 Indian Division, on their left,
the village of Tufillo on a high spur above the
river. There was heavy fighting for both
villages but San Salvo was clear by the 4th
and Tufillo by the 5th. The enemy, having
now offered as much delay as possible on this
line—and 16 Panzer Division, which was not
fresh when it went into action, had had heavy
losses—began to withdraw to his next, the
‘* Bernhardt ”’ line, which on Eighth Army’s
front ran from north of Isernia along the range
In the
Sangro defences itself Kesselring had disposed
65 Infantry Division which he had brought
down from the north. As a result of this with-
drawal we were able to enter unopposed the
important road junction of Isernia on 4th
November. :

On the Fifth Army front the first task, which
fell to 10 Corps, was now to secure Monte
Massico, the high razor-back ridge north-east
of Mondragone. Apart from being an impor-
tant stage in our advance northwards, this
position was also vital to complete the covering
screen defending Naples if it should be neces-
sary at any time to go on to the defensive;
present enemy strength and his constant rein-
forcement had, as I have already mentioned,
brought such considerations more into the fore-
ground. Two new German divisions, 305 and 94
