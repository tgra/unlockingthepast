AIR ORGANISTATION AND ADMINISTRATION.
38. Arrfields*,

Up to June, 1943, the progress of airfield
consiruction was behind schedule, and many
airfields were still incomplete.

Actually, at the beginning of 1943 the main
airfield construction prcgramme in India in-
cluded the building of 215 standard all-
weather airfields. Some were to be ‘‘ opera-
tional,”’ + e., built to full scale with two run-
ways and accommodation for two squadrons.
Of this programme, which had initially been
drawn up in March, 1942, five operational] air-
fields were complete in all respects, and 88
had one all-weather runway ready {over z,600
yards in length) by the end of 1942. In addi-
tion, sixty fair-weather strips or landing areas
had been completed.

The increasing scale of offensive operations
throughout 1943 entailed far more construc-
tion in the east than under the original plan.
A number of fair-weather airfields had to be
prepared in forward areas, with limited shelter
type accommodation and tentage, and the
decision to operate throughout the monsoon
made it necessary to develop some of these as
all-weather airfields with increased accommo-
dation and accessories. A number of airfields
was also completed in North East Assam to
handle supplies to China, or on the supply
toute from the West for the same purpose.
Moreover, in the same area certain airtields
were developed from which he U.S. Air Forces
could operate heavy bombers or defensive
fighters. .

In addition, the maintenance and reinforc-
ing of the U.S. Army Air Force squadrons in
Assam involved further construction in the
southern, western and central areas. By
November, 1943, a total of 34 all-weather
airfields, and 11 fair-weather strips had been
handed over to the US.A.A.F. Facilities were
also given to them in ‘certain other R.A.F.
airfields.

In March, 1942, there were only 16 airfields
possessing all-weather runways, of which four
only were operational by modern standards.
There were also twenty fair-weather strips. By
November, 1943, there were 285 airfields com-
pleted and 15 under construction. Of this
total, no less than 140 were complete in all
respects, while 64 airfields had one all-weather
runway ready, and a further 71 had fair-
weather strips or landing areas, and were
equipped in varying degrees with dispersal faci-
oe and domestic and technical accommoda-

ion

There have been great difficulties in the
execution of this programme which has cost
about fifteen million pounds. There has been
a shortage of suitable constructional equipment
and supervisory staff. Much of the work
carried out by civilian contractors has not been
satisfactory, and in all areas there has been
delay due to bad communications or inade-
quate control. In the Punjab and United

Provinces the Provincial Governments have’

given great assistance. In Eastern India, where
the need was greatest, there has been less
enterprise and efficiency. The fact remains,
however, that the Air Forces in India can now
expand rapidly with the sure confidence that
there are suitable bases from which to oper-
ate. A tribute is due to the many military

39. Manpower im the Royal Air Force.

*Perhaps the greatest problem in the expan-
sion of the Air Forces in this Command has
been caused by the acute shortage of suitable
manpower. Other theatres of war, whose more
imperative needs have quite rightly been given
priority, appear to have exhausted the avail-
able manpower in the United Kingdom, with
the result that this Command has often seemed
to be situated at the end of a badly leaking
pipe-line. To combat this difficulty, the sub-
stitution scheme, whereby local manpower is
recruited and trained to fill existing vacancies
in R.A.F. non-operational units, was decided
upon at the énd of 1942, and put into prac-
tice during the first half of 1943.

The output of trained manpower under this
scheme was not adequate, however, to meet
the demand caused by the expansion of the
Air Command. As a result we had to subsist
mainly on whatever drafts became available
from time to time from the United Kingdom
or other Commands.

An important and complicating factor in this
situation was the increased variety of aircraft
operating from India, and the consequent mul-
tiplication of requirements of the different
categories of aircrew trained for each type. As
advanced aircrew training facilities were strictly
limited in the Command, the main solution to
this problem consisted in placing more accur-
ate and detailed demands on the Air Ministry
for the personnel required. At the same time
training facilities were developed and utilised
to the maximum extent for converting surplus
aircrews from one type of aircraft to another.

Ultimately, as a result of the manpower |
shortage throughout the R.A-F., an establish-
ment ceiling was imposed on the Air Com-
mand in India. This ceiling limited the per-
sonnel expansion of the Command to a total of
approximately 90,000 RAF. and _ 10,000
LA.F. pérsonnel to meet a target of 73 squad-
rons. Any personnel recruited into the I.A.F.
however, under the substitution scheme would
not be counted against this ceiling. A target
of 140 squadrons will become operative atter
Germany has been defeated and persoznel
become available again from the west.

Actually the figures of air manpower for July
and November, 1943, were as follows, but
these contained deficiencies among some classes
of‘personnel and surpluses among others which
could not be adjusted by interchange, without
training afresh :—
