SUPPLEMENT To tae LONDON GAZETTE, 11 AUGUST, 1948

The E-Boats were difficult to see and their
presence was not disclosed until they went ahead
on their engines at high speed. Possibly they
would have achieved more success and suffered
less damage had they kept quiet during and
after the finng of their torpedoes. The handicap
of not having a flashless propellant for star-
shell was again keenly felt.

Torpedomg and Escorting of SYDNEY STAR.

66. NESTOR, who at 0255 had observed one
ship of the convoy dropping astern, proceeded
to investigate, and on closing, it was seen that
the ship, identified as S.S. SYDNEY STAR,
was moving slowly through the water on an
oppesite course to that of the convoy. On closer
approach, it was observed that the starboard
boats were being lowered; the ship however
appeared undamaged, with no list and at
normal trim.

67. Some time elapsed before NESTOR could
obtain a reply to repeated requests for in-
formation, but eventually SYDNEY STAR
Teported that she had been torpedoed in No. 3
hold, and that she had 30 feet of water in
that hold and appeared-to be sinking.

68. NESTOR therefore decided to embark
the troops numbering 470, and proceeded along-
side for this purpose. Planks were rigged
from SYDNEY STAR’s gunwale to NESTOR’s
forecastle, and Jacob’s ladders employed aft.
Transfer occupied 50 minutes, and was com-
pleted by 0405. .

69. Throughout this operation both ships
were lying stopped in a position 4 miles from
Pantellaria. Three E-Boats were observed
whilst the transfer of troops was proceeding,
but no attacks developed. On completion of
the transfer, personnel on ‘board NESTOR
numbered 774 (231 ship’s company, 56 army
passengers, 487 ex SYDNEY STAR).

70. Whilst alongside, NESTOR impressed
on+the Master of the SYDNEY STAR the
absolute necessity of keeping his ship afloat
and getting her under way again At o410
NESTOR cast off and SYDNEY STAR was
able to follow her at 12 knots. It subsequently
transpired that her No, 1 and No. 2 holds
had also made water, and that the damage
was caused by a projectile from one of the
escort during the E-boat mélée.

71. At 0615 two T/B aircraft were sighted
by NESTOR on the port quarter. Barrage
fire was opened and the aircraft crossed astern
making off in the general direction of the
convoy. At 0650 two more T /\Bs were sighted,
this time on the port bow. Barrage fire was
again opened and the aircraft crossed’ ahead
and made off towards the convoy. Thinking
that SYDNEY STAR was about to be attacked,
NESTOR made a ‘“‘‘Help”’ signal, in con-
sequence of which HERMIONE was detached
by Rear-Admiral Commanding, 18th Cruiser
Squadron at 0700 to join NESTOR and SYD-
NEY STAR.

Approach to, and Arrival‘at Malta, 24th July
(D.4). ;
- 72, At 0705 when some 60 miles west of

Gozo, a half-hearted attack was carried out
by 3 T/B aircraft.on the main convoy and

4479

sescort. Torpedoes were released at long range
when the destroyer screen opened fire. Ships
took avoiding action, but no tracks were seen.

73. In order to afford time for the cruisers _
and destroyers of Force X to discharge per-
sonnel and.stores and refuel, it had been
arranged that (Rear-Admiral Commanding, 18th
‘Cruiser Squadron should proceed ahead with
the cruisers and Hunts at high speed at about
0700, provided the situation as regards enemy
surface forces was considered satisfactory. At
this time, although all enemy surface units had
been reported in their respective harbours on
the previous day, no morning reconnaissance
report had ‘been received from Vice-Admural,
Malta.

74. There appeared io be little hkelhood
of enemy surface forces making contact with
the main convoy, a greater source of worry -
being the SYDNEY STAR. At 0730 the situa-
tion appeared easier, and realising that any
further delay might jeopardise the arrange-
ments for getting the convoy into Grand
Harbour and for sailing Force X to rejoin
Force H, Rear-Admiral Commanding, 18th
Cruiser Squadron, with ARETHUSA’ and
MANXMAN, parted company from the convoy
and proceeded at 25 knots to Malta. At 0830
a reconnaissance report was received from
Vice-Admiral, Malta, stating that no enemy
surface forces were in the vicinity. This
removed what little fears yet remained of an
attack by,surface forces.

75. At 1000, SYDNEY STAR, HERMIONE
and NESTOR were attacked by 8 JU.87 dive
bombers with German markings and 2 high
level bombers. The attacks were well syn-
chronised, and in the case of the dive bomb-
ing’ attack, well pressed home. One bomb fell
20 yards to port, and another 20 yards to
starboard of NESTOR; others fell close to
HERMIONE—but no ship was hit. One JU.87
was shot down by A.A. fire. One (Beaufighter
was in company but failed to make an
interception.

76. EDINBURGH, ARETHUSA = and
MANXMAN entered Grand Harbour at 1130
with ships’ companies fallen in and bands
playing. A great reception was accorded them
by the people of Malta.

77. HERMIONE, NESTOR and SYDNEY
STAR, having taken the route north of Malta,
arrived at 1400. The safe arrival of SYDNEY
STAR reflects great credit on the Commanding
Officer of NESTOR, Commander A. S.
Rosenthal, R.A.N., who showed judgment,
initiative and good seamanship in handling a
delicate situation so close to the enemy’s coast
and in the presence of enemy E-Boats. It
Was appropriate that the Commanding Officer
and most of his crew should be Australians.

78. The main convoy escorted by COSSACK,
MAORI, SIKH, FOXHOUND and FARN-
DALE continued without further incident and,
proceeding by the route south of Malta, entered
harbour at 1530.

Movements of Force H, 24th July (D.4).
79. Meanwhile Force H had reached position

37° 35°N, 5° 15’ E. at 0615, when two Sword-
fish were flown off to locate MANCHESTER
