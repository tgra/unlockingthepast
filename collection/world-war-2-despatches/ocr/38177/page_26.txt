a short time only, unless the port could be
freely used, which would be possible only
_when all danger of land attack and sustained
attack from the air had been removed.

In the advance beyond Tobruk maintenance
would again be the governing factor. Plans
for bringing the ports of Tobruk, Derna, and
Bengasi into operation at the earliest possible
moment were carefully worked out. But,
owing to limited transport resources, the size
of the forces for the subsequent advance and
their radius of action would be severely
restricted. For that reason it was all-important
that the enemy’s main forces should be
destroyed before they could withdraw beyond
our reach. ;

Camouflage and Deception.

It was of supreme importance to mislead the
enemy as to our intention and no effort was
spared to achieve this.

Reconnaissance.

For many weeks before the operation every
part of Libya in which enemy troops were
quartered was thoroughly reconnoitred. It
cannot be said that any one type of reconnais-
sance provided more valuable results than’ any
other, but the sum of their efforts produced
most accurate information about the enemy.
It will be seen that we were acquainted with
almost every important detail of the enemy’s
dispositions, his order of battle and defensive
arrangements.

The Royal Air Force covered the whole of
the enemy’s lines of communication from Tripoli
and Bengasi up to the forward area. In addi-
tion a thorough photographic survey was made
of all the important areas between Gazala and
the Egyptian frontier. The interpreters of the
Amy Air Photo-Interpretation unit attached
to the Eighth Army showed great skill in
plotting enemy defences and depots of supplies
from these photographs. Practically the whole
of the enemy’s dispositions round Tobruk were
pin-pointed from air photographs interpreted by
officers of this unit, and the plan for the Tobruk
sortie was based largely on this information.

The Long Range Desert Group were also en-
gaged in important reconnaissances. Operating
over an area approximately five hundred miles
from north to south and six hundred miles from
east to west behind the enemy lines, desert
patrols secured much useful topographical in-
formation, enabling existing inaccurate maps to
be revised. Small parties lay up for long
periods three hundred miles behind the enemy’s
advanced troops, observing the coastal road
and taking a complete census of traffic passing
between Tripoli and Bengasi. Both in
Cyrenaica and Tripolitania enemy convoys were
attacked, and the prisoners taken imparted
valuable information.

The armoured car regiments in the frontier
zone were also busy supplying information about
the enemy’s activities. It was particularly im-
portant that we should know the extent to
which the enemy used the area south of the
Trigh el Abd and west of the frontier. Penetrat-
ing up to fifty miles beyond the wire, patrols
brought back the heartening knowledge that
the area was not closely watched and that we
might expect to obtain a high degree of
surprise. y ome #e :

SUPPLEMENT to rae LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 1048

Bombardment of Enemy Supply Lines.

A description of the valuable preparatory
work carried out by the Royal Navy and the
Royal Air Force does not come within the scope
of this Despatch, though there can be no doubt
that its effect on the subsequent land operations
was little short of decisive. For many weeks,
while the Army was engaged in making its own
Preparations, the supply lines of the enemy were
subjected to constant heavy attack by sea and
air, Many ships carrying reinforcements in
men and vehicles were sunk, and many
thousands of tons of stores and fuel destroyed.
Enemy Dispositions.

In mid-November the greater part of the
enemy forces in North Africa were concentrated
in Eastern Cyrenaica, leaving in Tripolitania
only the regular garrison troops and the weak
Sabrata Division, which was serving as a draft-
ing formation. The main forces consisted of
three armoured, two motorised, and five in-
fantry divisions. These were organised as
follows: —

Panzer Gruppe, Afrika (General Rommel).

Afrika Korps—

15th Panzer Division.

aist Panzer Division.

goth Light Division. (Afrika Division).
Mobile Corps—

Ariete Division (armoured).

Trieste Division (motorised).

Trento Division.

21st Corps—
Bologna Division.
Pavia Division.
Brescia Division.
Frontier Group—
Savona Division.
Elements of other divisions, German and
Italian.

The 2zst Corps, stiffened by three German in-
fantry battalions, was investing Tobruk and the
Trento Division had lately joined it. The
frontier defences at Halfaya, Sollum and
Capuzzo, constructed during the summer, were
manned by German infantry battalions and
those round Sidi Omar by the Savona Division.
Bardia, where General Schmitt had his head-
quarters, was occupied by a mixed garrison of
Italians and Germans.

Between these two main infantry groups were
the armoured and mobile forces. The azst
Panzer Division lay astride the Trigh Capuzzo
some 12 miles south of Gambut, where General
Rommel’s headquarters were. The 15th Panzer
Division and the Afrika Division, an infantry
division specially formed for service overseas,
were concentrated round El Adem, Ed Duda
and Sidi Rezegh. The Ariete and Trieste Divi-
sions had recently moved to Bir el Gubi and Bir
Hacheim respectively.

Date of the Offensive.

I knew before we launched an offensive that
preparations pointing to an attack on Tobruk
were in train, but I did not know the date of
the proposed assault. I did, however, seriously
consider postponing my offensive until Rommel
struck at Tobruk, with the idea of catching the
enemy facing the wrong way and at a disad-
vantage. However, the urgent need for open-
ing our offensive at the earliest moment and the
