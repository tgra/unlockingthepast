SUPPLEMENT To tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 1951

Our casualties from North Burma (36 British
Division) were also flown back, at first by light
aircraft and later by returning heavy transport
planes, to our forward base hospitals in the
Ledo area.

150. The organization needed when large
numbers of casualties are moved by air was
being studied during the past six months. A
start was made to reduce the wasteful
“ribbon ” distribution of hospitals, which had
hitherto had to be maintained along the L.
ef C. solely for transit purposes, and to con-
centrate beds in large hospital centres. This
policy, as it develops, will allow a much larger
number of cases to be retained in the Four-
teenth Army area until they are fit to return
to their units, and thereby avoid the many
drawbacks in their evacuation to base hospitals
in India.

151..The following is a summary in round
figures of casualties moved between the 25th
June and the 12th November :—

91,800 30,900 122,700

Note.—All casualties are sent by river to the
railheads of the India Command. :

152. Incidence of Disease. The period
June to November has witnessed a steady
fall in the sick rate. The daily rate per

1729

thousand of 4.2, at the peak period in
June, compares favourably with the peak
figure of 6.0 in 1943. In November, the in-
cidence was only 3.0 compared wita 5.0 per
thousand in the same month last year. This
reduction was mainly due to the fall in the
malaria rate, which is due to a steady im-
provement in malaria discipline.

153, D.D.T. had not been used on a scale
adequate to show its capabilities, but experi-
ments were being made. ,

154, Apart from malaria, there were two
other somewhat serious outbreaks of disease ;
dysentery, which reached its peak in June
and July, and scrub typhus, which caused
much sickness between August and October.
The dysentery died down in October, but em-
phasised once more the necessity for maintain-
ing a high standard of sanitation. Effective
preventive measures against scrub typhus have
been discovered by the medical officer who
was lent to South-East Asia Command by the
Colonial Office and attached to my head-
quarters.

155. Since my first Despatch, the consulting
physician, surgeon, malariologist and psychia-
trist have arrived at, this Headquarters and
their advice has proved most valuable.

156. Casualties. The following table gives
a summary of our battle casualties from the
1st July to the Ist November and, for compari-
son,:a statement showing the Japanese
casualties during the same period. The
numbers of enemy killed are those whose
bodies were actually counted and they do not
include the casualties inflicted by our air
action:

The Japanese losses in killed alone exceeded

Welfare and Morale.

157. British Troops. The morale of the
troops has reached a high level, for they have
shown their superiority over the Japanese.

The main interest of the British troops is
centred in repatriation. Service in a distant
Eastern Theatre is unpopular and the British
soldier looks forward to going Home. The
handling of this important question by the
Government appeared in the eyes of the men
unsympathetic, but the reduction in the period
of service overseas has convinced the men of
the sincerity of the Government. .

The grant of Japanese Campaign Pay and
War Service Increment and the White Paper
on Release were generally welcomed.

158. “Mail” and “Rations” improved
greatly ; the film situation also improved and
additional Kinema Sections were allotted to

South-East Asia Command. “ Live Entertain-
ment” remained inadequate, for there were
too few E.N.S.A. shows and Indian Concert
Parties. Radio entertainment was increased to
thirty hours per week. The newspaper
“S.E.A.C.” grew in popularity, its circulation
by November having reached some 30,000
copies daily. Travelling facilities for men going
on leave continued, however, to be bad, in spite
of strenuous efforts that were made to improve
them. Shortage of railway equipment and
rolling stock caused many of the difficulties.

159. I wish to mention three institutions m
Imphal which did much to alleviate conditions
in the forward area: —

(a) An Officers’ Club was opened, the
popularity of which proved that it filled a
long felt want.

(6) Toc H Canteen, known as “The
Elephant Arms”, had an average nightly
attendance of 1,000 British soldiers. The
attached leave hostel was also popular.
