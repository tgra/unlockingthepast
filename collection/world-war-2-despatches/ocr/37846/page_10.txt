fought so valiantly against the Italians through-
out the winter months, were hardly in a position
to withstand the extra pressure of the German
forces. Withdrawal from Albania in the Koritsa
area had been considered expedient by British
commanders before the German invasion began.
However, the Greeks did not take a sufficiently
strategic view of warfare to allow such a with-
drawal to be carried out without seriously affect-
ing the morale of the army. This was especially
the case when wrested from the despised Italian
invaders. To give up their acquisition of their
own free will and to see it fall once more into
the hands of the Italians was for the Greek
fighting soldier in the line an intolerable idea.
When in fact, the withdrawal was eventually
forced upon them, it was too late for the Greeks,
reliant upon mule and bullock-cart transport,
to conduct an orderly retreat. Morale and
organisation collapsed. The Greek army com-
mander at Yannina capitulated to the Germans.
As the situation in this area deteriorated, it
became increasingly obvious that it was neces-
sary to withdraw the R.A.F. Western Wing,
consisting of one Blenheim and one Gladiator
squadron. This was successfully carried out in
spite of difficulties which arose as the result
of numbers of Yugo-Slav aircraft and personnel
arriving at Paramythia aerodrome and requiring
fuel and food right up to the last moment.

15th—aqth April. and Withdrawal.

43. At this juncture, I decided to abolish the
Eastern Wing and take over control of all opera-
tions from Athens, I left an R.A.F. officer
at Force H.Q. to act as liaison between the army
commander in the field and myself. Later,
when Force handed over the direction of the
withdrawal to Anzac Corps, this officer was
attached there. The army commander desired
only reconnaissance and fighter protection which
we did all we could to provide.

Throughout the withdrawal, the army co-
operation squadron carried out what recon-
naissance they could. After they had evacuated
Kazaklar, north of Larissa, they operated their
few aircraft from Pharsala,. which by this time
was serviceable. Later they operated from
Amphiklia, just behind the Thermopylae line.
Here there was a Greek Gladiator squadron
which was ground straffed and destroyed as
soon as the Germans were able to locate their
fighters on the aerodromes on the Larissa plain.

e army co-operation squadron’s Hurricanes
were not on the aerodrome at the time of the
ground straffing, and so luckily escaped, but I
considered it wiser to bring them back to the
Athens area.

In view of the complete numerical superiority
enjoyed by the enemy, I decided to operate my
Blenheim squadrons by night as much as
possible in efforts to delay, as far as lay in our

wer, the enemy’s advance. But after the
decision to evacuate had been taken, the whole
weight of the German Air Force was turned on
the Athens area and there was no alternative
but to save what air crews and material re-
mained. These squadrons ferried the remainder
of'the personnel of their squadrons to Crete and
carried out their instructions with discipline and
courage in the face of great peril.

Direction of Bombing Effort.

44. As far as the direction of bombing is con-
cerned, the operations against the Germans fol-
lowed four clearly defined phases:

SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 9 JANUARY, 10947

The first phase, lasting for about two days,
was the disclosure of the enemy plan prior to
gaining contact with our troops. During this
phase, bombing was directed at previously
arranged targets in the Struma valley, including
Petrich, Simitli, Gorna Djumaya and Sofia.

During the second phase, in which the direc-
tion of the German advance was recognised and
in which every possible effort was made to
alleviate pressure thrown against the Yugo-Slav
armies in the west and the Greek armies in the
Salonika area, bombing was directed against
supply columns and concentrations of enemy
M.T. at the bottleneck around Strumitsa, where
the German forces divided into two columns.

The third phase, in which a serious threat
developed against the British armies in the
region of the Monastir gap, was devoted to the
bombing of bottlenecks, railway junctions,
stations, bridges, defiles and concentrations of
enemy M.T. on roads leading towards the Mon-
astir Gap, from Skoplje, Veles, Prilep to Bitolj.

The fourth phase was the direction of all our
air effort in hindering and delaying the advanc-
ing Germans to allow our army to conduct a
successful withdrawal. All our resources were
thrown into the task of alleviating the pressure
on our forces in order to allow them the maxi-
mum amount of time to withdraw and to
prepare new positions.

Targets were chosen at poinis where it was
calculated that the effect of dislocation would
be most widespread amongst advancing German
columns, and yet close enough to the rear of
the German fighting troops to have the maxi-
mum immediate effect upon the progress of
their advance.

It is impossible to calculate the degree of
success which this policy attained, but German
prisoners who fell into our hands told woeful
tales of the heavy bombing which they had
suffered from the R.A.F. throughout their
advance. On the night 14/15th, our Welling-
tons created much chaos at Veles and broke
the bridge across the Vardar. A glance at the
map will at once show the importance of a
dislocation in the German L. of C. at this point.
It is the hinge upon which one, perhaps the
greatest, of the main German drives depended.

The continual bombing of M.T. which pre-
sented some of the best targets which our
Blenheim pilots, accustomed to such targets
as dispersed vehicles in the desert, had ever
known, caused much confusion amongst the
enemy.

Withdrawal of Fighter Squadrons.

45. The fighters were withdrawn to the Athens
area, since no aerodrome north of this was free
from ground straffing. The constant lack of
intermediary aerodromes made it inevitable that,
if our fighters were placed on an aerodrome
from which they could give protection to our
troops, they were in imminent danger of destruc-
tion by ground straffing as soon as they were
on the ground. If, on the other hand, they
were placed beyond the range of ground straff-
ing, they were unable to protect our troops and
the tightly packed columns of M.T. withdrawing
along the roads. The utmost efforts were made
to give the maximum protection to our con-
tinually harassed troops. All our machines
were working to maximum capacity. Many of
our pilots were working at extreme range, chal-
lenging untold odds and at times, after they
