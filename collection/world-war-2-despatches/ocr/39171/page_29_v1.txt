To General Sir Claude Auchinleck my principal thanks are due, because without his wholehearted and generous support and wise advice, 11 Army Group could not have achieved success. I can never adequately express my gratitude for all he has done.

I should also like to include in my thanks to him my gratitude to his staff for their unselfish help during many months.

I wish also to thank Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Peirse, and the R.A.F. and the US.A.AF. for their magnificent support during the fighting in Arakan, Assam and in Central and Northern Burma.

Admiral Sir James Somerville gave every assistance possible to the Army, though resources did not permit of a major combined operation.

Upon Lieut.-General Slim, Commander, Fourteenth Army, fell the brunt of operations and well and truly did he stand up to the strain of the continuous and heavy fighting which began in February and ended in August. He remained unshaken during the Japanese offensive and was quick to take advantage of opportunities to counter-attack. To him is due the resounding victory achieved by Fourteenth Army this year.

Lieut.-General Scoones greatly distinguished himself in command of 4 Corps upon which the principal strain of the fighting fell during the operations round Imphal between February and June. Lieut.-General Christison in command of 15 Indian Corps in Arakan first defeated the Japanese in Burma, He has shown fine qualities of leadership.

Lieut.-General Stopford, Commander, 33 ,

Corps, showed great staying power, professional knowledge and dash in the operations which ae finally in opening the Kohima Imphal road.

To my own staff ; officers, N.C.Os. and men ; I owe the greatest debt of gratitude for their splendid support and their fine team work. Always shorthanded, split into two with one detachment 1,500 miles from the other, they have never failed to do the work which has continued steadily to increase.

It is difficult to single out from so many firstrate officers and men, many individuals for special praise, but I must mention particularly my two principal Staff Officers upon whom fell special responsibility.

Major-General I. S. O. Playfair, M.G., G.S., has been the greatest help to me throughout, but especially after the staff was split in April when he went to Kandy as my representative. There, the whole responsibility for representing my point of view to the Supreme Allied Commander fell upon him. I relied entirely upon his unfailing judgment, strength of character and tact and he never failed me.

Major-General E. N. Goddard, M.G.A., 11 Army Group, must have carried one of the heaviest administrative loads in any theatre of war. No man could have discharged his duties with more unsparing devotion and no operations could have  succeeded if his work had not been of the highest standard.
