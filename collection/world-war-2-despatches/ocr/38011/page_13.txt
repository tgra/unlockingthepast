SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON

28. Captain L. E. H. Maund acted as my
‘Chief Staff Officer; he was assiduous and un-
tiring in his work and in all administrative
matters of the greatest help. To him can be
given much of the credit for successful
evacuation.

29. Finally, J must express my gratitude to
Lieutenant-General C, J. E. Auchinleck in
whom I could not wish for a better colleague.
His sound and soldierly views on all subjects
were of great assistance and support and the
period of our service together will for me always
‘be a pleasant memory.

(Signed) Corx & ORrerRY,
Admiral of the Fleet.

APPENDIX “A”.
REPORT ON OPERATIONS IN NORTHERN
NORWAY.

14th April to 13th May, r940.

The following Report was submitted to the
Secretary of State for War on 15th May,
1940, by Major-General P. J. Mackesy, C.B.,
D.S.0., MC.

Harstad, 15th May, 1940.
‘srr,

I have the honour to report that I handed
over command of this Force to Lieutenant-
General C. J. E. Auchinleck, C.B., C.S.L.,
DS.O., O.B.E., at 1830 hours on the 13th
May. I submit the following brief report to the
Secretary of State for War of events up to that
time.

2. I arrived in the Narvik area, actually in
‘Vaags Fjord, in H.M.S. Southampton at
daylight on the 14th April. I was accom-
spanied by a small staff and had on board two
companies of the rst Bn. The Scots Guards and
some details. ’

3. Having first ascertained that Harstad was
not in enemy occupation.and having obtained
some information from local officials at that
Place, I proceeded to obtain touch with the
6th Norwegian Division under Major-General
‘Fleischer, whose headquarters proved to be in
‘the Bardu area. The two companies ist Bn.
The Scots Guards were landed at Salangs-
‘Verket and Sjoveien on the Sag Fjord during
the afternoon and were put in touch with
‘elements of the 6th Norwegian Division. This
-early contact and the subsequent co-operation
of this detachment with our Allies had an im-
portant effect upon the spirit and determination
-of the Allied Forces.

4. Durink-the 14th April and the following
-days all available information pointed to Narvik
itself being stfangly held and to the fact that
‘the naval actioit,of the 13th April had by no
means demoralized the garrison as a whole.
‘The probability was that the garrison had in
fact been increased by nearly 1,000 good fight-
ing men from the sunken German ships: this
was fully confirmed by subsequent intelligence
reports. My troops had been ‘embarked for a
peaceful landing at a friendly and organized port
and could not be ready for active operations for
.some days. I decided therefore to disembark
the Force at Harstad and to establish my base
cthere also in the first instance.

GAZETTE, 10 JULY, 1047 2379
5. Disembarkation at Harstad was carried
out under great difficulty. Transports had to
lie at considerable distances—ro miles and
more—from the harbour and signal communi-
cation between ship and shore was impossible.
Air attacks, against which my force had no
defence, complicated the operation. However
disembarkation of the first flight of the force
was completed on the evening of 16th April.

6. Although nobody without personal ex-
perience of Arctic winter conditions can pos-
sibly picture the climatic difficulties we
experienced in the early days, a word or two
of description may not be out of place. The
country was covered by snow up to 4 feet and
more in depth. Even at sea level there were
several feet of snow. Blizzards, heavy snow
storms, bitter winds and very low night tem-
peratures were normal. Indeed until the
middle of May even those magnificent mountain
soldiers, the French Chasseurs Alpins, suffered
severely from frost bite and snow blindness.
Troops who were not equipped with and skilled
in the use of skis or snow shoes were absolutely
incapable of operating tactically at all. I had
no such troops at my disposal when I first
landed. Shelter from the weather was of vital
importance.

7. It soon became certain that the enemy
held Narvik in considerable strength. All the
existing defences had been handed over intact
by the Norwegian garrison. A personal recon-
naissance convinced me that topography
favoured the defence and that an opposed land-
ing was quite out of the question so long
as the deep snow and existing weather con-
ditions persisted and so long as my force Jacked
landing craft, tanks, adequate artillery sup-
port, adequate anti-aircraft defence and air co-
operation. The problem was, of course, not
merely one of landing, but one of yathiens out
a subsequent advance of several miles; yet,
owing to the configuration of the ground, not
even during the first mile could support be
given by ships’ guns,

I decided therefore that my first objective
must be to secure the Oijord and Ankenes
peninsulas, North and South of Narvik, from
which in due course observed artillery fire could
be brought to bear on the enemy defences.
Both these peninsulas were held by the enemy.

‘With this in view I moved the ist Bn,
The Irish Guards to the Bogen area and (at
a later date) the 2nd Bn. The South Wales
Borderers to Ballangen. The detachment of
the 1st Bn. The Scots Guards, under Major
L. Graham, M.C., which I had landed in the
Sag Fjord on 14th April, moved forward to
co-operate with the 6th Norwegian Division in
the Forsbakken area. The state of the roads,
lying under 2 to 4 feet of snow and ice, and
the impossibility of moving across country
without skis, prevented further progress by
these forces for the time being.

8. On the 2oth April Admiral of the Fleet
the Earl of Cork and Orrery was placed in
sole command of the operations. It may how-
ever be convenient to have on record a brief
summary of the subsequent operations from an
army point of view. On 24th April a naval
bombardment of the Narvik defences was
carried out with the object of making the enemy
surrender. “The ist Bn. The Irish Guards,

- embarked in one of H.M. Ships, were held
