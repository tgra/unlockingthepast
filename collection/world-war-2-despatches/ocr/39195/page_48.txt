Fourth, in the area of Mawchi and to the
north were H.Q. 15th Japanese Army, 56 Divi-
sion (less 113 Regiment), 15 Division, 144 Regi-
ment of 55 Division and various other units.
_ Fifth, to the east of the Sittang from Shweg-
yin down to Moulmein, were H.Q. Burma Area
Army, H.Q. 33rd Japanese Army, 31 and 33
Divisions, 24 Independent Mixed Brigade and
L. of C. and Base units.

270. This force was not in fact as formidable
as it first appears. 56 Division and 24 Inde-
pendent Mixed Brigade were the only major
formations which had not been severely
handled, with the loss of a large proportion of
their artillery and transport. Moreover these
two formations alone had managed to retain
their inter-communication systems reasonably
intact, There was therefore, I appreciated, no
immediate possibility of a major counter-offen-
sive, and the only possible intention of the
Japanese would be to extricate those troops
west of the Sittang from their almost hopeless
situation. .

271. I also appreciated that, in broad terms,
the Japanese would endeavour to hold the east
bank of the Sittang as a rear-guard position
under cover of which the bulk of their forces
now west of the river could be withdrawn east
into Siam or south to Moulmein. While this
was in progress the Japanese were likely to
oppose any advances by our forces on the
Taunggyi and Mawchi roads as likely to turn
their position, and cut off or disrupt an
organized withdrawal south or east of his
forces west of the Sittang. Elements of 56
and 15 Japanese Divisions did in fact oppose
our advance on the Taunggyi and Mawchi
roads respectively until the surrender.

It was obvious that the extrication of the
Japanese formations west of the river was an
operation involving tremendous difficulties.
There were the truly formidable natural
obstacles of the Irrawaddy, the Pegu Yomas
mountains and the Sittang to be crossed, during
the monsoon, by jungle tracks and without
wheeled transport or river crossing equipment.
They were also already cut off from all normal
supply and while they might live by foraging
they could not be maintained in ammunition
and other expendable military stores. Our air
superiority forbad the use of air supply.

272. Against this situation, Fourteenth Army
was in general extended over several hundreds
of miles on the Yenangyaung—Rangoon and
Mandalay—Rangoon axes. It was only pos-
sible under such conditions to hold key points
and patrol the intervening gaps, while the
movement eastwards of the considerable body
of enemy might well disrupt our tenuous lines
of communication.

Although we had gained a valuable fort-
night by the capture of Rangoon from the sea,
the administrative situation now limited our
capabilities for further action, coupled as it was
with the necessity to begin immediately the
preparations for the attack on Malaya.
Although it is dealt with in Part II of this
Despatch, I think it desirable to draw atten-
tion here to the two routes by which our sup-
plies arrived, and to point out that I was
Tesponsible not only for the maintenance of
the Army, but also for that of all Naval and
Air Force bases in Burma and for the carriage

to distribution centres in Burma of civil
supplies. .

The Northern supply route ran by rail to
Manipur Road in Assam thence by road
through Imphal to Kalewa then by Inland
Water Transport to Myingan, and finally by
rail to Thazi for distribution. It could be
supplemented by air transport from Imphal to

‘Myingan, but this method was as liable to

monsoon interruption as was the worn-out road
route. In fact, the rapid deterioration of this
route had already caused 4 Corps to be put on
half rations as a precautionary measure.

The Southern supply route was by sea to
Chittagong, Akyab or Kyaukpyu and thence
by air to Central Burma or Inland Water
Transport to troops in Arakan.

273. It was therefore essential to open, de-
velop and stock Rangoon as the main lbase for
Southern Burma, and improve its communica-
tions northwards as rapidly as possible. This
was underlined by the administrative problems
with which we would be faced when operating
in the Moulmein area, for here roads were few,
and monsoon conditions precluded the main-
tenance by sea of an advance down the Tenas-
serim coast. Finally, no further resources of
aircraft or shipping were available, and I was
forced to the conclusion that no major opera-
tion could be undertaken at any distance from
the main Mandalay—Rangoon road or railway.

274. I accordingly directed General Slim to
complete the destruction of the enemy west of
the Sittang and to maintain constant pressure
against Moulmein, Mawchi and Taunggyi.

SECTION XVI (paras. 275-281) OPERATIONS
IN (May

New orders issued by General Slim : Arakan
operations: 4 Corps operations: 33 Corps
operations : Note on guerilla organizations.

275. To carry out the tasks I had now given
him (see para. 274) General Slim issued fresh
orders to his subordinate commanders. Besides
4 and 33 Corps, General Slim had 26 Indian
and 36 British Divisions, and 64 Indian Brigade
(19 Indian Division), under his direct control.

He instructed 4 Corps (General Messervy)
to capture Mokpalin and Bilin, east of the
Sittang and reconnoitre towards Moulmein : to
destroy any enemy forces attempting to escape
from the Pegu Yomas across the Mandalay—
Rangoon road and railway; and to capture
Thandaung on the road from Toungoo to
Mawchi.

33 Corps (General Stopford) at the same
time was ordered to destroy the enemy in the
Irrawaddy Valley, open the Prome—Rangoon
road and railway, and capture Bassein. 26
Indian Division was ordered to advance on
Prome from Rangoon to meet 33 Corps, and on
the 15th May a battalion group from 2 British
Division (then in the Rangoon area) was sent
to carry out the capture of Bassein.

Finally General Slim ordered 64 Indian In-
fantry Brigade to relieve 36 British Division
on the Taunggyi—Thazi road and capture
Kalaw, the Brigade coming under command
of 4 Corps on the 18th May.

276. In Arakan there remained 82 (West
African) Division directly under: my control,
