to 15th AUGUST 1942.

‘The following Despatch was submitted to the
Secretary of State for War on 27th January,

. 1943, by GENERAL SIR CLAUDE J. E.
AUCHINLECK, G.C.LE., C.B., CSL,
DS.O., O.B.E., A.D.C., Commander-in-
Chief, The Middle East Forces.

INTRODUCTION,

Of the numerous problems of the Middle East
Command two ranked high above all others:
to destroy the enemy in North Africa and to

* secure the northern flank.

I had always conceived the former to be my
prime task, for the presence of strong and well-
equipped Axis forces in Cyrenaica was a con-
stant menace to our base in Egypt. I planned
to occupy the whole of Libya, Tripolitania as
well as Cyrenaica, so as to leave the enemy
no foothold whence he might, at some future
date, revive the threat to Egypt. Moreover, it
‘was always possible that we might eventually
launch an offensive against Italy herself,
and as a stepping stone it seemed essential to
capture Tripoli. This policy had the full
approval of His Majesty’s Government.

The other problem, however, I could not for
‘ome moment neglect. The danger that Ger-
many might attack Turkey and that Turkey
might collapse was always present. Moreover
the German invasion of Russia, which pro-
gressed at first with alarming rapidity, meant
that danger threatened the Northern Front
from the Caucasus also. .

Swift as their initial advance was, it seemed
impossible that the Germans should appear in
the Caucasus before the early spring of 1942,
and I thought it might be possible to destroy
the German and Italian army in North Africa
‘before that should occur. In November, there
-were sufficient troops already in the Middle East
-and enough reinforcements promised, to allow

me to conduct an offensive in the west and yet
be able to turn in time to stave off a possible

threat from the north. The scope of the pro-
posed offensive was ambitious, but it could be
contemplated without running undue risks else-
where, provided that the destruction of most
of the enemy forces was effected in Eastern
Cyrenaica. Above all, it was essential that
there should be no delay.

The offensive was a success, but rather
slower, more costly, and less complete than I
had hoped. Nevertheless, of the enemy forces
in Cyrenaica over two-thirds were destroyed.

Even before Cyrenaica had been recon-
quered, war had broken out with Japan, and
His Majesty’s Government were obliged to
divert to the Far East two divisions and certain
air force reinforcements intended for the Middle
East. But there was still no necessity to rescind
the decision to invade Tripolitania. The suc-
cessful Russian counter-offensive in the winter
of 1941-42 offset the loss of promised reinforce-
ments in point of time, but not as regards the
size of the forces which would eventually be
required to garrison the whole Command, if
the Germans should take the offensive once
more and defeat the Russians. We were always
handicapped. in our calculations, I may say,
by lack of knowledge of Soviet capabilities and
intentions. However, so important to the con-
duct of the war as a whole were the advan-
tages of securing Tripoli, that it was worth
taking further risks. .

While we were preparing to resume the offen-
sive, two Australian divisions were recalled
from Syria and Palestine to the Pacific theatre
and several air force squadrons were withdrawn
to the Far East.

In January, 1942, the enemy attacked, thus
anticipating our proposed invasion of Tripoli-
tania. Though our naval forces and aircraft
had drastically restricted the enemy’s build-up
of supplies in Africa during the latter half of
1942, by the end of the year the situation had

“changed greatly to our disadvantage. Power-

ful German naval and air reinforcements now
