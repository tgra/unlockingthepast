SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

by General de Larminat,* advanced up Route 2
on the right of Fifth Army with two divisions,
I Motorised and 3 Algerian. On the r1th they

seized Montefiascone and on the 18th stormed’

the strong position of Radicofani, the highest
point on the road from Rome to Florence. By
the zoth advanced elements were on the Orcia
river, a tributary of the Ombrone. Our main
forces had now reached the line on which the
enemy had decided to stand but on the Adriatic
they were not yet up with that line which in this
sector was the River Chienti. On 16th June I
had instructed the Poles to press on with all
possible speed to secure the capture of Ancona.
The Polish advance was indeed rapid and by
the 2oth they had crossed the River Aso and
captured Fermo and Pedaso. On the 2ist they
even managed to secure a small bridgehead over
the Chienti but next day this was destroyed
by a heavy enemy counter-attack. It was clear
that to force the Chienti would require a full
Corps attack. General Anders} decided that in
view of the time needed for concentration and
for bringing up the necessary supplies and
ammunition the probable date would be 4th
July. I agreed to this plan and proposed to
stage the attack in such a way as to be able to
press directly on from the Chienti to Ancona,
some twenty-two miles beyond the river.

On 14th June I divided my headquarters,
and, leaving the bulk of ,the administrative
branches and services in Caserta, to follow to
Rome when space was available, I created a
small Advanced Headquarters, consisting of
my operational staff only. This was the system
on which I had worked in Tunisia and Sicily
and, now that the comparatively static period of
the winter was over, I was anxious to be as
close behind the Armies as possible. On rqth
June I opened this advanced headquarters at
Frascati, using for offices a small building which
had previously been used for the same purpose
by Field-Marshal Kesselring. This was soon
left too far behind by the speed of our advance,
and on 25th June I moved to a camp site on
the eastern shores of Lake Bolsena.

The capture of Elba, early plans for which
I have already mentioned, took place about
this time. I originally wanted this operation
to be Jaunched if possible before the spring
offensive opened but it had been postponed to
a date between 2oth and 25th May. On 16th
May I was informed that it had been further
postponed till mid-June. This removed almost
all the value of the operation as by that time
our troops, advancing overland, would be
almost level with the island and on rath June
I asked whether the forces earmarked for Elba
could not rather be used for a landing on the’
mainland in support of Fifth Army. However,
this was considered unacceptable as the French
would not consent to the use in Italy of ‘g
Colonial Infantry Division, which they wanted
to keep for the landings in France. The opera-
tion therefore went in as planned in the early
morning of 17th June; the occupation of the
island was complete by the afternoon of the
roth. Steps were taken to emplace medium
guns in the north-eastern corner of the island
to command Piombino but the town fell on
25th June without the necessity for their use.

The Battle of the Trasimene Line.

It was clear that Kesselring had now decided
not merely to stiffen his delaying resistance
but to make a stand, although he was
approaching the broadest part of the Italian
peninsula. He calculated that the momentum
of our pursuit, after the exhilaration of the
chase north from Rome, now left a hundred
and thirty miles behind, must be starting to
flag and that he had his own troops well
enough under control again to rally them for
a defensive action on a coherent front; by thus
imposing a pause on us he would gain time
and space to prepare the ‘‘ Gothic ’’ line. His
decision began to make itself felt about 2oth

‘June. The chosen line was based on the east

coast on the River Chienti; west of the
Apennines the key points were’ the high
ground north of Perugia, Lake Trasimene and
Chiusi, from where the line continued east-
wards along the River Astrone to the Orcia
and the upper Ombrone. By now the Germans
were to a certain extent reorganised and re-
grouped and both armies were on the same
line and fairly well balanced in strength. They
had nineteen divisions, admittedly nearly all
under strength, in the line and six in reserve;
as against this we were maintaining the pur-
suit with nine only. The Army boundary ran
through Montepulciano with Tenth Army east
and Fourteenth west. On the Adriatic Tenth
Army had LI Mountain Corps of four divisions,
tather under strength. From the Tiber to the
Army boundary was LXXVI Panzer Corps
with seven divisions, including the good 15
Panzer Grenadier, 1 Parachute and Hermann ,
Goering Divisions; it was this Corps which was
given the task of delaying our Io and 13 Corps
either side of Lake Trasimene. In Fourteenth
Army 1 Parachute Corps, between Monte-
pulciano and Montalcino, had four divisions in
the line, including 26 Panzer and 29 Panzer
Grenadier. XIV Panzer Corps, on the west
coast, was weaker; it had five divisions but
only two, the 3rd and 90 Panzer Grenadiers,
were of good quality and the other three were
definitely poor. As the situation here deteriorated
this Corps had to be reinforced with battle
groups from two other divisions, 16 S.S. and
42 Jaeger. The general situation, however,
was hopeful -for the Germans; their best
divisions were equally spaced at the vital points
and had received heavy of reinforce-
ments and 34 Division was in process of arriv-
ing from the Russian front.

The line selected for a stand had been well
chosen, in spite of its length.” There were no
very obvious natural obstacles to our advance,
except the river lines on the two coasts, and
no prepared defences; but the country is hilly
and in general thickly cultivated, especially
in the vine-growing areas in the centre of the
line. Our own lines of communication were
severely stretched and these difficulties would
not be eased before the capture of Leghorn and
Ancona. The reconstruction of the railways
was being pushed ahead with good speed but
at the moment Eighth Army railhead was back
at Roccasecca, two hundred miles from the
battle front. The time had also been well
chosen for two reasons, one of which was a
most unusual spell of bad weather between 17th

*The position was apparently reconnoitred in
August 1943 when the Germans considered holding
aline Grosseto—Monte—Amiata—Perugia—Ancona.
