that they might make some stand in the Tid-
dim area. If they did so, their forces would
be threatened by the advance of our troops
down the Kabaw Valley.

76. The East Africans had advanced a
further 15 miles down the Kabaw Valley
towards Kalemyo, and had reached a point
26 miles south of Htinzin. Bad weather was
a greater obstacle to their advance than the
enemy,

Other East African troops had occupied
Sittaung on the Chindwin on the 4th September
and established a bridgehead on the eastern
bank of the river. They were relieved in this
area by an Indian formation at the end of the
month. ¥

71. North Burma. 36 British Division,
moving down the Myitkyina -Mandalay rail-
way, had entered Hopin unopposed on the 7th
September. They found 500 Japanese bodies
in the precincts of the village. By the end of
September, patrols had reached Mohnyin.

Chinese troops in the Kazu area had
advanced eleven miles south of the village.

78. Order of Battle (Moves). The last of the
Long-Range Penetration Brigades of Special
Force was withdrawn from Burma into India
during the month.

17 Indian Light Division left 33 Corps for
India.

2 British Division and 20 Indian Division
were resting at Imphal; 7 Indian Division
was at Kohima and 23 Indian Division at
Shillong.

79. Record of 33 Corps. In the six months
ending September, 33 Corps, which first took
the field at Dimapur in April, had done sterling
work. During an advance of nearly 300 miles
to the Tiddim area and about 270 to Yazago
in the Kabaw Valley, 9,746 of the enemy were
killed and 459 Japanese and 331 J.LF.
prisoners taken. 81 guns and 1,284 vehicles
had been captured.

80. Revised Task for 15 Indian Corps.
On the 28th September, the Commander,
Fourteenth Army, in view of the re-grouping
of the Japanese forces in Arakan, issued a
fresh Operation Instruction to 15 Indian Corps.
The bulk of 55 Japanese Division had been
transferred from North Arakan into the lower
Irrawaddy Valley, leaving a force of approxi-
mately four battalions in the forward area.
Three more enemy battalions belonging to 54
Japanese Division were on Akyab Island and
in the lower Kaladan Delta, and five battalions
were in the coastal area between the Barongas
and Cheduba Island. Thus the enemy was in
no position to launch a serious attack. The
tasks allotted to 15 Indian Corps on the 4th
September were, therefore, changed and the
Commander was ordered—

(a) To secure the area Chittagong—Cox’s
Bazaar to prevent the enemy’s interference
with our preparations for a future airborne
offensive.

(6) To secure the estuary of the Naf as
a ee for light coastal forces and landing
craft.

(c) To carry out reconnaissance, bombard-
ments and raids from the sea along the
whole Arakan coast to force the enemy to
lock up troops in this area.

@) To exploit any withdrawal or thinning
out of the Japanese forces in Arakan.

SUPPLEMENT to THe LONDON GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 1951

mander issued an Instruction 1o :33 Corps
which stated that :—

{a) His intention was to concentrate

and destroy him.

(b) The tasks of 33 Corps were:—

@ To capture the area Kalemyo-

alewa.

(ii) To advance eastwards as quickly
as possible and capture the Ye-U area
with the object of establishing air strips.
(c) 4 Corps was concentrating in the

The troops allotted to 33 Corps were 2
British Division, 5 and 20 Indian Divisions,
11 (East African) Division, and the Lushai
Brigade, but 5 Indian Division would be with-
drawn into Army reserve when Kalemyo had
been captured.

221 Group R.A.F. would be responsible for
air support, and air supply would increase
progressively from 244 tons per day on the
ist October to 364 tons from the 1st November
onwards,

82. On the 6th October, I told the Com-
mander, Fourteenth Army, that 3 Commando
Brigade (four Commandos) would be placed
under his command from mid-October, and
that they were to be employed to encourage
the enemy to believe that amphibious opera-
tions were imminent on the Arakan coast.

83. I issued an important Instruction to the
Commander, Fourteenth Army, on the Ilth
October, regarding Allied operations in Burma,
1944-45. In this, I repeated a Directive
teceived from the Supreme Allied Commander,
which stated that:— :

“ Allied Forces in South-East Asia Com-
mand will conduct concerted offensive opera-
tions with the object of destroying or
expelling all Japanese forces in Burma at the
earliest date. Operations to achieve this
object must not, however, prejudice the
security of the existing air supply route to
China, including the air staging port at
Myitkyina, and the opening of overland
communications.”

I confirmed in more detail the objectives
for which I had ordered plans to be prepared
in my Instruction of the 29th July.

The Fourteenth Army Order of Battle
was:—

33 Corps—2 British Division, 5 Indian
Division initially, 11 (East African) Division,
20 Indian Division, 254 Indian Tank
Brigade, Lushai Brigade, 268 Indian Lorried
Infantry Brigade (subsequently transferred to
4 Corps). 4 Corps—7 and 19 Indian Divi-
sions, 50 Indian Parachute Brigade for a
specific airborne operation. 255 Indian
Tank Brigade, which was to move to Imphal
in October. 28 (East African) Brigade, due
to move to Imphal in November.

I have given the composition of each Corps,
but the allotment of divisions to Corps was,
a coUrn left to the Commander, Fourteenth

ry.
