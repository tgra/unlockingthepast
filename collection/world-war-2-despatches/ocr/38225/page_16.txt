1604 SUPPLEMENT to tae LONDON GAZETTE, 4 MARCH, 1948

28. During the day ‘great efforts had been
made to find a suitable beach for BACHA-
QUERO, whose draught was 6 feet forward and
15 feet aft. A beach was eventually found
close North of Red centre at the foot of Windsor
Castle. The approach to this beach lay
through the minefield. However, BACHA-
QUERO was swept through by CROMARTY
who cut 2 mines, and her cargo landed near
Red Beach centre in 14 minutes,

2g. Before night fell I ordered AURICULA
to be abandoned by her ship’s company.
‘Destroyers and A/S corvettes were disposed
for A/S patrol.

30. General Sturges arrived from the Flag-
ship in a destroyer and after consultation in
KEREN proceeded ashore. Situation reports
up to the end of D.1 indicated that No. 5
Commando had captured the whole of the
Andrakaka Peninsula, and that the agth
Brigade had reached a line about 3 miles South
of Antsirane town, where heavy opposition
had been encountered.

May 6th, Day Two.

31. After daylight LIGHTNING and
LAFOREY engaged the enemy post still hold-
INDOMITABLE

Diego Suarez harbour, whose fire was con-
trolling the road to Diego Suarez North. At
0744 INDOMITABLE reported this ship, which
proved to be the D’ENTRECASTEAUX, as
being on fire. LAFOREY, LIGHTNING and
PAKENHAM took up positions to engage
targets indicated by F.0.0.s, LAFOREY
bombarding D’'ENTRECASTEAUX at
extreme range.

32. At daylight AURICULA was- observed

.to be lower in the water and as an emergency

measure FREESIA was ordered to tow her to
shallow water; the effort however was too great
and AURICULA broke in half and sank at
0823. .

33- H.M.S. RAMILLIES, wearing the flag
of S.O.F. arrived and anchored at ZD and
proceeded to fuel.

34. The landing continued at full speed, the
13th Brigade being landed on completion of
the 17th Bngade. All personnel numbering
approximately 10,000 men were ashore by
1700.

35. About 1600 a mine exploded in POOLE’s
sweep and severely wounded her First
Lieutenant, who, I deeply regret to report,
died of his wounds. He was buried at sea
from POOLE.

36. General Sturges came on board and out-

-lined the plan of attack on Antsirane for the

might, which included the entry of H.MS.
ANTHONY n the port of Diego Suarez and the
landing of H.M.S. RAMILLIES’ Royal
Marines at Antsirane.

Day Three: 7th May.

37. From about midnight various reports
were received from GENISTA on A/S patrol,
indicating that she had been in contact with
a submarine, had attacked and lost contact
North West of Nosi Hara. PAKENHAM,
LAFOREY and corvettes proceeded to assist in
the search. At 0500 an aircraft from ILLUS-
TROUS sighted the French submarine LE
HEROS on the surface outside the reefs North

East of Nosi Fati and sank her by torpedo.

- The first news of this received in KEREN was

an aircraft report at 0548 that submarine
survivors’ were struggling in the water.

38. From 0330 onwards reports of the
successful occupation of Antsirane and subse-
quent negotiations for the signing of a Pro-
tocol began to come in.

39. At 0930 ANTHONY arrived at the main
anchorage escortmg S.S. GREYSTOKE
CASTLE, who had arrived from Durban with
ammuiution and other stores. In view of the
brilliant operation carried out by ANTHONY
the previous night in landing the RMs from
RAMILLIES at Antsirane, I arranged for her
to pass all ships at the anchorage who cleared
lower decks and cheered her with great
enthusiasm.

40. The landing of vehicles and stores.con-
tinued. Returning landing craft conveyed
casualties to the hospital ship. Arrangements
were also made to convey several hundred
prisoners from. Red and Blue Beaches to
ORONSAY, where it had been decided to
accommodate all prisoners.

41. Survivors of the submarine LE HEROS
were interrogated) on board KEREN and a
report signalled to $.0.F. No information con-

cerning the minefields at Diego Suarez could

be obtained from them, The only item of in-
terest was that LE HEROS had left Diego
Suarez on 1st May. and had been patrolling ever
since.

42. On receipt of a signal from SO.F.
approving my proposals to sail slow and fast
convoys for Diego Suarez, preparations were
made to sail the slow convoy at 1600/7th, and
the fast convoy at 0500/8th. A route passing
eight miles North of Cape Amber was selected
and anchor berths for all ships in Scotch Bay
were allocated. .

43. The slow convoy, composed as for Con-
voy Y on passage from Durban with the addi-
tion of GREYSTOKE CASTLE, duly sailed
by the swept channel shortly after 1600,
escorted by D.12 and all available corvettes,
EMPIRE KINGSLEY acting as Commodore as
before.

May 8th. Day Four.

44. All landing craft were ordered to leave
the beaches by 0300 and to be hoisted.

At o§00 the fast convoy, composed as for
‘Convoy Z on passage from Durban, sailed by
the swept channel, escorted by LAFOREY and
JAVELIN. KEREN acted as Commodore.

45. I instructed POOLE, the only remaining
ship at the anchorage, to recover the dan buoys
marking the channel and to follow the Fleet to
Diego Suarez.

46. DEVONSHIRE and additional destroyers
yoined the escort of the corivoy when clear of
the swept channel and aircraft from ILLUSTRI-
OUS carried out A/S reconnaissance. The route
of both convoys to Diego Suarez fortunately
avoided the submarine which was eventually
destroyed by ACTIVE and passage was un-
“eventful though S.E. wind force 8 was ex-
perienced from Cape Amber onwards.

47. The slow convoy entered harbour at
tooo and the fast convoy at 1330, all ships
picking up their berths in Scotch Bay credit-
ably in spite of the strong wind.
