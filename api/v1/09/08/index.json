Chief among them was the great vulnerability of aircraft if caught by accurate H.A.A. fire when in close formation. A good instance of this occurred in an action on the 8th September, when a geschwader of 15 Do. 17s, flying in formation at 15,000 feet, approached a gun site South of River Thames. The opening salvo from the four 3.7-inch guns brought down the three leading aircraft, the remaining machines turning back in disorder, scattering their bombs on the countryside in their flight to the coast. -"

Meanwhile, the very scanty warning of the Italian collapse which I had received was cut still further by the weather. The first attempt to drop two officers by parachute on Rhodes, on oth September, failed, so that the Germans got an extra day in which to organise their positions on the island and to undermine the morale of the Italians. It was not until the night of gthroth September that Major the Lord Jellicoe and another officer were dropped by parachute and established contact with Admiral Campione, the Italian Governor, whose spirit was clearly affected by the delay and by the fact that the Germans were already present whilst we were not."

The 234th Infantry Brigade was in the meantime being prepared for operations, but, owing to th2 limitations of shipping and the time taken to collect it, the brigade could not be ready to sail until 18th September. The urgency was such that this delay was unacceptable, and one battalion was ordered to embark in motor launches and Royal Air Force launches for transit to Rhodes, while preparations for the mounting of the remainder of the brigade went on as fast as possible. It was, however, imperative that we should have a guarantee of unopposed entry into the port of Rhodes and an unopposed occupation of an airfield either at Marizza or on Cos before the expedition could be launched, since a landing against opposition was out of the question. Before anything could be done, the German commander, Von Kleeman, had taken advantage of Campicne\u2019s weakness and indecision, and the Germans assumed undisputed control of Rhodes."

            "description": "This enemy withdrawal made it easier to concentrate forward the Fifth Army troops which were to launch the second punch of my two-handed attack on the \u2018\u2018 Gothic \u2019\u2019 line. Moreover, in the course of the withdrawal Kesselring still further weakened his centre, from which he had already removed 29 Panzer Grenadier Division, by relieving 356 Infantry Division and sending it over. to the Adriatic. I decided, therefore, that the time was almost come for the Fifth Army attack to go in. I visited Eighth Army front on 8th September and it was clear to me from what I saw there that we could not continue our advance on to Rimini until we had driven the enemy off the Coriano ridge. This would need full preparation and would probably take two or three days more. I explained the situation in a signal next day, 9th September, and concluded by saying that for these reasons I had decided to unleash Fifth Army who would now go ahead with their offensive in the centre.

The main blow was to be delivered by II Corps but, in order to gain surprise, its concentration was to be secret and it was to be launched into the attack through 13 Corps. The plan was that 13 Corps should attack first with 8 Indian Division to capture the line of hills from Monte Morello to Monte Giovi, already mentioned, then, in the second phase, II Corps would pass through the left of 13 with its four divisions (34th, 85th, 88th and gist) and advance up the axis Florence-Firenzuola. 13 Corps would shift its main thrust to the right and continue to advance up the two roads Dicomano to Forli and Borgo San Lorenzo to Faenza. IV Corps was to exert the maximum pressure in its area with 6 South African Armoured Division, a Negro Regimental Combat Team and \u2018\u2018 Task Force 45\u2019 and release x Armoured Division for Army reserve to be used if a chance of exploitation arose."

The scheme postulated an increase in capacity of the port of Calcutta that was more extensive than anything previously envisaged. There were no administrative or constructional plans in existence for any such major port development. The idea also demanded the development of 45 airfields in the Calcutta area, fcr which suitable sites (near existing communications) could not be found in the time, and the petrol hft was beyond the capacity of existing transportation facilities."
