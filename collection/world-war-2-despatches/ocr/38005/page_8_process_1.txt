General Remarks,

67. The safe return of ESKIMO and COSSACK to Skjel Fiord was a fitting conclusion to an operation which I consider was an unqualified success.

Seven or eight enemy destroyers and one submarine the total German Naval Forces present were sunk without the loss of a British ship.

(The enemy destroyer already scuttled in Rombaks Fiord vide paragraph 4o may have been abandoned after the attack by the and Destroyer Flotilla on roth April, 1940.)

68. Our casualties also were comparatively small 28 killed, 55 wounded, while the casualties amongst enemy destroyers with their complement of 280 each must have been very heavy.

6g. I canaot speak too highly of the vigour and determination with which our destroyers went into the attack they had to bear the brunt of the enemy's defence, and it was only by the skilful handling of their ships that they



70. Our destroyers enjoyed a tactical advantage in their ability to fire a heavy armament on forward bearings.

71. The enemy reports made by WARSPITE S aircraft were invaluable. I doubt if ever a ship-borne aircraft has been used to such good purpose as it was during this operation. In addition the aircraft bombed and sank an enemy submarine.

72. Apart from the effective fire developed by WARSPITE her presence undoubtedly gave great confidence to our own destroyers and put fear into the hearts of the enemy, who must have realised that they were caught like rats in a trap.

73. The precision and coolness with which WARSPITE was handled during the approach, and when both main and secondary armament were engaging the enemy was typical of the Commanding Officer Captain V. A. C. Crutchley, V.C., D.S.C. .
