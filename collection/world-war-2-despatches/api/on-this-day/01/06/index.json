            "description": "In Western Cyrenaica early January was a period of acute administrative difficulty. The expenditure of artillery ammunition, except by troops actually attacked by the enemy, was limited to twenty-five rounds a a day, in order to allow reserves to be accumulated for the projected assault on the enemy holding Agedabia, which was to be launched when the Ist Armoured Division arrived. The move of this division had been delayed owing to the lack of transport to bring forward petrol, but it eventually reached Antelat on the 6th January. On the morning of the 7th our patrols reported that Agedabia had been evacuated. F"

On the afternoon of the 3rd January a number of small craft were sighted off Kuala Selangor but out of artillery range. About midday on the 4th, however, patrols of 3 Indian Cavalry made contact with an enemy force moving south down the road from 8th Mile Village north of Kuala Selangor. This enemy force, driving back the cavalry patrols, advanced eastwards along the River Selangor, exercising a direct threat to the main road communications at Rawang. A sharp engagement took place at the bridge east of Batang Berjuntai. To meet this threat the 6/15 Brigade Group, recently withdrawn from the Kampar position, was moved to Rawang and thence to the Batang Berjuntai area which it reached on the 6th January. It took up a defensive position south of the River Selangor. Orders were given for the Denial Scheme to be put into force at the Batu Arang coal mines the only coal mines in Malaya which are situated in this district: ;"

            "date": "6th January",
            "description": "It proved impossible to launch thet offensive in December. The requisite precondition on which I insisted, an. adequate spell of good weather, was never fulfilled. Had we undertaken an offensive in the weather that prevailed it would almost certainly have fallen short of success and the resulting expenditure of ammunition would have meant the postponement of the, offensive of next spring. Eighth Army took advantage of some fitful spells of clear weather to improve its positions; Ravenna fell on 4th December and Faenza on the 16th and by 6th January our line was on the river Senio and touching the southern shore of the Valli di Comacchio. Here the advance was halted and both sides settled down to an uneasy lull. It is surprising to note that, up to this time, the Germans had shown clearly their intention to maintain their strength in Italy. Two infantry divisions were hastily despatched in November to meet a crisis in Hungary but were immediately replaced; one of the new formations was a division from Norway which had travelled all the way through western Germany at the time when Rundstedt's Ardennes offensive was raging without being drawn into it. At the end of the year,. therefore, Kesselring still had twenty-seven* German divisions, four Italian divisions and a Cossack cavalry division. Though we had failed to break through the Apengines we had succeeded in our mission. The Germans found themselves obliged by the very measure of their success in the winter fighting to await our attack in the following spring on an extended and uneconomical line and I was able to accomplish what I had feared impossible the previous autumn, the effective destruction of the enemy armies south of the Po."
