Consolidation

32. On the 8th May I issued orders for immediate consolidation. 17 Infantry Brigade Group were to hold the Orangea Peninsula; 13 Infantry Brigade Group to reconnoitre and man a position facing South on the high ground about 3 miles South of  the airport; 29 Independent Brigade to hold the immediate defences of and control the town of Antsirane. Detached companies were left at Red and Blue beaches, and arrangements were made for anti-aircraft artillery personnel to take over important coast defence batteries with improvised detachments. On the same day I attended Rear-Admiral Syfret's conference with the French Commanders at which the final terms of surrender were arranged.

34. In assessing this operation, it must first be observed that it was conducted against opposition whose air power was weak and who was completely lacking in armour for a counterattack. The French white and Senegalese troops fought with determination and, although their armament and equipment were below first-class standards, they undoubtedly hoped to repeat the story of Dakar. When after 48 hours, it was clear that this was not to be, they remembered that  the true cause of their country lay with the United Nations and did

not continue a struggle which had become senseless as well as hopeless. Making due allowance for these facts, there is much of interest in this, the first of many probable amphibious assaults which remained to  be cartied out during the war.

The forces employed, naval, military, and merchant navy, were largely composed of units which had tramed together in Scotland for a considerable time, If this had not been so, it would have been quite impossible to embark operationally at such short notice and to operate with such an extremely low scale of motor transport. The employment of the 13th and 17th Infantry Brigades, which had been embarked non-operationally before the operation was mounted, was an intereshng expedient, only made possible by the adaptability of the troops concerned, by embarkation at the last moment of a small cadre of officers trained and experienced in this type of work, and by the great assistance given at Durban by the South African Government in limited testowing of Transports.

The number of landing craft available was small, as it was limited to what could be carned in the ships of the assault brigade. The effect of this in limitmg the inttial assault, was not important under the circumstances of this operation, but its effect in slowing up further landing was a most serious factor, both in planning and in the event. The build-up in vehicles on the first day was slow, yet 1t was a great improvement on what had been achieved in previous exercises and represented a very fine achievement by all those concerned,

The assault brigade advanced inland without delay, as soon as it had secured the beaches. This was a departure from usual practice and was most effective. The sudden arrival of the 2gth Independent Brigade at the neck of Antsirane Peninsula, seized the initiative from the French and effectively prevented any properly co-ordinated defence. At the same time, it gamed us 18 mules of road, which, given a few more hours delay, could and would have been stubbornly and effectively defended.

Finally, the use of a difficult, and therefore unexpected, line of approach, although m itself a risk, gained a degree of surprise which was largely responsible for the success of the operation. The ready acceptance of the approach by the Royal Navy and their skill m overcoming its difficulties and dangers, won the admiration and gratitude of all those responsible for the military part of the operation.
