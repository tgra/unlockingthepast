1806

18. @) At 0940 the strike started to land
on. (This was completed by 1025. An air-
craft followed the returning striking force and
was recognised on the plot as hostile too late
for a successful interception.

Gi) The Force retired to the south-west at
22 knots.

Withdrawal and Second Oiling

19. At 1415 a group of “four plus ” enemy
aircraft was detected by radar, the fleet then
being 42 miles south of Engano Island. This
group circled the island and finally faded to
the north-west at 1430. The high Combat
Air Patrol, which had been sent out to inter-
cept, was recalled. It is thought that no
further attempt was made to locate the fleet.

20. URSA was topped up with oil from
KING GEORGE V during 25th January and
was detached in the evening to proceed to
Cocos Island with signals for despatch. She
rejoined while the fleet was fuelling.

21. Force 63, including the aircraft carriers,
oiled in two bodies on 26th and 27th January.
ILLUSTRIOUS and VICTORIOUS also
topped up with aviation spirit. Oiling was
slow owing to buoyant hoses parting at the
joints.

22. At this stage it had become clear that
the fuel situation would allow no more than
one further strike at Palembang. .

Second Strike Plan

23. Gi) As a result of experience gained in
the first operation the orders for the second
strike were modified in two respects.

(ii) First, the fighter sweep was flown in two
parts, the timing of the flight plans being such
that the two independent squadrons should
arrive simultaneously at the two main enemy
fighter airfields. The squadrons were ordered
to establish patrols over the enemy’s airfields
on completion of the sweeps.

Gii) Secondly, the bombers were instructed
to turn right handed after bombing and pro-
ceed to the rendezvous passing south of the
target. This lengthened the withdrawal route,
but the alteration was made at the request of
the two Avenger Wing Leaders, in order to
avoid the heavy A.A. fire encountered round
Palembang town.

24. Plans were also made to fly off from an
alternative position north of Engano Isfand.
This northern position was not used, as it
seemed very unlikely that the enemy would
be able to move U-boats to the West Sumatran
coast in time to interfere with the operations.

Defence of the Fleet

25. It was appreciated that the enemy
would know that we intended to strike a
second time. They had probably captured
prisoners who knew that more than one strike
was intended. ‘We had attacked only one of
the two main refineries in the first strike, and
might reasonably be expected to return to deal
with the other.

26. It was therefore decided to reduce the
escort of the main strike, make this up to some
extent ‘by using the Fireflies throughout as
close escort fighters, and retain at least four

fighters in each of VICTORIOUS, ILLUS-
TRIOUS and INDOMITABLE ready to back
up the standing air patrol from INDEFATIG-
ABLE.

27. It was not expected that the enemy
would be able to reinforce materially his de-
fensive fighters, but it was expected that he
would make a real effort to attack the carriers,
possibly with one of his special attack
squadrons.

Order of Battle
28. The order of battle of the aircraft on
the second strike and sweeps was:—

Songei Gerong Strike
INDOMITABLE, 12 Avengers, 16 Hell-

cats.

ILLUSTRIOUS, 12 Avengers, 12
Corsairs.

VICTORIOUS, 12 Avengers, 12 Corsairs.
INDEFATIGABLE, 12 Avengers, 10
Fireflies.

Fighter Ramrod Sweeps
Lembak Airfield
ILLUSTRIOUS, 12 Corsairs.

Talangbetoetoe Airfield
VICTORIOUS, 12 Corsairs.

Armed Reconnaissance—Mana Airfield
INDEFATIGABLE, 2 Fireflies.

Second Strike—Flying off

29. Force 63 arrived at Position TA at 0600
on 29th January to find heavy rainstorms in
a belt 30 miles off the coast, but the Sumatran
mountains apparently clear of cloud. H Hour
was postponed from 0615 until 0640. At this
time the carriers were in a clear patch between
two rainstorms, but others soon arrived.

30. The striking force formed up well. in
spite of poor conditions and took departure
at 0732, two minutes after the planned time.
Their target was the Songei Gerong distillery.

31. The second ranges of aircraft were pre-
pared much more quickly than on 24th Janu-
ary. As a result the Fireflies joined up with
the main body before it crossed the coast, and
the Ramrod sweeps kept their appointments
punctually at the enemy airfields. '

32. The weather conditions round the flying
off position improved quickly after 0730 and
there was a steady north-westerly wind
throughout the operation.

Second Strike and Sweep—Narrative

33. The enemy was more alert than he had
been on 24th January, and was apparently
keeping a standing fighter patrol airborne.
The Ramrod sweeps found little on their air-
fields, but their presence on patrol over the
airfields may have prevented the enemy re-
inforcing his existing patrols. The total claim
of these two squadrons was four aircraft
destroyed and two damaged.

. 34. The main strike met no opposition from
enemy fighters until after they deployed. The
step-aside deployment plan used for this target
gave our escorting fighters a more difficult task
than the circular deployment used at Pladjoe.
