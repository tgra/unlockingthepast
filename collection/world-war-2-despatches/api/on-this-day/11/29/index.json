            "description": "Had the rst South African Infantry Brigade arrived at the time it was expected on the morning of the 29th November, its presence might have turned the scale, and our armour might have been freed to intervene at Sidi Rezegh. But there were severa] reasons why it was delayed. The rst South African Division was new to the desert, and its training in desert movement had been cut short. The advance of its ist Brigade was hampered, therefore, by the large number of vehicles it had to marshal and control. The brigade had frequently to halt, change direction and start again, and the general pace of its movement was slow. It was still some twelve miles south of Point 175 on the 28th November when the 30th Corps Commander halted it on receipt of a message purporting to come from the 13th Corps. Although",

I also impressed upon the Air Officer Commanding the urgent necessity for maintaining contact with the convoy, a point which he had already realised.",

It was estimated that 566 1st Line aircraft would now be required and that, when this target was reached, the strength of the land forces should be 26 battalions with supporting arms, ancillary services, etc. The Army estimate was accepted by the Chiefs of Staff who, however, declined to increase the previously approved air scale. The general situation and war plans were further discussed at staff conversations with officers from the Dutch East Indies on 25-29th November, 1940, at a conference with Dutch and Australian representatives and United States observers in February, 1941 (  A.D.A.

            "date": "29th November",
            "description": "i Special Service Force and 36 Division attacked the northern third of the mountain mass to gain Monte La nen and bale Maggiore. Air support on that day was heavy and tae the rat time was not reduced by weather. Both Corps  attacks were successful. On 6th December 10 Corps captured the summit of Monte Camino, which they had almost secured on the 3rd but failed to hold against counter-attacks, and on the oth Rocca d Evandro was captured. This brought 10 Corps to the Garigliano all along its front. II Corps captured La Difensa on 3rd December and held it against strong counter-attacks, and on the 8th captured and mopped up Monte La  Remetanea. 36 Division's attack on Monte Maggiore, the northernmost and lowest peak, had succeeded by the night of the 3rd; counter-attacks were repulsed and by the 7th the position could be considered secured.   Between then and the xrth ro Corps took over the whole of the feature from II Corps. Between 29th November and gth December VI Corps on Fifth Army's right made diversionary attacks along the axes of the Colli Atina and Filignano Sant  Elia roads. Very little ground was gained in tangled and difficult country, with peaks rising to over twelve hundred metres. 2 Moroccan Division began to relieve 34 Division on the Corps  right on 8th December. Phase I of the Army Commander's plan was now, however, completed with the capture of the Camino massif and Phase II was ordered to start on 7th December. In this phase ro Corps had a minor defensive r le; the principal objective was the clearing of Monte Sammucro and this was assigned to II Corps. VI Corps was to continue to drive westwards along the roads to Atina and Sant  Elia but on a larger scale facilitated by the accession to its strength of the fresh and mountain trained Moroccan Division. It was hoped that by attacking on so wide a front the enemy would be sufficiently stretched to prevent him massing for the defence of Cassino. The bitterest fighting took place for Monte Sammucro and the village of San Pietro in Fine below it. The attack began on 7th December; the first two high points on Sammucro were seized without exceptional difficulty but after that our troops were held until the 13th by severe German counter-attacks and heavy mortar and artillery fire. On the 8th the Italian Motorised Group failed in an attack on Monte Lungo, in the throat of the gap. The second battle for San Pietro opened on the a5th and succeeded, though at heavy cost in casualties, by the 17th; Monte Lungo was also occupied and, north of the village, we forced our way further along the knife-edge of Monte Sammucro. This was bitter mountain fighting, with great use of artillery and gains in territory small compared with the time consumed and the losses suffered. There was still another enemy position, almost equally as strong as San Pietro, just a short distance ahead, based on the western end of Monte Sammucro and the lower hills covering the village of San Vittore. But 36 Division was exhausted and on 29th December had to be relieved by the 34th before San Vittore was taken. The VI Corps attack on the right had also made little progress against difficulties of ground and stubborn enemy defence; by the end of the year it could only be said to have kept level with the advance of II Corps with",
