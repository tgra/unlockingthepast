.: During. the forenoon,: search aircraft were
sent’ to direct ;the hospital. ship TJITJAL-
ENGKA to the Fleet. This ship had been sent
at my request to remain at call within 30 miles

Of"a’ position’ 85 miles to the eastward of the
normal dawn position of the Fleet in the fuelling
area. Casualties by now fit to be moved were

transferred to TJITJALENGKA by destroyer

in ‘the afternoon.

During the day Sakishima was covereit by
TU 52.1.3.

At Igr0 the Fleet disengaged from the Tanker
Group for the night.

At this stage it — necessary to con-
sider the date on which the Fleet would leave
the operations area for. major storing in the
tear bases." The tankers and repair ships of
the Fleet Train, based at Leyte, require early
notice of a firm date for redisposition in, order
that with their slow speed they
their new stations in- time to- meet the Fleet
and falfil their functions."

‘As the Fleet was due at the storing ports

early in June, and as it was evident that a .

considerable amount of work would be required
to make good the battle damage to carriers, it
appeared desirable to conclude operations with
the twelfth strike:day on 25th May,*and so
ensure, the Fleet -being ready to resume opera-
tions when required in July.

. After consultation with A.C.1, I accordingly
sent the following signal: —
