            "description": "15. In the Basra area no major operations took place. The principal difficulty was that, to start with, there were insufficient troops to con- currently. The airport, dock area and power station at Maqil were occupied, but although the Iraqi troops in Basra agreed to withdraw on 2nd May, they failed to do so. When, even after the time hmit had been extended, they failed to comply, action by bombing and artillery fire was taken against them whereupon they immediately withdrew northwafds, along the West bank of the River Tigris above Qurmat Ali and towards Qurna. The only other action of any importance in the Basra area occurred on 7th May, when our troops occupied Ashar, the business quarter of Basra, after encountering slight opposition from some Traqi police and armed civilians,"

The first hostile move by the Iraq forces occurred on 30th April, when two infantry brigades of the Iraq Army, supported by Artillery and some armoured cars, began concentrating around Habbaniya and training their guns on the Camp, thereby constituting a direct threat to the British Cantonment there. A demand for the withdrawal of these troops was refused by the Iraqi Commander, who stated that no normal training was to be carried out from Habbaniya, and that fire would be opened on aircraft or troops leaving the Camp. Hostilities broke out on 2nd May and the Royal Air Force station was shelled inter- mittently until 5th May. The Camp was also bombed and machine-gunned by the Iraqi Air Force. The Royal Air Force bombed the Iraqi Positions gcoring many direct hits on their guns, armoured cars and machine gun posts. During this period also the Royal Air Force, despite the fact that the aerodrome was often under heavy fire, successfully evacuated by air to Basra a large number of women and children, who had been sent from Baghdad to Habbaniya when the situation at the former place became threatening. (The remainder of the British population of Baghdad were accom- modated either in the British Embassy or the American Legation throughout the period of Operations.)"

The enemy positions at Jefna were particularly strong and \u2018before they could be grappled with there were many outlying positions, on the hills either side of the road, which had to be cleared. Manteuffel\u2019s parachutists fought as well as usual and by 2nd May we were still held up at the immediate approaches to Jefna, though to the north we had outflanked it by some three miles. Heavy fighting continued on 1 Infantry Division front both on Gebel Sidi Meftah and to the north of it but in anti- cipation of its fall IE Corps were now bringing up x Armoured Division to operate on the ex- treme right of the Corps in the valley of the Qued et Tine. This valley leads direct to Mateur; no road follows it but it is practicable for armour once the left flank is freed by secur- ing Gebel Sidi Meftah. 78 Division to the east of the Oued had gained ground north of Gebel Ahmera and north-east of Heidous. On 30th April 34 Division scored its most note- worthy success with the capture of Gebel Tahent (Point 609). This commanding dome- shaped hill, east-north-east of Sidi Nsir, was defended by parachutists from the Barenthin Regiment, perhaps the best German troops in Africa. :"

The enemy succeeded in breaking the outer defences of the perimeter but failed to pierce our main defences. Fighting continued for two days and on the 1st May, Hurricanes of Nos. 73 and 274 Squadrons maintained fighter patrols to protect our troops and,, artillery against enemy fighter and bomber action. The Hurricanes encountered enemy fighters, in greatly superior numbers but shot down 4 Me.r109\u2019s in flames, with the loss of 1 Hurricane. Our troops successfully counter- attacked, destroying 11 enemy tanks and inflicting other heavy losses. The enemy how- ever, retained a hold on 5,000 yards of the outer perimeter and our line was adjusted accordingly. A further attack by the enemy on the 2nd May was repulsed, after which the enemy effort there appeared to be temporarily spent."

A double track through the marshalling yard was re-estab- lished by rrth May, 1944, but at D-Day (6th June), the marshalling yard was still unservice- able and the repair facilities could not be used."

            "description": "I therefore decided to recast the whole plan. T took the decision on 3rd May, based on a conference on 2nd May which I had been pre- vented from attending by impossible flying weather, to cancel the American assault in the west and transfer the whole weight of Seventh Army to the south-east of the island, on the immediate left of Eighth Army. I decided, in fact, to take a risk on the administrative side rather than the operational risk of dispersion of effort. This was contrary to what had hitherto been regarded as one of the funda- mental principles of the operation: that we must capture Palermo at the earliest possible oppor- tunity if we were to have a hope of maintain- ing sufficient forces for the reduction of the . island. On my new plan the only ports we should be certain of capturing in the first stage would be Syracuse and Augusta, the latter more a naval anchorage than a port, and pos- sibly Catania; the whole of Seventh Army would have to depend on beach maintenance except for such help as it might get from the small port of Licata which, as already stated, was only rated at a capacity of six hundred tons a day.* The risk was therefore grave, but there were two factors which brightened the prospect. The first was that there was a reasonable probability of suitable weather in July for beach maintenance. The second was the coming of the Duxw. I need not describe these ingenious amphibious vehicles, which are now familiar to everyone, but it is interesting to note, in view of the great part they later played, that I had never seen one up to that time. General Millert, my Major General, Administration, had received advance reports and had ordered large quantities from the United States on 22nd March. When they arrived it was discovered that the claims made for them were fully justified by their perform- ance. It is not too much to say, indeed, that the Duxw revolutionised the problem of beach maintenance. Nevertheless I arranged that Eighth Army should meet the commitment of providing a thousand tons per day through Syracuse for Seventh Army from D plus 14 to supplement their maintenance over the beaches until they could capture and bring into use the port of Palermo.:"

The three German destroyers then trans- ferred their attentions to the EDINBURGH, who was now in tow of a Russian tug and escorted by the FORESIGHT and FORESTER, one small Russian destroyer and the minesweepers HARRIER, HUSSAR, GOS- SAMER and NIGER. The German destroyers located her on the morning of 2nd May, in low visibility and extreme cold. The tow was im- mediately slipped and the EDINBURGH, who was unable to steer, circled slowly at about eight knots."

The capture of Point 609 by United States 34 Division was a particularly fine piece of work, against fierce opposition from the formidable Barenthin Regiment,"

The situation in 20 Indian Division\u2019s area on the 26th April was as follows. 80 Brigade in the Magwe area had pushed patrols across the river, which reported enemy motor transport moving west out of Minbu. Magwe itself was being heavily shelled from the west side of the Irrawaddy. 100 Brigade was pass- ing through 32 Brigade on the road leading from Satthwa to Allanmyo. After clearing opposition 26 miles north of Allanmyo on the 27th, 100 Brigade again made contact just north of the town. Allanmyo fell the following day, after 36 hours fighting, and we captured five guns. Meanwhile, 80 Brigade, advancing south from Magwe, was destroying many par- ties of the enemy who were trying to cross the river from the right bank and escape east- wards. At Allanmyo, 100 Brigade were 252 miles from Rangoon on the 28th April. By the 2nd May, breaking through all enemy attempts to stop it, it had advanced a further 40 miles and captured the great river port (now in ruins) of Prome, the eastern terminus of the road from Taungup. The last escape route of the rem- nants of the Japanese forces in South Arakan was now blocked."

He made the proviso that the decision as to whether the second (follow-up) division should actually be committed would be taken later. On the 17th April he confirmed his approval in an Opera- tional Directive addressed to his Commanders- in-Chief, in which we were instructed \u201cTo carry out an amphibious/airborne operation with the object of the early capture of Ran- goon should this not have been previously achieved by Fourteenth Army from the north.\u201d D-Day for the initial amphibious assault was to be the 2nd May, and this date should be borne in mind when the progress of Fourteenth Army\u2019s advance southwards is followed in the next section of the Despatch."
