Corps had teached  the line of the. river Pisciatello. .

On 17th October 2 Polish Corps, which had taken over the sector on the left of 5 Corps Previously under ro Corps (and commanded in the interim by the Headquarters of the disbanded x Armoured Division) opened an attack to improve our communications in the mountains. the minor road which leaves Route 7z at San Piero in Bagno and joins Route 67 at Rocca San Casciano, crossing the valleys of the Bidente and Rabbi. Possession of Route 67 would be of the greatest importance for improving communications between the two Armies. The Poles made good progress in the mountains. Galeata, commanding the upper Bidente valley, fell on 19th October and Strada, in the valley of the Rabbi, on the 2zst; here the enemy showed signs of an intention to resist more strongly. Meanwhile in the plains Cesena had been entered on 19th October and on the 2oth 4 Division seized a precarious but tenaciously defended bridgehead over the Savio in the neighbourhood of Route 9. Further to the south x0 Indian Division established two more bridgeheads and in the southernmost built up rapidly for an assault on Monte Cavallo, on the watershed between the Savio and the Ronco. By the 2ist there were no enemy forward of the Savio except in the coastal sector, where they still held Cervia. .

Intentions now were for the Poles to press down the valley of. the Rabbi towards Forli while 5 Corps advanced on the same objective on the axis of Route 9. The Polish attack began on 22nd October but made little. progress until the 25th. 5 Corps also met heavy resistance to attempts to break out from its Cesena bridgehead over the Savio. ro Indian Division captured Monte Cavallo and began to thrust northwards. Resistance ceased on the 24th, however, when the enemy carried out.his sole voluntary withdrawal on this front. The tactical situation, in particular the threat from Monte Cavallo, . would indeed have forced a withdrawal in the

near future but an even more pressing reason was the situation on the Fifth Army front where the crisis of the defence of Bologna had now been reached. Three first class divisions, 29 and 90 Panzer Grenadiers and 1 Parachute Division, had been withdrawn in succession to the central sector and it was vitally n  to reduce the front of LXXVI Corps to allow for this reduction in strength. The line chosen was the river Ronco. . By the 25th both the Canadians and 5 Corps had made contact with . this line but the rain, which was at that very time foiling Fifth Army's attack on Bologna, now reached a new high pitch of intensity. On the 26th all bridges over the Savio, in our immediate rear, were swept away and our small bridgeheads over the Ronco were eliminated and destroyed. The'Poles continued to advance and on the 27th captured Predappio Nuova. The situation remained more or less ui   like the weather, until the 3xst when the enemy was forced back opposite 5 Corps to a switch line from the Ronco at Forli airfield to the Rabbi at Grisignano.

This was a most discouraging period for Eighth Army. The weather was abominable and the country difficult. Every river and canal was subject to sudden rises and floods

which. not merely made the seizing of a bridge-

head in face of opposition desperately difficult but was liable also to interrupt at any moment maintenance and the movement of reinforcements. Some miles of waterlogged ground were gained but despite our best efforts it was impossible to prevent the enemy, making full use of these natural advantages, from withdrawing sufficient troops to block Fifth Army's advance. The capture of Cesena and Forlimpopoli, and even of Mussolini's birthplace at Predappio, were not sufficient recompense for the failure to capture Bologna. Eighth Army's strength was now also. declining, for early in October it had to release 4 Indian Division and the Greek Mountain Brigade Group to go to Greece. This was the beginning of a process which was to cost British troops in Italy eventually two more divisions.*
