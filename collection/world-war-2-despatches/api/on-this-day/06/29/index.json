On 22nd June, one Infantry Battalion, less one company, and one Squadron 13th Lancers moved to Haditha with orders to capture Abu Kemal, known to be occupied by some French troops and rebel Iraqis. The transport situation made a move forward from Abu Kemal before 29th June impossible."

            "date": "29th June",
            "description": "20. On the 29th June, I had wired to General Slim that 31 Japanese Division would probably be withdrawn to the south of Ukhrul, but that the enemy might make a final desperate attempt to capture Imphal from the general direction of the Tiddim and Tamu roads. Although we had sufficient strength to defeat any such attempt, our task of clearing the enemy west of the Chindwin would be facilitated if we could develop a real threat to his communications. I therefore directed him to consider whether the advance on Ukhrul could be continued south-south-east to Humine and Myothit at the head of the Kabaw Valley. This would give 31 Japanese Division no chance to recover and would threaten the communications of 15 Japanese Division at Thaungdut and Tamu."

            "title": "Allied Forces Shift Strategy as South Africans Advance Toward Orvieto, VI Corps Captures Key Coastal Position",
            "date": "29th June",
            "description": "On these orders the pursuit was pressed rapidly. The main difference was that 13 Corps was no longer directed on the TerniRieti area but farther afield; this meant that the South Africans were no longer to turn eastwards to cross the Tiber to seize Narni as originally planned, but to press on to Orvieto. Here again a difficult question of routeing was involved since both they and II Corps were in danger of arriving simultaneously at Viterbo. I decided to give precedence to the armour and II Corps was halted in place until the South Africans were through. Meanwhile VI Corps made rapid progress up the coast in spite of the arrival of two fresh German divisions. On the gth it captured Tarquinia and a task force from 1 Armoured Division, operating on the inland flank, cut into II Corps  territory to capture the Viterbo airfield. On the rrth, however, VI Corps was relieved by IV Corps and moved to Naples, coming under command of Seventh Army for operation ANVIL. II ad pushed forward with 85 and up the axis of Route 2 and consolidated the position between VI and 13 Corps. It was relieved by the French on oth June. On the oth Eighth Amy had also carried out a regrouping; the Tiber was now to be the boundary between 13 and 10 Corps, with the latter commanding all the troops formerly in 13 Corps east of the river. The final result was to give 13 Corps 78 and 6 South African Divisions, with 4 Division in reserve, and 10 Corps 6 British Armoured and 8 Indian Infantry Divisions, with 10 Indian as reserve. The Canadians were grounded south of Rome. The Polish Corps, which had passed to Army Group reserve on 26th May after the capture of Piedimonte, assumed command of the Adriatic sector from 5 Corps on 17th June, remaining under direct command of my headquarters until 29th June when it passed to Eighth Army. The enemy had begun to fall"
