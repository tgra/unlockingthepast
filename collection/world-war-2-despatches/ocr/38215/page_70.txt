471. Work was continued on the Serangoon
and Jurong Switch lines (see Section XLV).

472. In view of an anticipated air-borne land-
ing similar to those which had been so effective
in Crete special steps were taken for the defence
of aerodromes. In particular the Seletar and
Sembawang aerodromes were strongly defended.
Instructions were issued as to the form such air-
borne landings might take and the best methods
of countering them.

473. The Rear-Admiral Malaya arranged for
naval craft to patrol the sea approaches to
Singapore Island. Local naval craft were also
made available for in-shore patrol work as re-
quired by Area Commanders. Naval Liaison
officers were attached to the headquarters of each
Area,

474. The tasks allotted te the Royal Air Force
Fighter Squadron were, firstly, to co-operate
with the ground defences in the protection of the
Singapore Fortress area against attacks by
hostile aircraft and, secondly, to reconncitre the
main arteries of communications in South
Johore with a view to ascertaining the area of
the enemy’s concentrations. This squadron
was now based on the Civil Airport at Kallang.

475. On the administrative side, certain
changes were made. The duties of Martial Law
Admunistrator passed from the Commander,
Singapore Fortress, to the G.O.C., Malaya. All
Army field units were ordered to hold seven days’
reserve rations in addition to the emergency
ration, as a reserve in case they should find
themselves cut off from the normal supply. To
economise petrol and avoid traffic congestion
only those vehicles actually required were to be
kept in use. All others were to be parked in the
open spaces about Singapore Town.

All ships and small craft under control of
the Royal Navy were now based on Singapore
Harbour instead of on the Naval Base.

476. The’ Operational Headquarters Malaya
Command remained at Sime Road with
Administrative Headquarters at Fort Canning.
The Headquarters Royal Navy and Royal Air
Force were also at Sime Road.

477. The dispositions adopted by the Area
Commanders and their subordinates were in
outline as under:—

Northern Area.—
Right.—18 British Division (Major-Gen.

Beckwith Smith) less 53 Brigade Group.

This Division had the 54 Infantry
Brigade (Brigadier Backhouse) on the right
and 55 Infantry Brigade (Brigadier Massy
Beresford) on the left,

Leff,—1xr Indian Division (Major-Gen.

Key).
This Division had the 6/15 Indian

Infantry Brigade (Lt.-Col. Morrison) on

the right, and the 28 Indian Infantry

‘Brigade (Brigadier Selby) on the left. The

8 Indian Infantry Brigade (Brigadier

Trott) was in divisional reserve. The 6/15

Brigade was after a few days relieved by

the 53 British Infantry Brigade from Area

reserve and went into reserve.

Reserve.—53 British Infantry Brigade

(Brigadier Duke), later relieved by the 6/15
Brigade. To re-equip the 53 Brigade a large
number of weapons had to be withdrawn from
‘the remainder of 18 Division as there were
now few in reserve.

and, having located him, to close with him.’’

Section XLIX.—TuE PERIOD OF PREPARATION
31ST JANUARY-8TH FEBRUARY, I942.

479. Public Announcement. I published an
announcement which stated that the Battle for
Malaya had concluded and that the Battle for
Singapore was now beginning and called upon
all ranks and all civilians to play their part in
the defence of Singapore. A copy of this
announcement is attached as Appendix ‘‘ H ”’
to this Despatch.

480. The Far East War Counctl._—_The
Council, under the chairmanship of the
Governor, continued to meet at ogoo hrs. daily
at the house of the Secretary, Mr. Dawson.

481. Withdrawals to the Netherlands East
Indies—In accordance with instructions
received from the Supreme Commander South-
West Pacific certain units and individuals were

despatched to the Netherlands East Indies. The

units included an Australian Motor Transport
Company and certain Anti-Aircraft units.
Among the individuals were senior officers re-
quired for Headquarters South-West Pacific
and technicians no longer required at Singa-
pore. I was also instructed by the Supreme
Commander South-West Pacific, in view
of the shortage of trained staff officers
both in the N.E.I. and in India, to
evacuate to the N.E.I. all staff officers who
were no longer required and in particular to
consider whether I could now dispense with any
of the Indian Army formation headquarters in
view of the reduction of the fighting strengths
of those formations.

Some mechanical transport destined for
Singapore was also retained in the N.E.J. or
returned there without being discharged from
the ships.

482. Re-Organization of Formations and
Units.—As a result of two months of almost
continuous day and night operations on the
mainland, it was only to be expected that a
great deal of re-organization had now become
