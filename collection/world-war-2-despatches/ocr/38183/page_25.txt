SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 22 JANUARY, 1948

were left as they did not wish to move. The
native Volunteers were given the option of
moving, but most of them decided to remain
with their families in Penang; the British per-
sonnel of the Volunteers were brought away.

The coast artillery denial scheme was carried
out and all 6-inch guns destroyed. Approved
armament was withdrawn and most first-line
transport. Electrical machinery and the oil
fuelling system of the Eastern Smelting Com-
pany were smashed, the river house, telephone
exchange, cable and wireless station and aero-
dromes destroyed. The Singapore-Colombo
and the Singapore-Madras cables were, how-
ever, connected by binding screws and left
working in the hope that the Japanese might
not discover them—a hope that proved vain.
A reserve of food was opened for the civil
population, which had suffered some 600 killed
and 1,100 wounded in air raids during the last
week.

The destruction of material was incomplete,
the most notable example being certain vessels
that were left intact. Efforts were made by
the naval authorities to immobilise these by
laying mines in the Southern Channel, the
Northern already having been mined by the
Japanese. Presumably this was not effective
for long. : ;

XIJ.—Tue RETREAT FROM NORTHERN Maraya.

I2th-18ih December.

115. By the 12th December enemy pressure
on the Kedah front was becoming very severe.
The Kroh forces were being forced backwards
over the frontier, while our right in Northern
Kedah was also driven back, necessitating the
6th Indian Infantry Brigade withdrawing on
the left to conform-and hold a line River Bukit
(north of Alor Star) to Penang, Penang was
the subject of daily air attacks at this period.
Two days of heavy fighting then saw our forces
pushed back twenty miles south of Alor Star,
the 11th Division taking up a position in the
Gurun area. Some of the infantry units in
this division reported losses up to 50 per cent.,
but this included missing, many of whom re-
joined later.

The immediate preoccupation on our part at
this moment was to co-ordinate the movement
of the 11th Division with that of Krohcol. Un-
less this was done there was serious danger of
the Japanese cutting off one of the two forces.
Krohcol was now back in Kedah just east of
Baling and under the command of the rath
Indian Infantry Brigade, which had been sent
up from the south as reinforcements. But on
the 16th December the enemy drove in between
the Kroh forces and the 11th Division, and
counter-attacks by two: battalions of the 28th

Indian Brigade proved unavailing to restore.

contact. It was now that the lack of adequate
teserves to relieve troops who had been fighting
continudusly for a week began to be felt. The
enemy were pressing home their attacks in spite
of heavy losses. Troops from Penang were
sent up as reinforcements, while the 6th and
15th Indian Infantry Brigades had been so
weakened in the fighting that they were ordered
to re-form into one composite Brigade. .
.The Japanese were now employing Kota
Bharu aerodrome, reconnaissance revealing
some forty of their fighters on the ground. To
attack Kota Bharu, Singora and Patani aero-
dromes with the object of reducing the scale

of Japanese air effort was part of our general
air policy at this period, but our bomber effort
was painfully limited by our lack of aircraft,
Apart from deficiency of adequate A.A.
weapons, the defence of our aerodromes was
handicapped by lack of adequate warning in
the North. (See para. 54 above.) These
formed two causes of our heavy losses of air-
craft on the ground. The retention of our main
fighter strength for the defence of Singapore
(see para. 142 below) was a contributory cause
and also reacted directly on our bombing effort,
since it was impracticable to provide fighter
escorts. .

Two Buffaloes had been specially fitted for
photographic reconnaissance. To allow. of
extra petrol being carried, and at the same
time to reduce weight, all guns were taken out.
Even then the Buffaloes were inferior in per-
formance to the Japanese Zero fighters. The
pilots of these specially fitted aircraft carried
out useful work under very difficult conditions.

From the start of hostilities the Dutch sub-
marines had been very active. On the r2th
December one of them reported sinking four
enemy troopships at Patani Roads.

116. The difficulty of comibating the
Japanese attacks on our aerodromes resulted on
the 16th and 17th December in the evacuation
and demolition of Butterworth, Taiping and
Kuantan aerodromes, and our aircraft were
forced further South. Ipoh, too, was now being
bombed, and the aerodrome petrol dump was
hit. .
On land, the enemy, having advanced in
Kelantan (as far as the Sungei Nal) and in
Kedah, was now also attacking detachments of
our troops in Perak round about the Grik area.
The 3rd Indian Corps was accordingly autho-
tised to withdraw behind the line of the Perak
River to protect the communications of our
forces North of Kuala Kangsar. The rth
Indian Division began withdrawing from the
line of the River Muda Southwards behind
River Krian, linking up with the 28th Indian
Infantry Brigade and protected all the time
on the right flank by the z2th Indian Infantry
Brigade. During this period the Argyll and
Sutherland Highlanders made counter-attacks
with gallantry and skill. This withdrawal was
carried out successfully, the enemy being re-
pulsed with loss at his first attempt to cross the
river.

Inter-Allied Conference, 18th December.

117. On the 18th December a conference of
inter-Allied representatives took place at Singa-
pore, in accordance with proposals made by
President Roosevelt. Owing to the time factor,
China was not represented. Results of the
conference were telegraphed to England. The
main conclusions were as follows:—

(a) The importance of Singapore to the
war in the Far East, and to the world war,
could not be exaggerated; :

(b) The immediate plan was to dispose our
combined forces then available in the Far
East so as to—

(i) Keep the enemy as far North in
Malaya as possible and hold him in the
Philippines; and

(ii) Prevent the enemy acquiring terri-
tory, and particularly aerodromes, which
would threaten the arrival of reinforce-
ments; ;
