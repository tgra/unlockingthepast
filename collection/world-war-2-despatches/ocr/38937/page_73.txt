SUPPLEMENT to THz LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

Fiumicino was reached all along the 5 Corps
front.*

During the period while Fifth and Eighth
Armies were developing their main attacks x0
Corps, acting as the connecting link between
the two forces (but under command of Eighth
Army), had been following up and hastening
the enemy’s withdrawal on the axis of Route
7z, the Arezzo-Cesena road. Its frontage was
very extensive for its small strength but the
enemy also was weak in this sector. On 24th
September the watershed was gained after a
stiff fight for the Mandrioli Pass, for which the
enemy put up a strong defence. After this
heavy tains prevented further operations until
30th September; the division and the armoured
brigade under command were transferred to the
Adriatic sector and replaced by 1 Guards Bri-
gade Group and2 Anti-Aircraft Brigade from
Fifth Army for use as infantry. With these
forces, reinforced ‘by three dismounted
armoured car regiments and three independent
infantry battalions, it was impossible to force
the pace. The enemy, however, continued to
withdraw and by 6th October 10 Corps had
gained a position astride Route 71 on the upper
teaches of the Savio, not much more than fifteen
miles from Cesena.

Fifth Army resumes the Attack on Bologna.

The furthest point in Fifth Army’s advance
down the Imola road had been reached with
the capture of Monte La Battaglia on 27th
September. While the enemy was expending
his strength in vain counter-attacks to recapture
this vital position, attempts which continued
until they died down from exhaustion on 6th
October,t General Clark decided to take ad-
vantage of the progress made by the left wing
of II Corps to concentrate the main weight of
the Corps on the axis of Route 65, the direct
road to Bologna. The factors which had
militated against the choice of this axis for the
original attack no longer applied, since we had
now left well behind the strong defences and
difficult terrain of the Futa Pass and were over
the Radicosa Pass as well. Accordingly 13
Corps were to take over responsibility for the
Imola axis and were to relieve 88 Divi-
sion on Monte La Battaglia. I felt that this
new drive would be the climax of our opera-
tions in the mountains; the season was already
far advanced, and the break in the weather
had come earlier than‘ usual; unless we could
get through now we were likely to be stuck
in the mountains for the winter. In order,
therefore, to give the maximum weight possible
to the attack, and since all three divisions in
3 Corps were very tired after continuous
fighting, I decided on 2nd October to reinforce
it with 78 Division, my only fresh formation,
just back from a restful tour of duty in the
Middle East. Even with this addition, as I
reported on the same date, I feared that ‘‘ we
may not be quite strong enough to carry it

*I am unable to say definitely when I crossed the
Rubicon until historians decide which river it is; the
Uso, Fiumicino and Pisciatello are the candidates in
that order of preference.

{ There was a further unsuccessful counter-attack
on Monte La Battaglia on the night of 10/1 October.

j Although the Italian weather is regular only in
its extreme variability and although heavy rainfall is
-a feature of every month in the calendar the rain in
September and October 1944 was*both heavier and
earlier in its incidence than the general average of past
years seemed to prognosticate. .

through ’’. General Clark’s plan was to con-
tinue ¢o press forward with the troops already
in the line, resting one regiment from 85, 88
and 91 Divisions and then to bring in these
rested troops on roth October in a concentrated
attack. 13 Corps was to conform by attacking
on the right of II Corps with its existing forces
and then, relieving 88 Division with the
78th, to aftack in concert with the Americans
down the Santerno valley onto Route g north-
west of Imola.

II Corps’ new drive had started on rst Octo-
ber with 85 Division advancing east of
Route 65 and the oxst on the road itself, sup-
ported by diversionary attacks by 88 and
34 Divisions on the right and left flanks
respectively. On 2nd October the relief of 88
Division on Monte La Battaglia began, in
the first place by 1 Guards Brigade. The bad-
ness of the roads and tracks in rear of the posi-
tion severely hampered the relief; the rain also
continued remorselessly. On the left of II
Corps good progress was made. On 2nd Octo-
ber 91 Division captured the village of
Monghidoro, twenty-five miles by road from
Bologna, and on the 3rd 34 Division cap-
tured Monte Venere, a commanding height
to the west of the large village of Loiano. On
the right 85 Division had reached the head
waters of the River Idice. By the 4th II Corps
had made good an advance of some four miles
in two days against strong resistance and in
abominable weather. Loiano, twenty-two miles
from Bologna, fell to 9x Division on the
sth. On the same day 6 South African
Armoured Division came. under direct Fifth
Army command with the task of operating on
the left of II Corps up the Prato-Castiglione
road; it had under it 24 Guards Brigade, an
an independent Indian battalion (6/13 Frontier
Force Rifles) and Combat Command ‘‘ B ’’ of
x U.S. Armoured Division.

Slowly the advance on Bologna continued,
with gains of the nature of two thousand yards
in a day; for although we had now left the
“* Gothic "’ line defences far behind and were
attacking, in a sense, downhill, the complexities
of the mountain structure, the rain and the
fanaticism of the defenders made every ad-
vance a hard fought struggle. The attack in-
creased in intensity on oth October when 88
Division, now completely relieved by 13 Corps,
attacked simultaneously with 85 Division to
the east of Route 65 and with 91 Division on
the axis of the road itself. The enemy was
now reinforcing fast.* 65 Division had
already been brought round from the
western sector and put in in a narrow sec-
tor on the Bologna road and, on the r3th, 44
Division, which had been taken out for a rest,
was re-committed. The troops were encouraged
by a personal order from Hitler, read out to
ail ranks on 6th October, that the Apennine
position was to be held at all costs. On the
r4th Vietinghoff decided to run risks in his
vital left sector and began to bring across 29
Panzer Grenadier Division from the front oppo-
site Eighth Army. In spite of this our advance
continued. On the 12th 85 Division captured
Monte delle Formiche, a two thousand foot
peak to the east of the main road and level

*At the beginning of October Field-Marshal
Kesselring was seriously injured in a car accident on
Route 9 and did not return until the end of December.
He was succeeded in the.interim by General von
Vietinghoff of Tenth Army. .
