            "description": "Had the rst South African Infantry Brigade arrived at the time it was expected on the morning of the 29th November, its presence might have turned the scale, and our armour might have been freed to intervene at Sidi Rezegh. But there were severa] reasons why it was delayed. The rst South African Division was new to the desert, and its training in desert movement had been cut short. The advance of its ist Brigade was hampered, therefore, by the large number of vehicles it had to marshal and control. The brigade had frequently to halt, change direction and start again, and the general pace of its movement was slow. It was still some twelve miles south of Point 175 on the 28th November when the 30th Corps Commander halted it on receipt of a message purporting to come from the 13th Corps. Although"

            "description": "Bearing in mind the policy of avoiding war with Japan if possible a policy which had been reaffirmed by the Chiefs of Staff as recently as the 29th November and the situation in the United States with the Kurusu talks still going on in  Washington, I decided that I would not be justified in ordering   Matador  on this information, but orders were issued to bring all forces to the first,  . ., the highest, degree of readiness. I also impressed upon the Air Officer Commanding the urgent necessity for maintaining contact with the convoy, a point which he had already realised."

            "description": "26. The tactical appreciation asked for was prepared by the Commander-in-Chief, China, GeneralwOfficer Commanding, Malaya, and Air Officer Commanding, Far East. It was reviewed and endorsed by the Singapore Defence Conference held in October, 1940, attended by representatives of Australia, New Zealand, India and Burma, and by one American observer. It was estimated that 566 1st Line aircraft would now be required and that, when this target was reached, the strength of the land forces should be 26 battalions with supporting arms, ancillary services, etc. The Army estimate was accepted by the Chiefs of Staff who, however, declined to increase the previously approved air scale. The general situation and war plans were further discussed at staff conversations with officers from the Dutch East Indies on 25-29th November, 1940, at a conference with Dutch and Australian representatives and United States observers in February, 1941 (  A.D.A. Conference  ), and at a full conference with American and Dutch (as well as Dominion) representatives in April, t94x (  A.D.B. Conference  )."
