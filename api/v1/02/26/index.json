            "description": "By the 26th February a strong defensive posi- tion had been prepared, well-mined and organised in depth over an area thirty-six miles square. A minefield, extending from the coast at Gazala to Bir Hacheim in the south, blocked the coastal road and all the important tracks from east to west. Within the minefield strong defensive localities had been developed from Gazala to Sidi Muftah and at Bir Hacheim. The fortress of Tobruk gave depth to the de-"

            "description": "unfortunate in that their first major battle had been against such experienced troops and so dashing an enemy commander but, as General Eisenhower reported on 26th February, they were resolved to benefit immediately from the battle experience gained by the intensive train- ing of all formations. Their improvement was indeed continuous and outstanding throughout the campaign. Another result of the battle had been that Allied formations of all three nation- alities were very mixed up over the whole front and my first intention was to carry out a thorough reorganization. On the day I assumed command, in an order issued on 19th February, I laid down the following principles. Separate"

            "description": "As I have already explained it would be some time before General Montgomery could assemble sufficient troops for an attack on che Mareth line and he was determined not to attack before he was ready. In the meanwhile Field-Marshal Rommel still had his Army Group reserve under his hand, amounting to about two armoured divisions. They would also need a certain amount of time to recuper- ate from their losses in the Kasserine battle but after that they could obviously be best used in a spoiling attack against Eighth Army. The blow at II Corps had won the enemy a breathing space on that side and he could clearly appreciate that he would be ready to take the offensive again before Eighth Army was. I signalled to General Montgomery on 26th February to say that I thought Rommel would certainly try to attack him as soon as he could, following the original French plan; he replied in a letter on the 27th that it would be a very good thing if Rommel did attack and he only feared that he would not. In any case Eighth Army was well poised and ready for anything; on 26th February two divi- sions were forward in position, the 51st to the north of the road with all three brigades up and 7 Armoured Division astride and to ihe south of the road. The front was covered with an armoured car screen and the area round Medenine, juncture of the Mareth and Ksar el Hallouf roads, was being organised as a defensive position."

An attack on Medjez itself, south of the river, was re- pulsed with heavy losses after small initial success. The attack further south penetrated deeply into our lines but was beaten back north of El Aroussa while our defences round Bou Arada, some ten miles to the west, held firm in spite of being threatened from three sides. The attack down the B\u00e9ja road was more formidable; our outpost at Sidi Nsir was overwhelmed after a very gallant resistance but the time gained allowed\u2019 46 Division to occupy the pass leading to B\u00e9ja Very heavy fighting continued here for a week; losses in 46 Division were heavy but the defence held firm.

This apparently long delay was rendered necessary by his desire to have all the logistical preparations perfect. I sent my Major-General, Adminustra- tion, Major-General Miller, to Tripoh on 6th March to investigate the adminis- trative situation and his report on his return on rith March was very  satis- factory. The port was discharging over three thousand tons per day, to be shortly raised to four thousand tons, (on 6th March seven thousand tons were discharged, but this was exceptionally good); the ration, petrol and ammunition situation was therefore good and we could already assume as certain that the operation could proceed-according to tme-table. Eighth Army was anxious to know, however, what logistical support we could give in the case that the enemy, after a prolonged resistance on the Mareth line, broke completely and we should wish to pursue him for a long"

The same day a report was received that a patrol of the 24th G.C. Brigade had entered Bardera which was found to be unoccupied. Reports were also received that Iscia Baidoa and Dinsor had already been evacuated as a result of a message from the Duce ordering the evacuation of Italian Somaliland for Abyssinia. This was confirmed by patrols which occupied Iscia Baidoa on 27th February and captured 200 native troops and large quantities of ammuni- tion, supplies and petrol."
