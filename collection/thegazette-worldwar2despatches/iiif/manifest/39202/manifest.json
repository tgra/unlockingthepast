Od. net.\n\nThis set of maps also covers the operations described in the other Air and Army despatches\nof the Burma Campaign from 16th November, 1943 to 12th September, 1945.\n\nThe following despatch was submitted to the\nSecretary of State for Air in August, 1946,\nby AIR CHIEF MARSHAL SIR KEITH\nPARK, G.C.B., K.B.E., MC., D.FC., Allied\nAir Commander-in-Chief, South East Asia.\n\nFOREWORD.\n\n1. Air Power’s contribution to the overthrow\nof Japanese land forces during the closing\nstages of the war in South East Asia, is re-\nviewed in this Despatch, which opens with\nthe period following the Allied Forces’ vic-\ntorious entry into Rangoon on 3rd May, 1945,\nand culminates in the official surrender of the\nJapanese Southern Army to Admiral The Lord\nLouis Mountbatten, at Singapore, on 12th\nSeptember, 1945,\n\n2. During this period, squadrons of the\nRoyal Air Force played a conspicuous réle in\nthe last battle against the enemy land forces\non Burmese soil. More than ten thousand\nJapanese troops, ill-equipped, sick and\ndemoralised, were annihilated by our air and\nground forces while attempting a mass escape\nfrom the Pegu Yomas across the Sittang River\n‘and south to Moulmein. Their Air Force\nhad already been eliminated from Burma.\n\n3. August 1945 brought with it Japan’s\ntealisation of defeat and her decision to sur-\nrender. It forestalled by only a few weeks\nthe planned invasion of Malaya in which over\n500 aircraft of the Royal Air Force and about\n200 carrier-borne aircraft of the Royal Navy\nwould have demonstrated again the power of\nair superiority.\n\n4. Instead, squadrons of the Royal Air Force\nre-directed their energies to the most extensive\nmission of mercy by bringing relief and libera-\ntion, in the initial stages, to tens of thousands\nof Allied prisoners-of-war and internees in the\nmany Japanese prison camps scattered through-\nout the vast territories of South East Asia.\n\n5. The successful accomplishment of this\ntask made a fitting conclusion to Air Power’s\nparticipation in a war against a ruthless and\nfanatical enemy whose years of aggression in\nthese territories ended with crushing and com-\nplete defeat.\n\nPart I.\nRANGOON AND AFTER.\n\nTHE SITUATION IN May, 1945, AFTER THE\nFALt OF RANGOON.\n\n1. With unconditional surrender of Germany\non 8th May, 1945, the conflict in South East\nAsia and in the Far East against the last re-\nmaining of the Axis Powers took on a new\nsignificance, with the balance weighted heavily\nin favour of the Allies against Japan.\n\n2. The only outcome of the war in the East,\nlike the one prescribed for Germany, could\nbe complete and unconditional surrender of\nJapan. :\n\n3. Decisively beaten in Burma, and with\nRangoon recaptured only five days before the\nsurrender of Germany in Europe, Japan, fight-\ning alone, faced almost certain invasion of her\nhomeland in the coming months.

A_ redeployment of manpower and\nmaterial resources from Europe for the war\nagainst Japan was scheduled to begin, which\nwould thus quicken the tempo of operations.\nBut long before the collapse of Germany had\ntaken place in Europe, the plans for the re-\nconquest of Malaya and Singapore had been\nprepared. With the other Commanders-in-\nChief in this Theatre, I shared the conviction\nthat the second half of 1945 would bring the\nreinforcements promised by London. :\n\n5. On the entry into Rangoon on 3rd May,\n1945, theatre strategy was directed to the\nliberation of Singapore at the earliest possible\ndate with a view to opening up the sea-route\nto Indo-China and the East Indies, and to\nliberating enemy-occupied countries. There-\nafter, strategy subsequent to the re-occupation\nof Singapore would depend upon the march\nof events in the Western Pacific Theatre.\n\n6. It had been the contention, hitherto, that\nthe capture of Singapore would involve at Jeast\ntwo intermediate operations before the final\ngoal could be achieved. Firstly, it was con-\nsidered that an initial operation would be\nnecessary to establish an advanced air and\nnaval base. Through this base, aircraft and\nassault craft could be staged and operated in\nsupport of the next operation for the seizure\nand occupation of a bridgehead on the\nMalayan Peninsula. Occupation and develop-\nment of this bridgehead on the mainland was\nconsidered an essential prelude to the final\noverland advance on Singapore itself.\n\n7. Hastings Harbour was originally selected\nas the initial objective, but this was postponed\nto take place after the Monsoon. Further ex-\namination by the Joint Planning Staff at Head-\nquarters, S.A-C.S.E.A., however, indicated that\na stepping-stone still further south than\nHastings Harbour was not only desirable in\nrelation to the time margin, but also a prac-\nticable proposition as regards the fly-in of\nsingle-engined fighters and close support air-\ncraft. It was essential, however, from the\naspect of resources available, that such an\noperation should be a limited commitment as\na military operation and also as regards the\nshipping lift. | These limitations, therefore,\nnarrowed down the selection of this objective\nto a lightly defended island. Puket Island\nfulfilled this requirement. Its occupation was\ntherefore planned for June, 1945.\n\nPuket Operation or “ Roger”.\n\n8. The Puket operation—(“ Roger ”)—was\napproved in ‘principle by the Chiefs of Staff\nin February, 1945, but they reserved judgment\nas to its timing in relation to the fall of\nRangoon. A plan for the operation was never-\ntheless prepared by the Joint Planning Staff\nand Force Commanders’ Staffs were appointed.\n\n’ 9. Force Planning began in Delhi on Febru-\nary 2nd, but it became apparent that the occupa-\ntion of an island so close to the mainland\nwould involve a greater military commitment\nthan had been envisaged earlier. The Army\nconcept of this operation demanded one Divi-\nsion for the assault and initial occupation of\nthe island, including a small bridgehead on the\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\nmainland, and one follow-up Division to con-\nsolidate the position. The Japanese garrison\nof this island was reported to be approximately\none battalion, but other land forces could have\nbeen assembled on the mainland once the\nattack was disclosed.\n\n10. Owing to the distance from our own\nmainland bases, air cover and support would\nhave to be given by carrier-borne aircraft\ninitially until the capture of the first airstrip,\nwhen the Air Forces would accept full respon~-\nsibility for all air operational requirements. I\nsuggested that the Army demands, both in man-\npower and material, were excessive for so small\nan operation (the same opinion being expressed\nby the Supreme Allied Commander and the\nNaval C. in C.). I felt that if such demands\nwere persisted in, it might mean that the opera-\ntion (which would have given vital air bases\nto support a major operation) would have to\nbe dropped. These fears were well-founded,\nas the proposed operation was subsequently\nabandoned, mainly for this reason.\n\n11. Development of the air base at Puket\nenvisaged the completion of three runways to\nall-weather standard, with an initial force of\nthree Single Engine Fighter Squadrons and an\nultimate build-up to:— a\n\n3 S.E.F, Squadrons. ‘\n\n1 Fighter /Recce Squadron.\n\n3 Light Bomber Squadrons.\n\n2 Heavy Bomber Squadrons.\n\nDetachments of Air Sea Rescue and Photo-\n\n_ graphic Reconnaissance Unit.\n\nStaging facilities for air transport and other\ntypes of air traffic.\n\n12. In addition to this, the base would also\nrequire to be capable of staging airborne opera-\ntions in relation to future requirements of the\ncampaign in Malaya. The air base, too, would\nrequire to be fully operational by D plus 100\ndays, while its development to full capacity\nwas so timed as to provide the necessary air\nsupport and cover for the next stage of opera-\ntions comprising re-occupation of the Ports\nSwettenham and Dickson areas, and a bridge-\nhead for the final overland advance on Singa-\npore. The occupation of this bridgehead was\nplanned to take place some four months after\nthe initial occupation of Puket with a view to\nthe final assault for the capture of Singapore.\n\n13. Events in Burma, however, had forced\na change of plan, which envisaged the neces-\nsity to capture Rangoon from the sea before the\nmonsoon broke, and open it as a port to relieve\nthe other overworked supply routes.\n\n14. In this connection, it can now be, put\non record that a R.A.F. Mosquito aircraft,\ncarrying Wing Commander Saunders, made a\nJow reconnaissance of Rangoon the day before\nthe British Armada disembarked. Finding the\ncity empty of Japanese, and Allied flags fiying\nover P.O.W. camps, he landed at the nearest\nairfield, hitchhiked into Rangoon and released\nsome of our P.O.W’s. Wing Commander\nSaunders then borrowed a native boat and\nrowed down the river to tell the British Com-\nmander that Rangoon was unoccupied by the\nenemy, and offered his services as guide to\nthe Expedition. This unusual incident revealed\nthat the enemy forces in Rangoon itself had\ndeparted between the times of departure and\narrival of the sea convoy. It was later revealed\n",

It was realised after Rangoon’s capture\nthat to postpone the Puket operation later than\nmid-June, 1945, would inevitably retard the pro-\ngress of subsequent operations timed progres-\n\nsively for the capture of Singapore by the end.\n\nof the year. The Puket operation was there-\nfore abandoned. With it, there vanished a step-\nping-stone to Singapore which the British Air\nForces could well have utilised to great advan-\ntage.\n\nEffect of Delay upon Future Strategy\n\n16. The importance of accelerating the Allied\nMalayan offensive had been emphasised. In\nthe first instance, it necessitated planning for\nthe occupation and development of Puket\napproximately one month after the Monsoon\nhad set in. Any further delay than this in-\ncurred a steady deterioration in weather con-\nditions and a heavy swell on exposed beaches.\nThe cumulative effect of rain was also calcu-\nlated to cause a steady increase in the saturation\nof the ground and proportionately greater diffi-\nculty in airfield and road construction,\n\n17. It was estimated that the closing stages\nof the campaign in Burma, involving at the\neleventh hour a mounting of the amphibious\noperation “ Dracula” to make doubly certain\nRangoon’s capture, had imposed a minimum of\nnine weeks delay in the initiation of the opera-\ntion to capture the weakly held Puket. It fol-\nlowed, therefore, if Malayan strategy was to be\nimplemented to meet the proposed time\nschedule for the capture of Singapore that this\ninitial delay must be made good quickly.\n\n18. To achieve this there were three courses\nopen for consideration, each of which involved\nmuch planning :—\n\n(1) To select an alternative objective\nwhere airfield development was an easier\nproposition in relation to weather conditions\nand time available, or where airfields already\nexisted.\n\n@) To retain the existing objective but on\na less ambitious scale of airfield develop-\nment and military occupation, thereby speed-\ning up development.\n\n(3) To abandon any project for develop-\nment of a stepping-stone, and to embark\nupon the second phase of our overall strategy\nwhich envisaged a bridgehead on the\nMalayan Peninsula as a prelude to the final\nadvance on Singapore.\n\n19. Course 1, on examination, revealed that\nareas more suitable for airfield development\ndid not fulfil the operational requirements,\nwhile the occupation of existing airfields in\nsuitable areas was likely to require a major\nmilitary operation.\n\n20. As regards Course 2, if some reduction in\nthe scale of effort was acceptable, particularly as\nregards the requirements of heavy bombers,\nthen a substantial reduction in runway develop-\nment could be achieved. This, however,\nwould reduce the overall period of develop-\n\nment to the extent by which the base could -\n\nbe fully operational to provide the\nair support and softening up operations on a\n(68742)\n\n2129\n\nlighter scale in relation to the next phase of\nMalayan operations as timed. Furthermore,\nif reduction in base development were accom-\npanied by a decrease in the scale of military\neffort required to occupy the island, this would\nresult not only in saving time, but also in a\ngeneral economy in resources and shipping.\nThe Army, however, would not agree to any\nreduction in strength of assault and garrison\nforces.\n\n21. Course 3, when considered, had the\ngreat advantage of making up the total time\nlost, which, for reasons which have already,\nbeen stated, was of paramount importance.\n\n22. It was obvious, however, that without\nintermediate air bases, close support by land\nbased aircraft could not be provided either\nas a prelude to or during the initial occupa-\ntion of the bridgehead. .\n\n23. For this purpose, complete reliance had\ntherefore to be placed upon air support and\nair cover by carrier-borne aircraft until suit-\nable airstrips could be prepared within the\nbridgehead. Furthermore, the degree of heavy\nbomber support would be severely limited by\ndistance and weather. Even on the most\noptimistic assumption that one or more heavy\nbomber airfields would be available in Burma\nby September, air bombing involved a distance\nto targets of 1,000 miles with a consequent\nreduction in bomb load and intensity of effort.\n\n24. It was obvious, therefore, that opera-\ntions at such a range could not afford the re-\nquired support for the initial occupation of the\nbridgehead. The lack of an advanced air base\nalso introduced difficulties as regards the fly-in\nof aircraft for the build-up, and a routine ser-\nvice for aircraft replacement.\n\n25. When the problem was examined, the\nJoint Planning Staff recommended Course 3,\nprovided that carrier-borne air forces could be\nassured.\n\n26. Course 3 was therefore adopted, and the\noperation which, in planning, became known\nas “Zipper”, envisaged the occupation of a\nbridgehead in the Port Dickson—Swettenham\narea. The assault, it was intended, should be\ncarried out by two Divisions of No. 34 Indian .\nCorps, with 15 Corps in the following-up réle.\nThe amphibious operation would be under-\ntaken by a naval task force.\n\n27. It was planned that air cover and sup-\nport would be provided initially by carrier-\nborne air forces, presupposing that at least three\nlight fleet carriers would be available for the\noperation in addition to the escort carriers\nalready in the Theatre. The R.A.F. Squadrons\nof 224 Group, which had given outstanding\nservice in Burma, were to be flown into the\nbridgehead as soon as strips were available.\n\n28. As complementary to operation “ Zip-\nper”, planning was also initiated for the\noccupation of Singapore Island under planning\ncode word “ Mailfist ”.\n\n29. The initial assault for “ Zipper” was\ntimed to take place in early September, 1945,\nand subsequent exploitation southwards in\nMalaya was so timed as to permit of the final\nassault on Singapore by the end of December.\n\n30. From the air point of view I consider\nthe “ Zipper” plan for the assault on Malaya\npossessed one distinct disadvantage—its great\n\nA2\n",

Had it not been for the diversion of\nconsiderable military resources to the capture\nof undefended Rangoon, I would have preferred\nan intermediate step to Singapore which would\nhave permitted adequate air support and staging\nof aircraft. Time, however, was not on our\nside. In view of the Army’s commitments at\nRangoon, and of the naval disinclination to\nmake an assault without a suitable anchorage\nnearby, the prospects of any intermediate opera-\ntion completely faded away.\n\n31. The “ Zipper” plan, on the other hand,\ngave the recently occupied Cocos Islands a new\nand important réle as an offensive air base\nin addition to its primary function as a staging\npost to the South West Pacific. Originally, it\nwas intended that the garrisoning Air Forces\nto be based in the Cocos should comprise one\nSingle-Engined Fighter and one Coastal Tor-\npedo Fighter Squadron. The inclusion of the\nCoastal T.F. Squadron was mainly on account\nof a possible threat of enemy sea-borne attack.\nThis threat, however, had steadily declined. In\nconsequence, the operational réle of the T.F.\nSquadron virtually disappeared, while the\nlimited range of T.F. aircraft precluded them\nfrom employment offensively against targets\nwithin and beyond the Netherlands East Indies\nbarrier. Therefore, I decided to substitute one\nLong Range General Reconnaissance squadron\nin the Cocos in place of the T.F. Squadron, thus\nenabling General Reconnaissance Liberator\naircraft to carry out strikes from the Cocos on\ntargets along the coast of Malaya and N.E.I.\nAn additional advantage of the Cocos was the\ncertainty of more favourable weather condi-\ntions during the monsoon.\n\n32. In short, the R.A.F. developed the Cocos\nIslands into a most valuable offensive air base,\nand air staging post.\n\nTue Am BUILD-UP IN BURMA FOR FUTURE\nOPERATIONS.\n\n33. From the review of strategy and plan-\nning for the impending assault of Malaya, it\nwas evident that the air forces would be called\nupon to fulfil commitments extending over a\nvast area from Central Burma southwards to\nSouthern Malaya and around N.E.I., until the\ndefeat of the enemy in the South East Asia\nTheatre.\n\n34. As the result of this trend in future\noperations, the problem of command and\ncontrol of the Air Forces became far wider\nin responsibility than that which had obtained\nhitherto. Accordingly, it was decided that\noperational command and control of all R.A.F.\nGroups other than those serving in Burma\nshould be exercised directly by Headquarters,\nAir Command, South East Asia, through the\nrespective Group Commanders. Air power, it\nwas realised, would soon embark upon a large-\nscale intensification of operations against the\nJapanese, not only in South East Asia, but also\nin the South West Pacific Theatre.\n\n35. While the tempo of air operations had\nzased off considerably after the capture of\nRangoon, the immediate task nevertheless\nfacing the Air Forces was to secure bases and\nall weather airfields for the future redeploy-\nment and reinforcements of the squadrons in\nBurma and Malaya in the quickest possible\n“dime.\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\n36. The decrease in air operations which\ncoincided also with the arrival of the monsoon,\nwas, in every respect, a welcome relief for\nsquadrons. The task of the preceding six\nmonths in supporting and supplying the Allied\nland forces in the non-stop advance to\nRangoon had exhausted R.A-F. personnel to a\ndegree never experienced in the Middle East\nor North West Africa or the Central Mediter-\nranean during 1942-1945. Headquarters\nS.E.A.C. required our squadrons to operate at\nmaximum effort for a longer period than called\nfor in other Theatres. Aircraft, too, had with-\nstood the gruelling test of climate and semi-\ndeveloped airfields. In the race through Burma\nto beat the Jap and the monsoon, No. 221\nGroup Headquarters had moved four times ;\nmoves of Wing Headquarters totalled twenty-\nfive, and,,squadrons made no less than 112\nmovements. ‘These moves by the Air Forces\nin Burma through a tortuous country whose\ntoads and communications were notoriously\nbad, had meant some disorganisation and much\ndiscomfort, but hardly an operational sortie\nhad been lost owing to any forward movement.\nNeither the men, nor the aircraft, however,\ncould go on indefinitely. For the former a\nperiod of rest was necessary; forthe latter,\nre-equipment was in many instances, already\nlong overdue.\n\n37. Jt was during this lull in operations that\ncertain of these squadrons in Burma were rested\nand re-equipped before the next phase in the\ncampaign in South East Asia was due to begin.\nThe “Battle of the Break Through” by\nthousands of Japanese forces trapped in the\nPegu Yomas of Southern Burma had still to\ncome—a battle in which the Air Forces had\nconspicuous success.\n\n38. At this time there were ominous signs\nthat the Japanese Empire was beginning to\nteel under the fury of American air attack,\nwhich was now directed upon it without pause.\n\n39. With the next blows in South East Asia\nabout to descend upon Malaya, the trend of\nthe Air Forces was a movement to the south—\nas far south as possible with Southern Burma\nas the springboard for the major operation\nwhich was to come.\n\n40. The plan required a gradual movement\nof squadrons of fighter bombers, light and\nmedium bombers and indeed, heavy bombers,\nto Southern Burma. It was hoped that by\nAugust, 1945, Mingaladon Airfield, Rangoon,\nwould be capable of providing facilities for 100\naircraft, Toungoo with a capacity for 70 air-\ncraft ; Pegu 70 aircraft ; Zayatkwin 48 aircraft ;\nPabst 50 aircraft; Myingyan 70 aircraft ; and\nMeiktila 70 aircraft.\n\n41. This phased build-up was by no means\nfirm, for there was a decided lack of engineers’\ninformation on the eventual ability of certain\nof the more important and vital airfields. In\nface of Army representations that the original\nplan for the net of airfields in Southern Burma\ncould not be met without diverting Army\nengineers from other tasks in Rangoon, I had\nto agree, most reluctantly, to a much reduced\nconstructional programme in the Rangoon\narea,\n\n42. On entry into Rangoon, speed in airfield\nconstruction was absolutely essential. Delivery\nof bithess, for servicing the only airstrip, was,\n",

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\nhowever, retarded owing to the land com-\nmunication difficulties within the area, and I\nhad to give orders that No. 96 (Dakota)\nSquadron should be given the task of flying-in\nbithess from Bengal to Mingaladon. The task\nwas completed to scheduled time.\n\n43. I regret that the Air Forces should have\nhad to call upon the Army for airfield construc-\ntion in Burma owing to the absence of R.AF.\nairfield construction units and Air Ministry\nWorks Supervisory personnel in this Theatre.\nThere is no doubt that the American system\nof providing aviation engineer battalions in\nBurma proved better and more satisfactory.\nIt might also be noted that some fifteen\nthousand R.A.F. constructional personnel were\nallocated by Air Ministry to the Tiger Force\nOperation in the Pacific, although South East\nAsia Command was deplorably short of\nengineers, and it must have been evident that\nthis new Air Force was most unlikely to\noperate before the defeat of the Japanese.\n\nHastening Construction of Burma Airfields.\n44, Early in June, my Air Marshal Adminis-\ntration visited Rangoon to obtain first-hand\ndetails of the problems being encountered, and\nto hasten construction of airfields as much as\npossible. On my own visit to Rangoon on\nJune 15th, I was assured by Major General\nAdministration, Headquarters, A.L.F.S.E.A.,\nthat all points brought up by my Air Officer\nAdministration were receiving attention.\n\n45. The enormous increase in the Air Forces’\nradius of action which the new airfields under\nconstruction would afford was foreshadowed in\nJune, when R.A.F. heavy bombers, operating\nfrom bases in Bengal, attacked and sank a\n10,000-ton Japanese tanker in the Gulf of Siam.\nOne aircraft damaged by flak was forced to\nland at Mingaladon Airfield, Rangoon, which\nwas not yet completed, and over-ran the avail-\nable length of the runway, killing the crew.\n\n46. The continued pressure by Air Command\non the Army for more speedy construction\nbrought better results, and it was a little more\nheartening, on June 28th, to be given dates\nestimated for the various stages in the com-\npletion of the following airfields in the Rangoon\narea :—\n\nZayatkwin—i,750 yards. A/W runway\nby July 20th.\n\nZayatkwin—2,000 yards. A/W runway\nby July 31st.\n\nMingaladon—1,750 yards. A/W runway\nby July 31st.\n\nMingaladon—2,000 yards. A/W runway\nby August 15th.\n\n47. By October Ist, it was estimated that\nMingaladon Airfield would be capable of\naccommodating a total of 150 aircraft for\noperational purposes. The airfield at Zayat-\nkwin was expected to handle 130 Thunderbolts\nor Mosquitos, and would be staging through\nthe Squadrons for “ Zipper” by Ist October.\nPegu was also being developed as quickly as\npossible as a heavy bomber airfield.\n\n48. While it was expected that squadrons\nwould be able to move into the new airfields\nby the end of July, No. 224 Group, which had\nbeen linked with Lieutenant-General Sir Philip\nChristison’s 15 Corps in some of the fiercest\nfighting in Burma, was preparing to leave the\n\n2131\n\nArakan with its units and to proceed to India\nfor training and re-equipment in preparation\nfor the mounting of “ Zipper ”.\n\n49. The move of 224 Group squadrons was\ngreatly delayed and handicapped on account of.\nthe shortage of shipping and the inadequate\nland transport facilities in Burma. The fact\nthat Army units were also leaving Burma at\nthe same time did not make the position easier\nfor the movement of Air Force personnel and\ntheir equipment. June, indeed, ended with\nthe move of 224 Group far from complete, and\nit soon became apparent that units would not\nsucceed in clearing from the Arakan before the\nthird week in July.\n\nWithdrawal of US.A.A.F. from Air Com-\nmand, South East Asia\n\n50. On June Ist, 1945, because of our air\ndominance, the narrowing front, and the fact\nthat the tactical situation after Rangoon per-\nmitted no offensive action by the\nUS.A.A.F., the British and American Air\nForces reached the parting of the ways in South\nEast Asia Command. The American commit-\nment in Burma had ended with the capture\nof Northern Burma and removal of the enemy\nthreat to the supply line to China.\n\n51. Each Air Force was now to prosecute\nthe air war against the Japanese in neighbour-\ning Theatres. For the Royal Air Force, the\noffensive now headed down the Malay Penin-\nsula to Singapore. For the U.S.A.AF., how-\never, the route lay across the Himalayas to\nChina, since the sphere of the American Com-\nmand was designated the China-Burma-India\nTheatre. Yet another reason for the withdrawal\nof the 10th U.S.A.A.F. was the critical air\nsupply situation in the Northern Combat Area\nCommand, due mainly to the high rate of effort\nat which the 10th Air Force Transport Squad-\nrons had been operating and which was now\nbeginning to tell on personnel and aircraft\nalike. At the same time, the American squad-\nrons required refitting and rest before their\nimpending move to China.\n\n52. The withdrawal of American Squadrons\nfor service in another Theatre did not affect\nthe strategic situation in South East Asia Com-\nmand. The only aircraft which could have\nbeen retained with advantage were (a) the\ntransports which were being phased out gradu-\nally to bridge the gap until the arrival of our\nStage 2 aircraft, and whose withdrawal could\nnot be further delayed on account of the urgent\nneed in China, and (5) the photographic Libera-\ntors of the 24th Combat Mapping Squadron.\n\n53. The period of integration between British\nand American Forces in South East Asia had\nshown a very real spirit of close co-operation\n—a fact which I emphasised in a special Order\nof the Day published on June Ist, announcing\nthe withdrawal from Air Command, South East\nAsia, of the United States Army Air Forces\nunder Major General George E. Stratemeyer,\nEastern Air Command, Calcutta.\n\n54. In my’ Order of the Day, which I sent\nto General Stratemeyer, I revealed how air\npower had followed the basic principle in\nmodern warfare—that the air battle had first\nbeen won before embarking on the land battle.\nOnce the air battle was decided, air power\nwas then able to provide the ground forcee\nwith direct forms of assistance.\n",

The closing down of the fully\nintegrated Eastern Air Command Headquarters\nis, therefore, an important milestone in the war\nagainst Japan.\n\n“Eastern Air Command was formed on 15th\nDecember, 1943, at a critical time in the Battle\nof Burma, in order to weld into one Command\nihe British and American Air Forces on this\n\n‘ont.\n\n“The British Army was hanging on to the\nwestern fringes of Burma, having stemmed\nthe Japanese advance into Bengal.\n\n“When the British Army was besieged in\nImphal due to Japanese infiltration resulting\nfrom their superior mobility, the first task of.\nthe newly formed Eastern Air Command was\nto obtain air superiority in order to enable\nour close support squadrons to assist the land\nforces.\n\n“Within a short time air superiority was\n\n- obtained, due in no small measure to the long\ntange fighter squadrons of the U.S.A.A.F. It\nenabled the Allied Transport Squadrons to sup-\nply and reinforce the beleaguered Army ; also,\nit gave them the mobility which previously the\nJapanese had monopolised. From this time,\nuntil the capture of Rangoon in May, 1945,\nthe Allied Land Forces enjoyed all the benefits\nof air supremacy which, in turn, kept inviolate\nthe air supply lines and endowed the Allied\nArmy with the mobility and striking power to\nforge ahead to Mandalay, followed shortly by\nRangoon. It made possible the isolation of\nthe Japanese Army in Burma by Allied air-\ncraft, thus preventing the arrival of reinforce-\nments and supplies from Siam and Malaya.\n\n“Jn Northern Burma, the Tactical and\nTransport Squadrons of the 10th U.S.A.A-F.\nplayed a decisive part in the repulse of the\nenemy from the Chinese border and in the re-\nopening of the overland route to China.\n\n“A Japanese officer who was captured in\nBurma attributed the defeat of the Japanese\nArmy to the superior mobility of the Allied\nArmy. This mobility was almost entirely due\nto the air supply provided by the Allied Air\nForces, whose record tonnage exceeded 2,900\ntons per day in April, 1945. Due mainly to\ntheir superior numbers and operating at maxi-\nmum effort, the American Transport Squadrons\ncarried the greater portion of the air lift in\nsupport of the land forces in Burma.\n\n“Tn conclusion, it is fair to say that without\nthe support of the American Air Forces in\nBurma, we could not have defeated the\nJapanese Army as rapidly and as decisively in\n1945. All British Forces, both land and air,\nare deeply grateful for the whole hearted sup-\nport and complete harmony that existed\n‘between the American and British Air Force\nunits in this Theatre.\n\n“T am exceedingly proud to have had these\nAmerican Air Force units in my Command,\nand, together with all members of the British\nAir Force in South East Asia, wish them good\nluck, and good hunting.”\n\n, 56. In my Order of the Day announcing dis-\nintegration of Eastern Air Command, I did not\nmake especial mention of units of the Air\nService Command, but, instead I wrote to\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\nLieutenant General D. I. Sultan, Commanding\nGeneral, India-Burma Theatre, U.S. Army, and\nexpressed the valuable and splendid work\nwhich the Air Service Command had per-\nformed under Major General T. J. Handley,\nJnr. Without this help, we should have failed\nto carry through the intensive operations of the\nprevious 12 months.\n\n57. While it was necessary to sever the\nBritish and American Combat units of Eastern\nAir Command, and Air Command, South East\nAsia, there was, however, no break as yet with\nthe Air Service Command.\n\n58. With disintegration of Eastern Air Com-\nmand, the air offensive in South East Asia\nnow passed in its entirety to the Royal Air\nForce, and an exceedingly active period in the\ndeployment of squadrons in Burma began.\nThus, the integration ordered by the Supreme\nCommander in December, 1943, had been ful-\nfilled in so far as it concerned the integration\nof British and American Air Forces employed\nin the defeat of the Japanese in Burma.\n\nThe Impact of “Tiger Force” on Air Com-\nmand.\n\n59. For some time after the capture of Ran-\ngoon in May, there were indications that Tiger\nForce was going to be favoured by London in\nmen and material resources previously pro-\nmised to South East Asia Command.\n\n60. The Supreme Allied Commander,\nAdmiral Mountbatten, showed his reliance on\nthe Air Force in this Theatre, by a strong signal\nto the Chiefs of Staff expressing his intense\ndisappointment at the contemplated step since\nhe considered it would delay his carrying out\ntheir directive to open up the Straits of Malacca\nand to recapture Singapore at the earliest pos-\nsible date.\n\n61. I also communicated the concern felt\nby the Supreme Allied Commander to the\nChief of Air Staff, emphasising that future\nstrategy and operations in this Theatre had\nbeen based on the agreed rate of build-up of\nthe British Air Forces and especially of British\nTransport and Heavy Bomber squadrons.\nMoreover, the withdrawal programme of the\nUS.A.AF. forces for China which had now\nbegun, had been agreed and phased in with\nthe rate of build-up of the British Air Forces.\n\n62. The question of airfields in South East\nAsia for staging Tiger Force through to the\nFar East also presented some difficulties, since\nthe most suitable area’ was Rangoon where\ninsufficient bases for our own aircraft were\navailable. In the United Kingdom it was\nthought that Chittagong and Cox’s Bazaar were\ntoo far from Manila, and they were not\naccepted as alternatives.\n\n63. It became clear that Air Command,\nSouth East Asia, must accept the situation\n\n‘ wherein the air war in the Pacific against\n\nJapan received higher priority than ourselves.\nThis was finally confirmed by a signal from\nthe Chief of Staff in London on June 22nd,\npart of which read :—\n\n“In case you are in doubt, ‘ Zipper’ and\n‘Mailfist’ have been approved by the Com-\nbined Chiefs of Staff with the proviso that\nthese operations are conducted without pre-\njudice to the preparation and execution of\noperations for the invasion of Japan and\nother operations directly connected there-\nwith.”\n",

At the beginning of July, Air Vice-Mar-\nshals Sharp and Satterly arrived at Air Com-\nmand on their return from the West Pacific\nwhere they had been making preliminary\narrangements for air bases of Tiger Force.\n\n165. I then learned that, owing to the lack of\nairfields, operations by the V.H.Bs. (Very\nHeavy Bombers) were not expected to begin\nuntil the end of 1945. This delay greatly sim-\nplified the problem of providing staging posts\nfor Tiger Force aircraft through India and\nBurma since, by the time Tiger Force could\nbe in transit, both the monsoon and “ Zipper ”\nwould have finished, leaving fair-weather air-\nfields available for Tiger Force in the Rangoon\narea.\n\n46. It was indicated by the visiting Air Vice-\nMarshals that A.C.S.E.A. were expected to\niprovide staging facilities, not only for the\ninitial aircraft, but also for the reinforcement\nflow and for a daily transport service of three\naircraft each way. They further expressed\nthe hope that the maintenance of their reserve\naircraft would be accepted by this Command.\n\n67. I consider it worthy of note that while\nAir Command South East Asia was barely\nmaking do with transport resources of Dakotas\nwhich still constituted the major life-line of\nthé 12th Army, engaged with the Japanese at\nbay in the Sittang area of Southern Burma\nduring July, the representatives of Tiger Force\nassumed that Yorks and C.87s would be forth-\ncoming as a matter of course, for their trans-\nport requirements.\n\n68. Other examples of this clash in priorities\n\nwere not lacking, for it was disappointing to\nJearn from Air Ministry by signal on July 21st\nthat, owing to prior needs of Tiger Force, no\nLancasters or Lincolns could be expected save\nfor Air/Sea Rescue before mid-1946.\n_ 69. My appeal to Air Ministry for Lan-\ncasters and Lincolns had been for no other\nreason that I was concerned about the future\nheavy bomber supply situation in the Com-\nmand. I took the long view that we could\nnot expect to rely upon U.S. supplies of\nLiberators and, as the result of the difficulties\nwhich were already arising over spares and\nmaintenance backing, I was, therefore, anxious\nto start the re-equipment of the heavy bomber\nsquadrons and to introduce Lancasters vice\nLiberators into Air/Sea Rescue, Meteorological\nand several training units.\n\nPart If.\n\nTHE AIR WAR IN BURMA AND\nBEYOND.\n\nArr SUPERIORITY.\n\nWon and Maintained after Air Battles over\nArakan in 1943-44.\n\n70. Allied air superiority in South East\nAsia was won and maintained in the Theatre\nafter the air battles over Bengal and Burma\nlate in 1943 and the Spring of 1944, and re-\nmained almost unchallenged until the final\nsurrender of the Japanese.\n\n71. This air superiority is not always given\nits full value when the fortunes of war in\nBurma are weighed. ‘Without it, the history\nof the indomitable 14th Army might well\nhave centred around a fighting force, justly\ncapable of defence, but not capable of sus-\ntained offence. Air superiority too, meant a\n\n2133\n\n“safe conduct” for the air transport fleets\nengaged upon air supply and reinforcing of\nthe advancing troops. At one time no single\nDakota in Burma could with safety have taken\nthe air on any supply mission had not the\nair lanes been protected by our short range\nfighters.\n\n72. Air superiority, whether used for the\nclose support of the ground forces, or the\ninterdiction of lines of communication far\nbeyond the battle area, or in air supply or in\ncasualty evacuation, was indisputably ours,\na fact which Japanese Army Commanders\nthemselves confirmed after their surrender in\nAugust, 1945.\n\n73. In the Japanese Army, one Commander\nhad said, there had never been any real plan\nto develop the Military Air Forces. The air\nweapons he said, had been neglected from the\nbeginning in favour of ground weapons. Ever\nsince the China Incident, however, there had\nbeen a growing feeling that Japanese air\npower must be developed at all costs, but this\nrealisation had come too late, and even then,\nthe Army’s claims had over-ridden the long\nterm policy which recognised the absolute\nnecessity of a wide expansion of air power\nand the production of aircraft.\n\n74. Another Japanese officer, after fighting\nagainst us in South East Asia, said that almost\nalways the Japanese Army had left the con-\nstruction of airfields until the last, having con-\ncentrated firstly upon its own ground defences.\n\nFew Airfields left to J.A.F. in Burma.\n\n75. While the main Japanese Army had re-\ntreated to Moulmein after the fall of Rangoon\nin May, it still preserved enough strength to\nmake a spirited stand during July at what\ncame to be known as “The Battle of the\nSittang Bend.”\n\n76. The Japanese Air Force,‘on the other\nhand, had been driven out of Burma com-\npletely broken. No attempt, indeed, was’ made.\nto alleviate the distress in which the thousands\nof trapped Japanese forces in Burma found\nthemselves during July.\n\n77. Only twelve months earlier, the Japanese\nAir Force in South East Asia had made 333\nsorties in May of 1944 in their last bid to\ntip the scales in their favour at the siege of\nImphal, but had failed. For them, this air\neffort was a record for the Japanese Air Force\nfor any single month when the targets were\nAllied airfields and troop concentrations in the\nManipur Valley.\n\n(78, The enemy had behind them at that time\nthe important air bases at Shwebo, north of\nMandalay, and, in Central Burma, they pos-\nsessed the airfields at Meiktila, Magwe,\nPyinmana, Prome and Toungoo. Their most\nsoutherly bases were those which comprised\nthe Rangoon group of airfields.\n\n79, The Allies’ sweep through Burma and\nthe capture of Rangoon however, had taken\nall these airfields from the Japanese. All that\nremained to them in Southern Burma were\nthree serviceable airfields located at Tavoy,\nMergui and Victoria Point, on the Tenasserim\nCoast, and these soon became the regular\ntargets for our aircraft based at Rangoon.\n\n80. In June, 1945, yet another indication of\nthe weakness of the Japanese air power in\nSouth East Asia in face of air superiority was\n",

When Fourteenth Army marched a\nthousand miles through Burma in six months\nthey achieved a great military feat in a country\nwhich had been deemed hitherto to be almost\nphysically impassable and medically disastrous\nfor the mass movement of men. ‘With that\nArmy, the Air Forces went every mile of the\nway—scouting, supporting, reinforcing, supply-\ning, evacuating wounded and striking ahead\nof the advancing troops, to disrupt Japanese\nlines of communication and supply bases.\n\n82. The same air-ground co-operation which\nbrought about the fall of Rangoon and the\nre-conquest of Burma would have been re-\npeated on a grand scale for the assault planned\non Malaya—forestalled only by Japanese\nsurrender. Even then the flexibility of Air\nPower was such that, in the emergency which\nfollowed the cessation of hostilities, it was able\nto re-direct its energies in one of the greatest\nrelief and liberation operations of World\nWar IL\n\n83.

When the Japanese pulled out of Ran-\ngoon, and the remnants of the main army\nsucceeded in reaching Moulmein after the dis-\nastrous retreat down the Central Corridor in\nApril, hostilities in Burma were by no means\nover, -\n\n85. There was no question of the enemy’s\ncapacity to stage a serious comeback ; his sup-\nply lines were no longer reliable and the\nJapanese Air Force was out of the race.\n\n86. But there was one aspect of the cam-\nipaign which was not yet complete and one\nwhich began to assume greater importance now\nthat the Allied Forces had established them-\nselves firmly in Southern Burma and Rangoon.\nIt was the presence of the large isolated\nforces of Japanese troops in Central and North\nBurma, estimated at over 50,000 men. While\nthe Allied advance down the Central Corridor\nduring March and April had driven a\nwedge through a crumbling enemy defence, it\nhad, at the same time, forced a considerable\nstrength of Japanese troops into the hill\nregions of Eastern and Western Burma, iso-\nlating them from the main Japanese army as\nit retreated on Moulmein.\n\n87. The Air Forces, principally those of No.\n221 Group, and the Allied ground forces\ndeployed in Southern Burma, swung round to\nface these large concentrations of Japanese\ntroops in the north between the Irrawaddy and\n‘the Mandalay railway corridor in Central\nBurma and the railway corridor and the\nSittang and Salween Rivers to the east. Their\nobject was to close the principal escape routes\nwhich these Japanese forces must pass through\nto get out of Burma.\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\n. 88. Few factors sustain the morale of fight-\ning men more than the knowledge that supplies\nof provisions and equipment are assured. The\nisolated Japanese forces in Burma, however,\nas the result of disruption and disorganisation\nof their rear lines of communication, were ill-\nequipped, and certainly denied any possibility\nof supply by air. They suffered considerably\nthrough shortages of food, also medical sup-\nplies, and took to eating attractive looking\nbut dangerous fruits.\n\n89. So long as these trapped Japanese\nforces remained on Burmese soil, however,\nthey required considerable effort from the air\nto watch their movement and to destroy them\nas opportunity arose,\n\nThe Competitive Spirit of Squadrons.\n\n90. The task of hunting and destroying these\nisolated, pockets of Japanese forces, in co-\noperation with the Allied ground troops, fell\nlargely upon the squadrons of No. 221 Group,\nsince No. 224 Group, after its fine record of\nachievement in Burma, was now in the pro-\ncess of pulling out for training and re-equip-\nment in Southern India prior to the assault on\nMalaya.\n\n91. The competitive spirit among squadrons\nsoon produced keen offensive patrols in seek-\ning out the enemy with Mosquitos, Beau-\nfighters, Hurricanes, Spitfires and Thunderbolts\ncovering wide areas of country—in spite of\nMonsoon weather—and succeeding in driving\nparties of Japanese troops off the main escape\nroutes and forcing them to seek the cover of\njungle or scrub.\n\n92. In this offensive drive by the squadrons\nduring May and June, a total of 4,813 sorties\nwas flown by our aircraft in monsoon weather\nto bomb and strafe the enemy.\n\n93. It was during this period that a return\nwas made to jungle warfare in Burma, as grim\nand fierce as anything experienced by the air\nand ground forces during previous months.\nThe air forces faced the considerable hazards\nof monsoon flying conditions as they attacked\nenemy troop. concentrations attempting to re-\ngroup and reach appointed regrouping areas.\n\n‘94, The effectiveness of these R.A.F. jungle\nstrikes was not only substantiated in apprecia-\ntive messages by the Army, but also by\nJapanese officer prisoners-of-war captured at\nthis period. Of the air forces operating\nagainst them, a Japanese officer, a L/Cpl., and\na Superior Private had said during interroga-\ntion: —\n\n“ Dawn found us heading towards a village\n\n‘on the opposite shore. Later, we found that\nit was near Mumbu. We cooked some rice\nand afterwards all went to sleep in a bamboo\nclump on the bend of the river. Sleep, how-\never, was not so easy, for the enemy \"planes\nwere roaring overhead, and we would awake\nin a cold sweat in the midst of a horrible\nnightmare.”\n\n95. There could be no doubt that the enemy\nhad a healthy respect for our British Air Force\nand sought the cover of undergrowth when\nsurprised by our fighters, which strafed them\nincessantly. A Japanese Private of the 82nd\nAir Field Battalion, captured in Burma, when\nshown a collection of silhouettes of Allied\naircraft, picked out the Spitfire as the aircraft\nmost feared by the Japanese.\n",

By the end of June, the net was gradually\ntightened around the isolated Japanese land\nforces holding out in the Pegu Yomas in\nCentral Burma. The monsoon continued. The\nheavy rains made the movement of Allied\ntroops and their supporting arms exceedii\ndifficult on the fringes of the Pegu Yona\nalong the Mawchi Road east of Toungoo.\n\n97. The Japanese, however, got no nearer to\nescape. Whenever weather permitted, the\nsquadrons of 221 Group were overhead\nendeavouring to locate the enemy in the most\ndifficult of wooded country, and bombing on\nevery occasion whatever targets presented\nthemselves. For days, aircraft continued to\nsearch for heavily laden animal transports\nwhich the enemy were pressing into service to\ncarry accoutrement of every description., Even\nlumber elephants, taken from their ‘work in the\nfamous Teak Forests of Burma, were employed\nin carrying light guns and other heavy equip-\nment for the enemy. If the monsoon proved\na handicap to the Allied Forces it was worse\nfor the Japanese, who were completely cut off\nfrom sources of supply. In the Pegu Yomas,\nthe plight of the enemy, as a result of the\nvigilance of air power and the movement of\nAllied ground troops, became desperate as they\nstruggled against malaria and starvation, or\nsuffered foot-rot and stomach and skin troubles.\nSome, indeed, were like skeletons. when\ncaptured, while the remainder, still imbued\nwith fanaticism of glory and death, rather\nthan disgrace in surrender, struggled on.\n\n98. In their jungle strikes and “hunting”\nexpeditions, the squadrons obtained a large\nnumber of good results in spite of the diffi-\nculties of weather and thick ground cover. If\nthe enemy looked for a lull in operations as a\ntesult of the monsoon, thus giving them an\nopportunity to regroup, they got none from the\nR.A.F. squadrons and ground forces.\n\n99. In the Mokpalin area, where No. 20\nSquadron had damaged much enemy transport,\na message sent by Headquarters, 4 Corps, after\nthe strike, said :—\n\n“Thanks for the magnificent efforts\nyesterday on the Mokpalin road.”\n\n100. When Mosquitos of 47 Squadron went\nout on a strike, they bombed a village north\neast of Nyaunglobin, where it was reported\nthat the Japanese, moving south, had taken\ncover during the day. The Mosquitos dis-\npersed their bombs well among the bashas and\non dumps of packing cases seen on either side\nof the roadway, while many low flying attacks\nmade across the area did extensive damage.\n\n101. An Army report which reached 221\nGroup Headquarters stated that during an ait\nattack in the Meprawse area, some 30 to 40\nbullock carts carrying food were accounted for,\ntwo petrol dumps destroyed and 50 to 70\nJapanese troops killed.\n\n102. Up the Mawchi Road, Hurricanes went\nafter a number of guns or tanks stated to be\nmoving in the district. Two attacks which\nthey made on heavily camouflaged objects,\nrevealed large guns with limbers or tractors.\nThey left the targets in flames.\n\n103. The plight of the enemy as a result of\nthese jungle strikes worsened. A report\nbrought in, following an air strike by No. 11\n\n2135\n\nSquadron, said that “the villagers reported\nthat they carried away 30 Japanese corpses\nafter the strike.”\n\n104. Some time earlier, a strike by Nos. 79\nand 261 Squadrons brought the following\nmessage from Headquarters, 20 Indian Infantry\nDivision : —\n\n“One 75 mm gun, one 70 mm gun, one\n\n77 mm A/T gun, one 20 mm A/T rifle, six\n\npistols, six swords, approximately 100 rifles,\n\nthree stacks of ammunition and much\nartillery ammunition,”\nwere found by ground forces after a successful\nair attack.\n\n105. In the last week of June, the main con-\ncentration of Japanese forces in Central Burma,\nwas opposite Nyaunglobin, with protective\nforces north west of Pegu and south west of\nPyu, which gave R.A.F. Thunderbolts oppor-\ntunities for attacks. During one raid, six\naircraft of 79 Squadron bombed the village of\nThaingon. Some days later it was learned that\n170 Japanese and 40 mules had been killed.\n\n106. On the Sittang river too, where move-\nment by the enemy became more active, Spitfire\naircraft undertook patrols down the river,\ndamaging and sinking smail river craft of every\ndescription almost daily, thus helping our\nground forces to interrupt enemy efforts in that\narea to escape across the river.\n\n“ Force 136” and Sittang River Air Patrol.\n\n107. There were other major difficulties\nwhich stood in the way of the trapped Japanese\nforces in escaping from Burma. The guerilla\ntactics of “Force 136”, which later played a\nconspicuous part in the slaughter of the enemy\non the Sittang River, helped to seal this stretch\nof water against any large scale enemy crossing.\n\n108. The forces of Burmese guerillas, which\nbegan to assume considerable importance at\nthis time in Burma, had caused the utmost\nconcern to small parties of Japanese stragglers,\nwho suffered severe losses at their hands.\nThese guerillas had been operating with success\nduring the latter weeks of March, and through-\nout April, but they were even more active\nduring June and July, as the Japanese casualty\nfigures testified. :\n\n109. Organising the Burmese patriots was\nthe work of the British Organisation in Burma\nknown as “Force 136”. It was an inde-\npendent body which operated both with the Air\nForces and the Army. The Force consisted of\ntrained and specially picked officers who were\ndropped by parachute into enemy-occupied\nareas to organise Burmese levies and to wage\nsurprise attacks against the Japanese. This\nguerilla warfare demanded the closest liaison\nwith the Air Forces. Supplies, including arms\nand ammunition, were air dropped once the\nparties of levies had been organised.\n\n110. It was through the machinery of “Force\n136” too, that much valuable information\non enemy dumps, troop movements, head-\nquarters, and concentrations of transport carry-\ning food, stocks and equipment, was passed\nby ‘W/T to Army Headquarters, and special\nair-strikes quickly organised for the squadrons\nof 221 Group, R.AF. These tasks were carried\nout eagerly by pilots, and many profitable\nand successful strikes were made against the\n",

The air patrol on the Sittang River,\non the other hand, consisted of three standing\npatrols daily—dawn, midday and dusk. The\nduration of the patrols up and down the river\nwas so varied that the Japanese could never\nbe certain of escape. ;\n\n112. During one such patrol in June, two\nHurricanes of 28 Squadron came upon 50\nriver craft of all types in the Suppanu Chaung\nand, after damaging them by strafing, went on\nto Letpan and there strafed several boats\ndrawn up on the bank of the river near some\nvillages.

Disaster overtook the Japanese during\nJuly, when their final bid to break through\nthe Allied net and escape from Burma ended\nin a debacle.\n\n115. It was one of the blackest periods for\nthe enemy throughout their ill-fated campaign.\nMore than 10,000 men were killed in the\nmonth’s operations. Those who succeeded in\ngetting away and joining the main Japanese\nforces at Moulmein, took with them a picture\nof the punishing they had faced from the\nBritish air forces, the warring guerillas, and\nthe newly-formed 12th Army under Lieutenant\nGeneral Sir Montague Stopford.\n\n116. Operations by the air and ground forces\nin this last major battle in Burma took on an\nentirely new character from the mobility and\nspeed which had so characterised the pursuit\nof the enemy down the central railway corri-\ndor during April and May. Instead, the lull\nperiod in June had given the squadrons and\nground forces a better opportunity to deploy\nat strategic points in Southern Burma, so that\nthe enemy break-through from the Pegu Yomas,\nwhen it ultimately took place, developed into\na wholesale killing. The monsoon forced\nR.A-F. Squadrons to base themselves at air-\nstrips other than they would have preferred,\nbut, even so, the operations were maintained.\n\n117. The squadrons of 221 Group, R.AF.,\naccounted for at least 2,000 Japanese casualties.\nThroughout the campaign it was always diffi-\ncult to assess with accuracy the number of\nactual casualties inflicted by the air forces and\nour own artillery.\n\n118. Four separate phases characterised the\nJuly battle.\n\n@ There was a sudden flare-up of enemy\nactivity on the Sittang Bend at the opening\nof the month where the Japanese, firmly\nestablished at (Mokpalin, succeeded in\nmaking a bridgehead across the river and,\nafter some grim fighting, succeeded in hold-\ning on the right bank, an area of approxi-\nmately one square mile of country, encom-\npassing the villages of Nyaungkashe, Abya,\nand Myitkye.\n\n(6) Up country, on the Sittang, taking in\nan area. between Shwegyin and Kyaukkye,\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\nparties of Japanese troops, as they en-\n\ndeavoured to escape by crossing to the left\n\nbank of the Sittang, coniinued to fall into\nthe hands of organised guerillas.\n\n(c) Yet further to the north 19 Indian\nDivision and Patriot Burmese Forces in the\nworst of monsoon weather, were struggling\nalong the Mawchi Road from Toungoo in\nan effort to reach Mawchi, and cut the\nmain escape route of large Japanese forces\nTetreating southwards down the road from\nLoikaw, and Kemapyu, on the Salween\nRiver, and then south by valley tracks which\nled to Papun and Kamamaung. From\nPapun, one escape route continued south-\nwest to Bilin with easy access by road and\ntail to Moulmein. The second escape route\nfrom Papun went south-east to Kamamaung,\nthence by ferry down the Salween to\nShwegun, and there joined a track leading\nthrough Pa-An to Moulmein.\n\n@) The final, and major phase, was the\nlarge scale attempted break-through across\nthe railway corridor from the Pegu Yomas,\nstarting on July 2ist, by Japanese troops\nwhose strength had now been estimated to be\nabout 18,000, of which about 1,000\nwere left behind sick in the Yomas\nand could not take part in the breakout\noperations.\n\n119. Squadrons which played such a con-\nspicuous part in these operations were deployed\nas follows :—\n\n(a) ‘When the sudden flare up at the Sittang\nBend began, No. 906 Wing with Nos. 273\nand 607 Squadrons ; one detachment of night\nBeaufighters, and the H.Q. and one flight\nof No. 28 Fighter Recce Squadron, were\nbased at Mingaladon, Rangoon, thus within\neasy reach of this enemy force.\n\n(6) Based at Kinmagon was No. 908\nWing with Nos. 47 and 110 Mosquito Squad-\nrons, which were able, weather permitting,\nto afford valuable support to the parties of\nguerillas in their successful attacks on the\nJapanese in the Sittang river area.\n\n(c) No. 910 Wing was based at Meiktila\nwith four Thunderbolt squadrons, Nos. 34,\n42, 79 and 113, ready for action at the first\nsign of the break-through from the Pegu\nYomas.\n\n(d) Assisting 19 Indian Infantry Division\non the Mawchi road, was 909 Wing at\nToungoo, with No. 155 Spitfire Squadron,\nand later strengthened by No. 152 Spitfire\nSquadron which moved down to Thedaw\nfor a short period, and, at other times, staged\nthrough Toungoo.\n\n120. When the break-through by the\nJapanese from the Pegu Yomas started on\nJuly 21st, the whole of the air support was\nswitched over to this area and, for eight or\nnine days, the bewildered enemy was\nstrenuously harassed by the squadrons sup-\nporting the 12th Army.\n\nBattle of the Sittang Bend.\n\n121.

It was flat, open country with scattered\nscrub, and: some very fierce fighting took place\nin appalling weather at Nyaungkashe, Abya,\nand Myikye. The village of Nyaungkashe, in-\ndeed, changed hands several times.\n\n123. Air support thrown in by 221 Group,\nincluded the Spitfire and Thunderbolt\nsquadrons operating continuous patrols or\n“Cabranks” in the Nyaungkashe area. The\nenemy took exceedingly heavy punishment.\nHis determination to hold this area, at all costs,\nhowever, until the large Japanese forces to the\nnorth got down past Bilin, with the strategic\ntown of Mokpalin on their right, safeguarded\nby the Sittang troops, was obvious.\n\n124. Day after day, gun positions, troop con-\ncentrations, and river craft of all descriptions\nwere subjected to intensive attacks by the air\nforces, bringing sincere thanks from the Army.\nOn July 4th, No. 42 Squadron’s Thunderbolts\nhad a most successful day, when a 105mm\ngun was wrecked and two other guns silenced\nat Nyaungkashe.\n\n125. It was at this time that some forces\nof 7 Indian Infantry Division found themselves\nim a precarious position as a result of the\ndetermined Japanese thrust, but, assisted by air\nattack, succeeded in extricating themselves.\n\n126. “ With the help of excellent air sup-\nport quickly given,” wrote Lieutenant General\nMesservy to Air Vice-Marshal Bouchier,\nA.O.C, 221 Group, “I have been able to extri-\ncate some four hundred men, including sixty\nwounded, from a difficult situation with good\nknocks to the Japs at the same time.”\n\n127. It was noted throughout these air\noperations, and further substantiated by ground\nreports, that a considerable number of Japanese\ntroops were killed as a result of air attacks.\n\n128. By July 11th, the Japanese offensive at\nthe Sittang Bend had been contained, though\nthe enemy still retained their foothold on the\nTight bank of the Sittang, opposite Mokpalin.\n\nAir Power Assists the Guerillas.\n\n129. As the month advanced, a notable\nmovement of enemy troops endeavouring to\ncross the Sittang River in parties at various\npoints between Shwegyin and Kyaukke, kept\nthe Spitfire squadrons on continuous patrol\nover the Sittang River exceedingly active.\nThunderbolt squadrons, too, came down from\nthe Meiktila area to attack forces of Japanese\nnumbering, in some instances, one thousand\nstrong, as they made their way eastwards. The\nlarge scale break-through from the Pegu\nYomas had not yet started.\n\n130. It was in this area of the Sittang, and\nalso in the east, on the right bank of the\nSalween, that the organised guerillas, which\nhad been brought under the control of 12th\nArmy, ambushed hundreds of escaping\nJapanese troops moving down from Loikaw\nto Papun, and literally massacred them. No\nenemy party was safe from these guerillas\nunder Force 136 who, with portable W/T,\nkept base informed of the enemy’s movements\nand as a result provided the Mosquitos and\nSpitfires with definite targets, which they\nbombed and strafed untiringly.\n\n131. The guerillas’ flag was seen regularly |\n\nby pilots heading for their targets. They were\nassisted by large indicator arrows on the\nground, and even cryptic messages which the\n\n2137\n\nlevies had conceived. On one occasion, pilots,\ncorrectly interpreting a message, “In M”,\nlocated a Japanese force in 2 marsh,\n\n132, Following a heavy raid on Pa-An, one\nof the principal staging villages used by the\nJapanese while moving down the Salween\nvalley, a message sent from our land forces to\n273 and 607 Squadrons on July Ist said: —\n\n“More than five hundred Japs killed in\n\nJast heavy raid on Pa-An. Did not tell you\n\nbefore as awaiting confirmation. Congrats to\n\npilots.”\n\n133. An earlier report had described this\nwhole area after the raids as covered in dust\nand smoke, with Japanese soldiers seen running\nabout in panic and rushing for shelter as air-\ncraft came down to strafe them. The Mos-\nquito Squadrons got equally effective results\nfor, during a strike at Kawludo, an enemy\nstaging post in the Salween valley, north of\nPapun, a ground zeport stated that over one\nhundred Japanese troops had been killed.\n\n134, Thunderbolts and Spitfires carried out\na very successful attack on July 15th and 16th,\nin the Shwegyin Chaung area of the Sittang,\nand a message from Kyadwin to 113 Squadron\nand 607 Squadron said: —“ Tell R.A.F, strike\ngreat success.”\n\n135. North East of Kyadwin, at Paungzeik,\nMosquitos of 47 Squadron, on July 16th,\nmade a bombing and strafing attack in the\nPaungzeik valley and 51 dead Japanese were\ncounted after the attack. Yet another attack\nby aircraft on the 19th, at Shanywathit,\nresulted in two direct hits being made on a\nhouse which was full of Japanese troops, and\nover eighty are believed to have been killed.\n\n136. The reports of successful air strikes\nagainst the escaping enemy were many and\nvaried. In the credit for their success the\nguerillas of Force 136 must equally share.\nTheir daring in approaching large enemy\nparties and making sudden furious assaults on\nthem with gunfire and grenades before retiring\nto their hideouts to plan further surprise raids,\nwas outstanding in this final killing of the\nJapanese in Burma. The risks, too, which they\nran, while blatantly guiding aircraft on to\nenemy concentrations, frequently involved them\nin hazardous escapes. Many escapes were only\nmade possible indeed, by aircraft swooping in\nbetween the levies and the enemy, strafing the\nJapanese pursuers. If caught, guerillas were\ntortured cruelly by the enemy.\n\nTribute to R.A.F. from Guerilla Leader.\n\n137. A tribute paid to the Royal Air Force\nin Burma came from the leader of one of these\ncourageous parties operating in the Okpyat\narea of the Sittang.\n\n“Both I and every guerilla would like to\nmake it known to every pilot who took part\nin the battle of the Okpyat area just how.\nmuch all the brilliant offensive action of the\nR.A.F. fighter-bomber pilots was appre-\nciated,” wrote Captain J.

Whilst these exploits revealed the mag-\nnificent work of aircrews, they illustrated at\nthe same time the confidence and daring of the\nBritish-led irregular, for whom the pilots of\n221 Group squadrons felt most strongly that\nit was a case of “Hats right off” to the\nguerillas.\n\n139. “From Letpangon we were attacked\nby two hundred Japs at 23.30 hours. We only\nkilled fifteen of them, but we kept them there\nfor you to attack next day when you put in\ntwo good strikes. They cleared out after dark,\nand went on to Yindaikaein where you were\nable to attack them again,” said Captain\nWaller.\n\n140. The combined attacks on the Japanese\naircraft and guerilla parties constituted a war\nof attrition on the enemy. They could never\nbe sure of safety in any village they passed\nthrough, and roads, planked with thick scrub,\nwere a perpetual nightmare. The guerillas\nwere masters in the art of ambush. With the\nair forces to supply and assist them they\nseemed to be everywhere, and to know the\nenemy’s next move. This was evident from the\ncasualties they inflicted against the Japanese.\n\n141. It was after an attack by air forces on\na large concentration of Japanese troops at\nLetpangon, that the Okpyat Guerilla party,\nwhich had been pinning down the enemy until\nthe aircraft arrived, went out in a most success-\nful mopping-up task.\n\n142, Captain ‘Waller reported to the R.AF.,\n“We only killed 15 of them but you killed\n105 in three cracking good air strikes. You\nalso saved the lives of almost three thousand\noccupants and evacuees in Okpyat who were\ncompletely cut off.”\n\nJapanese Break-through from Pegu Yomas\nFails\n143. The desperate and last bid by the 28th\nJapanese Army to,escape across the Sittang\nbegan on July 21st, when some 15,000 to 18,000\nenemy troops, sick and demoralised, moved out\nof the jungle and scrub shelter of the Pegu\nomas.\n\n144, The moment for which the squadrons\nand Allied ground forces had been awaiting\nhad now come. The ground forces of 17\nIndian Infantry Division, ranged in groups\nalong the 100 miles stretch of roadway between\nToungoo and Pegu, which formed part of the\nrailway corridor, engaged the enemy, bursting\nover the road at several points simultaneously,\nand slaughtered them.\n\n145. The squadrons of 221 Group were\nswitched over to this battle area in support\nof 17 Division, and for almost nine days air\nassault was directed on the wretched Japanese\nas they made desperate attempts to reach the\nSittang River.\n\n146. From a captured enemy document it\nwas revealed that the main break-through from\nthe Pegu Yomas had been delayed by the\nenemy to allow the move of the Japanese\n28th Army to co-ordinate. The greater part\nof the Mayazaki Group (Lt.-Gen. G.O.C. 54\nDivision) had planned to attempt to cross the\nSittarig between Nyaungbentha and .\n(Coinciding with this move, Koba Group\n(Major-General Koba) had planned another\nmajor break out, and while the area of the\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\nmove was not determined, it was anticipated\nthat it would take place north of Toungoo in\n19 Division area where troops were deploying\nalong the Toungoo-Mawchi Road.\n\n147. The enemy’s plan was to form road\nblocks at selected points and to pass through\nthem assisted by “Jitter Squads” to create\ndiversions. All movements were to be made\nby night and the keynote of the break-through\nwas to be “speed” so that the maximum time\nwould be available for the collection of boats\nand rafts from the Sittang river in order to\ncomplete the crossing before daylight. The\nenemy had planned, on reaching the Sittang.\nto cross on a wide front using barges, rafts,\nlogs, bamboo poles and even petrol tins to\nassist the buoyancy of escapees in the water.\n\n148. It would be invidious to state that one\nsquadron, more than another, inflicted the\ngreatest punishment on the escaping enemy.\nAll squadrons thrown into the “ Battle of the\nBréik-through,” overcoming monsoon with\nlow clouds and heavy rain for long periods,\ndid what was expected of them with credit.\nThe keenness of squadron ground personnel\nwas equal to the occasion. They worked hard\nand ungrudgingly. All, indeed, in the air, as\nwell as on the ground, felt that something\nsubstantial was being accomplished in this last\nshow-down with the Japanese in Burma.\n\n149. The July killing lasted until the 29th.\nThe Thunderbolt squadrons, carrying three\n500 Ib. bombs on each aircraft, played havoc\namong concentrations of moving Japanese\ntroops. The Spitfires too, carrying one 500 Ib.\nbomb on each aircraft, pursued the enemy\nrelentlessly, strafing them as they ran for cover.\nAs many as 62 sorties were flown on July 23rd\nby Nos. 152 and 155 Squadrons.\n\n150. The extent of the full air effort by the\nR.A.F. squadrons in this battle cannot be\nadequately measured in the many squadron re-\nports which told of the effectiveness and killings\nmade during their strikes. The confusion and\ndisruption caused among the Japanese forces,\namounted to almost chaos. More convincing,\nperhaps, were the reports sent by 12th Army\nDivisional Commanders to H.Q. 221 Group,\nwho were not slow to express their gratitude\nfor the support given to their troops.\n\n151. After almost nine days of intense fight-\ning, the attempted break out by the Japanese\nfrom the Pegu Yomas ended in utter and com-\nplete failure. More than 10,000 men were\nkilled, as against only three hundred odd\ncasualties sustained by the Allied forces. Out\nof approximately 1,300 Japanese troops who\nsucceeded ‘in crossing the Sittang between\nMeikthalin and Wegyi, it was estimated that\n500 of their number had been killed during\nair strikes by Spitfires and Thunderbolts.\n\n152. The whole Japanese plan for organised\nescape petered out in the closing days of July,\nand the air and ground attacks were then\ntransferred once more to the Sittang Bend,\nwhere the other Japanese forces, to their credit,\nhad held out bravely in their struggle to keep\nopen the last doorway leading out of Burma.\nIn the July battle, R.A.F. squadrons had flown\na total of 3,045 sorties—92 per cent. of which\nwere offensive strikes in support of ground\ntroops, while a total weight of 1,490,000 lb. of\nbombs had been dropped.\n",

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\n153. As the last few hundreds of exhausted\nJapanese were making their escape to Moul-\nmein with bitter recollections of the ordeal they\nhad passed through, Lieutenant-General Sir\nMontague Stopford, G.O.C. 12th Army, when\nrecalling the severity of the weather, its flood-\ning, rains and cloud, showed his appreciation\nof the R.A.F. in these words :—\n\n“Grateful if you would accept and pass\non to all ranks under your command my\nmost grateful thanks for the admirable sup-\nport given during break-out battle and my\ncongratulations on splendid results achieved.\nFlying conditions must have been most diffi-\ncult but on all sides I hear nothing but\npraise of the keenness and determination of\npilots to get through. You have all played\na great part in the Twelfth Army’s first big\noperation.” ef\n154. Over and above the R.A. contribu-\n\ntion, our victory was won by our superiority\nover the Japanese in training, fighting ability\nand weapons; the accurate intelligence which\nwas obtained before the battle began ; the fine\nwork of the guerillas, and above all the high\nmorale and fighting efficiency of the troops.\n\nSTRATEGIC AIR OPERATIONS.\n\nA Well Sustained Offensive against Enemy\nSupply and Communications.\n\n155. With the capture of Rangoon and the\ndisbandment of the integrated Anglo-American\nStrategic Air Force on June Ist, the R.A.\nheavy bombers of 231 Group were left to carry\nout the next phase of the battle against the\nenemy’s communications leading to Singapore,\nand on other important targets.\n\n156. The partnership which had been forged\nbetween heavy bomber units of No. 231 Group,\nR.AF., and the 7th Bombardment Group,\nUS.A.AF. had, over a period, produced a\nstriking force so effective that it brought about\na serious disruption to Japanese strategic com-\nmunications in this Theatre, with a critical\ndecline in the quantity of supplies intended for\ntheir ground forces in Burma. .\n\n157. The departure of the 7th Bombardment\nGroup had one important significance. The\nGroup had operated twelve aircraft fitted with\n“ Azon ” equipment, consisting of a radio trans-\nmitter in the aircraft and a radio receiver on\nthe bomb which, once released, could be guided\nin such a way that fline errors could tbe\neliminated. Throughout the series of “ bridge-\nbusting ” missions on the Burma-Siam railway,\nwhich, on account of anti-aircraft defences\ncould not be attacked from low level by\nLiberators, the Azon equipment was used with\ngreat success.\n\n158. The destruction of bridges in Burma\nand Siam, notably on the Bangkok-Pegu rail-\nway, which was one of the principal tasks of\nthe Strategic Air Force, was a vital factor in\ncrippling the enemy’s land communications.\n\n159. In a six-month period between De-\ncember 1944 and May 1945, there was photo-\ngraphic confirmation of bridge destruction as\nshown hereunder :—\n\nDestroyed Damaged\nRail eee 96 36\nRoad ae a ae wae 13\n109 40\n\nTotal\n\n2139\n\n160. Feverish efforts made by the Japanese\nengineers, who worked with great energy re-\npairing and rebuilding bridges, failed to keep\nopen many of the vital communications upon\nwhich the Japanese in Souther Burma\ndepended.\n\nGreater Distances Flown to Target Areas.\n\n161. On the Allied occupation of Rangoon,\nR.AF. Liberators carried the heavy bomber\noffensive much further afield into the enemy-\noccupied territories of South East Asia, in-\nvolving frequent flights of over 1,000 miles\nradius from their Indian bases in Bengal. This\nwas inevitable, as the newly occupied airfields\nin Southem Burma, after the capture of Ran-\ngoon, were not yet big enough to take heavy\nbombers. The long distance flights undertaken\nby these aircraft across the Bay of Bengal in\ndifficult monsoon. weather were most\nhazardous. “\n\n162. From Moulmein, at the mouth of the\nSalween River, to Victoria Point, the southern-\nmost tip in Burma, is nearly 500 miles. This\ncoastal tip, known as the Tenasserim, together\nwith Japanese bases in the Andaman Islands,\ncame in for attention by the heavy bombers\nafter our entry into Rangoon. ‘ Nearly 1,000\ntons of bombs were dropped by the R.ALF.\nsquadrons during May, which reflected the\ndetermination of the crews to carry on their\nheavy bombing work in the disruption of the\nenemy’s communication system. Indeed, what\nwas to have been a V.E.-Day celebration in\nMay, was spent by crews of the squadrons\nstanding by for an attack on shipping in the\nAndamans. This cultimated in a bombing raid\non May 17th against the most westerly Japanese\nbase in the Bay of Bengal—Port Blair. The\nbombing force on this occasion concentrated\non important harbour installations, including\nmarine workshops at Phoenix Bay, while\nbuildings at Hope Town, the main coaling\npoint, were destroyed. A large orange red\nexplosion, with flames rising up to 1,500 feet,\nwas seen by the crews after they had hit their\ntarget. The enemy had fortified the whole area\nof Port Blair with shore batteries and A.A.\nguns, which succeeded in shooting down one\nof our aircraft.\n\n163. But the main battle against the enemy’s\ncommunications—notably those affecting Singa-\npore—was now on. The same air strategy\nwhich had disrupted the Japanese supply line\nbetween Bangkok and Rangoon was applied in\nthe succeeding months with equal effectiveness ©\nto the line linking Bangkok with Singapore.\n\n164. Communications on this mountainous\npeninsula, embracing territory of three States—\nBurma, Siam and Malaya—had, for the most\npart, been seaborne, though, as the Japanese\nadvance in 1941 showed, Singapore still had\na backdoor by means of the rail route to the\nnorth.\n\n165. With the sea lanes in the Strait of\nMalacca made more and more hazardous for\nJapanese shipping through the effectiveness of\nour mine-laying from the air and the vigilance\nshown by R.N. submarines, the enemy was\nforced to fall back steadily on the use of the\nBangkok-Singapore railway for the movement\nof supplies. This line snaked for a thousand\nmiles up the narrow neck of land between the\nGulf of Siam and the Andaman Sea.\n",

With\npersistence, however, they succeeded in getting\nas far south from their bases in India as the\nBay of Bandon at the Isthmus of Kra, to\ninflict heavy damage on the important railway\njunction of Jumbhorn at the narrowest part\nof the Isthmus.\n\nEnemy's concern over Systematic Damage\n\n167. I must express most sincere admiration\nfor the aircrews who flew these Liberators such\nabnormally long distances, frequently through\natrocious monsoon weather, to bomb their\ntargets in Siam and Malaya.\n\n168. Crews of Bomber Command in Europe\n\nflew 1,200 mile round trips to Berlin when\nattacking targets in the capital of the Reich, but\nthe R.A.F. Liberators in South East Asia flew\nfrom their bases in India round trips well over\n2,000 miles to bomb objectives at Bangkok,\nand other targets on the Isthmus of Kra. This\nis equal to a flight from London to Naples or\nwell to the east of Warsaw—flights, it should\nbe noted, which the R.A.F Liberators in my\nCommand carried out regularly against the\nJapanese.\n. 169. The concern of the enemy over the\nsystematic damage to, and destruction of, their\nlines of communication in Siam and Malaya\nwas revealed in a document which came into\nour hands entitled “ Protection of Communica-\ntions”. This document called upon Japanese\nUnit Commanders to overhaul their A.A.\ndefence methods as “enemy aircraft are\ncarrying out continuous and unceasing attacks\non our rear communications and planning to\ncut our rear lines altogether. We must perfect\nour counter-measures.”\n\n170. The enemy’s increased vigilance, how-\never, appeared to make no material difference\nto the preservation of their rail bridges, dumps,\nwater towers, locomotives, rolling stock and\nshipping.\n\n171. On June 5th, seven Liberators attacked\ntailyards at Surasdhani on the Bangkok-\nSingapore line. Surasdhani was an important\nsupply post for the Japanese and, to reach it,\nour bomber crews flew for 17 hours, mostly\nacross the Bay of Bengal, and through some\nof the worst weather which the monsoon\nduring 1945 had produced. This flight of 2,400\nmiles was one of the longest undertaken, up\nto that time, on a heavy bombing imission in\n\n, this Theatre. The bombing was well concen-\ntrated, and the results were good. Subsequent\nreconnaissance confirmed all claims made by\nthe crews.\n\nLiberators sink 10,000-ton Japanese Tanker.\n\n172. A shipping strike in Siamese waters on\nJune 15th, when a 10,000-ton Japanese tanker\nwas set on fire and left sinking by the stern,\nwas one of the most noteworthy operations of\nits kind during the closing stages of the war\nagainst Japan in South East Asia.\n\n173. To effect this strike, aircraft had to\nmake a round trip of approximately 2,500\nmiles to the expected anchorage, the route\nbeing almost entirely over the Bay of Bengal\nand the Andaman Sea.\n\n174. The tanker was the largest enemy vessel\nreported in Siamese waters for many months,\nand was believed to be one of the last of its\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\nsize remaining to the Japanese in the Southern\nArea. It was sighted by a Sunderland aircraft\nof 222 Group when it was apparently trying to\nmake a northbound run through the Gulf of\nSiam and along the east coast of the Malay\nPeninsula. The tanker had an escort.\n\n175. The Air Forces at the disposal of 231\nGroup for this strike were four heavy bomber\nsquadrons—Nos. 99, 159, 355 and 356,\nequipped with Liberator Mark V aircraft. A\ndetachment of six aircraft from No. 159\nSquadron, based in India, moved down\ntemporarily to Akyab, on the Arakan, for the\noperation. This enabled the aircraft of the\ndetachment to load up during the night and\nto take off at 0900 hours on the day of the\nstrike. They were, therefore, the last squadron\nin to attack.\n\n176. Due to exceedingly bad weather\nencountered by ail aircraft on the route to the\ntarget, a number of the aircraft were forced to\nabandon the operation and returned to base.\nThe master bomber and deputy master bomber\nwere, unfortunately, included in this number.\nThe remaining aircraft, which pressed on, came\nupon their target in the early afternoon as ‘the\ntanker was moving past Samui Island.\nescort was some distance away.\n\n.177. Three aircraft of 99 Squadron attacked\nthe tanker at low level but did not succeed in\nsecuring hits. All three aircraft were damaged\nby A.A. fire from the escort vessel and the\ntanker itself. One aircraft had a fin shot off.\nAfter delivering its attack, it eventually reached\nMingaladon Airfield, Rangoon, where it\ncrash-landed. The second aircraft, also\ndamaged, by A.A. fire, crash-landed at\nAkyab.\n\n178. The battle against the tanker was con-\ntinued later with three aircraft of 356 Squadron\nattacking at low level, and a direct hit pro-\nduced fire and a series of explosions. The\ntanker still fought back fiercely, and all three\naircraft were damaged by A.A. fire, one of\nwhich crashed when landing at Salbani in Ben-\ngal. The fight continued with the arrival of\nthree further aircraft from 159 Squadron which\npressed home the attack, claiming four and\npossibly six hits. With smoke billowing to\n7,000 feet, the tanker was left burning from\nstem to stern and sinking. The tanker’s escort\nsucceeded in making its escape.\n\n179. Subsequent reconnaissance showed that\nthe tanker was sunk, the funnel and mast were\nseen showing above the sea.\n\n1180. Loss of so vital a supply vessel as an\noil tanker of 10,000 tons, particularly at a time\nwhen supply meant everything to the enemy\nin South East Asia, added further to the em-\nbarrassment of the Japanese.\n\n181. For this outstanding success I sent a\nmessage of congratulation to Major-General\nJ. T. Durrant, S.A.A-F., who, on June 15th,\nhad assumed Command of 231 Group, vice\nAir Commodore F. J. W. Mellersh, C.B.E.,\nA.F.C., repatriated to the United Kingdom.\n\n182. The attack on the Japanese tanker\nended a month of most successful shipping\nstrikes by the air forces of 231 Group during\nJune, for, on June Ist, Liberators had surprised\nenemy vessels at Satahib in the Gulf of Siam,\nwhen a 335-foot submarine depot ship—\n“ Angthong ”—~was sunk.\n",

The stranglehold on the Japanese sup-\nply and communications system was further\ntightened on June 24th, when Liberators des-\ntroyed two important bridges at Kanchanaburi,\neighty miles west of Bangkok. The raid on\nthese bridges across the Meklong River at\nKanchanaburi was a disruption of serious con-\nsequence on the Burma—Siam railway. The\nultimate result of this attack was that three\nspans were demolished and one span displaced.\n\n184. Strategic bombing by the air forces of\nthis Command drastically cut down the use of\nthe enemy’s railroads, compelling the transfer\n-of more and more supplies to road and sea\ntransport, which inevitably slowed up the\nenemy’s war supply machine.\n\n185. When the ACS.E.A. Command\nformed in December, 1943, our heavy bomber\neffort was only 449 tons dropped by Libera-\ntor aircraft. In 1944 the figure had risen to\n3,846 tons, and by August, 1945, it had again\ntisen to a total of 9,441 tons.\n\n186. Behind these tonnages is evidence of\nthe contribution by the heavy bomber aircraft\nof this Command to the overall strategy of the\nSupreme Allied Commander, South East\nAsia, in bringing about the disruption of\n\nJapanese supply and road, rail and sea com-\n\nmunications.\n\nAIR SUPPLY\n\nA Testing Period for Squadrons\nDuring Monsoon\n\n187. Although the capture of Rangoon\nbrought an end to the more intensive Army-\nAir co-operation in Burma, the day by day\nair supply for ground troops concentrated in\nSouthern Burma, and still engaging large\nisolated forces of the enemy, was still main-\ntained.\n\n188. There was no alternative. Air supply, it\nwas realised, would have to meet the Army’s\ndemands until seaborne supplies began to func-\ntion, and road and rail communication inland\nfrom Rangoon were re-established.\n\n189. Much was being done to hurry forward\ntehabilitation in Rangoon generally and to get\nport facilities working, but this was no easy\ntask. Looting of property and bomb damage\nto those essential services which are the main-\nspring of a busy commercial port were exten-\nsive. Entry of larger ships into the harbour\nwas also delayed until dredging of the river\nchannel was completed, while there was the\nadditional task of repairing docks, wharves, and\nbadly disrupted road and rail communications.\nAll these were vital factors which indirectly\naffected supply to a vast Allied ground force\nwhich had pushed its way into Rangoon.\n\n\\190. The period May to August, 1945—\ncovering the re-entry of the Allied forces into\nRangoon, and later the surrender of Japan—\ncannot be termed spectacular in air supply\noperations, when reckoned against such efforts\nas persisted during the Allied advance down\nthrough Burma earlier in the year, and the\nsupply tonnage record was broken in April,\n1945, with 2,900 tons on one day. But it\nwas, nevertheless, an exacting period for squad-\nrons and personnel alike, for the following\nreasons :—\n\n(a) The period of the monsoon had set\nin, making flying exceedingly hazardous in\n\n60 mountainous a country as Burma. ‘\n\n2141\n\n(5) With the disintegration of the British\nand American Air Forces after Ist June,\n1945, American Transports were withdrawn,\nleaving R.A.F. squadrons of No. 232 Group\nto continue air supply operations unaided.\n\n(c) Supply demands made by H.Q. Allied\nLand Forces were not immediately reduced\nafter entry into Rangoon. On the contrary,\nthe Army persisted in a continuance of air\nsupply on a scale which it was not always\npracticable to meet in face of atrocious\nweather and fewer available aircraft.\n\n191. The departure of the American trans-\nport squadrons towards the end of May, 1945,\nresulted in a corresponding reduction in air\nsupply to the ground forces. With hostilities\nin Burma virtually over, this was only to be\nexpected. What air supply did not anticipate\nwas the enormous concentration of Allied\nground forces which had pushed into Ran-\ngoon at the last minute to ensure its speedy\ncapture. These troops had still to be fed and\nsupplied, as had the Allied ground forces en-\ngaging the remnants of the Japanese main\nArmy trapped in the Pegu Yomas of Southern\nBurma as the result of the rapid Allied drive\nto Rangoon.\n\n192. Throughout the campaign in Burma it\nhad been the practice to pool the air resources\nfor the mutual benefit of the British and\nAmerican elements of Eastern Air Command.\nThe result had been a building up of a\nbalanced organisation known as Combat Cargo\nTask Force, capable of operating at an ‘in-\ntensive rate of air supply.\n\n193. The operational achievement of Combat\nCargo Task Force, covering the period October,\n1944 (the date of its inception) to the end of\nMay, 1945, when disintegration took place, is\nbest indicated by the following figures:—\n\nTotal hours flown ... 386,283\nSupplies carried (short tons) 332,136\nNumber of persons carried 339,137\nNumber of casualties carried 94,243\nTotal tonnage carried, in-\n\ncluding weight of persons\n\nand casualties 379,707\n\nForecast for Air Lift after Rangoon.\n\n194. From the examination of results\nachieved during the advance through Burma,\nand the lessons learned, it was possible, in\nthe middle of May, to agree that each transport\nsquadron’s effort as from Ist June, 1945 to\n31st July, could be 125 hours per aircraft\nfor the month. This demanded an effort of\n156 hours per aircraft on the squadron strength.\n\n195. A better flow of reinforcement aircraft\nwas expected, which would thus greatly help\ntowards making the new transport effort pos-\nsible, also a stepping-up and increase in effi-\nciency of maintenance organisation, with con-\nsequent increased monthly output and quicker\nturn-round of aircraft undergoing repair, was\ntaking place.\n\n196. On the assumption that two R.AF.\nsquadrons were made available for airborne\ntraining by 1st June, that internal airlines re-\nquirements were met, and that USAAF.\ntransport squadrons were all out of the Theatre\nfrom 10th June, it was calculated that the\n",

This capacity measured against the\n_Army’s requirements of 14th May, 1945,\nshowed the following situation in tons :—\nALFSEA Capacity to\n\nPeriod requirement Deliver\ntons tons\nI~ 8 June 1,310 1,474\n9-10 ,, 1,070 1,474\nH—-i8 4, ... 1,070 880\n19 June—8 July. 840 880\n931 July 600 880\n\n199. On calculation, therefore, a total sur-\nplus capacity of 2,120 tons existed from 1-10\nJune, and a deficiency of 1,520 tons from 11-18\nJune, giving a surplus airlift. The surplus air-\nlift from 1-10 June, it was calculated, could\nbe stock-piled to offset the deficiency from\n11-18 June. From these calculations, there-\nfore, it was considered that the transfer of the\nUS.A.AF, squadrons could be accepted with-\nout detriment to any foreseen operations. Un-\nfortunately, a variety of factors militated\nagainst this target which had been so carefully\nplanned.\n\nSome Difficulties with the Army over Supply.\n\n200. On ith June, Advanced HQ.\nALFSE.A. signalled direct to the Supreme\nAllied Commander that the short fall in air\ntransport for the first nine days in June totalled\n955 long tons, and asked, therefore, for the\nretention of No. 238 Squadron already overdue\nto go to the Pacific,\n\n201. I proceeded to Rangoon to discuss this\nmatter more fully with Lieutenant General Sir\nOliver Leese, C.-inC, ALFS.E.A. and\nMajor-General Bastyan (Major-General Ad-\nministration), A.L.F.S.E.A.\n\n202. The Army had come fully briefed, and\nit was obvious that any detailed discussion\nin Rangoon without a full knowledge of all\nfactors would place the Air Force at a dis-\nadvantage. Accordingly, I signalled Air Com-\nmand to take all possible measures to lessen\nthe short fall and, for this purpose, to allocate\n22 additional Dakotas at once. Upon my re-\nturn to Command, at Kandy, I held a full\ndiscussion on the problem.\n\n203. The varied aspects of the problem are\nworth detailing since they illustrate the many\nlinks upon which air transport depended at\nthe time, and also the strong disinclination of\nthe Army to accept responsibility for break-\ndowns in air supply. Factors which had upset\nthe air supply target planned in the middle of\nMay included the following :—\n\n(a) The reinforcement flow had not been\nsufficient to equip the squadron up to a\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\nUnit Equipment of 24 plus 6 as planned and,\nin consequence, aircraft strength was 12 per\ncent. deficient.\n\n(6) Ramree airfield, which had been built\nby the Army for the express purpose of\nmonsoon air supply operations, was often\nso waterlogged that aircraft could not get\n\noff.\n\n(c} There had been an epidemic of main\nbearing failures in Dakota aircraft engines\nwhich had caused an appreciable drop in\nserviceability ; one squadron needed 26 new\nengines.\n\n(d) Although we hada margin of surplus\nlift available in May, the Army could not\ntake advantage of it in June, owing to\nshortage of transport.\n\n{e) Army demands remained high because\nthey could not withdraw sufficient troops\nthrough Rangoon due to shipping and com-\nmunication difficulties.\n\n204. It was decided to take the following\nsteps :—\n\n(i) Inform B.AF.S.E.A. that the allot-\nment of 24 aircraft to each squadron was\nof the greatest urgency.\n\n(ii) Press the Army for better drainage of\nRamree airfield.\n\n(iii) Transfer as soon as possible one or\ntwo transport squadrons from Ramree to\nAkyab.\n\n{iv) Give the squadrons a target of 100\nshort tons per day. This was desirable, for\nit provided a goal that could be reached,\nand’ prevented the frustration that had so\noften been felt in the past at being given a\ntarget impossible of achievement. Any\nmargin above the stated figure would be in\nthe nature of a bonus and have a stimulating\nmoral . effect.\n\n(v) Withdraw one of the two squadrons\nengaged from airborne training and employ\nit on transport. This would give a total\nof 810 long tons a day against the Army\nrequirements of 880. The difference was so\nsmall that it could surely be made up by\ninland water transport or other means and\nwould certainly entail no drastic cut in\nrations or amenities.\n\n205. Even then, air transport problems were\nnot solved. There were still in Burma tactical\nsquadrons whose speedy withdrawal for refit\nand training in preparation for “‘ Zipper/Mail-\nfist’? Operation could not be effected through\nthe overloaded land and sea lines of communi-\ncation. The only method of withdrawing\nthese units in sufficient time was to fly them\nout. I decided, therefore, that such a task\nheld priority over the airborne training 96\nSquadron was accomplishing at that time, and\naccordingly I received the Supreme Allied\nCommander’s agreement to 96 Squadron’s\ntemporary withdrawal to enable air lift to be\nprovided for R.A.F. personnel and equipment\nof the units already mentioned.\n\nTransport Preparations for “ Zipper|Mail-\n\n206. An important step was taken in July\nwhen I directed that Air Force representation\nshould be made available for Army planning\nbodies in order to prevent the Army supply\nauthorities from budgeting for airlift which\n",

By means of closer\nliaison it was hoped that the Army would\nmake bids for air transport which would be\npracticable, so that there would be no need\nfor the Air Forces to overwork their squadrons\nin order to make good the backlog. In addi-\ntion, it was possible, in planning, to leave some\nairlift for domestic requirements such as the\ncarriage of A.O.G. spares, etc.\n\n207. For the coming months air transport\ncommitments could be divided into the\nfollowing categories :—\n\n(i) The requirements of “ Zipper/Mail-\nfist” Operation.\n(ii) The supply of 12th Army fighting in\n\nBurma\n\n(iii) The maintenance and expansion of\ninternal airlines.\n\n(iv) The continuance at a higher rate than\nhitherto of airborne training.\n\n208. In order to meet requirement (i) it had\nbeen anticipated that there would be a sharp\ndiminution in the supply of 12th Army in\nBurma as the port of Rangoon became cleared.\nIt became apparent in the first week of July,\nhowever, that the requirements of the Army\nin Burma were going to be very considerably\nin excess of the figures that had been esti-\nmated at the time when aircraft had been\nallocated for “ Zipper/Mailfist.”\n\n209. A complete review of air transport\nplans was thus once again necessary. The\nArmy suggestions for meeting the new situa-\ntion were given in a signal from HQ.,\nA.LF.S.E.A., which, however, could not be\nagreed. The Army was accordingly asked to\nawait recommendations which would be avail-\nable with all data at the next meeting of the\nSupreme Allied Commander, when the whole\nquestion of air transport requirements would\nbe reviewed and priorities adjusted.\n\nHazards of Weather in Monsoon.\n\n210. Weather was the one dominant factor\nwhich affected air supply operations through-\nout Burma after the breaking of the monsoon.\nIt is no exaggeration to state that the transport\naircraft, probably more than any other air-\ncraft employed in the Burma Theatre, had to\nwage a day to day battle against the elements.\n\n211. During the crucial months, while the\nAllied advance down through Central Burma\nwas in progress, transport aircraft had been\nable to fly long hours, often in good weather,\nwhich greatly contributed to the successful\ncompletion of their commitment.\n\n212. The proposition, however, was different\nin May, after the arrival of the monsoon. Not\nonly did weather make flying hazardous and\ndifficult, but it was frequently impossible for\nmeteorological staffs to determine in advance\nwhat weather the transport aircraft were likely\nto encounter en route to their destination.\n\n213. The monsoon in Burma is at its worst\nduring June and July, when cumulo nimbus\ncloud, the greatest enemy of aircraft flying\nover Burma, builds up frequently from low\nlevel to above aircraft ceiling. :\n\n214. Comparing aircraft effectiveness in the\nmonsoon months of June and July with that\nof February and March, 1945, it appeared\nthat the effectiveness dropped to 70 per cent.\n\n(68742)\n\n2143\n\nAs the average length of trip was less during\nJune and July, however, the cargo tonnage\ncarried per aircraft dropped only to 76.5 per\ncent. of the fine weather standard.\n\n215. An indication of the monsoon’s toll on\naircraft and crews may be seen from the study\nof figures of losses for the month of June,\n1945. During this period No. 232 Group lost\n12 aircraft due to bad weather; casualties to\ncrews and passengers inclusive of those killed,\ninjured and missing totalling 72. This was a\nhigh price paid in men and material for the\ncontinued success of air supply in Burma,\n\n216. It is on record that one Dakota aircraft\nflying over Burma actually found itself turned\nupside down in a storm, and it was only the\nskill and presence of mind of the pilot which\naverted disaster.\n\n217. Yet another example of the hazards\nwhich faced transport supply crews in Burma\nduring that monsoon was the experience of\na pilot who found himself completely closed\nin with cumulo nimbus cloud during a return\njourney from Meiktila to Akyab. After three\nattempts, a break in the cloud was found which\nbrought the aircraft out on to the coast opposite\nRamree Island. The aircraft descended to 300\nfeet but cumulo nimbus again closed in behind,\nand the pilot, after making several unsuccessful\nattempts to climb out of the cloud, was even-\ntually forced down to sea level. For almost\nan hour the aircraft circled around until the\npilot finally succeeded in climbing to 7,000 feet\nwhere more cumulo nimbus was encountered\nand the radio compass was rendered unser-\nviceable. The aircraft then turned on a re-\nciprocal course and found a small gap in the\ncloud which again closed in. In the face of\nthis predicament, the pilot decided there was no\nalternative but to descend and to risk a blind\nforced landing. The pilot succeeded in bring-\ning the aircraft to a standstill in a paddy field\nwithout injury to any of the crew.\n\nStocking Rear Airfields with Supplies.\n\n218. Most of the supplies carried by the\nR.AF. Transport Squadrons in Burma after\nthe departure of the American units wete for\nthe purpose of stocking rear airfields, where the\nArmy organisations distributed the supply to\nvarious Army and R.A-F. units. Civil commit-\nments also continued to be fulfilled in Northern\n\nurma,\n\n219. ‘With the experience gained in June re-\ngarding the consumption of petrol required by\nC-47 aircraft for each trip during average mon-\nsoon flying conditions, squadrons located at\nRamree, Akyab, and Chittagong were\ninstructed to increase their load from 5,500 Ib.\nto 6,000 Ib.\n\n220. In preparation for ‘the final showdown\nwith the trapped Japanese forces in Burma,\nduring July, special instructions for supply\ndropping in the Toungoo area were issued.\nWeather, however, was again the big handicap,\nand as dropping operations were frequently\nimpossible in this area, arrangements had to be\nmade to land loads in Central Burma so as\nto form a stock-pile near the source of ground\noperations and later take advantage of periods *\nof fine weather in which to deliver the back-\nlog. This system made it unnecessary for air-\ncraft to carry undropped supplies back to base,\nwith a consequent increase in the number of\n\nB\n",

In the event\nof abortive trips producing a back log at\nToungoo, aircrews were briefed to proceed to\nthat area on supply dropping operations, after\nwhich the aircraft landed at Toungoo or Magwe\nand carried out second and possibly third trips\nbefore returning to base.\n\n221. During the flare up in ground opera-\ntions in the third week in July, when ithe\nbreak-through from the Pegu Yomas by the\ntrapped Japanese forces began, air supply to\nthe Allied ground forces engaging the Japanese\nassumed considerable importance until the\nbattle had ended. Rainfall was widespread\nover the whole area of operations, and diffi-\nculties under which aircraft had to operate\nwere acute. With exceedingly bitter fighting\ntaking place, and thousands of Japanese troops\npressing forward in their anxiety to escape, the\nstate of the ground situation was ever fluid,\nand made the accurate dropping of supplies no\neasy task. Many of the dropping zones used,\nindeed, were less than 100 yards from local\nenemy forces and there were occasions when\na dropping zone was surrounded by Japanese\ntroops and some of the containers overshot the\nmark and fell into enemy hands. It speaks well\nfor the aircrews trained in dropping supplies\nthat more containers did not fall into the hands\nof the Japanese, whose desperate plight during\nthe previous two months was due to lack of\nair supply and to the fact that the enemy were\ncut off from their Headquarters and bases in\nSouthern Burma and Siam by our land forces.\nEven in this last and major battle with the\nJapanese in Burma it was significant that air\nsupply—of which the enemy had none-—was\none of the cardinal factors in assuring triumph\nfor the Allied ground forces and disaster for\nthe enemy. Air supply in Burma made\nhistory which outdistanced in merit and\nachievement the more publicised air supply\noperations of the war in Europe such as that\nof Ambhem, or the food dropping to the Dutch\nin Holland. These, without doubt, were im-\nportant and commendable efforts in themselves,\nbut they bore no comparison to the enormous\nand sustained efforts of transport aircrews\nwho faced the hazards of monsoon weather.\n\nEnd of the War Affects Air Supply Operations.\n\n222. With the Japanese surrender in South\nEast Asia in August, air supply operations to\nthe Allied ground forces in Burma took on a\nnew aspect in keeping with the new situation.\n\n. 223, This did not mean that the commitment\nof the air supply squadrons would cease, or\nindeed, that fighting in Burma was entirely\nover. On the contrary, it was expected that in\ncertain respects air supply commitments would\nincrease. There could be no doubt, however,\nthat the nature and the location of loads which\nwould be carried, would greatly change.\nEvacuation of prisoners-of-war and internees,\nthe “ fly-in ” of Allied ground forces to occupy\nlarge and vast territories held by the Japanese,\nwere all commitments which faced the trans-\nport squadrons in South East Asia on the cessa-\ntion of hostilities. Materiel of war, on the other\nhand—so important a cargo throughout the\ncampaign in Burma—ceased to have a first\npriority. Movement of personnel, carriage of\nrations and civilian supplies replaced the trans-\nport of military supplies.\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\n224. Operations of the transport squadrons\nduring August fell into two distinct categories.\nThe first half of the month, when Japan was\nstill at war, supply operations continued much\nthe same as on previous months. After 15th\nAugust, when surrender was announced, the\nsituation became somewhat confused.\n\n225. The supply tasks by aircraft during the\nfirst half of August were confined principally to\nthe carrying of ammunition and petrol for the\ntwo most active areas of fighting in Burma—\nthe Mawchi Road and the lower Sittang—\nwhere the remnants of the Japanese forces who\nhad survived the July “Killing” were still\nholding out. There were, of course, other\nnumerous and important supply tasks, the\nbiggest of which was the stocking of airfields\nin Southern and Central Burma in preparation\nfor the sustained effort which would be required\nonce the assault on Malaya, under operation\n“ Zipper ”, began.\n\n226. One squadron during the first half of\nAugust had the sole task of taking food supplies\nto the civilian population of Northern Burma.\nThis was an important commitment owing to\nthe lack of other means of transport.\n\nOperations to relieve Allied Prisoners of War.\n\n227. With the Japanese surrender in the\nsecond half of August, there came orders for\nthe move of six R.A.F. Transport squadrons\nto the Rangoon area to transport stores, and\nto evacuate Ps.O.W. from Siam, French Indo-\nChina, Malaya and the Netherlands East\nIndies. As the result of these squadron moves,\nand the military situation at the time, the\n\n, number of normal transport operations fell\n\naway very considerably. The majority of the\ntrips, indeed, were concerned with moves by\nsquadrons and the stocking up of the Rangoon\nairfields with provisions for the liberated\nterritories and the P.O.W. Camps.\n\n* 228. August 28th—the historic date on which\nOperation “ Mastiff” was launched to bring\nrelief to the thousands of Allied Ps.O.W. in\nthe prison camps throughout the vast terri-\ntories of South East Asia—saw the transport\nsquadrons, as well as other aircraft of the\nCommand, including those of the RAAF.\ntake part in what was described as “ one of\nthe greatest mercy missions of the war.”\n\n229. Many of the flights undertaken in these\noperations were equivalent to a Transatlantic:\nflight, and yet 75 per cent. of the crews\nsucceeded in reaching their targets and\ndropping their messages as well as parachuting.\nmedical supplies, Red Cross parcels and teams\nof medical and signalling personnel provided\nmainly by airborne formations. Later, many\nthousands of Ps.O.W. and internees were\nevacuated from these territories by air.\n\n230. It is not difficult to visualise the plight.\nin which our Allied Ps.O.W. would certainly\nhave found themselves after the official\nJapanese surrender, had not all resources,\nincluding Air Power, been used, and organised\nquickly, to bring relief, comfort and sustenance\nto these unfortunate men, many of them too\nweak to stand on their own legs. Only Air\nPower could have penetrated these vast terri-\ntories throughout South East Asia with the\nspeed required to initiate that essential relief.\nThe pin-pointing of many Japanese P.O.W.\ncamps, in addition to the great distances flown.\n",

The period, May to August, 1945—\ncovering the re-entry of the Allied Forces into\nRangoon and later the surrender of Japan—\ncannot be termed spectacular in air supply\nOperations when reckoned against such efforts\nduring the Allied advance down through\nBurma earlier in the year, when the mobility\nof Fourteenth Army was almost entirely pro-\nvided by the Allied Air Forces whose record\n\nTactical Trips ...\n\nPersonnel Carried .\nCasualties Evacuated‘...\nSupplies Delivered (Short Tons)\nEstimated Total (Short Tons)\n\nCasuatTy EvAcuaTION\n\nA Prominent Lesson which Emerged from the\nCampaign in Burma.\n\n233. The great saving of lives and raising of\nmorale due to air casualty evacuation was one\nof the main lessons which emerged from the\nCampaign in Burma.\n\n234. This service was easily one of the best\nmorale builders among Allied front-line troops.\nIt inspired the fighting man’s confidence and\nallayed any fears he may have had about being\nwounded, with the possibility of falling into\nthe hands of the Japanese as a prisoner.\n\n235. Air casualty evacuation, once it became\nknown as the recognised .method for dealing\nwith serious cases by fiying them out of the\nforward areas in Burma, was a triumph both\nfor the Allied medical staffs and the aircrews\nalike. The Japanese had no air organisation\nfor similar evacuation of their troops, and the\nlow condition in which many enemy prisoners\nwere found as a result of acute sickness in the\njungle areas was, in itself, a contributory factor\nto their defeat.\n\n236. The general policy was for supply air-\ncraft to deliver supplies and take back from\nforward airfields on their return trips loads of\ncasualties to the base hospitals, and the special\ncentres established at Comilla, but when\nadverse landing conditions compelled supply\nby dropping, there were temporary difficulties\nin clearing casualties from Corps and Army\nmedical centres. Austers and L.5 aircraft\n(Sentinels) were used in the Theatre with con-\nspicuous success in the forward areas.\n\n237. For the purpose of handling casualties\nfrom forward medical units and forward trans-\nport landing grounds, R.A.F. Casualty Air\nEvacuation Units were set up. These units\nwere situated on the transport air strip covering\na particular area. ° Emplaning of the casualties\non to the aircraft was effected according to their\ndegree of urgency for base hospital medical\ntreatment. The average strength of a Casualty\nAir Evacuation Unit was 40 British other\ntanks, with a varied number of Indian per-\nsonnel. Approximately 100 wounded could be\nstaged at these C.A.E.U.s. for as long as was\nnecessary. As many seriously wounded and\nsick personnel required medical attention\nwhilst travelling in aircraft to base, an air\n\n(68742)\n\n2145\n\nsupply tonnage averaged 2,900 tons per day in\nil, 1945.\n\n232. The period, May to August, was not\nonly the monsoon period but the period, with\nthe exception of the July battle in Burma,\nduring which the Allied Forces on ground, sea\nand in the air were building up their organisa-\ntion and strength to deliver the next blow\nwhich would have fallen upon the Japanese in\nMalaya in early September. Nevertheless, the\nR.AF. Transport supply squadrons met the\ndemands required of them, and the supply\neffort for that period may be summarised as\nfollows : —\n\nJune\n\nMay July August Total\n7,998 7,211 8,258 3,779 =. 27,246\n7,795 2,321 3,017 4,651 17,784\n3,899 2,515 2,044 1,514 9,972\n23,172 19,978 22,170 9,418 74,738\n23,951 20,210 22,472 9,883 76,516\n\nambulance orderly pool was established at base.\nThis was composed of specially trained nursing\norderlies who flew in all aircraft. It is note-\nworthy to record that these nursing orderlies\nflew as much as 200 hours a month. They\ncarried with them complete first-aid equip-\nment, including oxygen-giving apparatus. In\nthe Burma Theatre, due to the mountainous\nnature of the country, portable oxygen equip-\nment proved to be essential in air casualty\nevacuation work, and its employment actually\nsaved many lives.\n\n238. The Casualty Air Evacuation Units in\nthe forward areas were also responsible for the\noff-loading, treatment and conveyance of\ncasualties received direct from the battle line\nin light aircraft such as the L.5. These aircraft\nproved invaluable in evacuating casualties\nfrom jungle clearances and small strips in the\nforward areas.\n\n239. Air evacuation of casualties began in\nBurma in the opening months of 1944, when\nthe Allied ground forces found themselves:\nencircled in the Arakan, and later during the\nperiod of the Siege of Imphal. By September\nof that year, some 48,789 casualties had been\nevacuated by air, and as the months passed,\nand the campaign developed in intensity, the\ncasualty evacuation figures steadily increased.\n\n240. By the end of April, 1945—three days\nbefore the fall of Rangoon—the total\ncasualties evacuated by British and American\naircraft in Burma was 110,761, of which\n50,285 were evacuated by R.A. aircraft.\n\n241. In the period May to August, 1945, the\nclosing stages of the war against the Japanese,\nR.AF. aircraft evacuated a total of 9,972\ncasualties.\n\n242. That air casualty evacuation proved\nitself a triumph both from the point of view\nof morale and the lives saved, is undisputed.\nPerhaps more convincing is the fact that,\nthroughout the campaign, only one death in\nthe air among ground personnel evacuated was\nrecorded, and only one aircraft, carrying 24\ncasualties, was lost due to weather.\n\n243. H.Q. AL.FS.E.A. stated that air\nevacuation reduced mortality of wounded by\n60 per cent. .\n\nBz\n",

Since American aircraft operated as\npart of the Allied Air Forces in the Theatre\nuntil integration in the Command ceased on\nist June, 1945, it is not inappropriate to men-\ntion something of the interesting experience of\nAmerican L.5. aircraft employed in Burma in\ncasualty evacuation and in other secondary im-\nportant tasks associated with supply to the\nground forces.\n\n245. A special research report on evacua-\ntion of casualties from the forward areas in\nBurma which was produced in July, 1945 by\nAir/12G (Research) Headquarters, Allied\nLand Forces, South East Asia, described the\nwork of two American squadrons operating\nL.5. aircraft with Fourteenth Army in the\ncampaign.\n\nThe purpose of the report was:—\n\n(@) To consider the best method of using\nL.5. aircraft for casualty evacuation in the\nlight of the American experience.\n\n(b) To estimate the number of aircraft re-\n\n* quired to -evacuate the casualties from a\n\nCorps in action with varying degrees of\n\nbattle activity.\n\n246. Throughout the period considered in\nthe report—November, 1944 to April, 1945—\nthe squadrons worked with 4 Corps and 33\nCorps from a rear strip close to the Casualty\nClearing Station. The squadrons of light air-\ncraft were allotted on the basis of one for each\nCorps of three Divisions. The C.C.S. was sited\nat the edge of. the strip. Forward strips were\nmade by the troops, and the location of the\nStrips was signalled to the squadrons. A re-\nconnaissance plane would fly over the site in\nthe early morning and photograph the strip.\nIf it was considered satisfactory for landing\nand take-off, the required number of aircraft\nflew out immediately.\n\n247. During the Meiktila-Rangoon ad-\nvance of 4 Corps, the number of strips con-\nstructed was greater than that during a\ncorresponding period at any other time, yet\nnone of the strips was refused by the squadrons.\nWhen the strips could be built more than 500\nyards long, it was possible to evacuate two\nSitting cases in one sortie, but there were few\nopportunities for this.\n\n248. All the squadron commanders under-\nstood their primary role to be casualty evacua-\ntion, But important secondary tasks were also\nperformed. Except in the case of the fly-in of\nimportant medical supplies, these secondary\ntasks were never allowed to interfere with the\nevacuation of casualties.\n\n249. The secondary tasks undertaken\nwere: —\n\n(a The emergency flying-in of medical\nsupplies, especially whole blood.\n\n(b) Flying-in reinforcements, mail, food,\nammunition and items of personal kit. These\ntrips were always part of an evacuation\nsortie,\n\nane Transporting V.I.P.s. within the Corps\n\n“@ Spotting for artillery.\n(e) Dropping and picking up messages.\n(f) Reconnaissance flights.\n250. The importance of the evacuation of\ncasualties relative to other duties was, indeed,\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THs LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\ninteresting. The total trips by one squadron\nover a given period of one month, when\nactivity was intense, was 12,017 of which 9,238\nwere casualty evacuation flights, or 77 per\ncent. of the total, as against 2,779 secondary\nmissions.\n\n251. In an analysis of the secondary tasks\nundertaken by these aircraft, the flying-in of\nreinforcements proved exceedingly valuable,\nsince these missions could be combined readily\nwith the collection of a casualty, while most\nof the other missions could not. In various\nten-day periods, for example, the total number\nof casualties evacuated was 7,705 as against\n3,345 reinforcements flown in. The per-\ncentage of evacuated casualties which were\nteplaced by reinforcements was therefore 43.\n\nEvacuating Casualties from a Corps in Action.\n\n252. For the peak period March, 1945, a\nsquadron of 32 American light aircraft\noperated under 33 Corps.\n\n253. During this period, all the cases re-\nquired to be evacuated were taken out by air.\nNo cases were evacuated by road or rail. The\naircraft were based at Shwebo during the first\nhalf of the month and flew as far as Ondaw,\n35 miles away. In the second half of the\nmonth, the aircraft were based at Ondaw and\nflew as far as Wundwin, 65 miles away. The\nnumbers of ground forces evacuated and the\npours flown in three ten-day periods were as\nfollows : —\n\nNumber Hours\nDate Evacuated Flown\n1—11 March , 1,604\n11—22 March 1,464 1,431\n21—31 March 1,362 1,688\nTotal ... 4,619 4,723\nMaximum distance between base and forward —\nstrip (miles) .. 65\nMinimum distance between base and forward\nstrip (miles)... 35\nAverage per cent. aircraft in commission daily 96-7\nAverage number of aircraft in commission daily 30-6\nAverage number of hours flown per plane per 5-2\nayo we ry ree .\nAverage number of hours flown per plane per\nAverage number of cases evacuated per plane 5\nAverage number of hours flown j per day 187\nAverage number of cases evacuated per day 154\n\nMaximum number of flying hours a Silo a aay 9\n\n254. The above achievement by _ this\nsquadron was a record for the American\nsquadrons in the Group. The effort was be-\nlieved to be near the maximum which any\nsquadron could reach in similar circumstances.\n\n255. During the period some of the pilots\nflew for nine hours a day for five consecutive\ndays, and made up seven sorties in one day\non several occasions. This intensification of\nactivity for short periods could not have been\nachieved without the very high level of main-\ntenance attained, nor could it have been ex-\nceeded without putting too great a strain on\nthe pilots or replacing some of the aircraft.\nThree of the pilots had to be replaced before .\nthe end of the operation owing to exhaustion,\nand 14 aircraft had to be replaced when the\nsquadron came out. The deterioration of the\nengines, however, cannot be ascribed simply\nto this operation, as the aircraft had had three\nmonths of operations before operating with\n",

The Squadron Commander, it was\nhavin 5 to note considered that the factor\nimiting the monthly carrying capacity of a\nsquadron was the ability of the lots. rather\nthan that of aircraft, to withstand the strain\nof intense activity. Few of the pilots in ques-\ntion could have remained efficient if the\nsquadron had attempted to carry on for longer\nthan six weeks at the same level of activity.\n\nMaximum Monthly Carrying Capaci\n\nSiren y Carrying Capacity of L.5\n\n256. While the average daily number of cases\nevacuated per aircraft was 5, some of the air-\ncraft actually exceeded this number, while\nsome failed to reach it. On the other hand,\nhad all aircraft been used to the same extent\nas those which flew more than the average for\nthe whole squadron, the average daily number\nevacuated would have been six, or 180 for the\nsquadron of 30 aircraft. This figure was\nagreed upon by the Squadron Commander,\nwho estimated that the maximum daily carry-\ning capacity of a single squadron of light air-\ncraft was 180 and the maximum monthly capa-\ncity 6,000. This, of course, was based on the\nmaximum distance of 65 miles between the\nTear and forward strips,\n\n257. The situation was somewhat altered in\nthe instance of 4 Corps’ advance down the\nMeiktila-Rangoon road in April, 1945, when\nan American light aircraft squadron was\nevacuating cases from Toungoo to Meiktila\nfor a short period. The distance involved\nwas 330 miles for a whole sortie, and the flight\nlasting approximately four and a half hours.\nThis meant that it was not possible to evacuate\nmore than two cases per plane per day for\nmore than a total of 60 casualties per day for\nthe whole squadron. It was interesting to\nnote in this connection, however, that 4 Corps’\nTate of advance in April was approximately\n14 miles per day. While the distances flown\nby light aircraft engaged on casualty evacua-\ntion were correspondingly great, the squadron\nwas nevertheless well able to handle all cases,\nbecause ground casualties were very light.\n\n258. Altogether the data derived as a result\nof the operational experience of these light air-\ncraft in Burma suggests that one squadron of\n32 LS aircraft is sufficient to evacuate all the\ncases: requiring evacuation from the forward\nareas of a Corps of three Divisions, provided\nthe average daily number of cases does not ex-\nceed 180 and the average distance flown is\nnot greater than 60 miles per trip (120 miles\nper round sortie). One other important pro-\nviso, of course, is that we have air superiority\nand that there is no prolonged heavy fighting\nwith an exceedingly high sickness rate.\n\nGENERAL RECONNAISSANCE.\n\nA Period of Great Versatility for G.R. Aircraft.\n\n259. When the period under review opened,\noffensive general reconnaissance had become\neffectively established as the primary opera-\ntional function of air-sea power in this Theatre.\nThe opening weeks of 1945 had incontestably\nindicated an entire absence of enemy U-boats\nthroughout the vast expanses of the Indian\nOcean, and pointed to the urgent need for\nalternative employment. Thus evolved the\nplan for an intensive anti-shipping campaign\n\n2147\n\nto disrupt the enemy’s sea transport in and\naround the waters of the Andaman Sea. Four\nmonths of vigorous anti-shipping strikes and\ncarefully planned air-sea mining operations\nrevealed that these tactics were greatly harass-\ning the enemy, and an intensification of offen-.\nsive general reconnaissance was rightly con-\nsidered a remunerative policy to pursue.\n\n260. Although the primary operational réle\nof 222 Group in May 1945 was that of sinking\nand immobilising the enemy’s shipping, it.\nmust be borne in mind that there were con-\ntinued and increasing commitments in the\nspheres of photographic reconnaissance,\nmeteorological flights and air-sea rescue. I\nhad, in fact, delegated the responsibility for the\norganisation and control of air-sea rescue\noperations and units to Air Marshal Com-\nmanding 222 Group as from Ist April, 1945,\nfor the whole of South East Asia Command.\nMoreover, there was always the possibility that\nthe enemy might recommence his U-boat war-\nfare with renewed vigour, and the G.R. forces\nunder my control had always to be prepared\nfor such a contingency.\n\nDeveloping the Anti-Shipping Campaign.\n\n261. With the re-occupation of Rangoon on\nMay 3rd, 1945, it became possible to estab-\nlish a new and invaluable base from which\nto develop the anti-shipping campaign in more\neasterly waters. Sunderland aircraft of 230\nSquadron (relieved in July by a detachment\nof 209 Squadron, similarly equipped) operat-\ning from the depot ship S.S. “ Manela” under\nthe operational control of 346 Wing were able\nto spread their tentacles over the areas of the\nTenasserim Coast, Kra Isthmus, Gulf of Siam\nand South China Seas, adding confusion and\nperplexity to the enemy with their constant\narmed reconnaissance and timely attacks\nwherever suitable targets presented themselves.\n\n262. As a counterpart to this newly estab-\nlished base of Rangoon in the north, the de-\nvelopment of Cocos Island in the south con-\nstituted an equally important strategic base\nfor similar operations off the west coast of\nSumatra, the south coast of Java and the\nSunda Straits. No. 321 Squadron, equipped\nwith Liberators (Mark VI, commenced\noperating a detachment of six aircraft from\nCocos Island on July 22nd, 1945.\n\n263. No. 354 Liberator Squadron, which\nhad initiated the offensive anti-shipping strike\naspect of the campaign in early February,\ndisbanded on 15th May, 1945. No. 203\nLiberator Squadron, however, which had com-\nmenced strike operations on 20th .March,\n1945, continued its programme of incessant and\nforceful attack over the Andaman Sea, Straits\nof Malacca, Gulf of Siam, Java Sea, Bangka\nStrait and off the west coast of Sumatra until\nthe cessation of hostilities. This squadron\nwas based at Kankesanturai (North Ceylon)\nbut frequently operated detachments from\nAkyab, Ramree and Cocos Island under\nadverse conditions.\n\n264. The paramount problem of the ship-\nping strike operations was the lack of forward\nbases. Liberator aircraft had been operating\nfrom bases far removed from this scene of\noperations, and the period of patrol in the\noperational area was inevitably curtailed, thus\n",

For example, there were no slipway\nor beaching facilities, so that it was impossible\nfor flying-boats to undertake operations likely\nto cause severe damage to their hulls. Neither\nthe Sunderland nor the Liberator aircraft is\nideal for low-level shipping attacks, but the\nnature of the operation and existing conditions\ndemanded long-range aircraft and these were\nthe only types available,\n\n265. It is interesting to note that Liberator\naircraft of Nos. 203 and 354 Squadrons carried\nout a series of long-range sea reconnaissance\npatrols during May 13th-19th which proved\ninvaluable in the location and eventual destruc-\nttion on May 16th of the Japanese heavy cruiser\n“*HAGURO” in the Straits of Malacca by\n“HM. Naval forces. (26th' Destroyer Flotilla—\n“Captain M. L. Power, C.BE. D.S.O., in\nTELMSS. “ SAUMAREZ ”.)\n\n266. Having regard to the many and varied\ncomplexities of conducting strike operations\nwithin this vast theatre of operations, such as\nthe unfortunate paucity of air bases, the\nirremediable problem of distance and the un-\nsuitability of aircraft, my G.R. Air Forces\nachieved results both impressive and commend-\nable. The enemy’s shipping sustained consider-\nable blows at a time when every ship in his\npossession was of vital importance. When the\nwar came to an abrupt conclusion, offensive\ngeneral reconnaissance was getting into its\nstride. Had hostilities continued, past experi-\nence permits an optimistic speculation in con-\nnection with the heavy toll general reconnais-\nsance would have taken of Japanese sea trans-\nport, particularly on the shipping routes\nbetween Batavia and Singapore.\n\nAir-Sea Mining as Part of the Campaign.\n\n267. Mine-laying operations were planned as\nan essential part of the anti-shipping campaign,\nto be executed concurrently with the more\ndirectly offensive anti-shipping strikes pro-\ngramme. Initially, it was planned to lay mines\nduring the hours of darkness in the shipping\nJanes of Northern Sumatra and Northern\nMalaya, and 160 Squadron (Liberators Mk.V.)\nunderwent an intensive period of training in\nlong range flying and the technique of mine-\nlaying to implement these plans. They com-\nmenced these operations on 21st January, 1945\nand continued until 24th May—a period of\n124 days during which 196 sorties were flown.\nAfter operational experience had been gained,\nthe mining commitments were increased to\ninclude drops in the areas of Sonchkla, Chum-\nborn, Port Swettenham and _ Singapore.\nMine-laying operations were discontinued after\n24th May, 1945, because the stage was then\nbeing finally set for Operation “ Zipper”, and\nto have continued mine-laying beyond that date\nmight have had serious repercussions when\nAllied landings took place on the west coast\nof Malaya.\n\n268. It is difficult, if not impossible, to assess\naccurately and fully, the damage and incon-\nvenience caused to the enemy by these par-\nticular operations. The strategy employed was\nto mine a number of different and well-\nseparated targets at frequent intervals so as\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\nto cause the enemy the greatest possible incon-\nvenience in constantly deploying his inadequate\nforce of mine sweeping craft over a large area.\nIt is reasonable to assume that many thousands\nof tons of enemy shipping were immobilised at\na time when they could ill be spared, and the\ntask of constant mine-sweeping must have been\nheart-breaking if not overwhelming. What-\never the material achievements of these opera-\ntions, it must be added that the programme\nwas extremely wwell-conceived and well\nexecuted.\n\nEmployment of General Reconnaissance Air-\ncraft on Special Duty Operations.\n\n269. The year of final and complete victory\nin South East Asia Command was a petiod\nof strenuous re-orientation for G.R. Air Forces.\nWith the Indian Ocean no longer a hunting-\nground for enemy U-boats, the days of vigilant\ndefensive warfare had passed, and it became\nessential to re-model the defensive Air Forces\ninto a strong and penetrating arm of offence\nwith which to sever the enemy’s sea communi-\ncations. (The broad strategy of general re-\nconnaissance in the Indian Ocean had always\nbeen concerned with the passive protection of\nshipping rather than the hunting of U-boats\n—a strategy rendered inevitable ‘by the enor-\nmous expanse of water to be reconnoitered and\nthe inadequate number of aircraft and few\nadvance bases at our disposal.)\n\n270. Unfortunately, it was impossible to\ndevote our entire G.R. resources to the execu-\ntion of this offensive plan, for there were more\nurgent operational demands to be satisfied, and\ngeneral reconnaissance aircraft could be\nquickly and satisfactorily diverted to the rescue.\nWhen mine-laying operations ceased, it was\nenvisaged that 160 Squadron, together with\nNos. 8 and 356 Squadrons, would reinforce\nthe shipping strike campaign, but the growing\nrequirements of the S.D. organisation absorbed\nthese squadrons to the detriment of offensive\ngeneral reconnaissance. The effort of G.R. air-\ncraft operating in the S.D. role does not pro-\nperly belong to this chapter, but rather to that\nof S.D. operations as a whole. Suffice it is\nto say here that these squadrons acquitted them-\nselves in a creditable fashion, and manifested\nonce again the comparative ease with which\nAir Power can be moulded into different forms\nor styles to meet the changing requirements.\n\n271. Towards the end of the war, No. 222\nGroup had become responsible for the opera-\ntional control of some six squadrons engaged\non §.D. operations, with the result that the\nfunctional and administrative experience gained\ntherefrom provided the Command with a com-\npetent and well-versed organisation for the\nvital and intricate operations immediately\nfollowing the end of the war. No. 222 Group\nalso played a large and important part in\nOperations “ Birdcage ” and “ Mastiff ”, for the\nrequirements of these operations were in many\nways similar to those of S.D.\n\n272. The achievements of general recon-\nnaissance aircraft engaged upon the relief and\nliberation of Allied prisoners-of-war, are\nrecorded in the appropriate chapter. It was a\nsatisfying conclusion to the history of general\nreconnaissance in the Indian Ocean—a history\nof dexterous and highly competent adaptation\nto the many and varied exigencies of an\nimmense and complicated theatre of war.\n",

Operations by S.D. aircraft of my Com-\nmand contributed very materially to the success\nof the highly organised guerilla forces of this\nTheatre which, themselves, were an integral\npart of the strategy of the Supreme Allied\nCommander, South East Asia.\n\n274. In the initial stages, S.D. operations\nwere primarily in support of our own forces\noperating in the enemy-occupied territories, con-\ncerning which our Intelligence from ground\nsources was exceedingly scarce. In the closing\nstages of the war, however, operations by air-\ncraft in introducing personnel to the Japanese-\noccupied areas of Burma, Siam, French Indo-\nChina, Malaya, Sumatra and Singapore Island,\nand supplying them as well as the guerilla for-\nmations under their control, grew to propor-\ntions which called for the maximum effort of\naircraft and crews engaged on this special work.\nIndeed the true picture was that our Liberator\nposition in the Command was exceedingly\ntight, since the S.D. effort was carried out\nlargely by this type of aircraft.\n\n275. By May, 1945, guerilla organisations in\nthe Theatre had become firmly established, so\nmuch so, that the Burmese Guerillas played\na prominent part with our Air and Ground\nForces in the killing of ten thousand Japanese\ntroops during an attempted mass escape from\nthe Pegu Yomas in July.\n\n276. A brief account of their activities in co-\noperation with the Tactical Air Forces is\ncovered in another chapter.\n\nControl of the Guerilla Organisations.\n\n277. The control of the Guerilla Organisa-\ntions in this Theatre was vested in the Supreme\nAllied Commander, South East Asia, with a\nbranch, known as “P” Division, which dele-\ngated part of its functions to special staff officers\nat various lower formations.\n\n278. Guerilla operations in South East Asia\ntook on an entirely different character from\nthe work of the underground forces in Europe,\nwhere patriots speedily organised themselves\nas a resistance movement. Jn South East Asia\nthe sympathies of Asiatics had first to be won\nover to our cause by special agents and leaders,\nand parties of guerillas organised among the\niocal inhabitants and often fanatical hill tribes-\nmen. Aircraft made flights of 2,000 and 3,000\nmiles regularly on these expeditions for on air-\ncraft almost entirely did the build-up of these\nsecret forces depend.\n\n279. Briefly, the Guerilla Organisations\noperating in the Theatre were as follows: —\n\n{a) Force 136. This was a British Organi-\nsation mainly responsible for raising, train-\ning, arming and controlling guerilla forces\nand sabotage teams. It also had a tactical\nintelligence role and operational control of\n“Z” Force which had a more limited but\nsimilar function.\n\n{b) O.S.S. The American Officers of\nStrategic Services had a similar object to that\nof Force 136, and also collected and distri-\nbuted strategic intelligence.\n\n(c) LS.L.D, The Inter-Service Liaison De-\npartment was a British Organisation and was\n\n2149\n\nconcerned mainly with the collection and dis-\n\ntribution of strategic intelligence from many\n\nsources.\n\n280. In addition to the above, there were also\nmiscellaneous organisations which had\nguerilla functions, and sometimes called upon\nSpecial Duty aircraft to assist them.\n\nAllied Air Force Units Involved.\n\n281. Liberators, Dakotas, Catalinas,\nLysanders and L.5 (Sentinels) were used for the\nS.D. operations. The principal units employed\nwere: —\n\n(i) No. 357 Squadron. This squadron was\nthe one permanent complete S.D. squadron\nin this Theatre. It consisted of 10 Libera-\ntors, 10 Dakotas and a detached flight of\nup to 10 Lysanders. The role of the\n\nLysanders was the infiltration and with-\ndrawal of men and mail by landing in enemy\nterritory. The Dakotas were also available\nfor similar landings, as well as for parachute\noperations.\n\nGi) No. 240 Squadron. This G.R. Cata-\nlina squadron included three Catalinas for\nSpecial Duty Operations in alighting in enemy\nwaters. These Catalinas were also capable\nof minor parachute operations.\n\niii) No. 358 Squadron. This heavy\npeliber squadron was transferred indefinitely\nfrom 231 Group to the S.D. role, and con-\nsisted of 16 Liberators which were modified\nto S.D. standards.\n\n(iv) 10th U.S.A.A.F. Until the withdrawal\nby the American Army Air Forces from the\nCommand on Ist June, 1945, a proportion\nof the effort of the 10th USAAF., by\narrangement with the O.S.S., was allocated\nto S.D. operations.\n\n{v) Tactical Groups. By local arrange-\nments between the Guerilla Organisations and\nNo. 221 Group, Tactical squadrons some-\ntimes carried out S.D. operations authorised\nby the Group Headquarters.\n\n{vi) S.D. Air/Sea_ Rescue Operations.\nSpecial Duty Air/Sea Rescue operations were\ncarried out from time to time by A.S.R. Cata-\nlinas under the control of No. 222 Group.\nThese operations were concerned with instal-\nling dumps of foodstuffs and equipment for\nmissing aircrews on coasts in enemy waters,\nand were arranged by “E” Group.\n\n282. As the S.D. squadrons duting the closing\nstages of the war in South East Asia were\noperating regularly at an intensive rate of effort\non these missions, other units were also brought\nin to supplement the S.D. work.\n\nPlanning of S.D. Air Operations.\n\n283. The training of aircrews and army per-\nsonnel to the R.A-F. standards took as high\npriority as the operations themselves. Where\npracticable, and when the Guerilla Organisa-\ntions agreed, the training of army personnel\nand aircrews was combined. This was par-\nticularly essential during training for night\nlanding operations on enemy territory, and\nfor ground-to-air special radar and signals\nequipment.\n\n284. It was estimated that a sustained rate\nof five successful sorties per aircraft per\nmonth could be maintained by an S.D.\nsquadron of twelve aircraft, giving a total of\n",

Generally, planning\ndid not exceed more than fifty sorties per\nmonth, in view of the maintenance difficulties,\nthe extremely long sorties which had to be\nflown, and the fact that the Guerilla Organi-\nsations might not have continuous operations\nin hand. While it was possible to carry out\nthe majority of the operations over Malaya\nwith safety during daytime, or under last light\nconditions, it was not considered wise to make\nthese flights in daylight in the immediate\nvicinity of Singapore.\n\n285. The three principal home bases for the\nS.D. operations were at Jessore in Bengal,\nMinneriya in Ceylon, and later the Cocos\nIslands. The operations from the Cocos did\nnot begin until mid-July, when sorties were\nflown to all parts of Malaya. From Bengal,\nthe S.D. operations were principally over\nBurma and French Indo-China, but flights\nwere also made deep into Malaya, one air-\ncraft logging twenty hours thirty-nine minutes\nfor one of its sorties.\n\nOperations Increased for Malaya.\n\n286. The strategic plan for the assault on\nMalaya called for an even greater effort by\nthe S.D. squadrons based in Ceylon. By July,\nthe underground forces had been so organised\nby our personnel, and supplied with arms and\nequipment to such proportions, that they con-\nstituted a very real threat to isolated garrisons\nof Japanese troops. The time was considered\nopportune to foster and galvanise these organi-\nsations into a formidable. fighting force to\nharass the enemy at the time of our own land-\nings in Malaya. For this purpose, therefore,\nit was decided to use heavy bomber aircraft,\nbased on the Cocos Islands, to supplement the\nS.D. operations into Southern Malaya, and to\nemploy these aircraft on the first ten nights\nof the July and August moon periods. These\noperations were controlled by Headquarters,\nNo. 222 Group. Aircraft airborne from the\nCocos Islands were routed in daylight through\nthe gap in the Sumatra mountain range between\n1° North and 2° North, and carrying a pay-\nload of 5,000 Ibs. In this way, approximately\n75 per cent. of the Malayan dropping zones\nwas covered.\n\n287. In order to carry out very long range\nS.D. operations within the Command with\nworthwhile payloads, Liberators at one time\nwere operating with an all-up-weight (a.u.w.)\nof 66,000 Ibs. This had paid a great dividend\nin establishing links with the underground\nforces in ‘Malaya.\n\n288. To keep the a.u.w. within the margin\nof safety, however, and at the same time carry\nthe maximum payloads, it was necessary, on\noccasion, to cut the amount of extra petrol\ncarried to the irreducible minimum ; to strip\naircraft of non-essential equipment, and to\ncarry only essential crews.\n\n289. In the weeks immediately preceding\n-the Allied landings on Malaya, a considerable\nweight of weapons, ammunition and concen-\ntrated food was dropped to thousands of\norganised guerillas, together with trained\nguerilla leaders.\n\n290. The operational records of the aircraft\nengaged on S.D. operations in the Command\nshow that aircraft of No. 222 Group alone\nflew: nearly 11,000 hours between May and\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\nSeptember, 1945. The Cocos squadrons,\nalthough not altogether fully experienced in\nS.D. work, speedily established an enviable\nreputation for accurate dropping. When it\nis realised, too, that the sorties carried out\nby Catalina aircraft entailed, for the most\npart, night landings on enemy waters in vary-\ning conditions of sea, without benefit of flare-\npath, some idea is gained of the high skill\nrequired from these R.A.F. pilots.\n\n291. The sudden end of the war in South\nEast Asia did not conclude the tasks of the\nS.D. squadrons, but brought instead a new,\nseries of commitments under Operation\n“ Mastiff” for the relief and liberation of\nAllied prisoners-of-war, an aspect which is\ndealt with in a later chapter of this despatch:\n\nOutstanding Operations by Lysander Aircraft:\n. 292, Any report or narrative on S.D. opera-\ntions would be far short of completeness with-\nout mention of the magnificent work done by\nlight aircraft, notably Lysanders. The untiring\nefforts of Lysander pilots, indeed, greatly\nassisted Force 136 to carry on their activities\nbehind the enemy lines during the drive through\nBurma, and I feel justified in singling them out\nfor especial mention.\n\n293. Particularly outstanding work was done\nby the Lysander Flight of 357 Squadron, Not\nonly were personnel infiltrated, but seriously\nwounded personnel were evacuated from the\nfield. In addition to the urgent operational\nstores flown in, commitments had included\ntransport of Staff Officers to Party Commanders\nin the field, and the evacuation of enemy\nprisoners-of-war and documents.\n\n294. The versatility of the flight had in-\ncreased with each operation. Sorties often\nnecessitated flying in foul monsoon -weather\nand landing on very smail strips. On one occa-\nsion a landing was attempted at Ntilawathibta,\nnear the Papun-Momaung Road, on a very\nshort strip and on wet and slippery grass. The\naircraft slid into a deep ditch at the end of the\nstrip, but escaped with negligible damage. In\nattempts to extricate the aircraft, lumber\nelephants would not go near, but the com-\nbined efforts of fifty local inhabitants even-\ntually succeeded in hauling the plane back on\nto the strip; the pilot then flew back to base.\n\n295. On many occasions Lysander sorties\ncame near to failure owing to the presence of\nJapanese troops in the area. Force 136 nearly\nalways had to cover the landing area for fear\nof surprise by Japanese patrols.\n\n296. On another occasion, a pilot was in-\nvolved in a skirmish between Japanese troops\nand Force 136 Guerillas at Lipyekhi, when\nhis aircraft failed to start for the return journey\nto Rangoon. Firing took place across the\nstrip, but the aircraft escaped damage. It\nwas rendered serviceable next day by a rescue\nsortie, and was able to return to base.\n\n297. Another escapade was accomplished\nwhen Squadron Leader Turner, Flight Com-\nmander, damaged his Lysander in an attempt\nto pick up personnel at Ngapyawdaw, near\nKinmun. Shortly after he had landed, the\nneighbourhood was compromised by Japanese\nforces and repair of the aircraft was impos-\nsible. Attempts to rescue’ Squadron Leader\nTurner were abortive until ten days later,\n",

In the meantime, the Flight Com-\nmander stayed with Force 136 Guerillas.\n\nThe Advantages of the Lysander Aircraft.\n\n298. The advantages of the Lysander for the\nunique type of work it was called upon to\ncarry out were as follows :—\n\n(i) Weight lifting capacity.\n\n(ii) Automatic flap action, meeting all the\nconditions of flight, e.g. a sudden loss of lift\nin a sudden violent turn or in conditions of\nturbulence over the hills.\n\n(iii) Capability of cruising at low speed in\nconditions of bad visibility.\n\n(iv) High rate of turn, of great value in\nconfined spaces.\n\n(v) Fixed undercarriage, strong and able\nto stand the shocks of heavy landings.\n\n(vi) High engine power and light wing\nloading, facilitating quick take-off from\nwaterlogged strips, and an immediate high\ntate of climb.\n\n(vii) Reasonable flying endurance of air-\ncraft, the pilot never being embarrassed in a\ndifficult operation by shortage of fuel.\n\n299. But even with these advantages, the\ntechnique required of the Lysander pilots was\none of skill, particularly when landing on very\nsmall strips. On such occasions the normal\napproach speed of 85 m.p.h. had to be re-\nduced to 70 m.p.h., and a precision touch-\ndown at the very beginning of the strip, with\nthrottle promptly closed, had to be accom-\nplished.\n\n300. From May, 1945, to October, 1945,\n357 Squadron Lysanders flew no less than\n1,310 hours. 405 sorties were attempted and\n363 of these -were successful. Personnel in-\nfiltrated had numbered 214, and evacuations,\n330. In addition, some 104,580 Ibs. of stores\nwere landed behind the enemy lines.\n\n301. A fitting tribute to the Lysander opera-\ntions was paid by Headquarters, Group “ A”\nof Force 136 on 23rd June, 1945,\n\nPHOTOGRAPHIC RECONNAISSANCE\n\nA Record of Achievement Built on\nPerseverance of Crews.\n\n302. Photographic reconnaissance has come\nout of the South East Asia Theatre with a\nrecord of achievement built upon the perse-\nverance of its air crews to master the diffi-\nculties of climate and terrain. A flight of\n2,600 miles in nine hours five minutes was one\nof the longest flights ever done in P.R.\n\n303. The radius of P.R. cover in Decem-\nber, 1943, when the Command was formed,\nwas not more than 680 miles, since long range\nTeconnaissance by Mosquitos was only in pro-\ncess of being attempted in the coverage of\nthe Andaman Islands from Comilla and, a\nlittle later, of Bangkok in Siam. When the\nwar with Japan ended in August, 1945, the\nrange of P.R. aircraft in South East Asia\nCommand was such that coverage of the\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands from Ceylon,\nflights deep into Siam and French Indo China\nfrom Rangoon, and a detailed coverage of\ntargets in Sumatra, Southern Malaya, Singa-\npore and Java by aircraft based on the Cocos\nIslands; had become norma! routine.\n\n2151.:\n\n304. The Mosquito indeed made amends\nfor the structural defect which had curtailed\nits use in this Command, for it set up two\nrecords in 1945. Firstly, a Mosquito XVI\nbroke the long distance record on March 22\nfor this type of aircraft in any theatre of war,\nwith a flight of 2,493 miles in eight hours\nforty-five minutes, covering the Bangkok—\nSingapore railway to a point south of the\nMalayan frontier. This performance, however,\nwas eclipsed by a Mosquito XXXIV based on\nthe Cocos Islands, which on 20th August,\n1945, flew 1,240 miles to Penang Island and\nthen went on to cover Taiping town and air-:\nfield at 17,000 feet. On the return home a\nsurvey tun was made on the K8/12-inch\ncamera. This was the longest P.R. flight to be\nmade in the Command, and covered a total of\n2,600 miles in nine hours five minutes.\n\nPhotographic Survey of Burma.\n\n305. Possibly the two most outstanding con-\ntributions by photographic reconnaissance to\nthe war in South East Asia were its survey\nphotography of Burma at the inning of\n1944, and its detailed coverage of enemy\noccupied territories after the fall of Rangoon\nin May, 1945, in preparation for the large\nscale assault on Malaya.\n\n306. The survey photography of Burma\nfulfilled a long-felt want by supplying accurate\nand up-to-date maps of Burma which were\npractically non-existent up to this time—the\nAir Force and Army having to use 1914-15\nground surveys which, as photographic recon-\nnaissance proved, showed major errors. The\nnew survey of Burma was one of the best\nexamples of R.A.F. assistance to the Army in\nthis Theatre.\n\n307. Faced with the urgent and extensive\nprogramme of photographic reconnaissance in\n\n: Malaya and Sumatra for Operation “ Zipper ”,\n\na detachment of 684 Squadron (Alipore) com-\nmenced operations from the Cocos Islands in\nJuly, 1945, with four Mk. XXXIV Mosquitos\nwhich had just been released for service use\nin temperate and tropical climates. The P.R.\nprogramme for “Zipper” went steadily for-\nward and, by the end of July, was 60 per\ncent. completed. A second detachment of\n684 Squadron Mosquitos was operating at this\ntime from China Bay, Ceylon, for the cover-\nage of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nP.R. organisation after fall of Rangoon.\n\n308. At the time of Rangoon’s capture in\nMay, 1945, the Photographic Reconnaissance\nForce was commanded by Colonel Minton W.\nKaye, United States Army Air Force, with\nGroup Captain S. G. Wise, D.F.C., as Assistant\nAir Commander:\n\n309. The Force controlled two RAF.\nSquadrons, No. 681 (Spitfires) and No. 684\n(Mosquitos), while the Americans had a P.38\n(F.5) Squadron, a P.40, and a B.24 Mapping\nSquadron. The American Units, however, had\ncompleted their task as a P.R. integrated force\nin the Command and, after carrying out a\nfew P.R. sorties at the beginning of May, ‘they\nthen retired to are for withdrawal to\nChina with the remainder of the American Air\nForces in the Theatre. The two RAF.\nsquadrons, therefore, were left to operate on\n",

It became apparent, after the fall of\nRangoon, that Photographic Reconnaissance\nin the Command would have to be endowed\nwith a mobility which would allow it to\nmove forward with the tide of battle. Accord-\ningly, No. 347 P.R. Wing, which was formed\nin April, became effective as a formation in\nMay, 1945. The new Wing Headquarters\nabsorbed all of the R.A-F. element of the\nPhotographic Reconnaissance Force and certain\nsections of the Station Headquarters at Alipore\nand Bally (India), where the two R.AF.\nSquadrons of Spitfires and Mosquitos were\n\nased.\n\n311. In May, No. 684 Squadron continued\nto be based at Alipore, but No. 681 Squadron\nmoved to Mingaladon, Rangoon and flew most\nof their sorties in support of the Twelfth\nArmy’s mopping up operations along the\nMawchi Road, the Sittang Bend and the road\nand river communications between Pegu and\nMoulmein.\n\n312. On 9th June, 1945, the Wing passed to\nthe Command of Group Captain C. E. St. J.\nBeamish, D.F.C. .\n\nWorking against the Monsoon in Operational\nAreas.\n\n313. Bad weather was the enemy which\nphotographic reconnaissance had to combat\nalmost continuously. Only by dint of sheer\nperseverance were many of the most important\ncovers accomplished.\n\n314, With the arrival of the Monsoon in\n\nMay over the operational areas in Southern\nBurma and Siam, coverage from a _photo-\ngraphic point of view became extremely diffi-\ncult and flying more hazardous.\n. 315. The inter-tropical front appeared at the\nIsthmus of Kra and moved as far north as\nMergui, but generally it kept more to the\nsouth, By the end of May, weather\ndeteriorated considerably and the Monsoon\nentered into its own for the season.\n\n316. While Spitfires, based in Southern\nBurma, were able to take advantage of local\nweather conditions for short P.R. sorties in\nsupport of the Army, the task was more\ndifficult, long range Mosquitos undertaking\nmany flights of more than 2,000 miles for each\nsortie. More than one aircraft on occasions\nreturned to base with torn fabric and other\nevidence of severe climatic conditions.\n\n317. In August, with the weeks drawing\nnear for the assault on Malaya, No. 2 Mosquito\nDetachment of 684 Squadron (based on the\nCocos Islands), succeeded in flying 282\noperational hours with only four crews. Some\nof the beach targets necessary for operation\n“Zipper” were exceedingly exacting, since\nphotography had to be done at low tide in\norder to secure a full picture of the state\nand condition of beaches in preparation for\nthe landings.\n\n318. Intimation of Japan’s surrender was the\nsignal for P.R. to work at greater pressure\nthan ever. The “ Zipper” programme, which\nwas all but complete, was cancelled, and a new\nprogramme substituted entailing cover, three\ntimes a fortnight, by P.R. aircraft of all im-\nportant targets ranging from Penang: Island to\nSourabaja in Java. It is worth noting that\nPR. aircraft, during this period of uncertainty\namong Japanese units regarding their country’s\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\nsurrender, met with more opposition than at\nany other time. At Palembang, pilots re-\nported that enemy A.A. fire was intense.\n\n319. Probably the most outstanding P.R.\nsortie from a general and humane interest at\nthis time was that undertaken by a pilot of\n681 Squadron (Spitfires) when covering\nprisoner-of-war camps in the Kanchana Buri\narea of Siam, ten days after the declaration\nof Japan’s surrender. Prisoners at one of the\ncamps were crowded together and swarming\nover the watch towers, waving and cheering\nto the pilot of the aircraft. Signs were also\nlaid on the ground, including a giant Union\nJack to indicate to the pilot that the prisoners\nalso knew of events which had caused excite-\nment in the world outside.\n\nParr III.\nTHE SURRENDER OF JAPAN.\n\nTHeaTRe BOUNDARIES AND DEPLOYMENT OF\nAm Forces Decmep aT Manila\nCONFERENCE.\n\n320. August, 1945 saw the war against\nJapan move with over-whelming speed towards\nits culmination.\n\n321. Throughout the war, research in\nBritain, America and Germany had pursued\nthe possibility of harnessing to war the poten-\ntialities of atomic energy, and the first atomic\nbombs were dropped with devastating effect on\nmetropolitan Japan at Hiroshima and Nagasaki\non 5th and 9th August, 1945, respectively.\nAdding further to the plight of Japan was the\ndeclaration of war by Russia on &th August,\nfollowed by Soviet Forces crossing the Man-\nchurian and Korean borders.\n\n322. From these momentous events, and\nfaced with certain Allied invasion of the home-\nland, for which air power had paved the way,\nJapan could see no escape. The end came in\nthe form of surrender, which was broadcast\nfrom Tokio on 10th August, and the acceptance\nof the Allied terms on 14th August.\n\n323. As the result of the Japanese intimation\nthat they were prepared to discuss and to\nreceive surrender terms, the Supreme Allied\nCommander, South East Asia, directed that a\nMission representing himself and his three\nCommanders-in-Chief should be despatched to\nManila in the Philippines. The primary\nobject of this Mission was to discuss the terms\nof surrender with General MacArthur and his\nstaff, with a view to co-ordinating measures to\nbe adopted to implement the terms of surrender\n‘both in the South West Pacific area and in\nSouth East Asia.\n\n324.

Flag\nLieutenant to Admiral Moody.\n\n2nd Officer Price, W.R.N.S., Secretary to\nthe Missions\n\n325. The Mission arrived at Manila shortly\nafter dawn on 17th August. The return\njourney, following the same route, was com-\npleted on 21st August, crossing occupied terri-\ntory once again by night.\n\nPolitical Situation at Time of Surrender.\n\n326. At the time of the SA.CS.E.A.\nMission’s arrival at Manila, the visit of the\nJapanese Mission to obtain the surrender terms\nwas still awaited.. It was thought that some\ndelay might have occurred arising out of the\npolitical confusion in Japan and the lack of\ncommunication facilities generally as the result\nof continuous and heavy bombing.\n\n327. The general opinion in the South West\nPacific Area appeared to be that the South\nEast Asia Command Theatre was being far\ntoo precipitate in implementing the surrender\nterms which had not yet been agreed by the\ncontracting parties. Furthermore, General\nMacArthur was adamant that any implementa-\ntion of the surrender terms could only take\nplace after the surrender terms had been form-\nally agreed and signed by the Japanese Govern-\nment either at Tokio or on board a ship in\nadjacent waters. This, it was calculated, would\nbe at least a week after the presentation of the\nAllied terms to be collected by the Japanese\nMission to Manila, to whom certain points\nwould need clarification. ,\n\n328. The Japanese Mission consisting of\nsome eight Japanese officers arrived at Manila\non the evening of August 19th, having flown\nin two Betty Bombers from Japan to Okinawa\nwhere they had transferred to a C.54. The\nMission was led by. Lt.-Gen. Kawaba\nTakashiro, Vice Chief of the Imperial General\nStaff. Altogether, the representatives were a\ndejected looking gathering of very small men,\nclad in shabby and ill-fitting uniforms. They\nwere treated with respect and allowed to wear\ntheir swords throughout their visit—an un-\ncomfortable privilege, as each member was\ncarrying a sword nearly as tall as himself.\nThe members of the Mission were housed in\nthe same building as the S.A.C.S.E.A. Mission\n—a partially repaired building in which they\nwere granted the hospitality of the top floor,\nthe least repaired of all. After a brief meal\non arrival they were summoned to a confer-\nence at G.H.Q. where they were presented with\nthe terms of surrender for explanation and\ntransmission to their Government. On their\npart, they provided full details of their Order\nof Battle, strength of garrisons and the neces-\nsary information regarding Prisoner-of-War\ncamps in various Theatres.\n\n329. The Japanese Mission returned to\nOkinawa from Manila at midday on 20th\nAugust. No untoward events occurred during\ntheir visit to the Philippines, but such was the\nmixture of feeling within their own country\nat that time regarding the peace terms that\nthey were shot at by their own fighters when\nleaving Japan for Okinawa. A similar recep-\ntion was contemplated on their return to Japan,\nand, in consequence, they took the precaution\nof approaching Japanese territory in the dark.\n\n2153\n\n330. There is little doubt in my mind that\nthe Japanese Government, at the time of sur-\nrender, was up against some very strong oppo-\nsition from certain fanatical factions. It was\nstated that in Singapore, before our occupation\nin September, a group of young Japanese\nofficers had planned to fiy to Tokio and there\nweed out what they considered to be the\n“corrupt elements” around the Throne, where\ndefeatist policies, they held, had greatly\ninfluenced the Emperor.\n\n331. The conference at Manila revealed an\nexceedingly interesting feature. Opinion in the\nSouth West Pacific Area apparently attributed\na far higher value to the enemy’s fighting quali-\nties than was attributed to those Japanese\nwhom we fought and defeated in Burma. It\nappeared that the morale and determination of\nthe enemy forces in the metropolitan area was\non a far higher level than that experienced in\nthe outer regions of Japanese conquest, where\nforces had been virtually isolated for months\nand, in any case, were not directly involved in\nthe defence of their homeland. For this\nreason, G.H.Q. Manila expected considerable\nopposition to their occupying forces in Japan\nproper, in the form of sabotage and other sub-\nversive activities by fanatical elements.\n\n332. At this time, the American airborne\ndivision was standing by at Okinawa to fly\ninto Japan. The ultimate figure for the build-\nup of U.S. Army Forces for occupation was\nput at some 18 Divisions together with the\nwhole of the 5th Air Force, although it was\nnot thought that this would include V.H.B.\naircraft owing to the lack of suitable runways\nin Japan.\n\n333. I think it is important to note the\nAmerican attitude at that time towards the\nparticipation of Air Forces, other than\nAmerican, in the initial occupation of Japan.\nGeneral Kenney, Commanding General, Far\nEastern Air Forces, was not disposed to dis-\ncuss the occupation of Japan by Allied Air\nForces, which he apparently regarded as un-\nnecessary representation in a country where\nairfield facilities were limited. Furthermore,\nit seemed that any inclusion of British Air\nForces in Japan would inevitably raise the\nquestion of Russian Air Forces in a similar\ntole, to which the Americans were strongly\naverse in every way. On the other hand, the\nAmericans favourably accepted the occupa-\ntion of Hong Kong and elsewhere by our Air\nForces, since they did not regard Hong Kong\nas their own problem. The fact that the British\n“Tiger Force” project for Okinawa was no\nlonger contemplated, as the result of Japan’s\nsudden surrender, also produced for the\nAmericans a general feeling of relief, mainly\non logistical grounds. The British airfield\nengineers, who were already in transit for\n“Tiger Force” constructional requirements,\nwere delayed at the island of Quajalin in the\nPacific, pending further instructions to pro-\nceed, and it was suggested to us that we might\nlike to divert these forces for our own airfield\nTequirements in Malaya and elsewhere.\n\n334. Australia, however, let it be known that\nthey had every intention of being represented\nin the forces of occupation of Japan. General\nMacArthur was informed, through General\nBlamey, that the Commonwealth proposed to\nprovide a representative garrison for Japan,\nincluding three tactical squadrons of the Royal\n",

It is interesting to note\nthat this was the first official intimation which\nhad been received by Headquarters, South\nWest Pacific Area regarding the representation\nof Allied Air Forces in Japan.\n\n335. With Japan’s surrender, H.Q. South\nWest Pacific Area were not unnaturally\nanxious that we should accept full responsi-\nbility, as soon as possible, within the new\nTheatre boundaries originally discussed at a\nmeeting between Admiral Mountbatten and\nGeneral MacArthur, which had taken place at\nManila during July.\n\n336. In the division of responsibility for\nimplementing the surrender terms, South East\nAsia Command was allotted the following :—\n\n{a) Andamans. Nicobars.\nBurma. Thailand.\nF.C. (South of Malaya.\n\n16° N.). Java.\nSumatra. Lombok.\nBali.\nAustralia accepted responsibility for :—\n(b) British New Borneo..\nGuinea. Solomons.\nBismarck Islands Timor.\nFlores. Ceram.\nSoemba. Amboina.\nBoeros. Tanimbar.\nKai Aroe.\n\nIslands in the Arafura Sea.\n\n337. This division, however, left a gap\ncomprising the Celebes, Halmahora Islands\nand Dutch New Guinea, for which no forces\nwere available to implement the surrender\nterms unless the Dutch did so—a commitment\nwhich would obviously have introduced a ship-\nping problem to transfer the necessary forces\nfrom Europe. The Australians, too, were\nanxious to hand over Borneo to us as soon as\npossible.\n\nTe SURRENDER IN SOUTH East ASIA.\nCeremonies at Rangoon and Singapore.\n\n338. In accordance with the orders of the\nSupreme Allied Commander, South East Asia,\nJapanese envoys, headed by Lieutenant General\nTakazo Numata, Chief of Staff to Field Marshal\nCount Terauchi, Japanese Expeditionary Force,\nSouthern Regions, arrived at Rangoon by air\non August 26th to be given their instructions\nfor the implementation of the local surrender\nterms. Thus, after inflicting on the Japanese\none of the greatest defeats of the war in the\nFar East, in a campaign which had lasted for\nover three years and in which the enemy’s losses\namounted to 100,000 men, it was at Rangoon\nthat the Japanese Generals arrived to take their\norders from the Allied Forces in South East\nAsia.\n\n339. The meetings in Rangoon with the\nJapanese plenipotentiaries were, in no sense,\nnegotiations. There was no question of dis-\ncussion of terms. The Japanese were there to\naccept Unconditional Surrender. It was in-\ntended also that a binding act of surrender\nshould be signed at Rangoon and that the\nofficial ceremony of surrender would be carried\nout at Singapore after the Supreme Allied Com-\nmander’s instructions had been completed at\nthe Rangoon meetings.\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THe LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\n340. The conditions insisted upon by the\nSupreme Allied Commander, South East Asia,\nincluded immediate relief to prisoners-of-war\nand internees ; Allied aircraft to begin day and\nnight reconnaissance flights over South East\nAsia; Allied vessels to begin mine-sweeping\noperations in hitherto Japanese-controlled\nwaters, and also for Allied vessels to enter ports\nin Malaya and elsewhere with full facilities\nprovided.\n\n341. The meetings with the Japanese pleni-\npotentiaries, which were resumed at Rangoon\nin the opening days of September, brought to\ndJight many positive facts concerning the plight\nof the Japanese Army in Burma from the time\nof the enemy’s disastrous retreat at Imphal in\nJune, 1944. It was apparent from one im-\nportant statement read by Major General\nIchida, at Rangoon on September 11th, that\nthe Japanese in Burma had not reckoned with\ntwo important and vital factors which upset\ntheir calculations and placed their forces at\ndisastrous disadvantages : —\n\n(a) Allied air supply, which permitted\nground forces in Burma to consolidate their\npositions without being forced to retreat, and\nthus rendered the enemy’s infiltration and\nencircling tactics abortive. ,\n\n{b) Allied air superiority, which so dis-\nrupted Japanese supply lines, both in Burma\nand further afield, that starvation and illness\novertook thousands of Japanese troops facing\nFourteenth Army, and also denied them the\nessential supplies of fuel, equipment and\nmaterial with which to fight a superior\nequipped, and better supplied, Allied Force.\n342. With the disruption of the enemy’s lines\n\nof communication, and the systematic attacks\non their rear supply bases, it was not surprising .\nthat Major General Ichida should declare :—\n\n“From the time of the Imphal operation,\nlast year, our Army in Burma carried on\nits operations continuously for a period of\na year with its main force, and during that\nperiod the army hardly ever received any\nreinforcements in its manpower—none since\nDecember last year—the replenishment of\nmilitary stores also being very meagre.”\n343. The situation of the Allied ground\n\nforces, ranged against them, presented .a\nhappier picture. Thanks mainly to Allied air\nsuperiority, and resulting air supply, they had\nwithstood the siege of Imphal, and, on the\nsiege being raised, had taken the offensive\ndown through Burma with the knowledge that\nfuel, rations, ammunitions and miscellaneous\nequipment would be air-dropped or air-landed\nto them, throughout the advance, while casual-\nties inflicted by the enemy would be taken\ncare of and evacuated safely to base.\n\nThe Ceremony at Singapore.\n\n344. With the Supreme Allied Commander,\nand other Commanders-in-Chief, it afforded\nconsiderable satisfaction to witness General\nItagaki sign, for his defeated compatriots,\nAdmiral Mountbatten’s terms for Unconditional\nSurrender in the South East Asia Theatre a\nSingapore, on 12th September, 1945. .\n\n345. There was not displayed at that cere-\nmony any deliberate’ outward show of pride\nin Allied military achievement. It was moré,\nJ consider, an atmosphere of confident achieve-\nment which reflected the mood of the three\n",

In South East Asia we had\ngood reason to remember that unequal con-\ntest during the dark days of 1941 and 1942,\nwhen the enemy, powerful and well pre-\npared, swept through Malaya, occupied Singa-\npore and later Burma. But their ultimate and\ndecisive defeat—when the tide turned against\nthem, must surely have caused them to re-\nmember the sting of our air forces which, in\ndue course, swept clear the skies over Burma,\nand disorganised the land communications of\nthe Japanese army as the ground troops rolled\nthe enemy back through Burma during the\nadvance from Imphal to Rangoon.\n\n346. The Instrument of Surrender was drawn\nup in English—the only authentic version.\nIn case of doubt as to the intention of our\nmeaning in that Instrument of Sunrender, the\ndecision of the Supreme Allied Commander\nwas unequivocal and final.\n\n347, Under the terms of surrender, all\nJapanese Army, Navy and Air Forces in South\nEast Asia passed to the control of the Supreme\nAllied Commander.\n\n348. I was much impressed by one notice-\nable characteristic on the part of our enemies\nwhich was in striking contrast to their pre-\nvious behaviour in this Theatre—some of it\nan exhibition of unmitigated barbarism. After\nthe surrender there was a widespread attitude\nof subservient willingness by the Japanese to\nobey our orders. In Singapore, as in other\nparts of the Command, I observed that the\nJapanese, officers and men alike, conducted\nthemselves with strict discipline in our presence.\n‘They were super-punctilious too, when paying\nrespects to members of our forces. While this\nwas To doubt correct, it did appear somewhat\nunreal.\n\n349, If, at Singapore, the Japanese myth of\ninvincibility still lurked in the midst of the\nmore fanatical Japanese elements, the Supreme\nAllied Commander must have corrected sharply\nany such belief which was held, in so far\nas it concerned the campaign in South East\nAsia. Admiral Mountbatten made it clear\nand emphatic to Itagaki during the surrender\nceremony that it was not a negotiated sur-\ntender, but complete capitulation by the\nJapanese, after total military defeat. He\ninformed Itagaki that not only did he possess\nsuperior naval, military and air forces at Singa-\npore, ,but, in addition, he had a large fleet\nanchored off Port Swettenham and Port\nDickson where, three days previously, on\nSeptember 9th, considerable forces had started\ndisembarking at daylight. On the 10th, the\nstrength of. that force was 100,000 men ashore.\nIndeed, at the very time of the Japanese\n‘signing the Instrument of Surrender at Singa-\npore, R.A.F. units were firmly established at\nStrategic points throughout the vast tenritories\nof this Theatre which, a few weeks beforehand,\nthad been held by the Japanese.\n\n350. It was also emphasised at the Singapore\nceremony that the invasion of Malaya would\nhave taken place on September 9th whether\ntthe Japanese had resisted or not, and it was\n‘stressed for the particular benefit of General\nItagaki, therefore, that the Japanese were sur-\nrendering to a superior Allied force in Malaya. .\n\n2155\n\nPart IV.\n\nTHE RE-OCCUPATION OF JAPANESE\nOCCUPIED TERRITORIES ON SUR-\nRENDER.\n\nOPERATIONS “TIDERACE” AND “ ZIPPER”.\n\n351. South East Asia Command’s assault\non Malaya, planned for 9th September, 1945,\nwas forestalled by Japanese surrender, thus\nbringing about a last minute change in plan\ninvolving more than 500 aircraft of the\nStrategic, Tactical and General Reconnaissance\nunits of the R.A.F. which had been assembled\nin India, Burma, Ceylon and the Cocos Islands\nfor the attack.\n\n352. ‘While Operation “ Zipper” went for-\nward on 9th September as arranged, it did so\non a much modified scale, having quickly\ntransferred a proportion of its original strength\nto Operation “ Tiderace” and leaving itself\nmore in the nature of a display to show the\n\nlag.\n\n353. The sudden capitulation of Japan on\nAugust 14th had brought with it the gigantic\ntask of effecting rapid occupation of the prin-\ncipal key points throughout the \"Japanese\noccupied territories in South East Asia and\nfurther afield.\n\n354. South East Asia, in this respect, bore\nno comparison to the situation in Europe\nwhere, on the eve of Germany’s capitulation,\nthe armed might of the Allied forces could\ntoll along the roads of the Reich to Berlin,\nand the Air Forces sweep over Germany at\nwill from their bases behind the victorious\ntroops. In South East Asia, the Japanese\noccupied territories were vast. They covered\nSiam, French Indo-China, the Tenasserim\nCoast of Southern Burma, Malaya, Singapore\nIsland, Sumatra, Java and Borneo. Even far\noff Hong Kong became a commitment.\n\n355. Headquarters, Air Command, South\nEast Asia, based at Kandy, Ceylon, was 1,500\nmiles distant across the Bay of Bengal from\nits principal air bases in Burma. Yet, such\nwas the flexibility of air power, and despite\nthe many and intricate formalities with which\nthe Command was confronted in implementing\nthe surrender terms on the eve of the planned\ninvasion of Malaya, that air formations occu-\npied bases at Penang on September Sth, Singa-\npore on the 6th, Bangkok on the Sth and\nSaigon and Hong Kong on September 12th.\n\n356. More vital still was the fact that the\nair forces of my Command had also launched\nupon one of the greatest missions of mercy\nof the war—the relief and liberation of\nthousands of Allied prisoners-of-war from the\nmisery and privations of their prison camps,\nand assisting in their transportation westwards.\n\nThe Advent of “ Tiderace” for Occupation of\n\nSingapore.\n\n357. Capitulation by Japan naturally\nrendered planning and preparations for the\nassault on Malaya somewhat abortive. - But\nthis was only on a limited scale.\n\n358. At the end of July, the mounting curve\nof Allied air assaults on Japan was such that\nit did seem reasonable to presume that an\nearly collapse was a distinct possibility. Accord-\ningly, emergency planning was put in pre-\nparation for the rapid occupation of Singapore\n",

The wisdom of this planning made itself\napparent early in August when the first atomic\nbomb was dropped on the Japanese homeland\nand Russia entered the war.\n\n360. It was the possibility of Japanese\ntreachery, however, which decided the course\nthat planning would take, and the initial occu-\n* pation of Singapore, known as Operation\n“Tiderace ’ was, therefore, mounted from\nTesources other than those earmarked for\nOperation “Zipper”. In this way, it was\npossible to counter any Japanese opposition to\n“Tiderace ” which may have taken place, by\ncontinuing to mount the strong fighting\n“ Zipper ” operation as originally planned.\n\n361. Although the first objective in the re-\noccupation plan was Singapore, a necessary step\nin order to establish an advanced air and naval\nbase to clear the Straits of Malacca for ship-\nPing, it became clear that Bangkok in Siam,\nand Saigon in French Indo-China, would also\nhave to be occupied soon after the Japanese\nsurrender.\n\n362. Operations known as “ Sibber ”, which\ninvolved the occupation of the Bangkok area,\nand “ Masterdom ”, involving the re-entry into\nFrench Indo-China to gain control over the\nforces of Field Marshal Count Terauchi, whose\nSouthern Army Headquarters were at Saigon,\nhad therefore tc be worked out in detail. More-\nover, it had been indicated by the British Chiefs\nof Staff that the former British port of Hong\nKong must also be occupied at an early date.\n\n363. To meet these exigencies, therefore, it\nwas found necessary to modify to some extent\nthe air effort for Operation “ Tiderace ” so that\nthe Dakota Squadrons, based in Rangoon, could\nbe utilised for essential trooping and air lift\nduring the occupation of Bangkok and subse-\nquently of Saigon. This was exceedingly im-\nportant, since a long voyage with troops from\nexisting Allied bases io Siam and French Indo-\nChina would almost certainly have prohibited\nthe speedy occupation of these territories had\nnot the ground forces been lifted by air.\n\n364. That 14,000 Army and Air Force per-\nsonnel for the garrison at Bangkok and Saigon\nwere carried in by our Air Forces without loss\nafter the Japanese surrender, was evidence of\nthe additional role which the Air Forces of my\nCommand were called upon to play on the\ncessation of hostilities, at a time when it was\nimperative to establish ground troops at key\npoints within the scattered enemy-cccupied\nterritories in the quickest possible time.\n\nOriginal “ Zipper” Plan Forestalled.\n\n365. The Surrender by Japan cut right across\nthe ambitious air plan for Operation “ Zipper ”\nwhich had been so carefully conceived to sup-\nport the landings by ground troops on the\nSouthern region of the Malay Peninsula.\n\n366. Landings on the beaches at Ports\nSwettenham and Dickson on D-Day, September\n9th, were to have been made under air cover\nprovided by carrier-borne aircraft of the Royal\nNavy, whose task would have included attacks\non the enemy’s lines of communication and\ntroop concentrations until the fly-in of R.A.F.\nfighters was accomplished. Two aircraft\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\ncarriers, H.M.S. SMITER and H.M.S.\n\nTRUMPETER, carrying short-range Spitfires\n\nand Sentinels and Austers for casualty evacua-\n\ntion, were to carry these aircraft to a point off\n\nshore for pilots to fly them from off the carriers\n\nand land them on the newly-occupied aero-\nmes.\n\n367. The planned effort of the naval carrier-\nborne fighters was 190 sorties a day from the\nmoment of their arrival in the areas of the\nbridgeheads for about a week. This would\nbe further augmented, within six days, by an\nadditional 72 sorties a day from the first land-\nbased squadrons of R.A.F. Spitfires, arid six\nsorties per night from the night fighter\nMosquitos. From the outset, therefore, air\nsuperiority was assured. The enemy was not\nexpected to produce any serious air threat which\ncould not be dealt with adequately by our\nfighters.\n\n368. As more than a thousand miles\nseparated the existing R.A.F. bases in Rangoon\nand the Cocos Islands from the landing\nbeaches, and aimost 1,50C mites in respect of\nother R.A.F. bases in Ceylon and Ramree\nIsland, it was impossible for I'ght bomber,\nfighter and fighter bomber squadrans to operate\nin immediate support of the bridgehead ground\nforces until the position ashore was consoli-\ndated, an airfield captured, repairs effected and\nrunways made serviceable.\n\n369. Basing its time-table on the speed of the\nArmy’s advance and the rapidity by which con-\nstructional engineers could repair damaged run-\nways and taxi-tracks, it was estimated that\nstrips could be brought into operation at the\nrate of approximately one per week. Once\nthe newly-occupied airfields had been estab-\nlished, the long-range Thunderbolts, Mosquitos\nand Dakotas, flying a thousand miles from\nRangoon, would then make the flight south to\nMalaya, being guided on the way by three\nnavigational aid ships at specified pusitions off\nthe Tenasserim Coast and Malayan Peninsula.\n\n370. The first strip —Kelanang—was calcu-\nlated to be operational by D plus 6; Port\nSwettenham by D plus 12 and Kuala Lumpur\nby D plus 20. It was possible that a fourth\nstrip might be established at Batu Pahat, or\nMalacca, in order to accommodate a light Mos-\nquito bomber and rocket-firing Beaufighter air-\ncraft by D plus 40.\n\n371. The value of the Cocos Islands prior to\nand during Operation “ Zipper” would have\nbeen considerable. The Strategic and G.R.\nsquadrons were to have taken part in large-scale\npre-D-Day operations directed against radar\ninstallations covering the approaches to the\nassault area, and also to cutting the Bangkok-\nSingapore railway north of Kuala Lumpur.\nOther tasks included the neutralising of the\nJapanese Air Force, estimated at a little more\nthan 170 aircraft in Malaya and Sumatra, also\nattacking enemy shipping employed in carrying\nsupplies or reinforcements to Malaya to oppose\nour landing. The aerodromes at Kelanang, Port\nSwettenham and Kuala Lumpur were not to be\nbombed, since they were the first objectives on\nestablishing the bridgehead.\n\n372. Five R.A.F. Wings were detailed to\noperate in the tactical forces contained within\nAir Vice Marshal Bandon’s 224 Group, whose\nadvanced Headquarters were to be established\n",

A start would first be made with a\ntarget of 150 tons per day from D plus 23.\n\n@ With the possibility of an airborne\nassault force deep behind enemy lines after\nthe third or fourth week of the operation,\nsix squadrons of Dakotas would have been\nflown in from Rangoon and out again\nimmediately afterwards for this purpose.\n\n(e) Mosquitos were to be employed as\nlight bombers, night fighters and photo-\ngraphic reconnaissance aircraft.\n\n(f) Air evacuation of casualties was to\ncave been the task of Sentinel and Auster air-\ncraft.

In the closing days of August, before\neven the “ Zipper” convoys had left India for\nMalaya, the emergency operation “ Tiderace ”\nwas ordered, since it was essential that air units\nshould fly into Penang and Singapore without\nfurther delay. This brought No. 185 Wing,\ncontrolling Dakotas, Spitfires and Mosquitos\nfrom Burma to Penang, and No. 903 Wing\nfrom Akyab to Singapore, together with Nos.\n152 and 155 itfire Squadrons flying\nZayatkwin (Rangoon)—Penang—Singapore\n(Tengah), and 110 Squadron from Hmawbi\n(Burma)—Penang—Singapore (Seletar). No.\n903 Wing elements reached Singapore on 6th\nSeptember, some three days before the first\n“ Zipper ” elements arrived off the west coast\nof Malaya on September 9th.\n\n377. With “Tiderace ” operation completed,\nand air, ground and sea forces occupying\nSingapore, the modified “ Zipper” operation\nwent forward on September 9th with convoys\nstanding off the beaches at Ports Swettenham\nand Dickson. The naval air support pro-\ngramme, however, had been called off.\n\n378. The air effort for the original\n“ Zipper” was considerably reduced and of\nthe five R.A.F. Wings scheduled to take part\nin the operation, the following wings did not\nenter Malaya and were phased out :—\n\nNo. 901 Wing. No. 904 Wing.

The scene, with every vessel\n\ninkling lights, resembled more a Cowes\nregatta than one of the largest amphibious\noperations of the campaign.\n\n385. The landings at Morib cannot de\ndescribed as attaining the same degree of\nsuccess as those experienced at Ports Swetten-\nham and Dickson—due principally to the diffi-\nculties encountered on the water-covered\nbeaches which, at that part of the coast, are\nnothing more than mud brought down by the\nKlang River.

It enabled released Allied\nprisoners-of-war to be evacuated by our aircraft\nto Rangoon and Singapore, while it also\nformed a valuable staging post to Saigon in\nFrench Indo-China as well as a refuelling point\nfor aircraft lifting there.\n\n388. In Bangkok, the Siamese Air Force was\nfound to be extraordinarily co-operative and\nmarkedly pro-R.A-F., since many of them had,\nin fact, been trained in England.\n\n389. An unusual document, giving an out-\nline of the activities and organisation of the\nSiamese Air Force, and also emphasising its\nattitude of passive resistance to the Japanese\n\n_ throughout the enemy’s occupation of Siam,\nwas handed over by the Siamese Air Force to\nR.AF. Intelligence,\n\n390. History must judge this document for\nitself. Whatever may have been happening\npolitically behind the scenes in the Far East,\nin these dark days of December, 1941, there\nseems to be no doubt that units of the Siamese\nAir Force, on December 8th, took the air to\nresist the Japanese invader, only to be out-\nnumbered and overwhelmed by units of the\nmore superior Japanese Air Force. While this\ncommendable spirit of resistance by the\nSiamese Air Force may have been evident, they\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\n‘were to learn sadly, the same day, that the\n\nSiamese Government in Bangkok was actually\nnegotiating with the Japanese Ambassador,\n\n391, “From outer appearances we played\nup to mislead the Japanese”, is one co!\nin the Siamese document when discussing the\ndefence of Siam during the period of Japanese\noccupation. In their participation in the\ndefence of Don Muang airfield and Bangkok\nagainst Allied aircraft, it was maintained by\nthe Siamese Air Force that “we just did it in\na formal fashion. The United Nations aircraft\nwould fly one way and our aircraft the other\nway, or at different heights. If by rare chance\nwe had to meet we carried on just for appear-\nances sake.”\n\n392. Such are some of the statements by the\nSiamese Air Force. But it is on fact, rather\nthan on professions of loyalty, that any final\nassessment must be made. In this respect,\nthere is one incontrovertible fact concerning\nAllied prisoners-of-war, which does reveal the\nsilent co-operation rendered by the Siamese\nAir Force from the time of their first prisoner-\nof-war—William MacClurry, an American\npilot from the American Volunteer Group\n(Tiger Squadron), who bailed out at Cheing\nMai at the onset of the war in the Far East,\nand whose custody by the Japanese was\nvigorously contested by the Siamese Air Force,\nuntil they finally confined him themselves to\nensure his better treatment and safety.\n\n393. It must also be marked to the credit\nof the Siamese Air Force that they did, to our\nknowledge, assist in furthering liaison and\ncommunication work within Siam, which\nincluded the conveyance of passengers in and\nout of the country; rendering assistance to,\nand providing safeguard for Allied personnel\nsent into Siam to gather information, and also\nindicating for our benefit, precise targets in\nthe hands of the Japanese. Such acts of co-\noperation were fraught with grave risk, and it\nis not surprising that the Japanese ultimately\nadopted an attitude of suspicion.\n\nThe occupation of Saigon.\n\n.394. The outward welcome accorded to the\nAllied Forces from both the French and\nAnnamese alike on our entry into French Indo-\nChina was decidely embarrassing. Our Forces\nobviously found themselves in a divided house.\n\n395. The main R.A.F. party flew into Saigon\nfrom Burma on September 12th, and was given\na demonstrative reception by the French. At\nthe same time, there were banners throughout\nSaigon’s streets erected by the Annamese\nwhich welcomed the Allies but bore caustic\nanti-French slogans. :\n\n396. R.A.F. reconnaissance parties who in-\nspected Japanese Air Force installations at\nThan Son Nhut and Saigon, found them most\ndisappointing. Comparatively few ai\nwere discovered, and none, indeed, were\nserviceable. It appeared that all serviceable\naircraft had either been withdrawn for the\ndefence of Japan or flown to Phu My aero-\ndrome, twenty miles east of Saigon, after the\ncessation of hostilities. The majority of\nJapanese Air Force personnel previously at\nSaigon had also been withdrawn.\n\n397.

On August 29th a strong naval force\nunder Rear Admiral C. H. J. Harcourt, C.B.,\nCBE. (Flag in HM.S.

The formal surrender of\nthe Japanese at Hong Kong took place on\nSeptember 16th. An air headquarters was\nestablished on September 12th.\n\n401. One Spitfire squadron was conveyed in\nan aircraft carrier and the remainder of the\nair units, which included a Mosquito L.B.\nsquadron, another Spitfire squadron, a Sunder-\nland squadron, and one Dakota squadron, were\nflown in to Kaitak Airfield at Kowloon, on the\nmainland, :\n\n402. Air defence of Hong Kong, and the\nprovision of air support for any operations\nwhich might be necessary by the ground forces\ninvolving security of the base, were the\nptimary duties of the air forces as planned.\nIn addition, however, Hong Kong provided a\nlink in the chain of air communications for,\nand reinforcement of the British and Dominion\nAir Forces which would garrison Japan.\n\n403. The “Shield” convoy, which was at\nsea at the conclusion of the Japanese war and,\naccordingly, was diverted while proceeding to\nOkinawa in connection with the Pacific “ Tiger\nForce” operation, arrived in Hong Kong on\nSeptember 4th with 3,400 officers and men of\nvarious R.A.F. units. A large percentage of\n“Shield” Force was composed of personnel\nof No. 5,358 Airfield Construction Wing, whose\noriginal task had been rendered redundant.\n\n404. The variety of rehabilitation tasks\nundertaken by R.A.F. personnel on the occupa-\ntion of Hong Kong and Kowloon on the\nmainland, and accomplished without any pre-\nvious experience, showed that the Royal Air\nForce, apart from its qualities as a fighting\nservice, could be extremely versatile in other\nspheres. It was gratifying to observe at Hong\nKong how aircrew personnel, mainly fighter\npilots, could apply themselves to ground dutier\nvarying from prison supervision to billeting\nand requisitioning, whereas those with greater\ntechnical knowledge, such as R.AF. Airfield\nConstruction Personnel, were largely respon-\nsible for the initiation and maintenance of the\npublic services ; power, light, transport, etc.\n\n(68742)\n\n2159\n\n405. In the first few days of occupation,\nsome 18,000 Japanese forces, including mam\nsenior officers, were rounded up, disarmed,\nand concentrated in Shamshui Po prison, pre-\nfiously a concentration camp on the main-\n\nid.\n\n406. The first commandant of what, under\nBritish occupation, became a Japanese con-\ncentration camp, was a R.AF. squadron\nleader whose previous experience had been\nlimited to operational flying. He proved him-\nself a competent prison governor during his\nshort term of office before handing over his\nduties to an Army officer.\n\nR.A.F. undertake many public services.\n\n407. The total neglect of civic administra-\ntion by the Japanese in Hong Kong and\nKowloon, except in so far as it affected them-\nselves, was all too apparent. Transport did\nnot exist; electric power was unreliable and\nthe supply severely limited; public health\nservices had been totally ignored, and the\nstreets stank with accumulated rubbish and\nfilth. There was, too, large scale looting by\nthe Chinese who, until checked, literally\nstripped every house they entered of all furni-\nture, fittings and every piece of wood includ-\ning floor boards and window and door frames.\nWood for fuel purposes, indeed, was at a\npremium in Hong Kong due to the absence\nof coal.\n\n408. The problems of occupation which\nfaced our forces on arrival were so numerous\nand varied that it was difficult to know where\nto make a start. Yet, at this time, when\nthe R.AF. personnel were busily engaged in\nestablishing an occupation force, many im-\nportant public services were undertaken with\n\ness.\n\n409. To overcome the transport difficulties,\nevery motor car available was requisitioned.\nThis in itself involved considerable labour for\nR.AF. personnel in rehabilitating and main-\ntaining decrepit and mechanically unsound\nvehicles which had been left behind by the\nJapanese. In particular, restoration of the\ndock area to a standard capable of unload-\ning the freight ships of “Shield” convoy pre-\nsented big difficulties. The wharves were\nbroken in many instances and covered with\ndebris and dilapidated equipment. Sunken\nvessels in the bases were also hazards to\nnavigation. .\n\n410. The power station at Kowloon was\nmanned by a R.AF. supervisory staff. While\nthe plant did not work to full capacity, prin-\ncipally on account of fuel shortage, it was,\nnevertheless, made to function and -supply all\nthe requirements of light and power in Kow-\nloon and the docks area. This work included\nthe reconditioning of furnaces, boilers, and\nthe repair of certain turbine power units.\n\n411. In their search for wood as fuel, an\nR.A.F. reconnaissance party of ground per-\nsonnel penetrated into the New Territories\nwhich -vere still occupied by the Japanese.\nLarge stocks of wood were discovered at Taipo\nand Fanling, twenty and fifteen miles respec-\ntively.

It was a mission of paramount import-\nance to thousands of families in Britain, the\nDominions and, indeed, in Holland, who\neagerly awaited information about relatives\ninterned and captured during the Japanese\nconquest of Malaya in 1942.\n\n419. In Singapore alone, about 35,000\nPrisoners were held in the various Japanese\nprison camps throughout Singapore Island)\nthe most notorious of which was the Changi\nGaol. The inmates of these camps had been\nsubjected to coarse indignities and even torture.\n_ 420. The feeling in Britain found expression\nin a message from the British Foreign Secretary\nto the Supreme Allied Commander, South East\nAsia, in which he drew Admiral Mountbatten’s\nattention to the numerous enquiries which the\nGovernment had received since the publication\nof atrocity stories from Singapore and else-\nwhere, and saying that there was grave concern\nin respect of Sumatra, since deaths actually re-\nported by the Japanese through the Inter-\nnational Red Cross were much higher in pro-\nportion to numbers anywhere else in the Far\n\nast.\n\n21. It can be seen, therefore, how well\nsuited was Air Power to perform this vitally\nimportant task involving great distances across\ngreat tracts of land—a task also in which speed\nwas essential for its success.\n\nOperation “ Birdcage” launched.\n\n422. As soon as the Japanese surrender had\nbeen universally accepted and confirmed, action\nwas taken to issue instructions contained in\nspecially prepared leaflets to: —\n\n(@) Japanese Prison Guards.\n(b) Allied Prisoners-of-war.\n\n(c) Local Japanese forces.\n\n(@ The local native population.\n\n‘423. The operation to implement this action\nwas allotted the code name of “ Birdcage,”\nand was launched by the Air Forces of Air\nCommand on August 28th, operating from\nbases in Ceylon, Cocos Islands, Bengal and\nBurma.\n\n424, Thereafter, Operation “ Mastiff”, was\nplanned to ensure that medical aid, comforts,\nfood, clothing, R.A.P.W.I. Control Staffs where\nnecessary, and any other essential preliminary\nneeds were introduced into the camps as early\nas possible.\n\n425. Operation “ Birdcage” was completed\nby August 31st. In the space of four days,\nleaflets had been dropped over 236 localities\nand 90 prisoner-of-war camps throughout\nBurma, Siam, French Indo-China, Malaya and\nSumatra. Where sorties were at first rendered\nabortive by weather and by difficulty in locat-\ning targets or by mechanical trouble, ‘they\nwere persisted with on the following days. Very\nfew priority targets remained uncovered. One\ngroup of towns in the hinterland of Malaya\nwas successfully covered only at the third\nattempt.\n\n426. In addition to Liberator sorties flown\nfrom bases in Ceylon, Cocos Islands and\nBengal, Thunderbolts operating from Burma\ndropped one million leaflets on thirteen locali-\nties in Southern Burma extending as far south\nNo target was left un-\ncovered. One Thunderbolt was lost during\nthese operations—the aircraft crashing in\nflames at Kraburi.\n",

I think it is worthy of note that Opera-\ntion “ Birdcage ” was carried out in very in-\ndifferent conditions. Even more important still\nwas the fact that an all round trip of many\nof the sorties was equivalent to a trans-Atlantio\nflight. Nevertheless, 75 per cent. of the crews\nreached their targets, which included towns and:\ncamps as far east as Hanoi, Tourane and\nSaigon.\n\nSuccess of Leaflet Dropping.\n\n428. The news of Japanese surrender con-\ntained in the millions of leaflets dropped met\nwith great enthusiasm throughout the scattered\nterritories of South East Asia. They were\npicked up on the streets of towns and read\neagerly by the civilian population. The mes-\nsages also dropped to the Allied prisoners-of-\nwar stated, “ We want to get you back home\nquickly, safe and sound”.\n\n429. Many of the prisoners had been\nJapanese forced labour for the building of the\nnotorious Bangkok-Moulmein railway—a slave\ntask which will take its place among the list\nof incredible efforts carried out by captive men.\n\n430. August, 1945, saw the greatest effort in\nleaflet dropping attempted by aircraft of the\nCommand.\n\n431. Prior to the surrender, and immediately\nafter, some 33,007,000 leaflets were dropped\nover the enemy-occupied territories in South\nEast Asia. This form of psychological warfare\nhad been stepped up very considerably after\nthe defeat of the Japanese in Burma, and in\nJuly the total dropped by aircraft of the Com-\nmand reached 22,000,000.\n\n432. One particular form of leaflet, dropped\nover the trapped Japanese forces in the Pegu\nYomas of Southern Burma during July, not\nonly called upon the enemy to surrender after\ntelling them of the hopeless position of their\nhomeland, but, on the reverse side offered\nthem a safe conduct through the Allied lines\nwith the added assurance that they would be\ngiven food, medical attention and honourable\ntreatment.\n\nLaunching of Operation “ Mastiff”.\n\n433. The saturating of towns and prison\ncamps with leaflets announcing the Japanese\nsurrender was, in itself, a laudable effort, but\nthe main task which awaited the Air Forces\nwas unquestionably that of Operation\n“(Mastiff in bringing practical relief and\ncomfort to those who needed them most.\n\n434. Hundreds of these prisoners were\nemaciated, gaunt and pitiful beings—some, in-\ndeed, were too weak to stand upon their\nlegs. The majority of prisoners were deficient\nof proper clothing. There were instances, too,\nwhere some were completely naked.\n\n435. The need of medical supplies was per-\nhaps the greatest, for the Japanese had shown\nlittle ability or willingness to appreciate the\nneeds of prisoners-of-war in many cases. The\nimmediate requirements in drugs, therefore,\ncould only be taken to sufferers by air, and,\nas a large percentage of prisoners and internees,\nparticularly in Singapore, were affected by\nmalaria, it was estimated that 1.250,000 tablets\nof Atabrine, or substitute, were essential for\ndelivery each week.\n\n(68742) .\n\n2161\n\n436. The “Mastiff” operation in the early\nstages was carried out by ten Liberator squad-\nrons (including one R.A.A.F. squadron) and\none Dakota squadron. Three Liberator squad-\nrons operated from bases in Bengal—Jessore,\nSalbani and Digri—covering targets chiefly in\nSiam and French Indo-China. From bases in\nCeylon another three Liberator squadrons\noperated over Malaya and Sumatra, while areas\nin Malaya and Java were supplied by three\n\n‘ Liberator squadrons based in the Cocos\n\nIslands, though these were chiefly employed\non targets in Sumatra.\n\n437. The Dakota squadron operated from\nRangoon over Siam and the Tenasserim Coastal\nArea of Southern Burma. The tasks under-\ntaken by this Dakota squadron must nof be\nconfused with the all-out effort made by five\nDakota squadrons of No. 232 Group, R.AF.,\nbased on Rangoon, which were employed on\nthe air-lift to Bangkok, where the Don Muang\nAirfield was quickly in use. The operations\nof these Dakota squadrons in the air landing\nof supplies and in the evacuation of prisoners-\nof-war was one of the outstanding features of\nthe air operations associated with “ Mastiff ”.\n\n438. From Ist to Sth September, approxi-\nmately 200 Dakota sorties were flown from\nRangoon, and some 400 tons of stores were\ndropped or landed. The same aircraft carried\nback 4,000 prisoners-of-war and internees. On\nthe following week the Dakotas carried out\na further 360 sorties, and dropped or landed\n600 tons of stores. On their returm trips they\ncarried back some 3,700 prisoners-of-war. It\nwas a tribute to the enthusiasm shown by the\nDakota aircrews at this time that 12th Army,\nby September 10th, was able to report that\napproximately 9,000 prisoners-of-war had been\ncarried back to Rangoon from Bangkok. Early\nin the month, practically all the U.S. prisoners-\nof-war had been evacuated from the Bangkok\narea, the figure being approximately 162. This\nevacuation was carried out chiefly by U.S.\nairlift, which was also responsible for bringing\nout a number of British and Allied sick.\n\nUse of Thunderbolts and R.A.A.F. Liberators.\n\n439. Though not actually engaged upon\nOperation “ Mastiff”, a number of Thunderbolt\naircraft flew from their bases in Burma and\nassisted in the problem of locating camps and\ndetermining their circumstances. Many of\nthese Thunderbolt sorties were rendered abor-\ntive by weather, but other sorties resulted in\nthe bringing back of valuable information. It\nwas noted, for example, that several of the\nprison camps on the Burma-Siam railway, in\nthe area stretching N.W. from Kanchanaburi,\nwere deserted and empty, while prisoners-of-\nwar in other scattered camps greeted the\nappearance of the Thunderbolts with under-\nstandable enthusiasm expressed by frantic\ncheering and waving.\n\n440. The inclusion of a series of sorties by\nLiberators of the R.A.A.F. which took’ off\nfrom bases in North Western Australia to drop\nsupplies over Magelang Airfield, in Java, also\ngreatly assisted in the success of operations in\nthe opening weeks. These aircraft landed in\nthe Cocos Islands, loaded up with fresh sup-\nplies, and repeated the drop on Java en route\nback to Australia. The R.A.A.F. Liberators\ncompleted 21 sorties, all of which were success-\nful. Other sorties of a similar nature were\n\nD\n",

At this time too, the\npresence in Singapore of Dakotas belonging\nto 31 Squadron, which operated over Sumatra,\nassisted materially in bringing out of Sumatra\nsome of the first prisoners-of-war.\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THs LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 19531\n\n441. For purposes of comparison, the under-\nnoted table shows the air effort over different\ntarget areas of South East Asia for the first\nthree weeks during which Operation “ Mastiff ”\nwas in progress, and which covers the particular\nperiod of my Despatch.\n\nAugust—September\nWeek 30th—-Sth\n\nWorking of RAPWI and the S.D. Squadrons.\n442, The evacuation of prisoners-of-war and\n\ninternees required the maximum co-operation\nbetween Naval, Land and Air Forces,\n\n443. An Inter-Services Initer-Allied Com-\nmittee was therefore established at the Head-\nquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander,\nat Kandy, Ceylon, for planning and co-ordina-\ntion of control. This Committee acted as the\nclearing house for information, and declared\nthe decisions of the Supreme Allied Com-\nmander on policy, priorities, and allocation of\nresponsibility.\n\n444. The working organisation was known\nas RAPWI (Release Repatriation of Allied\nPrisoners-of-war and Internees), which had a\nCentral Control for aid by air at Kandy, with\nArmy and Air Force Officers, and Sub-Con-\ntrols at Calcutta, Rangoon, Colombo and\nCocos. As the necessity for air dropping\ndecreased, these Controls were inconporated in\nthe RAPWI Control Organisations with Naval,\nAmny, Air and Allied representation, Sub-\nsequently a Control was opened at Singapore.\n\n445. The RAPWI Controls were responsible\nfor co-ordination of executive action in\nmatters of supplies for RAPWI, and the\nevacuation of personnel by aircraft and white\nand red ensign ships.\n\n446. For the prodigious effort put up by\nthe Cocos based squadrons engaged on opera-\ntion “ Mastiff”, Red Cross and other stores\nfor RAPWI were packed at Sigiriya, Ceylon,\nand handed over to the R.A.F. for delivery\nto the Cocos Islands. This-demanded a very\nheavy ferrying commitment to the Cocos\nas two-thirds of the prison camps were\nsupplied by the Cocos based squadrons. Every\navailable Liberator and Sunderland aircraft\nwas used during the inauguration of\n“ Mastiff ”.\n\n447. This extra effort by the S.D. Liberators\nbased on the Cocos was due to the Jarge loads\nwhich had to be carried to the prison camps\nat Singapore and Southern Sumatra—tloads\nwhich averaged from 3,500 to 4,000 Ibs.\n\n448. No praise could be too high for the\nair and ground crew personnel of these Cocos\nbased squadrons. Despite the severe shortage\nof experienced crews and, indeed, aircraft, a\ndaily average of seven sorties, and sometimes\nnine, was maintained. One squadron flew to\n\nSeptember\nWeek 6th—12th\n\nSeptember\nWeek 13th—19th\n\nwidely differing dropping zones throughout\nMalaya, Sumatra and Java. Ninetyive -\nsonnel were dropped on these sorties, of whi\n\n65 were doctors or medical orderlies, and all\narrived safely despite the short notice at which\nmost of the sorties were laid on. On the first\n\npped a medical\nChangi Airfield at dawn on August 29th,\nmaking a round trip of 3,400 miles.\n\n449. The great distances covered and the\nadverse weather conditions encountered were\ndifficulties which were not overcome lightly and\nwithout danger. A Liberator on a supply\ndropping mission to the prison camps at\nPalembang was seen to spin whilst executing\na steep tum and all nine crew members were\nkilled.\n\n450. It became obvious that Operation\n“ Mastiff ” would continue for some consider-\nable time until the last prisoner of war and in-\nternee had been evacuated from all areas by\nair and sea. As September advanced the\nnumbers brought out mounted steadily. There\n\n-has been praise on all sides for our squadrons\n\nco-operating with the other Services in this\nrescue of men and women who have endured\nuntold hardships, indignities and, in some cases\nbarbarous cruelties—comments of praise which\nI have confirmed myself during talks with\ntepatriated prisoners of war flown out of the\nprison camp areas.\n\nTue JAPANESE PLANNED COUNTER MEASURES\nTO INVASION OF Mataya.\n\n451. The the Allies’ powerful “Zipper”\noperation for the landing in Malaya would\nhave succeeded, and that mastery of the air\ncovering the landing would have been secured\nalmost from the start, seems a justifiable claim\nafter careful examination of evidence made\navailable through interrogation of Japanese\nofficers following the surrender in South East\n\n452. It was evident that the Japanese, in\ntheir defence of Malaya, were unable to con-\nform to one of the first principles of modern\nwarfare—that air superiority must be gained,\nand that the battle in the air must first be\nwon, before ground forces can wage their\noperations with any likelihood of success.\n\n453. The Japanese counter invasion plan\nwas based on the fact that very few opera-.\ntional aircraft were available since it had beer\n",

The aircraft avail-\nable, therefore, were mainly trainers which\nwere not easy to send back to Japan. In all,\nthe enemy had, for the defence of Malaya,\nSumatra and Java, approximately 800 service-\nable aircraft all of which, in the last resort,\nwere to be used as Tokkoki (special attacker\nsuicide aircraft). -\n\n454. On D-Day, the enemy planned that\nthere should be no daylight sorties whatever\nowing to the difficulty in providing sufficient\nfighter cover to break through the British\nfighter defences. About 50 to 60 suicide sorties\nwere to be made at twilight with a fighter\nescort of 30 to 40 aircraft. The suicides were\nto fly in flights of about 5 aircraft and all\nattacks were to be concentrated on shipping.\nEven if balloons were used by the Allied con-\nvoys no other method of attack than that of\nsuicide attack was considered feasible. Ground\ntargets were also to be ignored and no fighter\ndefence put up against R.AF. bomber\nattacks. Once the Japanese fighters had ful-\nfilled their escort tasks to the suicide aircraft\nthey, in turn, were to be used as suicide air-\ncraft themselves since there were not enough\naircraft to use for both purposes.\n\n455. One Japanese source of information, as\nthe result of interrogation, was extremely\nrevealing. This source declared that the whole\nof the aircraft available to the Japanese for the\ndefence of Malaya against the Allied invasion\nwould, as the result of the mass suicide attack\npolicy, “have been knocked out in about a\nweek ”.\n\nDirect attack on Mainland not Expected.\n\n456. Following upon the Allied victory in\nBurma, and the capture of Rangoon in May,\nthe Japanese expected attacks by the Allies\non the Andamans, Nicobars, Mergui and\nPuket in August or September, with the main\nattack on Malaya coming at the end of\nOctober or nearly in November.\n\n457. As soon as the airfields around Ran-\ngoon had been made serviceable by the Allies,\nthe Japanese expected there would be a pro-\ngramme of softening-up attacks on Japanese\nbases by R.A. aircraft, with some 200\nbomber sorties and 200 escorting fighter sorties\ndaily. The enemy intended to put up little\nopposition on air attacks against Mergui, the\nNicobars or Andamans, while no defensive\nfighter sorties were to be flown against the\nR.A-F. softening-up attacks unless Singapore\nitself were attacked.\n\n458. A direct landing on the mainland of\nMalaya was not anticipated at the outset.\nInstead it was expected that the Allies would\nwork gradually south, during which time there\nwould be consolidation and the systematic\nbuilding up of bases. In this connection, it is\ninteresting to note that the Japanese considered\nany landing in the Puket area (an operation\nwhich we had earlier planned and then aban-\ndoned after the fall of Rangoon) would have\nproved exceedingly dangerous for them, as\nthe short range of the available Japanese fighter\naircraft would have made it most difficult to\noppose a landing there. The area of Port\nSwettenham on the Peninsula, it was believed,\nwould not be reached until the end of 1945.\n\n459. As “ Zipper” was planned for Septem-\nber, and would undoubtedly have taken place\n\n2163,\n\non that date but for the cessation of hostilities,\nit is evident that the dispositions by the Japan-\nese for counteracting the Allied invasion would\nhave been lamentably behind schedule.\n\nJapanese Build up of Suicide Aircraft.\n\n460. Taking into account the enemy’s limited\naircraft resources, the Japanese air strategy, on\npaper, was quite logically prepared.\n\n461. In February, a little more than six\nmonths before surrender came, the Japanese\nSouthern Area Army in South East Asia was\ninformed by Tokio that there must be a change\nin air strategy in the Southern Area. The High\nCommand had visualised that, before long, the\nSouthern Area (French Indo-China, Siam,\nMalaya, Burma and Netherland East Indies)\nwould be almost entirely cut off from the\nEmpire and would have to develop their own\nair defence from an already diminishing air\nforce in that area.\n\n462. Training was accordingly speeded up,\nand all training aircraft and some operational\nand second line aircraft were ultimately modi-\nfied to carry bombs.:\n\n463. As far back as February, 1945, the\nJapanese had already had some experience in\nthe use of suicide attacks in the Philippines\ncampaign and had seen how effective these\nsuicide attacks could be against concentrations\nof shipping and, in particular, against large\nbattleships and carriers.\n\n464. It was the eventual plan of the Japan-\nese, once the Allied invasion of Malaya had\nstarted, to use all their aircraft (first line, train-\ning and transport) as suicide aircraft against\nAllied shipping and then continue to fight on\nthe land without an air force.\n\n465. In the Southern Area, all Japanese air-\ncraft were widely dispersed over the vast areas\nof Malaya, Sumatra and Java, while airfields\nwere, in many instances, poor in condition. To\neffect this concentration of aircraft in Malaya,\nSumatra and Java in preparation for the Allied\ninvasion of Malaya, the Japanese had left Siam\nand French Indo-China almost bare of aircraft,\nexcept for some trainers, and it had not been\nthought possible to transfer to Malaya.\n\nNo Shortage of Suicide Pilots.\n\n466. It seemed that there was no shortage\nof pilots in the Southern Area to man Japanese\nsuicide aircraft, and that Major-General\nKitagawa, G.OL., 55th Air Training Division\ncould, on his own admission, have called on\n2,000 pilots for the 8/900 suicide aircraft at\nhis disposal. On the other hand, few had any\noperational experience and consisted of training\ninstructors and student pilots with little more\nthan 100 hours flying. It was from these that\nonly the best were selected as suicide pilots.\nHere, however, an exceedingly interesting and\nimportant factor must be noted. This speciak\nattack corps of suicide pilots was made up of\nardent volunteers. They had determination to\nproceed to their doom elated in the thought\nthat they were dying for their Emperor.\n\nMajor Factors Overlooked by Japanese.\n\n467. The Japanese considered that they\nwould have been able to defeat the Allies’ first\nattempt at landing in Malaya by the use of\ntheir suicide aircraft, but considered that when\nthe second attempt at landing was made by the:\n",

I refute the Japanese contention that\nthe first attempt at landing by the Allies would\nhave met with reverse. On impartial examina-\ntion of the facts made available by the Japanese\nafter surrender, there were several major factors\nwhich the Japanese most decidedly over-\nlooked. Briefly these factors were :—\n\n() No attacks were to have been made by\nJapanese suicide aicraft until dusk on D-Day,\nthus giving our air forces taking part in the\nlarge scale invasion of Malaya at least twelve\nhours to neutralise, as they would have done,\nJapanese aircraft in the Penang/North\nSumatra area.\n\n_ i) R.ALF, Intelligence had estimated that\n\n- 175 Japanese first line aircraft would be\nimmediately available in Malaya and\nSumatra. Of this number, only 20 were\nthought to be’ bombers, and 120 fighters—\nthe remainder being reconnaissance and\nfloatplanes.\n\nThe general preparation of all the trainer\n‘units in these areas for suicide attacks was\nwell known to the R.A.F., and the estimated\nnumber available in Malaya and Sumatra\nwas 245 in Malaya and 20 in Sumatra. The\nestimated number of trainer aircraft in Java\nwas 346.\n\nBy early September, the intended move of\nthe Japanese trainer,aircraft in Java to air-\nfields in North Sumatra and Central Malaya\n\nhad only just got under way, so that it seems\nfairly certain that many of these trainer air-\ncraft would never have been able to leave\nJava, as the Japanese had quite overlooked\nthe Allied threat by our air forces established\nin the Cocos Islands which had started opera-\n. tions in August.\n\nii) It was unlikely that any reinforce-\nments of aircraft could have been withdrawn\nfrom French Indo-China and Siam. In any\nevent, the numbers and types of aircraft\navailable from that source were negligible—\n\n+ a fact borne out on the entry of the R.A.F.\ninto French Indo-China during the course of\noccupation after the surrender.\n\n(iv) Without exception the Japanese\nofficers interrogated after surrender were well\n\n. aware of the fact that their communications\nwere so unreliable that no High Command\n\nsuch as 3rd Air Army could have hoped to\ncontrol operations once “Zipper” had\n\n_ started. Decisions, it should be noted, were\n\n- to have been left to subordinate commanders\n\n« and even to unit.commanding officers. This\n\n‘ undoubtedly would have meant a great deal\nof wasted effort.\n\n(v) The Japanese had planned to rely on\nair reconnaissance for advance information\non “ Zipper” and the location of targets for\n\n*+suicide attacks in the preliminary stages of\nthe invasion. They were so short of aircraft\nfor this essential commitment, however, that\nit would have been exceedingly difficult for\nthem to spot and hold any of the Allied\nForces. Indeed, it is more likely that com-\nplete surprise would have veen achieved on\nD-Day ‘by the R.A.F. units taking part in\n“Zipper” and that large numbers of\nJapanese aircraft would most certainly have\nbeen .destroyed on the ground.\n\noo\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 195i\n\n. {vi) Lastly, the Japanese Air Force had\nanticipated a breathing space between the\nair attacks on the Penang area and the\nattacks on Singapore. It is doubtful, how-\never, if they could have withdrawn and re-\ndeployed many of their aircraft from that\narea as well as from Sumatra without our\nknowledge through superior photographic\nreconnaissance.\n\nMAINTENANCE.\n\nMeeting the needs of overhaul in face of\nadvancing front\n\n469. The Maintenance Organisation in South\nEast Asia was faced with two major issues\nduring the period May to September, 1945,\nfollowing upon the re-occupation of Rangoon\nand, later, the sudden termination of hostilities\nin August.\n\n470. The influencing factors were :—— ‘\n\n(a) The need for a re-orientation of the\n‘Maintenance Organisation as the result of\nthe battle front having moved further away\nfrom the static repair and overhaul bases\nwhich had been built up in India.\n\n(6) The termination of Lend/Lease byt\nAmerica to the United Nations following\nupon the surrender of Japan, this causing\nfacute difficulties in providing replacements\n‘and spares for American types of aircraft\ndn operational use within the Command.\n\n71. On the one hand, the re-organisation of\nmaintenance to meet the needs of the advanc-\ning front was not an insuperable task and soon\ntighted itself once necessary changes had been\neffected, but the denial of spares, on the cessa-\ntion of Lend/Lease, was distinctly serious as\nthere were some 1,600 American aircraft and\ngliders in India and South East Asia for which\nspares were absolutely essential.\n\n72. With the arrival in Southern Burma of\nthe victorious Air Forces in May, it was con-\nsidered that a reversion from the existing cen-\ntralised system of maintenance in the Theatre\nshould be initiated. The six months rapid ad-\nvance down through Burma had been a testing\ntime for every branch of maintenance. Burma\ncould not be compared to the great flat desert\nstretches of the Middle East. Transport of\nthe mobile units negotiated appalling roads\nafter an equally difficult journey from India. Aé\none time, indeed, it was doubtful if transport\nwould last untit Rangoon was reached.\n\n473. These difficulties must be emphasised\nbecause it was to this mobile ground organisa-\ntion, embracing Repair and Salvage Units, Air\nStores Parks, Motor Transport, Maintenance\nUnits and Motor Transport Light Repair\nUnits, that the Air Forces in Burma were tied\nand were fully depndent upon for their servic-\ning if not their very existence during opera-\ntions.\n\n474. The re-organisation of Maintenance\nwhich took place after our arrival in Southern\nBurma can be summarised as follows:—\n\n(a) The Forward Repair Depots in the\noperational areas were abolished and Sal-\nvage units built up. .\n\n(6) Group Commanders were invested\nwith the responsibility of repair and overhaul\nof their squadron’s aircraft.\n",

Re-organisation was necessary for yet\nanother important reason. The great distance\nwhich, at that time, obtained between opera-\ntional areas in Burma and bases in India,\nprecluded the return of short range aircraft to\nMaintenance Units for major inspections and\nengine changes. Thus, it became necessary to\ntransfer the responsibility for this maintenance\nwork to the squadrons and other flying units.\nOwing to the different problems, including.\nbeaching facilities, involved in carrying out\nmajor inspections on flying boats, this mainten-\nance continued to be centralised at Koggala in.\nCeylon.\n\n476. Hitherto, all repair and salvage units\nin the Command were controlled by Head-\nquarters, Base Air Forces through Nos. 222,\n226 and 230 Groups on a regional basis. In the\nre-organisation no change in policy, however,\nwas effected in the case of units under 222\nGroup, Ceylon, and 226 Group, whose area\nextended _ throughout India, but excluded\nBengal and Assam. The R. & S.U.s. on the\nother hand, had, of necessity, to be fully mobile\nand to move with the units they supported.\n\nA7T. When the re-organisation was put into\neffect the establishments of flying units were\nincreased by 25 per cent. in order to cover air-\ncraft undergoing major inspections at units.\nThis increase was effected by feeding in addi-.\ntional aircraft from the R. & 8.U.s. as and when\nthe squadron or unit became due for a major\ninspection.\n\n478. The base at Rangoon carried heavy res-\nponsibilities—not only for the continuance of\noperations during the mopping up period in\nBurma, but in preparing its organisation to\nmeet the coming operations against Malaya.\n\n479, A Forward Equipment Unit and a For-\nward Repair Unit were maintained in Ran-\ngoon to support the Air Forces in Southern\nBurma and to act as backing, if necessary, for\nthe “Zipper” forces which would deploy\nthrough Southern Burma bases. The pressure\non maintenance at this crucial period is illus-\ntrated by the amount of work tackled. During\nthe months from May to August, the Repair\nand Salvage Units returned to service 830 air-\ncraft and dismantled a further 420 which had\nbeen written off. The heaviest month, was\nMay, after the entry into Rangoon, when 300\naircraft were repaired—an indication of the\nstrenuous use to which they had been sub-\njected during the last stage of the lightning\nadvance to Rangoon.\n\n480. It was thought that the Repair and\nSalvage Unit in Rangoon would build up a\nfairly extensive repair depot, but with the\ncapitulation of the Japanese in August this\nwas no longer necessary, and personnel were\nswitched to Singapore to re-occupy and build\nup the original Repair Depot at Seletar on\nSingapore Island.\n\n(68742)\n\n2165\n\nDifficulties arising from Lend {Lease termin-\nation.\n\n481, President Truman’s announcement of\nthe Surrender of Japan brought with it the de-\nclaration that Lend/Lease to Allied Govern-\nments was at an end except for assistance to\nforces engaged against Japanese who had not\nsurrendered,\n\n482. The repercussions in Air Command,\nSouth East Asia were serious. There was a\nworld-wide shortage of Dakota spares. The\nU.S.A.A.F., however, as a result of the termin-\nation of Lend/Lease had cancelled the pro-\nduction of spares for their earlier Marks 1, II\nand IIT and there were 200 Dakotas included in\nthis range within South East Asia Command.\n\n483. To ascertain the position as it affected\nAir Command, investigation revealed that, ex-\ncluding Dakotas, Expeditors, Thunderbolts and\nCornells, there were some 1,600 American air-\ncraft and gliders in India and South East Asia\nwhich would gradually become unserviceable\nthrough Iack of spares.\n\n484. The Command’s most urgent attention\nat the beginning of September, therefore, was\ndirected with the utmost speed to securing\nalternative arrangements for supply of neces-\nsary spares. In some respects, but by no\nmeans all, the situation was partially alleviated\nby the arrangement reached at Washington that\nthe U.S.A.A.F. would meet, on a cash basis,\nlimited demands in respect of Liberator,\nDakota and Skymaster aircraft only. No stock\ndemands, however, were permitted. The literal\ninterpretation of this ruling was that a demand\ncould not be raised until an aircraft was\nactually grounded or until repair was held up.\nA period of from eight to ten weeks also must\nelapse before the necessary parts could be\nobtained from America.\n\n485. What became quite certain was that\nno demand whatsoever would be met in other\ntypes of aircraft, which included the follow-\ning :—\n\nThunderbolt. Cornell.\nSentinel. Vengeance.\nArgus. Catalina.\nExpeditor. Harvard.\n\n486. It was clear, therefore, that as stocks\nfor any particular item became exhausted, so\nalso would the repair of aircraft, their engines,\nand associated equipment automatically cease.\nCannibalisation, or robbing another aircraft,\nwas of very limited value as the bulk of the\nspares required were rendered necessary by\nwear and tear or by climatic deterioration.\n\n487. In a signal to the Air Member for\nSupply and Organisation, I stated that if we\ndid not get the essential parts, I could foresee\nus falling down badly on our agreed commit-\nments, and urged that dollars should be made\navailable for purchase of our essential require-\nments for replacement arising from wear and\ntear.\n\n488. But the difficulties in England over the\ntermination of Lend/Lease were greater than\nit was at first realised. There were dollar\nquotas to be considered, and in this connection\nit was learned that demands on available\ndollars were extremely heavy, especially for\nfoodstuffs. The situation in respect of air-\ncraft spares and replacements, therefore, was\n\nE\n",

REGIMENT OPERATIONS.\n\nA record of achievements in the South East\nAsia Command.\n\n489. In the various campaign stages of the\nwar in South East Asia I have been left\nin no doubt whatsoever about the usefulness,\nefficiency and fine example of that most junior\nof all our forces—the R.A.F. Regiment.\n\n490. The RAF. Regiment adequately\ncarried out the task of close defence of air-\nfields in Burma and in other operational areas\nin South-East Asia.\n\n491. I have it on record from one of my\nGroup Commanders who moved with\nFourteenth Amy all the wa through Burma,\nthat he considered it probable that the Group\ncould not have occupied air strips as far for-\nward as they did—with consequently better\nair support for the Army—had he not been\nconfident that the R.A.F, Regiment could have\nmaintained the necessary security.\n\n492. In South East Asia the R.A.F. Regi-\nment proved itself a force capable of carrying\nout more than the tasks which its originators\nclaimed the Regiment could accomplish. It\nwas not a force of men dressed up as guards\nand picqueted around some airfield or supply\ndump with guns propped in their hands. These\nmen were so trained in the art and strategy\nof ground defence and of jungle warfare, that\nthey were able to undertake with success\ncounter measures against Japanese infiltration\nparties who might set themselves up near the\nperimeter of some airfield and constitute a\nmenace uatil hunted down and destroyed.\n\n493. When the advance through Burma\nbegan in January, 1945, there were ten Field\nSquadrons, seven A.A. Squadrons and seven\nRegiment Wing Headquarters working with\nthe Tactical Air Forces. On the capture of\nRangoon in May, 1945, these had been in-\ncreased to fourteen Field Squadrons, nine A.A.\nSquadrons and eight Wing Headquarters.\n\n494. For the D-Day operations plazined ‘for\nthe assault on Malaya, the Regiment was also\nscheduled to play a prominent part. Five\nRegimental Wings of nearly 2,500 officers and\nmen, made up of nine Field Squadrons and five\nA.A. Squadrons were available. One A.A.\nSquadron had been brought out of the Cocos\nIslands, where its twenty millimetre Hispano\ncannons had given protection to the heavy\nbomber and transport airfield there.\n\nDefence of Airfields and Mopping Up.\n\n495. When it is considered that few\nJapanese were ever taken prisoner in Burma,\nelecting to face death rather than capture,\nand that the principal task of the R.AF. Regi-\nment was to protect our air strips rather than\nto make enemy captives, the effort of the\nRegiment between January and May, 1945, in\nall forms of service was exceedingly high.\nWhile operating at seven strips during that\nperiod, the A.A. Squadrons succeeded in\ndestroying one enemy aircraft and registering\nhits on three others out of a total of nine\nenemy aircraft attacking ‘these particular\n\nSUPPLEMENT. to tHe LONDON .GAZETTE; 19 APRIL, 1951\n\n496. The most outstanding episode of the\nR.AF. Regiment’s service in this theatre was\nthe assistance they gave in the defence of\nMeiktila airfield. It was essential to comb the\nairfield and its environs each morning for\nsnipers before permitting aircraft to land.\nEvery gully, fox-hole or other feasible hiding\nplace of a sniper had to be examined. The\npatrols started just after daybreak and took\nalmost two hours to complete. It was thorough\nand effective, but the only sure method of\nclearing the area of the enemy, to ensure the\nsafety of our aircraft.\n\n497. In mopping up isolated parties of\nJapanese in Burmese villages at the time of\nthe advance on Rangoon, certain umits of\nthe R.A.F, Regiment gave considerable assist-\nance to Civil Affairs Officers and also helped\nin the clearing and disposal of mortar bombs,\nbooby-traps, mines and anti-tank traps. Ex-\ntensive searches, including patrols up rivers,\nwere also carried out by the Regiment in their\nefforts to arrest wanted and known collabora-\ntors and to enforce the surrendering of illegally\nheld arms and ammunition. The river patrols\non these occasions were necessary owing to\nthe difficulties of communication and the nature\nof the country. During March and April, for\nexample, one Field Squadron covered an area\nof 2,600 square miles, visited or “raided”\n250 villages, arrested 100 Japanese collabora-\ntors and recovered 26 rifles. Large quantities\nof ammunition of British and Japanese make\nwere also recovered, together with clothing,\nequipment, parachutes and rations.\n\nThe Occupation of Singapore.\n\n498. In the protection of newly captured\nairfields and the guarding of vital radar sites\nonce the assault on Malaya had begun, the\nR.AF, Regiment would bave been indispen-\nsable to the Air Force and could have been\nrelied upon to fulfil its task thoroughly and\nwell. Even in the peaceful occupation of\nSingapore, units of the Regiment, within 24\nhours, were maintaining the security of Kal-\nlang, Changi, Seletar and Tengah airfields—\none of which had three hundred police in\npeacetime.\n\n499. Up country in Malaya, during the early\ndays of occupation by our forces, a squadron\nof the R.AF, Regiment sent out a patrol\ninto one of the thickly wooded areas and suc-\nceeded in recovering 600 gallons of petrol\nfrom a party of Malays and Chinese.\n\n500. On September 10th, two days before\nthe official surrender ceremony at Singapore,\nNo. 1329 Wing R.A.F. Regiment, with four\nField Squadrons, arrived at Penang and took\nover the entire garrison duties from the Royal\nMarines. On the day following it was decided\nthat the Regiment should also occupy Port\nButterworth and Prai area, Province Wellesley,\nas part of the Penang commitment.\n\n501. If the RA.F. Regiment in South East\nAsia. had done nothing more than provide\nvital protection for our airfields, the record\nof its achievements would still read with com-\nmendable credit. That it was able to perform\nfurther additional services and maintain a\nsmartness and discipline which called forth\npraise from Army and Navy ‘alike, demon-\nstrates the value of the Regiment as an ad-\njunct to the Royal Air Force.

Following the reconquest of Burma in\nMay, the future trend of the Command's\nadministrative development was largely influ-\nenced by the following factors: —\n\n@ Disbandment of the integrated Eastern\nAir Command Headquarters on Ist June,\n1945 and the withdrawal of the United States\nArmy Air Forces from the Command.\n\n(ii) Reorganisation of Headquarters,\nRA-F., Burma, on the assumption of full\n\noperational and administrative control of the\n\nAir Forces in Burma. :\n\n_ Gii) Administrative planning in anticipa-\n‘tion of the forthcoming operations in South\nEast Asia associated principally with the\nre-conquest of Malaya and the build-up of\nthe strategic base of Singapore.\n\n(iv) Planning for the reorganisation of the\nCommand, subsequent to the re-occupation\n“of Singapore.\n\n505. It ‘was not unnatural, on the defeat\nof Germany, that attention should be focussed\nsuddenly upon the impressive array of air\npower promised for South East Asia in Phase\nTI of the war. Not only was the number of\nsquadrons expected to be increased, but more\nmodern and more powerfully armed aircraft\nwere-envisaged. There were expectations too,\nof ‘plentiful supplies of spares and ancillary\nequipment calculated to abrogate, for the\nduration of the Far Eastern war, the parsimony\nof indigenous industrial resources. South East\nAsia, it was confidently hoped, would achieve\navhigher place in the list of priorities as from\nVE-Day. But this illusion was soon shattered.\nAt the beginning of June it was officially re-\nvealed ‘that the Pacific’ Tiger Force and post-\nwar-evénts in Europé would take priority over\nSouth East Asia’s dernands. The decision was\noccasioned ‘not:'so much-by the shortage. of\nequipment as by- the global deficiencies in ship-\nping-and manpower which implied that drastic\ncuts in the Phase IL Target of 116 squadrons\n\n2167\n\nwould have to be accepted. It became evident,\ntherefore, that the basis for planning was not\nwhat the Command was entitled to expect, but\nwhat was actually available.\n\n506. In spite of these difficulties—and they\nhad been many in South East Asia—it was\nnecessary to cut the administrative cloth to\nsuit the operational coat. A target of 87\nsquadrons which, it was reckoned, would have\nto meet the air effort, both for “ Zipper” and\n“ Mailfist ” and other commitments, was there-\nfore accepted.\n\n507. Although these factors did not seriously\naffect Operation “Zipper”, the enforced\neconomy would have had some bearing upon\nthe final assault on Singapore itself and upon\noperations contemplated early in 1946 into\nSiam, had the war with Japan continued. Other\ntasks too, included action on the development\nof the air base in Southern Burma and the\nCocos Islands, both closely associated with\n“ Zipper ” and the redeployment of the strategic\nforces, once heavy bomber bases further east\nand south east became available.\n\nImportant Changes After Fall of Rangoon.\n508. The ease with which Rangoon fell\ncaused future administrative planning to pro-\nceed along more ambitious lines. Before\nfurther operations could be undertaken, how-\never, it was necessary to have a reshuffle of\noffensive and defensive units ; introduce a re-\nvised maintenance policy and new equipment\nto meet conditions of the Malay Peninsula ;\nto withdraw many air forces from Burma for\nrest, refit and concentration for “ Zipper”.\n\n509. The most important change in Com-\nmand organisation at this time was the de-\nparture of the American Air Forces which\nwere withdrawn from the Theatre as from Ist\nJune, 1945. The disintegration of the British\nand American Air Forces in Burma involved\nthe disbandment of Headquarters, Eastern Air\nCommand, and the transfer of the Air Staff\nfrom that Headquarters to HQ. RAF,\nBurma, which then became an independent\nR.A.F. Command under H.Q. Air Command,\nSouth East Asia.\n\n510. A. series of other changes was\nbrought about as a result of the revised respon-\nsibilities of Headquarters, R.A.F. Burma,\nupon disbandment of Eastern Air Command.\nOperational control of all R.A.F. formations\nand units, formerly under Eastern Air Com-\nmand, was taken over by H.Q. R.A-F., Burma.\n\n511. The title of “Strategic Air Force”,\nwhich had included British and American\nsquadrons, ceased to be used with effect from\nIst June, 1945, and No. 231 Group, R.AF.,,\ncontinued strategic operations alone. In the\nsame way the disintegration of Combat Cargo\nTask Force was carried out and, on the de-\nparture of the American squadrons, No. 232\nGroup took over the full operational control\nof all. RAF. transport units in the\nALF.S.EA. area.\n\n- 512. Yet another important change at this\ntime was the reorganisation of the R.AF.\nElement of H.Q. Photographic Reconnaissance\nForce as a Wing (No. 347 Wing), after the with-\ndrawal of the American Forces. Included in\nthe wing’s establishment was No. 1 Photo-\ngraphic Interpretation Detachment. “The object\n",

Throughout the campaign in Burma,\nHeadquarters 230 Group thad been charged\nwith the control of all maintenance and stor-\nage units in the area of Headquarters, R.AF.,\nBurma, but the Group itself was under the\ndirect control of the C.M.O., Headquarters,\nBase Air Forces. This arrangement was un-\nsatisfactory because it meant that the R.AF.\noperational commander in Burma did not\nhave complete control of his maintenance\norganisation. It was therefore decided to dis-\nband No. 230 Group and to absorb the Main-\ntenance Staff of the Group into Headquarters,\n\nBurma, with effect from 15th May,\nbas “The units tnder No. 230 Group were,\nat the same time, placed directly under the\noperational groups they served, and the staffs\nof these groups were increased to cope with\nthis commitment by the addition of some of\nthe posts thrown up from the disbandment\nof No. 230 Group.\n\nWithdrawal of 224 Group in Preparation for\n\n“ Zipper”.\n\n514. The main assault on Malaya, scheduled\nfor early September, made necessary the with-\ndrawal of No. 224 Group and units from the\nArakan and Burma.\n\n515. This was started early.in May. The\nwithdrawal was handled directly between Head-\nquarters, R.A.F., Burma, and Headquarters,\nBase Air Forces. As from Ist June, 1945,\nH.Q. 224 Group was placed directly under the\ncontrol of H.Q. Base Air Forces for the pur-\n\npose of mounting operation “Zipper”, but\nthe A.O.C. 224 Group and his staff retained\nthe right to visit all units during mounting\nand to advise on all matters concerning the\n\n* training of units for their various tasks. Head-\nquarters 224 Group undertook the responsi-\nbility for force planning.\n\n516. It was decidedly unfortunate, if not\nserious, that owing to the acute shortage of\nshipping, the withdrawal of units from Burma\ndid not go off as smoothly as might have\nbeen expected. Many of the units, indeed.\ncame out of the Arakan with no equipment\nor M.T., while the equipment and M.T. of\nother units which arrived in India lay on\nthe docks awaiting the arrival of the units\nfor many weeks, When units ultimately reached\nIndia they were deployed on airfields which\nhad been prepared for them, but owing to the\nnon-arrival of equipment or personnel, the\ncommencement of training was badly delayed.\n\nRe-organisation of Air Command in 1945-46.\n\n517. In view of the extension of the respon-\nsibilities of Air Command, South East Asia,\ntowards Singapore and beyond, the future\norganisation of formations- in the Command\nrequired consideration.\n\n518. The principal factors which necessi-\ntated reorganisation were as follows :—\n\n(a) Mopping up operations of the enemy\nin Burma would continue for some time,\nbut, so far as the Air Forces were concerned,\nthese could be undertaken by one composite\ngroup (No. 221).\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\n(6) Since No. 224 Group had been with-\ndrawn from Burma for participation in\nOperation “ Zipper”, the Group would come\ndirectly under the operational control of\nHeadquarters, Air Command, during the\nnext stage of the Campaign.\n\n{c) The Heavy Bomber Group (No. 231)\nwas no longer suitably located in Burma. It\nwould be based at the Cocos Islands for\n“ Zipper ” support.\n\n. _ @) Photographic Reconnaissance, Special\nDuties and Air Supply Operations would\nno longer be concentrated on Burma, but\nwould be required in widely separated\nareas. This called for direct control from\nthe Headquarters of the Air Command of\nthe groups engaged in these duties.\n\n(e) The above factors reduced the respon-\nsibilities of H.Q. R.A.F. Burma, which had\nhitherto controlled several functional\ngroups.\n\n(f) The altered military situation had also\ncalled for the move of Headquarters, Allied\n‘Land Forces to Kandy, while Headquarters,\nSupreme Allied Command, together with the\nHeadquarters of the three Commanders-in-\nChief, would move to Singapore at the\nearliest practicable date.\n\n(g) The 10th U.S.A.A.F. had been moved\nto China and. Eastern Air Command dis-\nsolved. At the same time the R.A-F. Target\nForce for South East Asia in Phase II was\nnot to be as large as originally planned.\n519. These factors, it was considered, re-\n\nquired revision of previous operational plans,\n\nand would enable a considerable reduction of\nplanned overheads to be effected in Head-\nquarters and Administrative Services,\n\n520. On the fall of Singapore the following\nmoves were scheduled to take place:—\n\n(a) Headquarters, Air Command would\nmove there in company with Headquarters,\nSupremé Allied Commander, H.Q. Allied\nLand Forces and part of the E.LF. H.Q.\n\n(b) Headquarters, No. 222 Group would\nmove from Ceylon to Singapore and under-\ntake responsibilities in that area similar to\nthose undertaken by Mediterranean Allied\nCoastal Forces or Air Defences, Eastern\nMediterranean.\n\n(c) Headquarters, No. 231- Group would\nmove to Singapore and be possibly em-\nployed either as a heavy Bomber Group\nHeadquarters, the Headquarters of a Task\nForce, or be disbanded.\n\n(d) Headquarters, No. 224 Group would\nalso move to Singapore area and remain\na composite group, being modelled as neces-\nsary to undertake further operations for the\nteconquest of Sumatra, Java and Borneo.\n521. A small Headquarters, R.A.F. Ceylon,\n\nwas also planned to take over area respon-\n\nsibilities for :—\n\n@ Ceylon.\n\n(b) Island Flying-boat, Emergency Land-\ning Grounds and Met. Stations to the south.\n\n(c) Cocos for administrative services.\n\n522. Although the future strategy for South\nEast Asia Command was not yet d\nmaking it impossible to forecast reliably _ for\nthe future deployment of forces, it was con-\nsidered that the reorganisation as _—\nwould meet all the probable Tequirements”\n",

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\nTHE MANPOWER SITUATION IN\n“SOUTH EAST ASIA\n\n523. The energetic stepping up of operations\nin the Pacific directly against Japan, brought\nabout a wide variety of circumstances which\ncombined to deny Air Command, South East\nAsia that priority in personnel which the\nCommand had expected would be forthcoming.\n\n524. Demands in Europe and the Pacific for\nshipping ; the sudden announcement, preced-\ning the General Election, to reduce the Over-\nseas Tour for Army personnel by approxi-\nmately 10 per cent; the operation of the Re-\nlease Scheme, and the priority accorded to the\nPacific “Tiger Force”, all adversely reacted\nupon Air Command, South East Asia.\n\n525. In May, 1945, the establishment and\nstrength of the Command for British personnel\nwere as follows: —\n\nSurplus}\nEstab. Strength Deficiencies\nGround Officers 8,103 . 7,573 — 530\nOther Ranks ... 105,470 110,459 4,989 = —\n\n526. The 64 per cent. deficiency in ground\nofficers affected principally the branches in\nAdministration, Code and Cypher, Tech. (EB)\nand Catering. On the other hand, the position\nas regards airmen was that the technical trades\ncarried a surplus of 7,100, whilst the trade of\nClerk G.D. was deficient by not less than 36\nper cent., equipment assistants by 20 per cent.\nand cooks by 28 per cent.\n\n527. By September, 1945, the position had\nso deteriorated that an overall deficiency was\nshown, although certain trades continued to\n\ncarry a surplus. The strength of personnel\nwas as follows: —\nSurplus]\nEstab. Strength —_ Deficiencies\nGround Officers 8,116 7,525 _- 591\nOther Ranks ... 123,466 114,419 — 9,047\n\n528. The 7 per cent. deficiency in ground\nofficers was spread over a great many branches.\nPhysical Fitness carried a deficiency of 36 per\ncent. and Code and Cypher a deficiency of\n22 per cent.\n\n529. The overall 8 per cent. deficiency in\nother ranks, however, clouded the very large\ndeficiencies carried in the following trades: —\n\ner cent.\n\ndeficiency.\n‘Clerks GD. ... we we 43\nClerks Acctg. wee ae 36\nCooks .... ae ae ae 32\nDriver MT. ... wee ne 18\nEquip. Asst. ... wee « 36\n\n. 530. The Command had clearly to take\nmeasures to rectify this weakness if it was to\nfunction administratively, and compulsory mis-\nemployment of surplus tradesmen and aircrew\nwas therefore introduced. It was fortunate\nthat, on the defeat of Japan, an opportunity\nwas offered for a large scale reduction of estab-\nlishments and disbandments to begin.\n\n531. The Release Scheme, coming so soon\nafter: the cessation of the European War, re-\nacted very materially against the Command.\nIt brought further grave losses in the difficult\ntrades at a time when the efficient administration\nof the Command was essential for the prose-\ncution of the war against Japan.\n\n.2169\n\n532. An even greater disadvantage was the\nfact that it withdrew from the Command the\nmore senior and experienced personnel. Con-\nsequently, while the position in a branch or\ntrade as far as actual personnel were con-\ncerned, may have appeared satisfactory on\npaper, it was not always so in actual perform-\nance of work, and efficiency thereby suffered.\n\nReduction in overseas tour for personnel.\n\n(533. On 6th June, 1945, the War Office\nsuddenly announced a reduction in the overseas\ntour of Army personnel. This factor had every\npromise of producing serious repercussions in\nSouth East Asia, in which either coming opera-\ntions, or morale, or both, might well have been\naffected. The fulfilment of the War Office\nannouncement was rendered virtually impos-\nsible by the Jack of homeward personnel ship-\nping and the congestion in transit camps in\nIndia.\n\n534. To avoid a parallel situation with regard\nto the Air Force in this Command, I signalled\nthe Chief of Staff emphasising that any\nannouncement of a reduction in overseas tour\nfor the Air Force would be premature and im-\npracticable at this juncture.\n\n535. At the same time, I strongly recom-\nmended that shipping and air transport should\nbe found in order to bring into effect, by Ist\nDecember, 1945, a reduction of tour from four\nto three and a half years, for all single officers\nand airmen. This reduction was agreed upon\nin August in principle, but was not fully\nimplemented until December.\n\n536. Between May and September, 1945,\nsome 559 officers and 2,263 airmen left the\nCommand under the Release Scheme. During\nthe same period 2,201 officers and 12,932 air-\nmen were repatriated in addition to those des-\npatched on release.\n\n537. The celebration of V.E.-Day in the\nCommand was a sincere enough occasion for\neveryone, though it was only natural that it\ndid not hold the same high spirit of enthusiasm\nfor those in the East still fighting the last of\nthe remaining Axis powers. The announce-\nment that the Burma Star had been inaugurated\ngave general satisfaction to personnel serving\nin Burma—an award well merited—but person-\nnel in India and Ceylon felt that the burden\nof their overseas service was not sufficiently\nrecognised by the award of the Defence Medal.\n\n538. The postal voting scheme for the\nGeneral Election in July, 1945, was put into\noperation successfully during May and June,\nand ballot papers for personnel in South East\nAsia were flown out from England by trans-\nport aircraft. The papers were given priority\nover all other mails handled by R.A.F. Post\nStaffs. The total number of completed applica-\ntion forms for postal voting received by 25th\nJune at R.A-F. Post Karachi was 33,500. A last\nminute supply of forms to the Cocos Islands,\nwhose original consignment was ‘mislaid in\ntransit, produced satisfactory results.\n\n539. Altogether, a total of 30,013 ballot\npapers was finally forwarded by air to the U.K.\nfrom the Command. .\n",

Japan, in her disastrous war against the\n.Allied Powers, was defeated largely by her own\nmisjudgment—embarking upon a policy of\nexpansion which lengthened too far her lines\nof communication without providing adequ-\nately armed forces for their protection and\nmaintenance.\n\n541. Expansion brought the Japanese, in\ntheir initial flush of success, to the very thres-\nhold of India at a time when the Allies were\nleast prepared to resist her westward march.\n\n542. Defeat for the Japanese in South East\nAsia, I consider, had its begnning in the air\nbattles over the Arakan in late 1943 and the\nopening months of 1944, when Allied air\nsuperiority was obtained.\n\n543, It is my opinion that the cardinal weak-\n“ness in Japan’s war of aggression was un-\ndoubtedly a badly balanced war machine, which\nshowed too heavy a bias in favour of land\nforces, and a much too weak air force, also\nair potentialy\n\n344. Without air support, the J: apanese\nAnny in South East Asia fought a losing battle\nafter Allied air superiority had been won. The\nnumbers actually killed during their campaign\nin Burma were enormous, whilst the number\nthat perished in the jungle will never be\nknown. This Japanese Army provided a grim\nreminder to any Army that embarks upon\noperations without adequate air support.\n\nClose Support operations.\n\n545, According to the Japanese, it is im-\npossible to state definitely which of our Allied\nfighters had the greatest effect morally upon\ntheir ground forces in South East Asia, as each\nfighter had its own characteristics. The effect\nditfered according to the nature of the target\nattacked and the time of the attack, whether\nby day or by night. On an assessment of the\nAllied fighter aircraft individually, however, it\nappears that the enemy considered the Spitfire,\nthe ‘Thunderbolt and the Mustang surpassed\nall others.\n\nFighter, and fighter/bomber offensive opera-\ntions. ‘\n\n546. The effect of the Beaufighter and\nMosquito attacks on Japanese shipping in the\nGulf of Martaban during the early months of\n1945- was such that the enemy stopped move-\nment of shipping by day, and did movements\nonly at night. In this way enemy shipping was\nconserved,\n\n547. On the other hand, the harassing attacks\nthese aircraft carried out on the enemy’s road,\nrail and river transport areas was exceedingly\neffective. While it cost them few casualties\nto. men, the air. attacks, according to the\nJapanese, made troop as well as supply move-\nments virtually impossible. Materials and food,\nthey stated, became difficult to move, and this\nhad a bad effect upon the civilian population.\n\n548. Our policy of surprise raids on the\nenemy’s rear airfields was most effective. In\nthis respect the American fighter attacks on\nthese airfields were not- only effective, ‘but\ngreatly. helped’ to. reduce the - operational\nstrength of the Japanese Army. Air Force.\n\n-SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951\n\nHeavy Bomber Operations. .\n\n549. The heavy bomber attacks which our\naircraft carried out on Rangoon, and on supply\ndumps in the vicinity, cannot be compared, in\neffectiveness, to the heavy air attacks made on\n\n“bridges, railway tracks, marshalling yards and\n\nimportant installations in other enemy ocoupied\nareas. The dumps in the Rangoon area which\nwere targets of attack were, according to the\nenemy, destroyed to some extent, but they did\n\n* not greatly affect Japanese morale. The bomb-\n\ning of Rangoon itself, however, which was\ncontinued for almost a month before the\nenemy’s evacuation, had a marked effect upon\ntheir morale. The effect of the bombings on\nthe civilian population appeared to be small\nbecause only military targets were bombed.\n\n550. Bombing raids on military installations\nin the rear areas were admitted by the\nJapanese to be most effective, and many targets,\nsome highly important to the Japanese war\neffort, were destroyed. The attacks, it appears,\ncould have been even more effective had our\nbombers struck at the targets over a wider\narea, as enemy installations were immediately\ndivided up into sections and scattered once a\ntarget area was hit. .\n\nAir Mining Operations Affect Supply.\n\n551. I consider it exceedingly gratifying, aud\nindeed, interesting, to have it confirmed by\nthe Japanese themselves {bet the isolation ot\nlarge sea transports, as the result of our ai\nmining operations, seriously affected the\nJapanese supply situation. The mines were\nlaid by our aircraft in the Rangoon River and °\noff the Tenasserim and Malayan coasts. The\nsowing of these mines, the Japanese stated,\nwas directly responsible for the sinking of\nimportant supply ships.\n\n552. Our air mining programme, which\nbegan on 21st January, 1945, and was discon-\ntinued on 24th May, 1945, since the stage was\nthen being set finally for the assault on Malaya,\nresulted in a total of 925 mines being dropped\nin the specified areas. The minelaying opera-\ntions were 86.9 successful—only 29 mines being\ndropped foul, and 80 being brought back by\naircraft to base. : . .\n\n553. From a tactical point of view, I was\ninterested to learn that, of all the weapons\nwhich we used against the Japanese in Burma\n-—trockets, machine-guns, cannon, bombs and\nNapalm—the machine-guns had the most effect.\nboth morally and physically, upon their groun\nforces. . ; Lok\n\n554, During the advance of our. ground\ntroops, the feints and dummy -attacks by our\nsupporting aircraft proved very effective in\nkeeping the’ Japanese under“ cover—a. highly\nimportant factor when troops are storming\nstrongly-held positions. Lo\n\n555. Close support by the Japanese Arm:\nAir Force was negligible. Its development\nwas dependent upon adequate air strength, arid\nas the Japanese Army. Air Force gradually\ndwindled away to nothing,.close support -for\ntheir ground forces was therefore impracticable.\n-_ 556. While the Japanese also. used Visual\nControl Posts to indicate’ targets -to their. ait-\ncraft, shortage of wireless equipment <greatly\nhindered.them in putting: through. demands. for\nair support.

Burma proved how an Army could\nmarch for a thousand miles through some of\nthe worst country in the world so long as air\nsupply was guaranteed by our retaining air\nsuperiority and having adequate-air transport.\n\n558. There is no doubt that the Japanese\nfully appreciated how vitally important Allied\nair supply was to the success of our operations.\nThey confessed that all means possible were\nused to interfere with Allied air supply, but,\ndue to the small size of their Air Force, they\nfailed in their efforts.\n\n559. Burma, I consider, has given us the\nclassic example of an Army in the field existing\non air supply, and the technique evolved from\nthese air supply operations must surely com-\nmand serious attention.\n\nLessons which emerged in South East Asia.\n560. The war in South Hast Asia, has\nimmeasurably enriched our experience in air\noperations in the East ; quickened our percep-\ntion to the dangers of a purely static defence\n\nsystem for these Empire territories, and shown.\nhow essential is air power for future defence.\n\nThe need for greater squadron mobility.\n\n561. One of the most noticeable features of\nour operations in South East Asia was the\nclumsy and inadequate method which we had\nbeen forced to employ to maintain the mobility\nof our squadrons, their Personnel and\nequipment.\n\n562. This implies no reflection on the ground\nstaff and maintenance organisation; who\nsucceeded in achieving good results with the\nequipment and facilities available when moving\nthe squadrons forward, month after month,\nthrough a country devoid of proper communi-\ncations and faced with flooding during the\nmonsoon, when roads turned into quagmires.\n\n563. But a squadron working in support of\nfront-line troops must have greater mobility\n\n2171\n\nto enable its ground organisation to move to\nits next base, and not find itself on some narrow\ninadequate road, choked for miles ahead with\nslow moving army transport.\n\n564. It is on record that during April, 1945,\nwhen over 80 R.A.F. units moved forward in\nBurma to new bases in keeping with the over-\nall plan of advance, one R.A.F. wing, having\ninsufficient road transport, had to use bullock\ncarts. Against this, there is the more logical\ninstance of another R.A.F. wing which moved\nfrom Akyab to Rangoon by air, taking with\nit all its equipment and personnel and leaving\nbehind only M.T., since it was picking up a\nnew allotment of vehicles at its destination.\n\n565. With so many moves by squadrons in\nthe forward areas—many going ahead with the\nbare minimum of staff to keep aircraft operd-'\ntional pending the arrival of the remainder\nof their ground personnel bringing up essential\nequipment—squadrons often found themselves\nseparated from a proportion of their servicing\nechelons for’ several days due to lack of trang-\nport. Until the full staff of the echelons\narrived, an enormous amount of work was\nthrown upon ground crew, since aircraft at the\ntime were being pressed into service in support\n\n‘of the advance and had to be loaded with\n\nbombs and with ammunition.\nneeded daily servicing.\n\n566. This, I consider, is one of the moit\nimportant lessons which emerged from opera-\ntions in South East Asia. Experience has\nshown that Air Power, in the movement of its\nground organisations, must have infinitely\ngreater mobility in future, and be ait-lifted by\nits own transports.\n\n.
