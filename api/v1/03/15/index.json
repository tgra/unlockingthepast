            "description": "29. The result of the successful establishment of Tripoli as an advanced base was that the build-up of Eighth Army for its further ad- vance was carried through. Both the 3oth Corps and the roth Corps were brought up to strength, and by 3rd March, 11,318 reinforce- ments had been despatched from the Delta as against demands for 8,goo. Sixty-two per cent. of Middle East\u2019s intake of vehicles was sent up to Eighth Army during the period up to 15th March, including a special despatch of 520 vehicles which was sent up on 23rd Febru- ary, and by the end of March 20,000 tons of ammunition had been sent through Tripoli for distribution to Eighth Army."

            "description": "distance. This would impose a heavy strat on a force based on Tripoli, over two hundred miles from Mareth and three hundred miles from the next port at Sfax. I had already dis cussed this point with General Monigomery. In view of the time available I had decided to employ II United States Corps in a limited operation on the extreme right of my line in Tunisia; the objects of this were to restore confidence after the earlier setbacks by a care- fully planned successful operation, to exert pressure on the right rear of the enemy defend- ing the Mareth positions, and to be ready to open an alternative line of supply for Eighth Army after they had broken through the Gabes Gap. I planned, therefore, that II Corps, now commanded by General Patton, who had relieved General Fredendall, should attack Gafsa on or about 15th March with r Armoured and 1 Infantry Divisions. They would secure firm possession of Gafsa and build up there a dump of petrol for the use of Eighth Army,"

Air operations continued against enemy positions and lines of communi- cation in all sectors although on a somewhat reduced scale as the result of a further de- terioration of weather conditions."

            "description": "6. The reference in article (d) to offensive operations squadrons of the Tactical Air Force was hardly more than a convenient fiction. Its purpose was not so much to place these operations under my control, as to pre- vent them from prematurely absorbing the energies of the Air Officer Commanding and staff of the Tactical Air Force, to the detriment of their more important task of preparing for the coming events in Europe. Although the operations were planned and their execution ordered from the headquarters of No. 11 Group, which was part of my command, they were supervised until the 15th March, 1944, by the Air Commander-in-Chief himself. Thereafter they were directed by the Air Marshal Com- manding, Second Tactical Air Force (Air Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham, K.C.B., D.S.O., M.C., D.F.C., A.F.C.). This arrange- ment was typical of a series of complex rela- tionships brought about by the special circum- stances of the time. In effect it meant that the Air Officer Commanding, No. rr Group {Air Vice-Marshal H. W. L. Saunders, C.B., C.B.E., M.C., D.F.C., M.M.), while he never ceased to be constitutionally my subordinate, acted for certain purposes as the agent first of Air Chief Marshal Leigh-Mallory and later of Air Marshal Coningham."

Another fighter ground attack was organised and took place between z3th-15th March, This operation resulted in the loss to the enemy of 20 aircraft, 6 destroyed in the air, 9 on the ground and 5 damaged. Qur losses were two Hurricanes. The value at this particular period of these heavy losses to the enemy was very great. Our further ad- vance was over mountain roads through many narrow defiles and passes, where our columns would have been extremely vulnerable to air attack. Although they were bombed sporadi- cally the attacks were not pushed home and lite damage resulted. Our columns were still able to advance by day."
