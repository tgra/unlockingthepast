52 SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 JANUARY, 1047

149. The demands of all three services for
photographic cover were very varied and so
great in number that it was necessary to set up
a controlling body to deal with them. Accord-
ingly, the Central Reconnaissance Committee
was established at your headquarters. This
inter-service committee received requests for
photographic cover from all services and
allocated the task to the most suitable reconnais-
sance force. One of the most important
functions of this Committee was to watch the
security aspect of the reconnaissance effort and
by ensuring that this effort was judiciously dis-
tributed, conceal from the enemy our special
interest in the assault area.

150. The bulk of this invaluable reconnais-
sance ‘effort was flown by aircraft of A-E.A.F.
which, in the period rst April to 5th June flew
no less than 3,215 photographic reconnaissance
sorties. Aircraft of other commands, however,
including 106 Group, R.A.F. Coastal Command
and United States Eighth Air Force, operating
under the control of R.A.F. Station, Benson,
also contributed notably to this work, flying a
total of 1,519 sorties during the same period.
The excellent co-operation between British and
American reconnaissance units in fact enabled
the needs of all services to be fully met by
D-Day.

151. If we had had to rely, however, entirely
on orthodox high altitude reconnaissance aircraft
for this work, ‘not more than a small proportion
of these needs could have been met. The
weather in Western Europe, never very suitable
for high altitude photography, was particularly
bad in the early part of the year. There was
an urgent need for a medium/low altitude
photographic reconnaissance aircraft to supple-
ment high altitude reconnaissance. It was
decided, therefore, to convert some Mustang
fighters into tactical and strategical medium/
low altitude reconnaissance aircraft. They were
equipped with oblique cameras, were armed to
protect themselves and were fast enough to out-
pace most German fighters.

152. Low altitude reconnaissance, however,
whether visual or photographic was at all times
a hazardous business in view of the risk of being
jumped by higher flying enemy fighters. None
the less, early results achieved by Mustangs
were very encouraging and eventually a number
of reconnaissance squadrons were partly re-
equipped with converted Mustangs to supple-
ment their high altitude aircraft. Their work
proved invaluable and the development of this
aircraft for photographic reconnaissance work
has been one of the outstanding lessons of the
air war.

Protection of the Assembling of the Assault
Forces.

153. I stated in paragraph 25 that one of the
main tasks of the air forces was to support the
landing of the Allied armies in Europe. As a
corollary, the air force was required to protect
the assembling of the assault forces. A.E.A.F.
was directly charged with this responsibility.

154. More than 2,000 ships and landing craft
were used io lift the initial assault forces and
other equipment, and they were supported by
task forces of over 100 warships including
battleships and more than 200 escorts and other
naval vessels. In all, over 6,000 ships and land-
ing craft were employed in the first week.

155. The assembly, preparation and loading
of these ships and other special beach installa-
tions necessitated. the concentration of enor-
mous forces in the ports and harbours of the
south coast of England, in the Bristol Channel
and in the Thames Estuary, over long periods,
with especially heavy concentrations in the final
six weeks. Moreover, large scale embarkation
had to be practised to ensure that speed and
flexibility could be attained. To provide this
practice, a series of exercises were staged in
which the forces to be employed were brought
into the concentration areas and in some cases,
embarked and sailed to practice assault beaches
on the south coast of England.

156. Enemy Action against Assault Forces.—
It was estimated by my Planning Staff that the
German Air Force would have available 850
aircraft, including 450 long range bombers to
‘ase against the Allied assault operation. I antici-
pated that these bomber forces would be used
against shipping in ports and in transit, both
in bombing attacks and in sea mining. It was
further estimated that this force would be
capable of the following scale of effort over a
period of three weeks during the assembling
and loading periods : —

Sorties.
Sustained per night... ... + 25
Intensive per night for 2-3
nights per week ... a 50-75
Maximum in any one night... 100-150

157. In fact, the enemy activity did not reach
this maximum scale of effort. There were three
periods of activity in the s®& weeks prior to 6th
June, and they involved only 377 bombing
sorties.

158. On 25th-26th April, approximately 40
aircraft operated against Portsmouth and
Havant. On 26-27th April, approximately 80
aircraft again attacked Portsmouth and a
triangular area between the Needles, Basing-
stoke and Worthing. On 29-30th April,
approximately 35 aircraft operated over and
off Plymouth.

159. The second phase of these attacks took
place on the nights 14-r5th and 15-16th May,
when approximately roo and 80 aircraft respec-
tively operated against Southampton and along
the coast, and against Weymouth.

160. The third phase was during 28-29th
29-30th and 30-31st May; on the first of these
nights, approximately 35 aircraft attacked from
Dartmouth to Start Point and on the next two
nights small forces operated indiscriminately.

16x. The night fighter forces of the Air
Defence of Great Britain were ready to deal
with this activity. Of the total of 377 enemy
sorties, night fighters claimed 22 destroyed,
6 probably destroyed and 5 damaged, while a
further 2 were destroyed by anti-aircraft fire.

162. A valuable contribution to the defence
of the assembly areas for the assault forces was
made by balloons and anti-aircraft guns.
Units were provided for this purpose by R.A.F.
Balloon Command, the R.A.F. Regiment, Anti-
Aircraft Command and certain Anti-Aircraft
artillery formations of the United States forces.
Operational control of these units was in general
exercised on my behalf by the Air Marshal
Commanding, Air Defence of Great Britain.

163. The work of these units not only in
protecting the assembly, but later, in defence
