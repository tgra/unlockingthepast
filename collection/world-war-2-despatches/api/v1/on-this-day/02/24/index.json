By the 20th February, the shortage of food and ammunition, severe casualties and lack of any tactical success began to have their effect upon the Japanese forces, and they began to try to escape, at first in driblets and then in larger parties. Many of them failed to run the gauntlet and were wiped out. By the 24th February the Ngakyedauk Pass had been re-opened and the Japanese offensive, heralded as the beginning of the march on Delhi, had been defeated."

The full effect of the expansion of the   Big Ben   fighter-bomber force was seen in the second half of February, when Fighter Command made 548 sorties: and dropped 108 tons of bombs precisely the same weight in two weeks as in the previous six. At the suggestion of my Chief Intelligence Officer, who recommended that we should try the effect of concentrating our efforts on a single target for at least a week, nearly three-quarters of this bomb tonnage was aimed at the Haagsche Bosch; where severe damage was done, particularly on the 22nd February, when a film studio which the Germans used for storage was gutted. An almost complete cessation of rocket fire over a period of more than sixty hours followed this attack; and  on the 24th February photographic reconnaissance failed to reveal a single rocket anywhere in the square mile or so of wooded parkland that the Haagsche Bosch comprised. Other evidence strengthened the inference that the Germans had been driven from the Haagsche Bosch, at least for the time being, and suggested that they had been forced to improvise facilities in the racecourse area at Duindigt, further to the north."

Here they were joined by the rest of the Division and 255 Indian Tank Brigade (less one regiment left with 7 Indian Division). The advance continued the same day, but to avoid the difficult country between Pyinsin and Welaung, the Division fanned out, 48 Brigade and a proportion of armour moving on Taungtha, via Kainye, and 63 Brigade with the main body of the Tank Brigade directed south-east on Seiktin and then north-east, via Welaung. Both columns reached Taungtha on the 24th February after overcoming desperate resistance and clearing many minefields. By the evening of the 24th, our leading troops had progressed five miles south-east of Taungtha, towards Mahlaing. By 0900 hours om the 26th we had captured the important Thabutkon. airfield intact, smashing through a determined Japanese effort to protect it.
