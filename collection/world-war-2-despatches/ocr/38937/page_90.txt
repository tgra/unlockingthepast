APPENDIX ‘K”
ADMINISTRATION IN THE ITALIAN
CAMPAIGN.
Planning

Administrative planning for the invasion a
Ttaly was made unusually difficult by two
factors; the flexibility of the operational plans
and the remoteness of the base. The decision
between the various plans for invasion which
had been prepared was of necessity postponed
until very shortly, comparatively speaking,
before the dates on which they were due to be
put into action. As a result it was impossible
to prepare well in advance an overall plan for
the administrative side of the campaign and the
arrangements eventually come to had to be
hastily made and advisedly provisional in
character.

There were three major headquarters in the
Mediterranean theatre, concerned _ with
operations against Europe. Allied Force Head-
quarters at Algiers, Anglo-American in com-
Position but working on the American staff
peer was in general responsible for all

ectives and policy; for operations against
Europe; it met all administrative demands for
the forces operating in Italy either from its own’
resources in the Mediterranean or by demand
on Washington and London. It was also
responsible for mounting formations and units

Forces, was a British headquarters located in
Cairo. It was responsible for mounting all
formations and units which came from its
command i.e., the bulk of Eighth Army and
ro Corps, and assisting A.F.H.Q. with such
resources as it could make available. Fifth-
teenth Army Group Headquarters, though
originally intended to assume responsibility for
administrative policy and co-ordination of
general administration of the fighting forces,
ground and air, did not in fact assume that
responsibility for the campaign in Sicily and
the early stages in Italy. This came about
more by circumstance than by On
the American side its responsibilities ‘would
inevitably have been small, since on the
American system the Services of Supply, North
African Theatre of Operations, worked direct
to Army. On the British side there was already
a headquarters administering the bulk of the
forces, Tripoli Base under General Robertson, (*)
and Eighth Amy planned to bring this over
to Sicily as ‘‘ Fortbase.’’ This had the advant-
age that the headquarters was already well
acquainted with the formations to be
administered and the existing channels of
supply to the Middle East and had a close and
