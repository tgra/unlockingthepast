SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 SEPTEMBER, 1946

pens, and till then some aircraft were parked
in the open. Losses at dispersal points were
not serious; the worst in my recollection was 5
aircraft destroyed or seriously damaged in one
attack. Small portable tents were provided
which could be erected over the centre portion
of an aeroplane, leaving the tail and wing-tips
exposed. These protected the most important
parts and enabled ground crews to work in bad
weather.

153. About this time an improvised Repair
System was organised and worked"well. With
the hearty co-operation of the Ministry of
Aircraft Production it was decided that Units
should be relieved of all extensive repairs and
overhauls, both because of their preoccupation
in the Battle aiid because of the danger of
further damage Being done by enemy action
to aircraft under repair. Broadly speaking,
any aircraft capable of returning to its base
was capable of another 15 minutes’ straight
flight to a Repair Depot: aircraft incapable of
flight were sent by road. Small repairs, such
as the patching of bullet holes, were done by
the Unit. Two such Repair Depots were im-
provised about 30 miles to the west of London,
and this undoubtedly prevented an atcumula-
tion of unserviceable aircraft at Fighter Stations.

154. It was also about this time that the
final decision was made to relegate the Defiant
to night operations. It had two serious dis-
abilities; firstly, the brain flying the aeroplane
was not the brain firing the guns: the guns
could not fire within 16 Degrees of the line of
flight of the aeroplane and the gunner was dis-
tracted from his task by having to direct the
pilot through the Communication Set. Secondly,
the guns could not be fired below the horizontal,
and it was therefore necessary to keep below
the enemy. When beset by superior numbers
of Fighters the best course to pursue was to
form a descending spiral, so that one or more
Defiants should always be in a position to bring
effective fire to bear. Such tactics were, how-
ever, essentially defensive, and the formation
sometimes got broken up before they could be
adopted. In practice, the Defiants suffered such
heavy losses that it was necessary to relegate
them to night fighting, or to the attack of un-
escorted Bombers. ~

155. The above remarks have carried me be-
yond the first phase of the Battle and into the
second; but I find it impossible to adhere to
a description of the fighting phase by phase.
The Enemy’s Strategical, as well as his
Tactical moves had to be met from day to day
as they occurred, and I give an account of my
problems and the lessons to be derived from
them roughly in the order of their incidence.
The detailed sequence of events is sufficiently
indicated in the Diagram at Appendix ‘‘ D.”

156. Throughout the Battle, of course, fight-
ing continually occurred over the sea, and Ger-
man aircraft, damaged over England, had to
teturn across the Straits of Dover or the English
Channel. Far more German than British crews
fell into the sea.” The Germans therefore de-
veloped an elaborate system of sea-rescue.
Their Bombers had inflatable rubber dinghies,
and various other rescue devices were adopted.
Crews were provided with bags of a chemical
known as fluorescine, a small quantity of which
stained a-large area of water a vivid green.
Floating refuges with provisions and wireless
sets were anchored off the French coast. ‘‘E

~

Boats ’’ and rescue launches were extensively
employed, and _ white-painted float-planes,
marked with the Red Cross, were used even in
the midst of battle. We had to make it
known to the Germans that we could not
countenance the use of the Red Cross in this
manner. They were engaged in rescuing com-
batants and taking them back to fight again, and
they were also in a position, if granted
immunity, to make valuable reconnaisance re-
ports. In spite of this, surviving crews of these
aircraft appeared to be surprised and aggrieved
at being shot down. .

157. Our own arrangements were less
elaborate. Life-saving jackets were painted a
conspicuous yellow, and later the fiuorescine
device was copied. Patrol aircraft (not under
the Red Cross) looked out for immersed crews,
and a chain of rescue launches with special
communications was installed round the coast.
Our own shipping, too, was often on the spot,
and many pilots were rescued by Naval or
Merchant vessels.

158. This is perhaps a convenient oppor-
tunity to say a word about the ethics of shoot-
ing at aircraft crews who have ‘‘ baled out ’””
in parachutes.

159. Germans descending over England are
prospective Prisoners of ‘War, and, as such,
should be immune. On the other hand, British
pilots descending over England are still poten-
tial Combatants.

160. Much indignation was caused by the
fact that German pilots sometimes fired on our
descending airmen (although, in my opinion,
they were perfectly entitled to’do so), but

-I am glad to say that in many cases they re-

frained and sometimes greeted a helpless
adversary with a cheerful wave of the hand.
161. Many of the targets attacked during the
first two phases of the Battle were of little
military importance, and had but slight effect
on our War Effort. Exceptions to this were
day-attacks carried out on the Spitfire works at
Southampton and the sheds at Brooklarids
where some of our Hurricanes were assembled
and tested. Both these attacks had some effect
on output, which would have been serious but
for the anticipatory measures taken by Lérd
Beaverbrook. :

162. About this time one Canadian, two
Polish and one Czech squadrons became fit for
Operations.

163. A squadron of Canadian pilots of the
Royal Air Force (No. 242) had been in exist-
ence for some months, and was one of the
squadrons which went to France in June to
cover the evacuation from the West Coast. On
its return it became one of the foremost fighting
Squadrons in the Command, under the leader-
ship of the very gallant Squadron Leader (now
Wing Commander) D. R. S. Bader, D.S.O.,
D.F.C., No. x (Canadian) Squadron, now
also came into the line and acquitted itself with
great distinction.

164. I must confess that I had been a liftle
doubtful of the effect which their experience in
their’own countries and in France might have
had upon the Polish and Czech pilots, but my
doubts were soon laid to rest, because all three
Squadrons swurig in the fight with a dash and
enthusiasm which is beyond praise. They
were inspired ‘by a burning hatred’ for the
