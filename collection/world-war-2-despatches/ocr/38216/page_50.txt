ends of the islands, near Sourabaya in the east
and in the Sunda Straits on the west: this was
the most difficult form of attack to parry, and
it was to be expected that the enemy would
adopt it. A landing in central Java was not
thought to be hkely. The Dutch defence plan
was laid accordingly.

Dutch Plan,
523. This was:—

(a) To watch, by means of air reconnais-
sance, as far northwards as possible on both
sides of Borneo, and the whole of the Java
Sea—this being undertaken by the Recon-
naissance Group. Submarines supplemented
this watch.

(b) An invasion was to be opposed as far
out to sea as possible by air action: all
bomber and reconnaissance aircraft were to
ibe used for the purpose when occasion arose.

(c) A Combined Allied Naval Striking
Force of 5 cruisers and g destroyers was
based at Sourabaya and would engage the
main threat when it appeared.

(@) Finally, should the enemy land, he was
to be resisted on the beaches at certain points
only. Suitable landing beaches were so
numerous that only a few of the most obvious
could be defended. Elsewhere the plan was
to keep troops in local reserve and to counter-
attack landings with them, the Army felling
back if necessary on to previously prepared
positions covered by demolitions.

{e) As a successful invasion was all too
probable it was decided that there should be
two centres for a final stand, a decision which
was enforced by a shortage of troops and by
the great length of the island. The two
chosen centres were Malang Plateau in the
‘east and Bandoeng volcanic plateau in the
west.

APPROACH OF ENEMY Convoys.

524. On the 25th February air reconnais-
sance on the east side of Borneo reported that
shipping, which had been collecting for some time
past in ports in the Macassar Straits, was forming
up at Balikpapan, evidently in preparation for
putting to sea. The invasion of Java was
imminent. .

525. On 26th February a convoy of more
than 50 ships and transports, accompanied by
a strong naval escort, was located in the
southern end of the Macassar Straits steaming
south.

526. On the 27th February it was again
located, now in the Java Sea, on a course and
speed which would bring it to the north coast,
westward of Sourabaya, at midnight 27th/28th
February.

527. The Allied Fleet put to sea and fought
an engagement with the escort of heavy cruisers
and destroyers during the night 27th/28th
February. The latter was very superior in
numbers, weight and metal. The Allied ships
were either sunk or disabled. This gallant
action afforded the land defences another
24 hours’ grace, because the transports turned
away northwards at the ‘beginning of the sea
action and steamed towards Borneo during the
night.

“528. On 28th February the transports were
again located steaming south at a speed which
would bring them to landing-beaches’ westward

of Sourabaya about midnight 28th February / 1st
March.

529. Meanwhile the situation on the west side
of Borneo had not developed so clearly. In-
vasion forces had been suspected in the Natuna
or Anambas Islands and possibly at Muntok
on Banka Island. Reconnaissances had failed
up to 26th February to clarify the situation.

530. On the 27th February, a small convoy
with escort was located about 50 miles south
of the southern tip of Banka Island Steaming
slowly on a north-easterly course. This might
or might not be part of an invading convoy
“« marking time ’’ ‘before turning south towards
Western Java.

531. On the 28th February about noon, the
situation ‘became clearer. A convoy was
sighted at that hour approximately roo miles
north-east of Batavia steaming on an easterly
course at high speed. It consisted of rz trans-
ports; one cruiser and three destroyers were dis-
posed some 30 miles to the south and on a
parallel course. Another and larger convoy
was located to the north-west: strength, course
and speed were not clear. Both were at a
distance which would make landings possible at
two: points in western Java about midnight.

532. The moon was one day past full, wind
off shore, ideal conditions for landing. All was
evidently set for simultaneous landings—one at
the eastern end of Java probably just west of
Sourabaya, and two at the western end of Java
in the vicinity of Batavia.

BOMBER OPERATIONS 27TH FEBRUARY
TO rst Marcu.

533. To revert to the night of 27th/28th
February. It then appeared that the major
threat would develop against Eastern Java.
It was therefore decided to move No. 36 (T.B.)
Squadron (9 Vildebeestes and 1 Albacore) at
once to Madioen (near Sourabaya) to co-
operate with American B.17’s in resisting it.
No. 36 (T.B.) Squadron arrived at Madioen on
the afternoon of 28th February, and during the
night 28th February /1st March carned out two
sorties per aircraft, the first against transports,
the second against landing barges. The first
attack entailed a long search because reconnais-
sance information with which they thad been
briefed proved inaccurate. A convoy of 28
ships was eventually found 5 miles off the
Coast, north of Rembang, some 100 miles west
of Sourabaya. Most pilots claimed hits on
transports, and execution amongst the barges.
Subsequent reports received from American
H.Q. in the area stated that attacks had been
most successful and that No. 36 (T.B.)
Squadron had sunk 8 ships—the Americans
themselves claimed 7 others: but it has not

- been possible to verify this seemingly very high

rate of success. On completion of the second
attack, No. 36 (T.B.) Squadron returned
direct to Tjikampek, less three aircraft which
had ‘been shot down including that of the C.O.,
Squadron Leader J. T. Wilkins, an outstanding
leader who was unfortunately killed. Each
aircrew of this squadron, operating from a
strange aerodrome, thus carried out two night
attacks in 24 hours, involving over 15 hours
flying in open cockpits—an excellent achieve-
ment. .

the threat to western Java had crystallised
