415. There were over 6,600 operational air-
craft in A.E.A.F. at D-Day. These aircraft
were composed of ten basic types with a large
number of varying marks, each with its own
problems in servicing. That the maintenance
personnel managed to keep the operational ser-
viceability to the high levels stated below is a
remarkable achievement. When it is remem-
bered that throughout June and July most of

the squadrons operated from new-made landing
strips only a few miles from the front line, and
that the dust on these Normandy airfields was,
in the opinion of many experienced cam-
paigners, worse than that in the North African
desert campaigns, then the efforts of the main-
tenance personnel become even more outstand-
ing.

417. The maintenance of operational strength
was also the result of a carefully prepared plan
for replacement of aircraft. In this connection,
it is interesting to note that the forecasting of
wastage and casualties by the planning staff
was sound, and since the losses were somewhat
below those planned, there were never any seri-
ous difficulties of supply. The replacement pool
and recovery organisation both worked ex-
tremely well.

418. The statistics of the average daily con-
sumption and wastage of P.O.L. and ammuni-
tion also reveal something of the achievement
of the supply organisation. During July,
A.E.A.F. expended daily 750 tons of bombs and
more than 200,000 rounds of ammunition. The
fuel consumption of A.E.A.F. in July reached
approximately 30,000,000 gallons of petrol,
almost 1,000,000 gallons per day. A large part
of this fuel and ammunition had to be trans-
Ported into the beach-head and up to forward
airfields. In this connection the work of Air
Force beach squadrons deserves special men-
tion. These parties went in with the follow-up
troops on D-Day and due in no small measure
to their efforts, the first airfields were stocked
rany for operations in the beach-head on

+3.

419. The following story reveals some of the
difficulties encountered and overcome in supply-
ing an air force of the magnitude of A.E.A.F.
Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary
Force Operational Memoranda called for special
markings on aircraft in order that they might
be clearly distinguished on D-Day. To achieve
success the markings had to be applied on

D — 1 so that all aircraft should have broad
black and white bands painted on them on
D-Day, but not before. The total requirements
of distemper for this purpose to mark approxi-
mately 10,000 aircraft and gliders was 100,000
gallons or 1,500 tons. There was no such
amount immediately available in the United
Kingdom. Supply action on a high priority was
necessary. Supply to civilians was stopped,
overtime was worked in pits and factories,
Whitsun week-end holidays were forgotten and
by Y-Day all was ready; the distemper and
20,000 brushes to apply it were on hand.

Airfield Construction.

420. In combined operations it is obviously
advantageous that fighters, fighter bombers and
reconnaissance aircraft of the Tactical Air
Forces should be able to work from bases in
the operational theatre as early as possible,
and therefore airfield accommodation is of para-
mount importance.

42t. The extent to which airfield require-
ments could be met in this operation depended,
in the main, on the ability of the field en-
ineers to locate and develop suitable sites.
ese sites had been previously chosen by
experts after a detailed study of the coverage
provided by photographic reconnaissance air-
craft and available maps. _It also depended
upon having a sufficiently high priority within
the available shipping space for the movement
of equipment and material. Naturally these
claims must be balanced with others of opera-
tional urgency. ;
422. In the initial stages, the terrain in the
British sector was generally more favourable
