be detrimental to the actual defence of Ran-
goon. These included the diversion of certain
ships carrying admunistrative units which
would be very difficult to unload in the,existing
conditions and whose presence would seriously
complicate the evacuation problem. It made
it clear that fighting troops should be continued
to be sent as reinforcements and that every
effort would be made to hold Rangoon, It also
dealt with the evacuation of women and
children and the denial of the oil refineries. It
concluded with emphasizing once again the
need for a Corps Commander and also for a
Senior General Officer to undertake liaison
duties with the Chinese Armies.

There can be no doubt now that the timely
adoption of these measures was amply justified,
without them there would have been chaos.

95. Withdrawal begens. On the zoth Febru-
ary after three days of almost hand to hand
fighting, the forward troops managed to dis-
engage from the enemy and the first stage of
withdrawal commenced. The withdrawal was
co-ordinated by the Commanders of the 48
and 16 Brigades. The only unit that had
any difficulty in getting away was the 1/9
R. Jats, which was partially surrounded and
owing to a delay in receipt of orders to with-
draw was caught by a pre-arranged bombing
attack intended for the enemy. This delayed
the withdrawal of 48 Brigade till 1500 hours
and it was eventually ferried to Kyaikto by
M.T., reaching that place at about 2030 hours.

The intention now was for the 17 Indian
Division to form a strong line on the west
bank of the River Sittang, and it was hoped
that, if any enemy managed to cross in any
strength, the 7 Armoured Brigade would be
able to deal with them. It may be mentioned
here that while the paddy land looked most
suitable for the employment of tanks, it was
found that the small bunds between the fields
necessitated the tanks slowing down to take
them, and thus making them vulnerable and
slow.

96. Plan of Withdrawal. Tihe 17 Indian
Division’s plan for the withdrawal was for 48
Brigade to move back first, going into divi-
sional reserve. It was to pass through 46 Bri-
gade which was already in the Kyaikto area.
46 Brigade was to act as rearguard to the
17 Division. On 21st February the leading
battalion of 48 Brigade was only to go as
far as the quarries, two miles east of Mokpalin.
The remaining battalions were to halt on posi-
tions some four or seven miles further back
along the main road. To strengthen the bridge-
head defence consisting of the 3 Burma
Rifles and one company 2 D.W.R., the Divi-
sional Commander subsequently ordered the
4/12 F.F.R. to the Sittang bridge area.

The 2 D.W.R. less one company remained
with 46 Indian Infantry Brigade and it was
also decided that units should retain their
transport.

97. Communications. The withdrawal across
the river was bound to be a difficult operation
as only the one bridge existed, but a power
ferry. for M.T. with three boats had been
placed in position as an alternative means, and
was provided with landing stages of elaborate
construction.

It should be noted here that in this area com-
munications were extremely difficult, apart

from the railway there was a road only as far
as Waw some to miles west of the Sittang
Bridge, on the east side there was no road until
reaching Kyaikto 16 miles beyond the River.
Every effort had been made to complete the
road, and to deck over the railway bridge. By
excellent work on the part of Mr. Stewart of
the Burma Railways, the latter and the power
ferry were completed, but the ‘‘ road ’’ was
still a very dusty and rough track through the
jungle. It may be added, that the River
Sittang at this place was nearly 500 yards wide
and very swift. The rapidity of the current,
the enormous rise and fall of the tide (40 feet)
and the existence of a bore, were considered
to render it unsafe for navigation, and nobody
but a very strong swimmer could hope to cross
it by that means.

98. Visit to Lashto. As the withdrawal of
17 Indian Division on 20th had been suc-
cessfully begun, I felt able on 2zst to fly up to
Lashio to meet the Generalissimo on his way
back to China. It was obviously most desir-
able that I should do so in order to hasten as
far as possible, the arrival of the Chinese
troops in Burma. Unfortunately he decided at
the last moment not to land, and flew straight
on to Chungking. I returned to Rangoon by
air on 22nd to find a very serious situation
had arisen on the River Sittang. It is necessary
first however, to describe what had taken place
on 21st during my absence.

99. Events of 21st. By 12.00 hours on the
aist both 48 and 16 Indian Infantry Brigades
had passed through 46 Brigade at Kyaikto.
During the afternoon 46 Brigade commenced
its withdrawal and although bombed from the
air it was not followed up. The order of
march was 48 Brigade leading, followed by
16 Brigade M.T., 46 Brigade M.T. and then
16 Brigade followed by 46 Brigade. One
battalion of 46 Brigade moved by the railway
line, all the remainder by the road and track.

Between 12.00 and 15.00 hours the troops
between Kyaikto and Mokpalin were very
heavily bombed and machine gunned by air-
craft which were considered by many people
to be our own. Whether this was the fact and
whether the fault lay with the Army or thé
R.A.F. was not satisfactorily cleared up at the
time.

By 18.30 hours on 21st H.Q. 48 Brigade
and 1/4 G.R. were established in Mokpalin
with the remaining battalions of the Brigade
supporting them and seven miles further south
as laid down by Divisional H.Q.

The 16 and 46 Brigades spent the night
2ar1/22nd on the road between Kyaikto and
Mokpalin and the time of start for the 22nd
was fixed between the Brigadiers concerned. It
was agreed that 16 and 46 Brigades M.T.
should start at about 03 oo hours, in that order,
followed by 16 Brigade and 46 Brigade.
By 06.00 hours the whole of the troops in the
rear of the column were on the move.

100. Situation about the Sittang Bridge. We
must now return to the head of the column.

The movement from the Quarries started at
04.00 hours on 22nd February with the 1/4
G.R. leading, followed by Divisional H.Q. and
H.Q. 48 Indian Infantry Brigade.

The 1/4 G.R. were given the task of protect-
ing the west bank of the bridge against para-
chute attack and the bridgehead was still there-
fore dangerously weak. The passage of M.T.
