Kamaing was captured on the 16th June and Mogaung invested. The situation in the Mogaung Valley on the 22nd June was that the Japanese in the Kamaing area were being forced into the southern end of the valley; while Special Force was attacking their supply lines in the area north of Indaw. Special Force also had a detachment, known as   Morrisforce , blocking the Myitkyina Bhamo road."

From a strength of two squadrons totalling 15 ULE. aircraft in June, 1944, resources were increased by the end of April, 1945, to three squadrons and one flight totalling 61 UE. aircraft. The dividend that has been paid definitely justified the effort involved. From a handful of informants supplying skimpy information at great risk, the organisations grew, by the end of the campaign, into a powerful force capable of exerting a considerable influence on the course of the battle, and the air effort to support them reached a total of 372 sorties in the lunar month 18th April to 17th May. Between November, 1944, and May, 1945, over 1,350 sorties were flown, in which 2,100 tons of stores and 1,000 liaison. officers were dropped behind the enemy"

By February the ground forces had successfully advanced as far as Maingkwan in the Hukawng Valley, and the Mustangs and Kittyhawks comprising the force had given valuable support in the form of attacks against camps, concentrations of troops, M.T. and stores, both in the valley and along the road from Kamaing to Mogaung. The work of ground attack squadrons in sweeps along the flanks of the road was reported by prisoners of war as particularly effective. Liberators (B.24) and Mitchells (B.25) were also used in attacks on this sector of the front, dropping 155 tons of bombs on Kamaing, 93 on Mogaung and 40 on Myitkyina. This support continued when the Hukawng Valley had been left behind, and by the end of the period covered by this despatch Mogaung was being invested by ground forces and the main strip at Myitkyina, taken on 17th May, was in the. hands of the N.A.S.F., forming a potential advanced all-weather base."

            "description": "52. Throughout the whole period the supply of the Chinese-American forces operating from Ledo under General Stilwell had been proceeding. These troops were advancing down the Hukawng and Mogaung Valleys and thereby gradually bringing the opening of an overland route to China nearer realisation. Each advance took them further from their bases, and consequently their calls for air supply were increasing, necessitating up to 100 sorties per day. Landing grounds were constructed wherever possible along the path of the advance, and light aircraft were employed with good effect. The Dakota (C.47), however, remained as the greatest single factor in maintaining the advance. In April the entire 50th Chinese Division, numbering almost eight thousand men, was flown from Sookerating to Maingkwan, while by then all the combat troops in North Burma, both American and Chinese, had become dependent upon air supply. In May, a fast moving column of American troops, known as Galahad Force and supported entirely by air, made a considerable detour and caught the enemy unawares, seizing the main airfield at Myitkyina on 17th May. All units of Troop Carrier Command in the north had been standing by to carry in those forces which General Stilwell believed adequate to defeat the expected enemy counter attack. BrigadierGeneral Old was waiting at Shinbuiyang to conduct the initial glider operation in which troops and engineering equipment were to be conveyed, and himself towed the first glider into Myitkyina. Transport aircraft followed the gliders almost at once. In the course of thirty-six hours of intensive operations by both day and night, during which ground fire was continually encountered, and one enemy air attack was successful in shooting down a Dakota (C.47) and destroying others on the ground, there were landed a complete Chinese Regiment, six light anti-tank batteries, twelve Bofor guns and crews, one airborne engineer company and a Chinese mortar company. Many loads of ammunition, food and stores were also conveyed. Before the end of the month further troops, in numbers equivalent to a division, had been taken by air to Myitkyina, and the first stage of the reconquest of Burma and the reopening of the Burma Road was completed."

On 11th May the sth K.A.R. advancing west of the lakes captured Bubissa, taking some prisoners and guns, but were counter-attacked by six medium and three light tanks and a Banda group. The C.O. decided that he would be unable to hold the position and conducted an orderly withdrawal behind the Gidu. armoured cars covered the withdrawal and acted as a decoy to the enemy tanks. Unfortunately three armoured cars got bogged following the infantry over soft ground and had to be abandoned after all weapons, etc., had been removed. (In point of fact all these armoured cars were eventually recaptured.) Meanwhile on 13th May 1 N.M.R. attacked the positions covering Sciasciamanna. This energetic attack was completely successful and resulted in the capture of 800 prisoners, two batteries of artillery and nine tanks. The advance was continued to Sciasciamanna which was entered on 14th May, and to Dalle which was occupied on 17th May. A further 650 prisoners, some guns and armoured cars were captured."

On 14th May, however, there were indications that Maraventano was in on the move, this time in the direction of Debre Sina (Agibar). A small force was sent off at speed to take and hold the fort at Uoghidi-which commanded. the enemy line of retreat. This fort was successfully occupied and its Banda garrison joined our forces. On 17th May our main force had followed up and gained contact with the enemy rearguard travelling over extremely difficult country."
