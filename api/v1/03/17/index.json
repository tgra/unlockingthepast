            "description": "68. 17 Indian Light Division pulled out of Tiddim on the 17th March and, after hard fighting, in which the enemy suffered heavy losses, succeeded in cutting its way through to Imphal early in April. This Division in spite of many difficulties had succeeded in bringing through most of its transport and vital stores, together with its wounded during the with- drawal up the Tiddim road. The Silchar\u2014 Bishenpur track was cut by the enemy\u2019s advance."

On the 18th March, I was interviewed by the Chiefs of Staff on my plans for the operation and on 19th March I met the Prime Minister. On the evening of the same day I left for my H.Q. at Melrose, and on 21st March embarked nm M.V_ Wenchester Castle which sailed on the 23rd March. On the 22nd March I saw Lieutenant-General E. C.: A. Schreiber, commanding the Expeditionary Force which I was now leaving. . 1 thanked him for the great assistance that his staff had given to Force 121, ahd handed over 101 and 102 RM. Brigades to his direct command."

            "description": "As the enemy withdrew deeper into Gojjam his forces naturally increased and the British and Ethiopian.regular forces diminished, since it was necessary, if only for the protection of valuable stores, to garrison positions such as Emanuel and Dambacha, to reform 2 Ethiopian Battalion, and to protect the L. of C. used by the few lorries captured at Burye, on which supply now depended. At Debra Markos the disparity of the forces opposed had reached something fantastic; 12,000 Italians and Colonial troops were contained by two com- panies of the Frontier Battalion, supported by the mortar platoon (four mortars) of 2 Ethio- pian Battalion, totalling 300 men. The enemy\u2019s illusions as to our regular strength were at last beginning to be dispelled; Natale was disgraced by General Nasi and replaced by Colonel Maraventano, and the enemy broke back on 17th March and re-occupied Fort Emanuel with some 1,500 troops."

By the 15th, they were within two miles of the Myitnge River. On this date also, 6 Brigade operating to the south of 5 Brigade against strong opposition, inflicted heavy casu- alties on the enemy and reached a point two miles south of Tada-U. On the 17th March, 5 Brigade captured Ava Fort, liquidating a stubborn defence and, by the 21st, Japanese pockets of resistance had been mopped up, the Ava-Mandalay road opened, and junction effected with 19 Indian Division. 6 Brigade in the meantime had reached the Myitnge River and proceeded to inflict severe casualties on the enemy retreating before 19 Indian Division. 4 Brigade, transferred from the west, passed through 6 Brigade on the 18th and continued the advance towards Sado. While 19 Indian Division continued to advance southwards, 2 British Division were deflected south-west clearing the triangle Myitnge\u2014Myingyan\u2014 Meiktila. On the 27th March, 4 Brigade cleared Pyinzi and on the 31st reached Mahlaing. 5 and 6 Brigades cleared the area between Myitnge and Myingyan, linking up with 268 Indian Infantry Brigade at Natogyi, 17 miles east of Myingyan, on the 30th March. 268 Brigade had cleared Sagaing at the north end of the Ava bridge on the 18th March, and then advanced south-west via Myotha."

            "description": "110. The forces which Kimura concentrated to recover Meiktila were as follows: 18 Japanese Division (less 114 Regiment), brought south from the Northern Combat Area Com- mand\u2019s front: 119 Regiment (53 Japanese Divi- sion), from south of Mandalay ; 214 Regiment (33 Japanese Division) from the Irrawaddy front, opposite Pakokku; and 49 Japanese Division (less 153 Regiment) which had been hurried north from Pegu. These forces were reinforced by Army Troops, including medium artillery and some tanks. It was a formidable concentration and it was being rapidly effected. Our forces in Meiktila comprised 17 Indian Division and one tank brigade. The only re- inforcement available was 5 Indian Division, which moved forward from Jorhat (700 miles distant) on the 5th March. Its forward con- centration was carried out with great speed and the whole Division (less its air-transportable brigade) had reached 7 Indian Division\u2019s bridgehead at Nyaungu 10 days later. The fly-in of the remaining brigade from Palel to Meiktila was completed on the 17th March, but I will refer to this again. It will be seen, therefore, that the enemy was concentrating the equivalent of six brigades, plus Army units, against our four infantry brigades and one tank brigade. There was nothing perturbing about this, but it must be remembered that our communications were vulnerable ; our forward airfields were exposed to attack, as, also, was the road back via Taungtha, while the road west, via Kyaukpadaung, was of course still"

In the meantime, the enemy had succeeded in establishing a strong block on the Tamandu\u2014An road, to the west of 2 (West African) Brigade, and the supply situation of this Brigade was, for some days, critical. The toad was, however, reopened on the 26th March. 2 Brigade was ordered to withdraw west to the Tamandu area, while 1 (West African) Brigade, now the most easterly troops on the An road, readjusted their dispositions east of Letmauk (seven miles east of Tamandu). On the 17th March, 22 (Bast African) Brigade was concentrated at Ru- Ywa and assumed charge of that area, It was then ordered to move south in support of 4 Brigade of 26 Indian Division, which was advancing towards Taungup. By the 23rd March, forward troops had reached the north bank of the An Chaung at Kywegu, meeting only slight opposition and, by the end of the month, they had reached Letpan."

Despite the fact that only one Port Construction Company was available, and that it had to do most of the sorting of stores besides its proper work, (by the end of April five pontoon jetties with Bailey Bridge approaches had been built, a timber pier 130 feet long with a 122 foot pontoon head had been completed, and a start made on a trestle jetty. As in the case of Akyab, the initial working of the port had been by 41 Beach Group who soon handed over to the Port Commandant. The target port capacity was the same as for Akyab, but with very incomplete facilities. This target was early exceeded, a record discharge of 1,767 tons being achieved on the 17th March."
