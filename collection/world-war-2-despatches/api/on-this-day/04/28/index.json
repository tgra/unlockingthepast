The enemy defences were strong and long-established and the terrain, as I have said, was particularly difficult; these advantages outweighed in the early stages their numerical inferiority and the lack of reserves for the defence, but as position after position was wrested away there were increasingly less troops to man the positions in rear. 9 and 1 Infantry Divisions attacked on, the morning of 23rd April on the Sedjenane-Mateur and B ja-Mateur axes respectively. On the first day 9 Division gained its objective west of El] Aouana 1 Division made slightly slower progress but by the 25th had reached the high ground a mile to the south-east of Sidi Nsir station. This advance had exposed the left flank of the division and 34 Infantry Division was now brought in between the other two to clear up the area astride the Sidi NsirMateur road. The mdge of hills west of Sidi Nsir was cleared by 28th April after three days of concentrated artillery fire and on the same day the high ground east of the village was captured after close and heavy fighting.",

Naval defensive measures on this occasion were undoubtedly on the weak side and this incident underlined: the need for every available warship and craft to take part in the opening phases of   Neptune   when the enemy must be expected to attack our convoys with everything at his disposal.",

At Allanmyo, 100 Brigade were 252 miles from Rangoon on the 28th April. By the 2nd May, breaking through all enemy attempts to stop it, it had advanced a further 40 miles and captured the great river port (now in ruins) of Prome, the eastern terminus of the road from Taungup.

Kimura had apparently no hope of retaking Toungoo itself, but ihe directed 15 Japanese Division to accelerate its move west from Mawchi and block the Toungoo Mawchi road at the point where it enters the hills. The object was twofold. First, this threat.to 4 Corps might delay fits advance and cause it to divert troops; secondly, this position would protect the flank of those elements of 33 Japanese Army still north of Mawchi, who were retreating south. The Japanese Commander's next step was to concentrate every available man for the defence of Pegu. 24 Independent Mixed Brigade was rushed north from Moulmein to the Pegu  Mokopalin area. He also formed two new Mixed Brigades rom the Rangoon garrison, which were largely composed of administrative and naval personnel. The Rangoon Anti-Aircraft Command, the largest in Burma, provided the guns for this scratch force, all its batteries being utilised for this punpose. These two brigades were moved up to Pegu on 27th April with orders  To destroy the enemy north of Payagyi and 'Waw  , which lie 10 and 15 miles north and north-west of Pegu respectively. While this was going on, the major portion of the small detachments guarding the mouth of the Rangoon River were moved back into Rangoon   To cover demolitions  . With effect from the 28th April, therefore, Rangoon was prcieaily denuded of troops, except for 5,000",
