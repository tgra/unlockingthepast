Accordingly next morning, 27th April, I wrote an appreciation of the situation which convinced me that evacuation was necessary and that there were two main ways of doing it. In the first case, as w  had few stores and little heavy equipment ashore we might, by means of a rapid evacuation of personnel only, cut our losses to the lowest level. In the second, by continuing to send anti-aircraft guns and artillery, and possibly subsequently further infantry, we might be able to hold the position for some time longer. This however would undoubtedly involve the loss of large quantities of valuable material and certainly heavy casualties in personnel. The period could not be sufficient to allow of any direct attack on Trondheim being planned and mounted. In my opinion the correct solution was a rapid withdrawal with the object of reducing our losses to the lowest possible figure. :",

Another merchant ship which conveyed troops from this place was bombed and set on fire soon after leaving Greece and two destroyers which picked up the survivors from the ship were both sunk by bombs within a few minutes of each other. Some 700 troops are believed to have lost their lives.  These were practically the only casualties during the voyage from Greece.",

Kimura had apparently no hope of retaking Toungoo itself, but ihe directed 15 Japanese Division to accelerate its move west from Mawchi and block the Toungoo Mawchi road at the point where it enters the hills. The object was twofold. First, this threat.to 4 Corps might delay fits advance and cause it to divert troops; secondly, this position would protect the flank of those elements of 33 Japanese Army still north of Mawchi, who were retreating south. The Japanese Commander's next step was to concentrate every available man for the defence of Pegu. 24 Independent Mixed Brigade was rushed north from Moulmein to the Pegu  Mokopalin area. He also formed two new Mixed Brigades rom the Rangoon garrison, which were largely composed of administrative and naval personnel. The Rangoon Anti-Aircraft Command, the largest in Burma, provided the guns for this scratch force, all its batteries being utilised for this punpose. These two brigades were moved up to Pegu on 27th April with orders  To destroy the enemy north of Payagyi and 'Waw  , which lie 10 and 15 miles north and north-west of Pegu respectively. While this was going on, the major portion of the small detachments guarding the mouth of the Rangoon River were moved back into Rangoon   To cover demolitions  .

On the 27th April, the armoured column met determined opposition at a village near Milestone 68 and fighting continued throughout the day, Japanese suicide parties, who attempted to destroy our tanks with pole-charges, having to be eliminated. 17 Indian Division had passed through 5 Indian Division on the 26th and was busy mopping up and repairing crossings behind the armoured column. Five bridges south of Nyaunglebin had been destroyed by the enemy and another washed away by a flooded chaung. Valentine +bridge-layer tanks had enabled our armour to cross, but our lorried infantry was temporarily held up pending the arrival of Bailey bridging.",
