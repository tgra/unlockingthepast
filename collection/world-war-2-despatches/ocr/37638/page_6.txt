22. The shortage of transport was probably
the most hampering factor on all operations in
the ‘Middle East during the first six months of
rg4i. 1 had been informed by the ‘War Office
that from January onwards a supply of some
3,000 vehicles a month would arrive in the
Middle East from the United States; and I
based my plans for the organisation of my
troops and operations on the arrival of this
transport. In fact, during the first four months,
less than half of the amount promised arrived
(2,341 in January, 2,094 in February, 725 in
March, 705 in April). The consequent shortage
hampered operations in Cyrenaica, in Crete, in
Iraq, and in Syria. The force sent to Greece
was made up to its full complement of trans-
port at the expense of other theatres, and the
whole of this transport, some 8,000 vehicles,
was lost in the evacuation of Greece.

23. Our covering forces, towards the end of
March, on the frontier of Cyrenaica, just east
of Agheila, 150 miles south of ‘Benghazi, con-
sisted of the 2nd Armoured Division, less rst
Armoured Brigade Group in Greece. The divi-
sion comprised an armoured car regiment, the
3rd Armoured ‘Brigade and a portion of the
Support Group. The armoured car regiment,
the King’s Dragoon Guards, were only newly
converted from horsed cavalry to this role and
had little experience of the desert. The 3rd
Armoured Brigade consisted of the 3rd ‘Hussars
(light tanks), 5th Royal Tank Regiment
(Cruisers), and 6th Royal Tank ‘Regiment,
armed with captured Italian tanks. Of the
above, 3rd Hussars had had, at the end of
March, only 2g light tanks in action out of their
establishment of 52, and these were in a poor
mechanical state; the 5th Royal Tank Regi-
ment had only 23 cruisers available out of 52,
and these had done a very considerable mileage
and were in an even poorer mechanical state.
6th Royal Tank Regiment had, on 3oth March,
only one squadron available, while the second
was formed two days later, the day after the
enemy attack began. They had had little time
to become accustomed to the Italian tanks.
Headquarters 2nd Division had only arrived in
the forward area in the third week in March
and had not had time to settle down; the same
applied to the Support Group, which consisted
of the 1st Tower Hamlets, the roqth Royal
Horse Artillery (25-pdrs.), 3rd Royal Horse
Artillery (Anti-Tank Regiment), and one
company Royal Northumberland Fusiliers
(Machine-gun Regiment). The whole forma-
tion was unpractised and required at least
another month to find its feet. I had
hoped that this period would be available before
the enemy attacked. I did not become aware
of the dangerouslv poor mechanical state of the
armoured troop’. till a few days before the
enemy attack. The strongest position for
defence on the Cyrenaican frontier was west of
Agheila, where some salt marshes confined the
approaches from the west. I had given orders
that this position should be occupied, but owing
to the transport shortage mentioned above, it
was found impossible to carry out the main-
tenance of the force if it pushed forward this
additional 40 miles,

24. My instructions to General Neame, com-
manding in Cyrenaica, were that, if attacked,
he was to fight a delaying action between his
forward position, east of Agheila and Benghazi.
I told him that he should not hesitate to give

up ground if necessary as far as Benghazi, and
even to evacuate Benghazi if the situation
demanded it, but to hold on to the high ground
above Benghazi for as long as possible. The
gth Australian Division had only two brigades
forward, the third having to remain back at
Tobruk owing to shortage of transport. I
instructed General Neame to conserve his
armoured troops as much as possible, since I
could not provide him with any armoured
reinforcements before May and _ without
armoured troops his whole position would be
compromised. I still believed at this time that
no enemy advance in strength was probable
for another three or four weeks.

25. Before describing the enemy’s counter
attack, it may be mentioned that on 21st March
the last Italian detachment left in Cyrenaica
had been captured. This was the force occupy-
ing Jarabub Oasis, which had retreated there
in the middle of December after the battle of
Sidi Barrani. It originally comprised about
800 Italian and 1,200 native troops. Ever since
then it had been merely observed by the
divisional cavalry regiment (mechanised) of
the 6th Australian Division. I had not the
transport available to maintain a larger force
at such a distance from the main line of com-
munications and estimated that the exhaustion
of its supplies would compel the surrender of
the force. Although practically the whole of
the native troops had surrendered, the Italian
part of the garrison was still in its defences by
the middle of March and was being supplied by
air, Since the force observing Jarabub was
required in Greece I determined to attack and
capture the garrison. This was carried out
by the 2nd/gth Australian Infantry battalion
under Brigadier Wootten, and the Divisional
Cavalry Regiment already in front of Jarabub.
In face of a skilfully conducted attack the
garrison surrendered, putting up a poor fight
in spite of its strong defences.

26. On 31st March the enemy counter offen-
sive against our troops in Cyrenaica began.
The attacking force consisted of the 5th German
Light Armoured Division and two Italian
divisions (one armoured, one motorised). It
was supported by a considerable air force, the
enemy being numerically superior throughout
the operations, although they did not make full
use of this superiority, largely as a result of
the initiative and aggressiveness of our R.A.F.
During the first three days the 2nd Armoured
Division withdrew slowly northwards, and by
the evening of 2nd April was north of Agedabia.
The enemy so far had not pressed his advance
with much vigour. Our intention was that the
armoured force should maintain a position from
which they would be on the flank of any enemy
advance by the main road to Benghazi and
would also block any attempt to turn our posi-
tions in Cyrenaica by taking the desert route to
Mechili. The Commander of the 2nd Armoured
Division had originally intended to counter
attack the enemy north of Agedabia if oppor-
tunity offered; but on being warned that no
tank reinforcements were available and that he
should not attack unless a specially favourable
opportunity offered, he decided to continue the
withdrawal. .

27. The 3rd April was the unfortunate day
of these operations. It was intended to con-
tinue the gradual withdrawal east of and
parallel to the Benghazi road, and the force
