two on which the weather permitted even a
reasonable scale of offensive air support and air
transportation. As a result, the airborne for-
mations were not completed to strength (indeed
82 Airborne Division was without a complete
gliderborne Combat Team). It had moreover
been the intention to fly in 52 Division, but this
Project had to be abandoned. Resupply
Missions were repeatedly cancelled, and when
flown were often on a greatly reduced scale.

Had reasonable weather conditions obtained,
I believe the Arnhem bridgehead would have
been established and maintained.

Full success at Arnhem was denied us for two
Teasons. First: the weather prevented the
building up of adequate forces in the vital area.
Second: the enemy managed to effect a very
rapid concentration of forces to oppose us, and
particularly against the bridgehead over the
Neder Rijn. In face of this resistance the British
Group of Armies in the North was not strong
enough to retrieve the situation created by the
weather, by intensifying the speed of operations
on the ground. It was not possible to widen the
corridor sufficiently quickly to reinforce Arnhem
by road.

On 25th September I ordered withdrawal of
the gallant Arnhem bridgehead.

The vital crossings at Grave and Nijmegen
were retained, and their importance was to be
amply demonstrated.

On the central sector of the Allied front, by
the middle of September the First and Third
U.S. Armies were fighting on the Siegfried Line
from the Aachen area through the Ardennes to
the region of Trier, and southwards along the
general line of the upper Moselle.

By the third week in September the Sixth U.S.
Army Group which had landed at Marseilles
was firmly deployed on the right of Twelfth
U.S. Army Group; the Allied front was con-
tinuous to Switzerland.

Operations to open up Antwerp,

The enemy had achieved a measure of re-
covery. This was clear not only in the Arnhem
operation, but also in his reaction to American
thrusts in the Siegfried Line. It was necessary
to prepare for a hard killing match before it
was possible to secure the Ruhr and advance
into Germany. There was also the task to
open the approaches to Antwerp before winter
set in.

The immediate intention therefore became
the clearance of the Scheldt Estuary.

This task was given to the First Canadian
Army and lasted through October to the first
week in November. The enemy resistance was
vigorous, and some very hard fighting took
place, leading up to the final operation for the
capture of Walcheren. The reduction of this
fortress presented many novel problems which
were overcome principally by very remarkable
precision bombing by Bomber Command,
which breached the dykes and submerged large
areas of the island. The extensive use of
special amphibious devices enabled our troops
to operate in the resulting floods. The naval
craft put up a very fine performance in this
battle, in spite of severe casualties from the
coast defences and the rough seas. Walcheren
was eventually cleared of the enemy by 8th
November.

While the First Canadian Army were clear-
ing the banks of the Scheldt, 1 Corps on its
Tight wing, together with 12 Corps of Second

Army, were engaged in clearing south-west
Holland up to the River Maas; at the same
time 1 Corps was protecting the right flank
of 2 Canadian Corps operating in Beveland and
Walcheren.

As soon as the Scheldt and south-west Hol-
land operations were completed, First Canadian
Army took over the northern sector of 21 Army
Group as far east as Middelaar, which included
assuming responsibility for the Nijmegen
bridgehead.

This was to facilitate the Second Army opera-
tions which were to line up facing east for the
drive to line the Meuse. This regrouping had a
further object: First Canadian Army was re-
quired to plan the battle of the Rhineland,
which was to be launched from the Nijmegen
area; Second British Army was to plan the sub-
sequent assault across the Rhine.

By early December, Second British Army
was lined up along the River Meuse as far
South as Maeseyck, whence the front crossed
the river to the area of Geilenkirchen and joined
the Ninth United States Army:

Plans for the regrouping of 2x Army Group
for the Rhineland battle were completed by
early December. In fact some divisions were
actually on the move to their new concentra-
tion areas, when, on 16th December, the Ger-
man counter-offensive in the Ardennes broke.

The Batile of the Ardennes.

The full weight of the German counter-
offensive in the Ardennes was not immediately
apparent; extremely bad weather had precluded
satisfactory air reconnaissance, and the aan
concentration had been carried out with a high
degree of secrecy. However, on the 18th
I was considering the possible effects of a
major enemy thrust towards Brussels and
Antwerp on our dispositions—for the Army
Group ‘was at that time transferring the bulk
of its weight to the extreme Northern flank.
I ordered the concentration for the Rhineland
battle to stop, and had plans Fs tee for
switching some divisions from the Geilenkirchen
sector to the west of the Meuse.

By the roth the full implications of the
German attack were established. It was known
that the Sixth S.S. Panzer Army was thrusting
in a North-Westerly direction towards Liége,
with the Fifth Panzer Army in a wider wheel
on its left. Seventh German Army was in
support. On the same day the Supreme Com-
mander entrusted to me temporary command
of the First and Ninth U.S. Armies (with effect
from the 2oth), as they were at that time on
the Northern side of the German salient, and
therefore remote from the Twelfth U.S. Army
Group axis. :

On‘the roth I ordered General Dempsey io
move 30 Corps west of the Meuse, to a general
line from Liége to Louvain, with patrols for-
ward along the Western bank of the river
between Liégé itself and Dinant. This Corps
was thus suitably placed to prevent the enemy
crossing the river, and could cover the routes
from the S.E. leading into Brussels. It sub-
sequently became necessary in connection with
the regrouping of American First Army to send
some British divisions east of the Meuse. But
throughout the battle I was anxious to avoid
committing British forces more than was neces-
sary. Had they become involved in large
numbers, an acute administrative problem
would have resulted from their Lines of Com-
