existing organization, strengthening it as neces-
sary by the introduction of men of character
and experience.

SECTION XXX.—Lagour.

246. War experience soon showed that, while
the organized military labour units worked on
the whole satisfactorily, this was far from being
the case with civil labour. Trouble first broke
out in Kedah, where civil labour disappeared
as soon as the operations started. At Penang,
during the heavy air raids, the majority of the
Asiatic municipal employees disappeared leav-
ing the troops to carry on their functions, an
experience which was to be repeated later in
Singapore. On the railway, after the spas-
modic enemy air attacks on the stations, many
of the non-European officials and labourers
absented themselves. These included such key
men as engine-drivers, stokers, signalmen,
plate-layers etc. As a result there was a real
danger that railway traffic would come to a
standstill. The danger was averted, firstly by
the Volunteer Railway Umt and secondly by
seconding for work on the railways military
personnel with previous railway experience.
The conduct of the semor railway officials
throughout was, however, exemplary.

247..In the Singapore area the trouble first
appeared on the aerodromes It had from the
first become obvious that a secure base from
which our aircraft, and especially our fighter
aircraft, could operate was essential for the suc-
cessful development of the campaign. I there-
fore agreed to the maintenance of the existing
Singapore aerodromes and the construction of
new aur strips taking priority over other mili-
tary work. Large labour gangs were required
to fill in the craters caused by enemy bombing
and for work on the new air strips. After each
taid, however, the greater part of these gangs
disappeared and after a time it became diffi-
cult to get labourers to work on the aerodromes
at all To ease the situation I had to arrange
for working parties to be found, whenever
available, from the Army Reinforcement Camps
for work on the aerodromes, even though this
meant that little or no labour was available for
work on the beach defences of Singapore
Island. The trouble soon spread to the Naval
Dockyard where, after one or two air attacks,
many of the permanent civil staff absented
themselves, with the result that the repair of
local naval craft and other work was seriously
delayed. Later the Dock workers, employed
by the Singapore Harbour Board, similarly dis-
appeared when the Docks became the main
target for enemy air attacks. Here also mili-
tary personnel had to be called in to unload
the ships.

248. In the Army, War Office authority had
been received shortly before war broke out to
form up to six labour companies, but for some
time the War Office refused to agree to increase
the fixed rate of 45 cents per day for coolies.
As the current rate in Singapore at that time
was in the region of one dollar per day plus
free rations and accommodation, it was not
surprising that, in spite of strenuous recruiting
efforts, these companies could not be formed.
By the 7th January only one additional com-
pany had been formed.

- 249. Early in January efforts were made to
solve the grave labour problem. Mr. Bisseker

1287

was appointed Director of Labour under the
Director-General of Civil Defence. He worked
through the Chinese Chamber of Commerce
and through influential representatives of the
other communities. The Services applied to
him for their requirements.

250. On the 8th January a Director of Army
Labour was appointed. He took over control
both of ‘the existing labour companies and of
the labour supplied by contractors. Many of
the latter were of a very poor quality and it
had become apparent that the only satisfactory
solution was to recruit as many labourers as
possible into the labour companies; also that it
was essential that they should be handled by
officers and N.C.Os. who understood them and
that accommodation should be provided as near
as possible to their work. By arrangement the
Governor cabled to the Colonial Office request-
ing that the Services should be given authority
to accept decisions by the D.G.C.D. as regards
conditions of service reached after consultation
with interested departments. No authority was
received, but the War Office was informed that
in view of the urgency the labour scheme agreed
upon locally was accepted.

251. We continued to be hampered by the
lack of centralized leadership among the Chinese
in Singapore, from whom the bulk of the
labourers were drawn. The coolies understood
little of the war and many of them were quite
content to hide in their villages unpaid. There
were few who would go among them and lead
them The situation was to some extent aggra-
vated by the distribution of rice to each Asiatic
household to be held as a reserve, a measure
taken by the Government in order to disperse
food reserves but which had the effect of mak-
ing it unnecessary for the labourers to earn
their subsistence.

252. There were those who urged that com-
pulsion should be applied but those best ac-
quainted with the Asiatics, and especially with
the Chinese, were opposed to it. They con-
sidered that better results would be obtained
by trying to find, and get the co-operation of,
Asiatic leaders. I supported this view. It was
only when this had failed to produce the
required results that a measure was
passed on the 2oth January to introduce com-
pulsion, but it came too late for its value to
be disclosed.

253. The shortage of civil labour remained
a great source of weakness throughout the
campaign. It is right to add, however, that
many of the senior officials, both European and
Asiatic, performed their duties loyally and well.
This was particularly the case in the Railway
and in the Posts and Telegraphs Departments
which were kept working in spite of very great
difficulties.

SECTION XXXI.—THE STRATEGICAL SITUATION,
30TH DECEMBER, I94I—2ND JANUARY, 1942.

254. Our object remained as before, i.e. the
Defence of the Naval Base.

There had been no change recently in the
Naval situation.

The Air situation has been described in Sec-
tion XXIV. The safe arrival of 50 Hurricane
Fighters, due to reach Singapore by sea about
the 13th-15th January, appeared to be ot para-
mount importance as this was still the only
