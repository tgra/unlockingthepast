Formation of War Council, Malaya.

228. On the roth December Mr. Duff Cooper,
whose ministerial duties had taken him to Singa-
pore, formed a War Council, the composition
of which was as follows:—

Mr. Duff Cooper, Chairman;

H.E. the Governor of the Straits Settle-
ments,

C,-in-C., Far East;

C,-in-C., Eastern Fleet;

G.O.C., Malaya;

A.O.C., Far East;

and later, Sir George Sansom as being respon-
sible for propaganda and Press control, and
the late Mr. Bowden as representative of the
Austrahan Government.

This War Council met daily for deliberation,
mainly in connection with the conduct of the
war im Malaya.

Events on the 11th December, 1941.

229. On 11th December the squadrons in
N. Malaya were not in a position to take offen-
-sive action, Coasta] reconnaissance, however,
to the north of Kuantan by sections of Hud-
sons, continued. Catalinas extended the search
‘into the S, China Sea, whilst P.R. Buffaloes
continued to register Japanese activities off the
South Siamese coast. Enemy submarine re-
ports necessitated the despatch of sections of
Vildebeestes without result.

230. No. at (F) Squadron, R.A.AF, at
Ipoh had no aircraft available for tactical re-
connaissance for IIIrd Corps, and so A.H.Q.
issued orders that the squadron was to be
brought up to strength (16 I.E.) immediately
with a proportion of new pilots.

231. Eighty Japanese aircraft attacked
Penang Town; no aircraft were available for its
protection.

232. On the ground, in addition to advances
in the NE. and N.W., the Japanese had in-
filtrated down the east coast as far as Tren-
gannu, In the north-west, where the main
Japanese forces were advancing, there was
considerable pressure on the 11th (Indian)
Division, but no major action had been fought.
Attacks from the air on our forward troops
increased in weight on the 11th, though the
enemy air effort was still being expended
chiefly on our aerodromes.

233. To assist in the defence of Borneo the

Dutch placed at Sinkawang under A.H.Q.

_ operational contro] one squadron of (9) Glenn
Martins and one fhght of (4) Buffaloes.

Consideration of Bomber Policy.

234. On the evening of the 11th December
it was decided to attack Singora aerodrome
once more, the arrival over the objective to
be just before first light om the z2th. Eight
aircraft of No, 34 (B) Squadron at Tengan
were detailed. The attack was unsuccessfu!:
few aircraft got through the bad weather and
others were Jost as a result of it.

235. This raid was carried out as part of the
current policy for bombing Japanese aero-
dromes in order to reduce the scale of their
air activity against our ground forces. The
Air Staff at A.H.Q,, however, favoured the
view that the correct employment of air forces
was in the attack, of the shipping and troop
concentrations in the Singora area, where the
main landing had taken place, and through

which reinforcements were still entering. They
felt that the tume had not yet come to con-
centrate on co-operation with. the Army to
delay the Japanese advance on the ground,
Furthermore, the resources available tor the
bombing of aerodromes were not sufficient to
produce any real effect‘on the Japanese effort.
Dhis was the view of the A.O.C., but he con-
sidered that he could not alter the policy
which was’ selected to meet the wishes of the
G.O.C., Malaya, who was anxious that action
should be designed to reduce the scale of air
attack on our troops. The G.O.C. was
approached again at about this time, but re-
iterated that ‘‘ bomber policy must give im-
mediate relief to his troops’’ which, in his
view, could only be achieved by bombing aero-
dromes. (See next paragraph.)

236. Note by Lieut.-General A. E. Percwwal.

“‘T have no recollection of this approach. In
any case I am quite certain that there was
no strong difference of opinion on the subject
between the late Air Vice Marshal Pulford
and myself, I would point out that there
had ibeen practically no air attacks on the
ground troops up to that time, so it was very
unlikely that I should press for immediate
relief of the troops. At the same time I have
always held, and still do, that the first essen-
tial in any campaign is to obtain some measure
of control in the air. By r1th December the

“Japanese fighters, most of which were based

on Singora aerodrome, had established control
of the air over Northern Malaya. As long as
they held that control the chances of our air-
craft doing damage to Japanese shipping and
troop concentrations in the Singora area was
remote. Before that could be done it was
necessary to regain some measure of air con-
trol. The only chance of doing this was to
destroy a number of enemy fighters on their
congested and weakly defended aerodrome-
Therefore, if I did press for an attack on the
aerodrome, it would have been for that reason
and not to provide immediate relief for the
ground troops.’

237. The G.O.C.’s point of view was con-
firmed by G.H.Q. who, on 12th December,
issued a War Instruction, the relevant para-
graph of which read:—

“ For the present, assistance to the 11th

Ind. Division is to take precedence over

other R.A.F. offensive tasks,’’

On the 12th December the C.-in-C. visited
A.H.Q and re-emphasised the importance of |
providing support to the Army in the north-
west.

Prowsion of Support for the Army.

238. On the r1th/12th December the land
position in the north-west worsened. The rith
(Indian) Division was attacked in and forced
to evacuate the Jitra position, and Krohcol
came under heavier attacks, The withdrawal
of the latter force would have had grave con-
sequences as it would have exposed the com-
munications of the 11th Indian Division and
thus necessitated a general withdrawal out, of
Kedah province. ~

239. The only aircraft still available in the
area for direct support of the Army were two
or three -Buffaloes of No. 21 (F) Squadron,
R.A.A.F., at Ipoh; the rest of the squadron
was being re-equipped at Singapore. The
