            "description": "Meanwhile the enemy's assaults on Bir Hacheim were renewed. Beginning on the 6th June, the attacks continued and grew in intensity. The Free French resisted valiantly, but on  the evening of the 8th June, General  Koenig was obliged to report that the situation had become serious. It seemed likely that the stronghold would fall unless the garrison was given support from outside. becoming critical, General Ritchi  was anxious  to retain possession of it since, if it were lost, we should have to form a new and extended front facing southwards behind which we might be hemmed in and deprived of our power of manoeuvre. The threat to our rear would be increased, and, while it would be more necessary than ever to attack the enemy's supply lines, to do so from the south would become correspondingly more difficult. I agreed that we must hold the enemy frontally and do everfthing in our power to deprive him of supplies. Orders were therefore issued for an armoured regimental group from the 4th Armoured Brigade with two columns each from the 7th Motor Brigade and the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade to attack the goth Light Division in the rear next day, At the same time a convoy was to be passed in, and arrangements were made for aircraft to drop supplies. It was intended that the armoured regimental group should eventually (join the forces operating round Mteifel. ;",

            "description": "231. The bombing of the   ski sites   and other factors led to a postponement of this programme. The landings in Normandy on the 6th June, 1944, took the Germans tactically by surprise and found them still not ready to use the flying bomb. Thereupon LXV Army Korps, apparently on Hitler's instructions, peremptorily ordered Flakregiment 155 (W) to begin operations on the 12th June. The precise grounds of this decision are never likely to be known. The opportunity to use the long-range weapons to delay the Allied assault had gone, if indeed it had ever existed. But the Germans may still have hoped to gain time by exploiting the harassing effect of the bomb and hampering the flow of reinforcements and supplies. Moreover, it is improbable that we, need look very far for the motive that prompted such a natural reaction to events. At moments of crisis the impulse to retaliate against an England which had upset all Hitler's plans by perversely refusing its allotted role was never far below the surface. The Germans quickly publicised the flying bomb as   revenge weapon No. 1  : and their propaganda may well have contained a hint of their real purpose. With the   west wall   in jeopardy and defeat on the horizon, Hitler may have seen no more than the need to strike back and hope for a miracle.",

Even on subsequent days, when the Germans had had time to appreciate what we were doing, air opposition was far from energetic.
