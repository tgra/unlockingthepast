rain fell over the whole area and continued
throughout the rest of the day. The black
cotton soil became sodden and prevented the
transport with water and supplies from reach-
ing the troops, the 2nd Brigade not receiving
any until after the fall of Mega. On the 17th,
while the 2nd S.A. Brigade were searching for
a way in through the hills south and south-east
of the town, the 5th S.A. Brigade attacked,
and consolidated their position within two
miles of Mega, with troops on their left
flank overlooking the town. Eventually on the
18th Lieut-Colonel C. L. Engelbrecht leading
one company of the and F.F. Battalion from
the and S.A. Brigade scaled a precipitous
cliff on the south-east of the town, although a
native guide had reported this route to be
completely impracticable, and captured the
enemy’s main gun positions.

Meanwhile, the two battalions of the 5th
Brigade had attacked again in the rain and
mist, working forward from feature to feature,
till eventually at 1745 hours they were about
to launch their final assault. The enemy how-
ever, who had just lost his guns, realised his
position to be hopeless and surrendered.

Besides 26 officers, 598 Italians and 374
natives, our captures at Mega included four
medium and three field guns and a large stock
of machine-guns, rifles and ammunition.

30. In the evening of 22nd February a
patrol of Irregulars who had been sent forward
by 2nd S.A. Brigade to contact friendly natives,
entered Moyale without opposition, the garrison
having hurriedly withdrawn to Neghelli on the
day Mega fell. 2nd S.A. Infantry Brigade
following up the Irregulars occupied the town
the next day and found that the enemy had
abandoned a large quantity of war material,
including one field and four medium guns.

31. Both the brigades patrolled actively -

from Mega and Moyale towards Iavello,
Neghelli and Mandera, and plans were being
made for the capture of Iavello, but the heavy
rains which then began made all the roads
impassable at periods and movement and
maintenance became increasingly difficult.

32. During this period 25th E.A. Brigade,
which had only two newly-formed battalions,
carried out the operations to the west of Lake
Rudolf. I had given instructions that this
brigade was to move forward with the eventual
object of capturing Kalam. The initial advance
proceeded with no difficulty and Todengang and
Namuruputh were occupied on oth February.
The subsequent advance towards Kalam proved
a different matter. The country to the north
of Lake Rudolf, in the Omo Valley, was
eccupied by wild Merille tribesmen whose
traditional enmity towards the Turkana had
been fostered by the Italians so that it in-
cluded us. A large number of these tribesmen
concentrated to stop the advance of the 2/4th
K.A.R. who were very soon in difficulties, as
they were not able to reach the water-holes
which the tribesmen were guarding and their
transport was unable to get up to them owing
to the badness of the track. The Battalion
was eventually extricated by the dispersal of
Merille concentrations by air action and by
sending forward water trucks escorted by
armoured cars. This was not done, however,
before considerable suffering from thirst had
occurred.

33. I decided it would be unprofitable at this
stage of the campaign to try to carry out opera-
tions against the Merille, so I ordered General
Brink to take up a defensive position in the
area Namuruputh-Todengang on this part of
his front. .

34. A meeting was arranged on the 19th
February between Brigadier W. Owen, M.3B.E.,
M.C., commanding 25th E.A. Brigade, and
the Merille chiefs, which at first appeared
successful. But it was soon apparent that
they would only come to heel when the enemy
was evicted from the Omo delta and we occu-
pied Kalam which, it was reported, was held
only by Merille and some of the Donyiro tribe.

Owing, however, to administrative difficulties
and the state of the road it was not until 24th
March that we were able to capture Kalam and
push patrols further up to the north.

35. The problem of settling this area is a
difficult one as the tribes are hereditary enemies
of each other. It is impossible, therefore, to
persuade one tribe to disarm unless the next
tribe does so simultaneously. This obviously
cannot be done until all the country to the north
is in our hands.

36. After the capture of Mega and Moyale I
was considering employing the rst SA Division
for the advance from Mogadiscio into
Abyssinia as not only did I ihink that their
greater fire power and superior equipment
would be needed in the Abyssinian Highlands
where the conditions would be strange and diffi-
cult for African troops, but also because I
wished, for political reasons, to give the South
African Division a more prominent part in the
campaign, and it appeared doubtful whether
operations north of Mega and Moyale would be
possible in the approaching rains. I therefore
issued orders for the 21st EA Brigade to move
from Wajir to relieve the and and sth SA
Brigades on the escarpment where there was a
danger of their being marooned in the rains,
and for these brigades to move back where they
would be suitably placed should I decide to
move the 1st SA Division over for the advance
into Abyssinia from Italian Somaliland.

During the period 5th-roth March the change-
over was completed, but only with great diffi-
culty owing to the state of the roads. ‘Divisional
Headquarters, Divisional troops and sth SA
Infantry Brigade went to Wajir and 2nd SA
Infantry Brigade to Isiolo. At this time I was
continually receiving reports which indicated
that the rains would be early and had in fact
set in in some parts of the Northern Frontier
District. Since the move across to the eastern
front was only practicable if the roads, or rather
tracks, were dry, and. as I found I was able to
continue the advance north into Abyssinia with
troops already in Italian Somaliland very much
earlier than was at first estimated, I was very
regretfully forced to abandon the project of
using the South African Division on the other
front and therefore gave orders for it to con-
centrate in Kenya.

37. It had recently been decided that as soon
as I could spare the 1st SA Division it should be
transferred to Egypt. I therefore notified
C-in-C Middle East that the 1st SA Division
Headquarters and 5th S.A. Brigade could now
be spared, but that I required and S.A. Brigade
for operations in British Somaliland to back up
the forces which Aden were landing to take
