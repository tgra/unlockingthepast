was a most unfavourable theatre, into which
I should certainly not have made a deep land
advance on any scale had sea transport been
available. I also realised that the troops avail-
able had had little opportunity of training in
jungle warfare. I hoped, however, that, if the
advance in Arakan could: proceed rapidly, it
would be difficult for the Japanese to rein-
force in time; and considered it was better to
take the risks involved than to remain inactive
on this front during the winter.

Instructions for this operation were issued to
G.O.C.-in-C., Eastern Army, on the 19th
November, 1942. The progress and results will
be described in a subsequent despatch. By the
end of the year r4th Indian Division had
crossed the Burmese frontier and had occupied
Maungdaw and Buthidaung, from which the
Japanese withdrew without fighting. The
division was preparing to push on down to Foul
Point at the southern end of the Mayu Penin-
sula, from whence it was intended to launch an
assault on Akyab. Unfortunately, rain had
already delayed the progress of the division.

NorTHERN BuRMA OPERATIONS,

32. I had a conference with General Stilwell
on the 17th December at which plans for Upper
Burma in the early part of 1943 were discussed.
General Stilwell was anxious, in spite of the
administrative difficulties, to secure as much of
northern Burma as possible, in order to cover
the construction of a road from Ledo by Myit-
kyina to Paoshan to join the Burma Road, and
also to secure the airfield at Myitkyina. The
construction of the Ledo-Myitkyina road had
now been undertaken iby the Americans. It
was agreed that all preparations should be con-
tinued with the object of an advance into Upper
Burma from Yunnan (Chinese force), Ledo
(Chinese Corps from Ramgarh) and Manipur
(British IV Corps), to begin on the rst March if
the progress of road-making and administrative
situation permitted.

33. On IV Corps front, 23rd Indian Division
had advanced two brigades into the Tamu area
in the Kabaw valley, while 17th Indian Division
moved forward towards the Chin hills down
a new road which was being constructed
towards Tiddim. There was some patrol
incidents in the Kabaw and Chindwin valleys
but no major action.

In northern’ Burma Kachin levies based on
Sumprabum did some excellent work in haras-
sing Japanese forces north of Myitkyina. In
the Hukawng valley a small force of Japanese
and rebel Burmans advanced to Shing-
bwiyang in October but withdrew after bomb-
ing attacks by the United States Air Force.

OPERATIONS OF THE R.I.N.

34. The main work of the Royal Indian Navy
in the period under review has been convoy
duty. Several Japanese submarines were
known to ibe operating in the Indian Ocean, but
no ship in convoy was lost. A number routed
independently were sunk, chiefly in the vicinity
of the Mozambique Channel, but generally
speaking enemy submarines were not numerous.
Ships of the R.I.N. made a number of depth-
charge attacks on possible submarines, but no
sinkings were claimed.

On the r1th November H.M.I.S. Bengal,
commanded by Lieutenant Wilson, while, on
passage from Australia to India convoying the

Dutch tanker Ondina, encountered two
Japanese armed merchant cruisers south of
Cocos Island. Though the enemy was greatly
superior in strength, H.M.I.S. Bengal closed
at once and fought a most spirited action at
close range, sinking the larger of the enemy
ships. The Dutch tanker gallantly supported
Bengal. This action reflected the greatest credit
on the commanders and crews of Bengal and
Ondina.

AIR OPERATIONS, OCTOBER-DECEMBER.

35. With the improvement of the weather
the monsoon, a systematic air offensive
was begun against the enemy airfields and com-
munications in Burma, to the extent that our
resources allowed. Attacks were made both by
day and nig'st and had undoubtedly very con-
siderable effect. The air force also provided
direct support for the Army in Arakan and
Assam; defended by fighters Calcutta, Chitta-
gong and other vulnerable points; protected
shipping in the Bay of Bengal; carried out
visual and photographic reconnaissance; and
dropped large quantities of supplies in the Chin
hills for the local troops, at Sumprabum for
the Kachin levies and for the garrison of Fort
Hertz.

The Japanese air force showed only sporadic
activity. Between the 25th and 28th October
the enemy made a series of heavy raids on air-
fields in the Dinjan area which the Americans
had lately taken over. One of these caused
considerable damage, since the warning system
proved ineffective. In December, the enemy
attacked our forward airfields in the Fenny and
Chittagong areas and the docks at Chittagong;
he caused little damage. At the end of the
year he made a series of small attacks by night
on Calcutta. These did little damage but
caused an exodus of labour.

SumMarRY.

36. From the above it can be seen that the
Indian Command had a full and eventful year
in 1942. It had been rudely awakened from a
somewhat detached interest in the war by the
shock of Japan’s aggression and the wholly
unexpected disasters in Malaya and then
Burma. When the danger approached closely,
both the armed forces and the nation were
unprepared to meet invasion. Ever since the
beginning of the war India had sent troops
abroad almost as quickly as they could be
trained, and had kept in India, except for the
minimum necessary for the defence of the N.W.
Frontier and internal security, only new
formations under training, with incomplete
equipment. In 1942 a considerable proportion
of these half-trained formations had been sent
to Malaya or Burma in the hope of holding up
the enemy. So that in March, 1942, India had
not a single fully-trained division. The Air
Force, as shown, was similarly ineffective and
the Eastern Fleet was unable to control Indian
waters. So India stood in greater peril of
invasion than for some hundreds of years.

That India was able six months later to pass
from a defensive to an offensive basis may be
counted something of an achievement, especially
in view of the administrative difficulties and
internal troubles that were encountered.
Prompt assistance was sent from the United
