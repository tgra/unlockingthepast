Blenheim I’s serviceable, was used in an
endeavour to intercept these attacks, but with-
out success owing to the poor performance of
their aircraft.

“299. Day raids by the enemy took place
with increasing intensity, at first by bombers
alone, and later by bombers escorted by
fighters. On the rst January the first serious
attack against Tengah took place, as a result of
which native labour disappeared. This was to
happen at all aerodromes as they became
attacked, necessitating the replacement of
domestic personnel by Europeans and making
it increasingly difficult to repair damage to
aerodrome surfaces. At all Stations on the
Island dispersed accommodation was provided
for personnel normally quartered at them,
mobile kitchens were improvised, and, in the
case of Seletar, married fatnilies were moved to
alternative quarters.

300. Tengah was attacked again on the 6th
January, oth January, x2th January, 13th
January and 14th January. On the 15th, the
naval base was attacked, and on the 16th, aero-
dromes and the docks. The 17th was a par-
ticularly bad day. Attacks on aerodromes
were catried out by escorted bombers, and,
under their cover, low flying fighters slipped in
and attacked Sembawang and Seletar. At
Seletar, 2 Catalinas’ at their moorings were
burned out and another 2 damaged. Six
Blenheims at Tengah were damaged to a vary-
ing degree, whilst at Sembawang 3 Buffaloes
on the ground were destroyed and 4 damaged.
Attacks were carried out by some 80 bombers,
of which 2 were brought down and another 4
damaged. The attack was repeated on the
18th against the naval base and the docks, and
again 2 were brought down and possibly 6
damaged for the loss of 8 Buffaloes.

301. The absence of a first-class fighter air-
craft prior to the second half of January was
a handicap. An attempt was made to improve
the performance of the Buffalo by reducing its
petrol load and replacing the unsatisfactory
-5 guns, which were heavy and possessed faulty
interrupter gear, by .303 machine guns, but it
remained inferior to the Navy O particularly in
“* dog-fighting *’ s

302. wsteet: owing to the short warning
of enemy raids, our fighters were frequently
still climbing to meet the enemy when they
were themselves attacked. A warning of at least
thirty minutes was required to enable the
Buffalo to reach 24,000 feet, which was the
height at which the enemy formations often
flew. But the successive evacuation of Observer
Corps Posts on the mainland as the Japanese
advanced, and the inadequate radar cover
available, meant that the period of warning
was almost always insufficient.

303. The Dutch Fighter Squadron in Singa-
pore was transferred in the middle of January
to Palembang (para 357), leaving only 2
squadrons of SBuffaloes—Nos. 243(F) and
488(F)-for the defence of Singapore, because
Nos. 21(F) R.A.A.F. and 453(F) Squadrons
based at Sembawang were used primarily for
Army co-operation and for escorting bombers
operating by day on the West coast. Apart
from other handicaps, therefore, defending
fighters were outnumbered in the ait by the

” Japanese fighters in varying degrees between
6-1 and I5-I.

304. The .A.A. defences of the Island were
of limited effect in countering air attacks.
Bofors guns gave protection against all but.a
few surprise low level attacks. But the great
majority of the enemy’s bombing was carried
out from altitudes of over 20,000 feet, where
they were well above the effective range of the
3-in, guns which formed one-third of the heavy
A.A. defences. At such heights only the 3.7-in. *
guns, of which there were only 4o for the
defence of the many targets on the Island,
could reach them.

Further changes in the Higher Command.

305. At the beginning of January it had
been decided by the Allied authorities to unify
the command of all their forces in the South
West Pacific under a Supreme Allied. Com-
mander. General Sir Archibald Wavell was
appointed to this post. He arrived in Singapore
on 7th January and commenced to form his
staff, absorbing into it the Commander-in-
Chief, Far East, and his staff. On r1th
January he moved to the site selected for his
Supreme Allied Headquarters, South West
Pacific Command, namely to Bandoeng in
Java. There on r5th January he assumed
command of operations throughout the S.W.
Pacific, and G.H.Q. as such ceased to exist.
The code name for General Wavell’s H.Q. was
Abdacom.

306. It is unnecessary for the purpose of this
report to describe the organisation of Abdacom.
Suffice it to say that it included a department,
the code name of which was Abdair, whose
head functioned in the dual capacity of Chief-
of-the-Air-Staff at General Wavell’s H.Q., and
of Commander of all the Allied air forces in
the S.W. Pacific. This appointment was tem-
porarily filled by Major General Brereton, U.S.
Army Air Corps, pending the arrival of Air
Chief Marshal Sir Richard Peirse, R.A.F., who
was appointed to it and who took up ihe duty
during the last days of January.

307. To facilitate control of air operations
within the S.W. Pacific Command, the area
was divided by Abdair into six Groups, of
which only two need be mentioned in this
Narrative :—

(i) Westgroup—consisting of R.A.F. Far
East Command, including Units in Malaya
and those in process of being transferred to
the Netherlands East Indies.

(ii) Recgroup—consisting of all seaward
reconnaissance units in S.W. Pacific Com-
mand, British, Dutch and American. Its
Headquarters was in Java.

Dwective to Air Forces in Malaya.

308. On the 18th January Abdacom stressed
the importance of Singora as a target and
issued a general directive to govern the opera-
tions of the-Air Forces in Malaya. This direc-
tive stated that ‘‘ protection of convoys at
present takes precedence over action against
other Japanese forces. If, however, new ex-
peditions are located threatening the east coast
of Malaya or endeavouring to pass south of
Singapore, all available air effort should be
directed to destroying such targets’’. The
directive also stressed the importance of slowing
up the Japanese advance on land by attacking
Singora, intervening in the land battle,sand
of reducing the scale of Japanese air attack.
