patrol actions along the Dabus River. On 2ist
April 2/6 K.A.R. were ordered to operate
south and south-east towards Mendi and
Ghimbi in co-operation with one Belgian bat-
talion which, after the capture of Dembi Dollo,
was directed on Yubdo. Thereafter 2/6
K.A.R. was to continue eastwards to Lekempti,
and the Belgians towards Gore, as far as the
administrative situation permitted. Patrol
activity continued in this area, and various
small actions were fought, but the enemy posi-
tions at Dembi Dollo were too strong for the
Belgians to take. The enemy had air superi-
ority in this area, the majority of our Air
Force being engaged in Northern Ethiopia.

At the end of April the Belgians had six
companies spread out from the Bortai River to
Gambela. Throughout the month of May, 2/6
K.A.R. and the Belgian Contingent were thrown
on the defensive. Initiative had passed to the
enemy who threatened to retake -Asosa and
Afodu with his considerable garrison in the
Mendi area. This necessitated the disposition
of 2/6 K.A.R. to cover the approaches from
Mendi over the River Dabus, and the temporary
evacuation of Ghidame. The weakness of our
forces must now have been apparent to the
enemy.

The Belgians were subjected to regular air
bombing. There was a considerable amount
of sickness amongst them. Until the westward
drive from Addis Ababa and the Lakes
diverted the enemy’s threat to Asosa, it was
not safe to move 2/6 K.A.R. southwards from
the Dabus River to co-operate with the
Belgians,

In June 2/6 K.A.R. moved south to Ghi-
dame, operating from there south-eastwards to
cut the road Dembi Dollow-Yubdo. The road
was attacked on 3rd July, and by the qth July
good progress was being made. On 2nd July
the Belgian Contingent forced the River
Bortai, attacking towards Dembi Dollo on the
3rd. At o200 hours on 4th July General
Gazzera asked for terms and surrendered the
remnants of his army to the Belgians.

Part VIII.

Operations in the Boma.

During the early stages of the war opera-
tions on the Boma Plateau had been confined
to patrol activity only. It was not until forces
operating from Kenya along the west side of
Lake Rudolph were ready, that the Equatorial
Corps could undertake an advance into south-
west Ethiopia. Maji was the centre of the
Italian resistance in this area. The natives
were friendly neither to the Italians nor the
British and even before the war had been a
constant source of trouble. Sudan forces in
this area consisted of four companies of the
Equatorial Corps and a nebulous force of
patriots who, in this area, achieved very little.
Time and resources did not allow the making
o. an all-weather road across the Boma
?.ateau towards the frontier. It was therefore
not possible to maintain regular forces in active
operations during the rains, which, in this
area, begin early in the year. On 17th February
these decisions were conveyed to the O.C.
Equatorial Corps, He was instructed to take
steps immediately to dump forward sufficient
supplies to maintain at least one company of
the Equatorial Corps and the patriots, who
uuumbered about 500, during the rains.

SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 10 JULY, 1946

The general outline of the plan was for
companies of the Equatorial Corps to move
on Maji via Zilmanu in co-operation with 25th
East African Brigade. On r1gth February
No. 2 Company of the Equatorial Corps en-
countered a ‘battalion of 18th Colonial
Brigade. An action ensued in which the enemy
left 150 dead, our casualties being 5 killed and
9 wounded including one British officer. The
enemy battalion was driven off.

On and April Maji was reported strongly
held ‘by the enemy and there was a consider-
able number of anti-British natives with a
stiffening of regulars in the Zilmanu and Beru
areas. ‘Between these posts the country was
in a state of semi-civil war, On 8th April a
message was received from ‘G.O.C. East Africa
that Maji had been evacuated and expressing
the opinion that the Merille tribe would not
submit unless Maji was occupied by regular
troops. He also stated that 25th East African
Brigade would only be able to garrison Maji
for a limited time as it was wanted for further
operations, He asked if the Equatorial Corps
could take over the garrisoning of Maji. This
was agreed to and the Equatorial Corps moved
forward to occupy Maji. The rains had
already started and the state of the tracks was,
appalling. The country is covered with
tropical jungle. Progress was slow and diffi-
cult. By 25th April the Equatorial Corps was
still ten miles from Maji, having been held up
by road conditions and flooded rivers. It was
not until early in May that Maji was occupied.
The only practicable route into Maji came from
the north, and 0.C. Equatorial Corps found it
necessary to establish a ison at Masci, nine
miles north of Maji, where contact was made
with 2/4 K.A.R.

On 13th May, O.C. Equatorial Corps re-
ported that he was confident of being able to
occupy Maji indefinitely but it was essential
that one company should occupy Masci to
cover the only practicable route which came
into Maji from the enemy’s direction. Owing
to the rains his L. of C. was precarious. He
had reached the limit of M.T. Beyond
garrisoning Masci and Maji, only defensive
patrols could be undertaken, At this time the
whole Boma area was under heavy, con-
tinuous rain, The many rivers were rapidly
rising and some were now twelve feet deep.

By ist June, Advanced Headquarters of the
Equatorial Corps was fully established in Maji.
Irregular activities were directed from there,
mainly in the direction of Shoa Gimira. During
June the country was gradually cleared of
enemy,

Part IX.
The Patriot Campaign—r1940.

The month of November 1940, when a
forward policy in Gojjam was decided upon,
found the enemy and ourselves disposed as
follows in the area of potential revolt:
Gojjam.

The enemy had thzee Colonial Brigades (six-
teen battalions) concentrated on the three main
strongholds, Dangila, Burye and Debra Markos,
with four Blackshirt battalions in support.

We had Mission ror, consisting of Colone!
D. A. Sandford, D.S.O., two other British
Officers and three N.C.Os., accompanied by
the Emperor’s representative Azajh Kabada and
