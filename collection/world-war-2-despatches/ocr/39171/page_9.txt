SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951

(©) Containing and killing Japanese in the
Kabaw Valley and Atwin Yomas.

(a) Pushing forces across the Chindwin,
if the Long-Range Penetration Brigades
created a favourable situation.

57. On the 13th January, patrols reported
considerable enemy activity east of the Chind-
win, between Sittaung and Paungbyin, and also
east of Homalin, some forty miles further up
the river. This information, which supple-
mented previous air reconnaissance reports, in-
dicated that the enemy might be preparing for
an offensive.

58. On the 17th January, we attacked enemy
positions at Kyaukchaw, eighteeen miles south-
east of Tamu in the Atwin Yomas, and there
were other small operations in the same area
during the month.

59. Throughout January and February, 17
Indian Light Division was continually engaged
with the enemy in the Tiddim area; attack
and counter-attack following each other in
quick succession.

The Japanese Offensive against Imphal and
Kohima.

60. During February, it became steadily more
evident that the Japanese were preparing for
an offensive across the Chindwin and from the
area about Fort White against 17 Indian Light
Division. The general situation remained un-
changed until the 8th March, when the antici-
pated Japanese offensive was launched. This
began with two main advances, one up the
west bank of the Manipur River, the other
northwards up the Kabaw Valley, from which
Japanese columns moved westwards to cut the
Imphal—Tiddim road. It was also apparent,
from the enemy’s dispositions, that he would
probably launch an offensive farther north
from the Thaungdut—Homalin area against
Tamu, Ukhrul and Kohima.

61. Our dispositions at the beginning of
. March were :—

50 Indian Parachute Brigade: Kohima.
This Brigade (less one battalion) had been
flown in from India as a reinforcement to
4 Corps early in March.

23 Indian Division: One brigade in the
Ukhrul area ; the remainder south and south-
east of Imphal.

20 Indian Division: On the Tamu road
and in the Kabaw Valley.

17 Indian Light Division (two brigades
only): Tiddim area.

62, On the 7th March, I had sent an instruc-
tion to the Commander, Fourteenth Army, of
which the following were the main points :—

(@) A warning that the impending
Japanese offensive against 4 Corps’ area
would probably be on a considerably Jarger
scale than anything the enemy had yet
attempted in Burma.

(b) An indication of the tactical difficulties
of the situation, due to the fundamental
weakness of our line of communication
being parallel to the enemy’s front along
the Chindwin River. .

(c) The strategical importance of the
Imphal Plain: (i) as a base for the main-
tenance and operation of our air and land

1357

forces, and (ii) its value to the Japanese as
a base for attacks against the Surma Valley
in Eastern Bengal and our Assam lines of
communication. Attacks against Bengal
would have an adverse and widespread moral
effect ; while interruption of the Assam lines
of communication would seriously jeopard-
ise both the Sino-American operations based
on Ledo and the air ferry route to China.
I pointed out that the enemy’s effort with-
out control of the Imphal Plain, would prob-
ably have to be confined to raids, owing
to the indifferent communications and the
paucity of food supplies in the hill tracts.

(d) The security of the Imphal Plain was
his primary task.

(©) A confirmation of the authority I had
recently given General Slim verbally that
he might, if necessary, give ground in the
Chin Hills and the Kabaw Valley. In this
event, I stated he would be justified in using
Long-Range Penetration forces to operate
boldly against the enemy’s flanks and com-
munications.

(f) I stated that, apart from 25 Indian
Division, Long-Range Penetration Brigades,
and 50 Indian Parachute Brigade, immediate
reinforcements for 4 Corps must come from
Fourteenth Army sources, and that, there-
fore, preparations should be made for the
quickest possible moves of troops to rein-
force 4 Corps, although this might (i) limit
the depth of our advance in Arakan, (ii)
cause troops to be retained in Arakan longer
than desirable and (iii) interfere with in-
tended reliefs. 77 and 111 Long-Range
Penetration Brigades were already in the
Fourteenth Army area; 16 Long-Range
Penetration Brigade was marching into North
Burma, 14 and 23 Long-Range Penetrationg’
Brigades, and 3 (West African) Long-Range
Penetration Brigade, were about to move
into Fourteenth Army’s area from India.
I promised to investigate whether the pro-
jected moves of 14 and 23 Long-Range
Penetration Brigades could be accelerated.

63. The relative dispositions of our own
troops and those of the enemy and the topo:
graphy of the country all combined to facilitate
infiltration, which is the basis of Japanese
tactics in fighting in close country. General
Slim, therefore, decided very rightly, that to
leave 17 Indian Light Division at Tiddim, and
20 Indian Division east and south of Tamu
would not only give the Japanese excellent
opportunities of cutting off these two Divisions,
but would imperil the defence of the Imphal
Plain which was his primary task.

He also appreciated that, if he could engage
the Japanese forces in the neighbourhood of
the Imphal Plain, he would impose upon them
all the difficulties and disadvantages of a long
line of communication over difficult country
and preserve to himself the advantages of a
short line of communication.

64. The G.O.C.-in-C. 4 Corps gave instruc-
tions to Commander, 17 Indian Light Division,
that he was to withdraw if his line of com-
munication was seriously threatened. The
Commander, 17 Indian Light Division, not find-
ing himself unduly pressed frontally, and not

ising the extent to which the enemy were
infiltrating behind him, postponed his retire-
ment somewhat too long. 17 Indian Light
