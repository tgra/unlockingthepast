CONCLUSION.

78. These operations were carried out to take
advantage of the Italian surrender to obtain a
foothold in the Aegean with such forces as were
available in the Middle East. We failed be-
cause we were unable to establish airfields in
the area of operations.

79. The enemy’s command of the air enabled
nim so-to limit the operations and impair the
efficiéncy of land, sea and air forces that by
picking his time he could deploy his compara-
tively small forces with decisive results.

80. The naval forces engaged on these opera-
tions, cruisers, destroyers, submarines and
coastal craft, and the small force of aircraft
available to 2or (Naval Co-operation) Group
all fought hard and did valiant work under

5379

particularly trying conditions. They achieved
considerable success against the enemy and held
off the attack on Leros for some time, but not
without heavy casualties to our own forces.

8x. Had more aircraft beer available,
especially modern long range fighters, and given
more luck, the operations might have been pro-
longed, but after the loss of Kos, if the enemy
was prepared to divert the necessary effort, it
is doubtful if Leros could have been held in-
definitely without our embarking om a major
operation for which no forces were available.

82. It may be, however, that the inroad made
in the enemy’s shipping resources—which pro-
cess is still going on—will prove a fatal handi-
cap to him when the time comes for us to
embark on an “all in ’’ offensive in the Aegean,
with adequate forces.
