The air effort in April.

£75. In April the need to help the Allies’
Jast assault in northern Italy (considered later)
called for a vastly increased M.A.S.A.F, effort
in the area and the commitment of disrupting
the enemy’s communications supporting the
south-eastern front was relegated to second
place. Nevertheless, the latter targets still felt
a very appreciable weight of M.A.S.A.F.
bombs. :

176. Main targets in the first week of the
month were the constantly attacked Maribor
railway bridge, the less visited Dravograd rail-
way bridge, also in Jugoslavia, and the Graz,
St. Polten and Krems marshalling yards. In
particular, the blocking of the two latter yards
cut Linz from Vienna at a very critical stage
in the battle for the Austrian capital. No. 205
Group meanwhile hit the Nove Zamky mar-
shalling yards by night and the Strategic
fighters operating over a wide area destroyed
nearly roo locomotives and numerous units of
rolling stock.

177. With Vienna virtually isolated, the Red
Army increased the speed of its advance: from
7th to 13th April bitter street fighting occurred
in the capital, culminating in its complete
occupation.

178. While the heavy bombers were switch-
ing their effort to the Italian theatre, the
Strategic fighters continued the work, effectively
dive-bombing Austrian bridges and_straffing
tail traffic in southern Germany. Results of
the latter activity during the week ending 15th
April included 227 locomotives and 354 units
of rolling stock destroyed or damaged.

179. Features of the final assaults were the
complete destruction of the Rattensburg rail-
way bridge; the Strategic fighters’ continued
dive-bombing and straffing effort; the night
bombing of the Freilassing marshalling yards,
and the severe damage inflicted on the Linz
marshalling yards, the last major Austrian
traffic centre on the Linz—Budejovice—Prague
tailway, which after the fall of Vienna, became
the enemy’s last important lateral communicta-
tion line behind the rapidly closing eastern
front, and an objective of American troops
pdvancing from the southern end of the western

‘ont.

General results.

180. It has not proved possible to assess in
detail the effects of M.A.S.A.F.’s four month’s
attacks on railway communications to help
the Red Army’s advance into Austria, The
evidence of photographic reconnaissance,
ground reports, and aircrew observations, how-
ever, examined in the light of experience gained
in investigations in France and Roumania, is
sufficient to give a general picture of the effect
of the offensive,

181. The air attacks were always ahead of
the enemy’s programme to repair his battered
railway centres, and troop and supply move-
ments to the south-eastern front were seriously
limited and delayed. Furthermore, the elimi-
nation of marshalling facilities in Austria and
Western Hungary forced the Germans more
and more to adopt the unsatisfactory practice
of making up unit trains far in the rear, so
that further handling before arrival at the
‘battle area could be avoided. Additional dis-
Tuption was caused by the destruction of

moving trains. A conservative estimate of
units of rolling stock destroyed or severely
damaged is 18,000 (including more than 1,600
locomotives). Many of the destroyed wagons
were laden with supplies, and tank cars were
filled with oil products. Further destruction
of tanks and ordnance was effected at loading
points. The cumulative effect was to cripple
completely the enemy’s land operations against
the Russians in this area.

Tae INTERDICTION OF ITALIAN COMMUNICATIONS

182. (When it became evident, at the be-
ginning of 1945, that it would be impossible to
Jaunch a major offensive until the Spring came,
and that until] that time, holding operations
only were possible on the ground, the Air
Force’s chief task as far as the Italian theatre
was concerned became the reduction of the
enemy’s fighting capacity on land to the greatest
degree possible. To do this, it was necessary,
above all, to deny him freedom of movement.
Without such freedom, he would be unable
to achieve the build-up of supplies and re-
inforcements required to withstand a major
offensive.

183. But, equally important, the enemy
would also be unable to adopt the alternative
of withdrawing large land forces and using them
to reinforce other fronts, where they were
urgently required. It would indeed place him
on the horns of a dilemma—he would not be
able to use his troops effectively where they
were, and would not be able to withdraw
them for more effective use elsewhere.

184. A third consequence, rather more
strategic than tactical, would be to prevent
the Germans from exporting foodstuffs, in-
dustrial products, and loot generally from
Italy, and from importing raw materials and
coal for use in the North. Italian industrial
areas.

185. By far the most important of the
enemy’s lines of communication into Italy,
especially in view of the campaign being waged
against his oil resources, were the railways.
These, because of the mountainous nature of
the terrain on the northern borders of Italy,
were limited in number, and so their inter-
diction did not present a task which was be-
yond the capacity of the resources at the dis-
posal of the Air C.-in-C.

186. The Commanding General, M.A.T.A.F.,
was responsible for the execution of the inter-
diction policy, and from January until the
ground offensive began in April, he used by
far the greater part of his effort on this task.
Supplementary aid was provided by
M.A.S.A.F., when weather or other considera-
tions prevented the heavy bombers from being
used to attack targets higher in priority in
the strategic effort, and also to a limited extent
by M.C.A.F.

Interdiction of Railway Communications.

187. There were eight main routes leading
into Northern Italy from the rest of Europe.
Of these, the two from France were no longer
available to the enemy, while in March an
economic agreement with the Swiss Govern-
ment was concluded which vetoed the passage
on the two lines through Switzerland of war
material between Italy and the Reich.
