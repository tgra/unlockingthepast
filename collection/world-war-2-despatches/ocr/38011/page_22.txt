44. Previous to my arrival, owing to the poor
result of a reconnaissance of the Skaanland
Area, a representative party of the Services had
proceeded to Tromso with a view to investi-
gating what facilities existed there. They had
teported that provided assistance was forth-
coming from the Norwegian authorities, Tromso
was suitable for the handling and storage of
large quantities of stores, and could probably
provide sufficient accommodation for the Gen-
eral Hospital, but that labour was scarce.
Immediately on arrival the D.A. & Q.M.G.
visited the Skaanland Area after having seen
the facilities available at Harstad, and reported
to me that Skaanland could not be developed as
a Base Area before the arrival of the winter
snows owing to the large amount of construc-
tional work on unsuitable ground that would
be necessary. It was therefore decided to send
a further reconnaissance to Tromso with a view
to establishing a Base Sub-Area there to include
the General Hospital, Supply Depot, Ordnance
Depot, and certain reserves, the remainder of
the base facilities being located at Harstad with
en gpnmamamition Depot at Fjeldal near Skaan-
land.

45. This layout was about to be implemented
when it was decided that the operations were
not to be proceeded with.

46. During the period Harstad was being
bombed from the air, i.e. up to the end of the
third week in May, certain dispersion of stores
at Harstad was made by increasing the reserves
held forward and moving certain Base stocks
into the surrounding countryside.

General Remarks on Administration 13-24 May.

47. As will be seen from paragraph 16,
the weak link in the administrative system was
the locally procured Inland Water Transport
which the Navy and Army had improvised. It
was weak because the crafts were owner-driven
Diesel engined fishing craft of 10 to 50 tons and
also because of the lack of adequate control or
organization. In consequence, though willing
workers, the personnel could not be relied upon,
whilst the distances to be covered were great.
All immediately procurable craft (‘‘ puffers ’’)
and seven small coastal steamers, two of which
were used as Hospital Carriers, were located at
Harstad and in the vicinity of the forward Field
Supply Depots. .

48. Owing to the lack of control, the crews
and Dock Labourers at one time stood down
during the period of the bombing attacks on
Harstad. It was decided that the Army should
take over the running of Inland Water Trans-
port, and procure British personnel from home
for this purpose. In the meanwhile, the Navy
would continue to run it under Force Head-
quarters through the A.D.Tn. with certain Army
personnel placed on board to ensure a measure
of availability of the crafts themselves, together
with their personnel.

49. Great difficulties were experienced in the
hi of heavy equipment and stores at
Places other than Harstad, as there was no
means of putting them ashore except by Motor
Landing Craft. These were few in number and
were also required for tactical operations. In
consequence the establishment of A.A. Guns in
Position and the creation and stocking of aero-
dromes at Bardu Foss and Skaanland were
seriously delayed. Labour for the creation of
the aerodromes and for working in the Base

installations was procurable and generally
worked well, though it would not have been
sufficient to maintain the roads and assist on
a large scale scheme of hutting. ,

50. It was soon realised that a comprehen-
sive scheme for the control of the civil popula-
tion and that certain evacuations in the Base
and forward areas would be required for security
reasons. An added reason was to ensure that
maximum use could be made of existing
accommodation for the housing of personnel
and stores during the coming winter in order
to reduce the hutting programme to a mini-
mum. Negotiations were going on with this in
view when operations ceased. :

General Survey of Events during the Period
from 25th May to and June 1940.

51. The principal military operations during
this period were the capture of Narvik and the
evacuation of Bodo. These are described in
subsequent paragraphs.

52. During the period our fighter aircraft
were exceedingly active and caused heavy
casualties to the enemy. As already mentioned,
the Hurricane fighter squadron arrived on
26 May, and, after an abortive attempt to base
it on Skaanland, was finally located at Bardu
Foss with the Gladiator squadron.

Enemy activity in the air was increasingly
evident at the commencement of the period
under review and there were several heavy
raids on Harstad, Bardu Foss, Skaanland and
Bodo, the newly-prepared landing ground at
the last-named place being so badly cratered as
to be unusable.

As a result of these attacks H.M.Ss.
Southampton and Cairo were damaged and
sustained a number of casualties in personnel,
while on 26 May H.M.S. Curlew was hit by a
bomb at Skaanland and became a total loss.
On 29 May the Mashobra, mobile base ship,
had to be beached as the result of bombing
attacks and also became a total loss.

Towards the end of the period enemy air
activity was less noticeable, presumably owing
to the activity of our fighters and the prevalence
of low clouds and mist.

53. Throughout this period close touch was
kept with Colonel Pollock, Head of the Mission
at Tromso, and much valuable information re-
garding the trend of Norwegian politics and
opinion was obtained from him.

54. On 2gth May, after consultation with
General Bethouart “and myself, Lord Cork
telegraphed to the’ Chiefs of Staff requesting
that the decision, as to how and when the
intention to evacuate Norway was to be com-
municated to the Norwegian Government and
military commanders, should be left to him,
otherwise the tactical situation might be gravely
compromised to the detriment, not only of our
troops, but also the Norwegian troops.

On the same day information received from
Colonel Pollock at Tromso indicated that owing
to the evacuation of Bodo, the Norwegian
Government were greatly disturbed and might
possibly ask for a separate armistice regardless
of the military situation.

I received an urgent request from General
Fleischer on 30th May to reconsider the decision
to evacuate Bodo and for protection of his troops
in that area. In actual fact, all Norwegian
troops withdrew from the neighbourhood of
Bodo without loss and escorted by a destroyer.
