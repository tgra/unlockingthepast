It was later teinforced by a lorried infantry brigade."

            "description": "and Akarit battles. It was to be relieved by 56 Division, which had had no previous opera- tional expenence. The plan was to relieve 4 Indian and New Zealand Divisions opposite Gebel Garca and Takrouna with 51 Division brought forward from rest; this division had also had fairly heavy losses and was to be restricted to a holding role. The two former divisions, with the 56th, were to make the assault on the right. The first stage was on the night 24th/25th April when the New Zealanders and 201 Guards Brigade captured Gebel Terhouna, a strongly contested hill feature over- looking the coast about five miles north of Enfidaville. The main attack was planned for 2gth April and its Gbject was to establish all three divisions in the area of Hammamet, at the base of the Cape Bon peninsula. On the 2gth, however, I received a signal from General Montgomery saying that, as a result of a failure by 56 Division on that day when coming under artillery fire as it was about to take up positions for the attack, he now felt unhappy about the possibilities of success. As this was not going to interfere with the plans I was already form- ing for finishing off. enemy resistance in the Tunis plain I.authogized the abandonment of the attack, 1 Fighting French Division was brought forward on 6th May to relieve 51 Division and the Eighth Army front became a holding front except for the western flank where the New Zealanders carried out; local gpera- tions to assist XIX Corps and attract enemy attention."

However, after the Italian- German counter-offensive in Cyrenaica, which led to our withdrawal to bases outside the range of Tripoli, it became essential to resume operations dgainst that objective from Malta. A detachment of No. 148 Squadron (Welling- tons) \u2018was accordingly sent back to Malta during early April, and aircraft of this detachment made 34 night sorties against Tripoli between 13/14th and 24/25th April, dropping up- wards of 50 fons of H.E. and incendiary bombs on harbour facilities and shipping with successful results. Fleet Air Arm Swordfish also made torpedo and bombing attacks on convoys off the Tunisian*Coast and against shipping at Tripoli."

As it appeared to me then, the possibility of landing further troops or of maintaining the troops then ashore depended entirely on our being able to obtain control of the situation in the air, In my appreciation I stated this fact and gave it as my opinion that should adequate air support be available I had no reason to suppose that we could not hold our existing positions against the Germans, and at a later date eject them from Trondheim. Without it I had little doubt that any further operations would become im- possible and that we should be compelled to evacuate our forces from Southern and Central Norway, I further stated that should evacua- tion be decided upon it would have to be done at short notice and that all necessary plans for this operation must therefore be made with- out delay. I requested that the Inter-Service Planning Staffs should be directed to make the necessary preparations forthwith. I was not aware when this appreciation was written that the attempt to establish the Gladiators ashore had failed."

            "description": "On and April Maji was reported strongly held \u2018by the enemy and there was a consider- able number of anti-British natives with a stiffening of regulars in the Zilmanu and Beru areas. \u2018Between these posts the country was in a state of semi-civil war, On 8th April a message was received from \u2018G.O.C. East Africa that Maji had been evacuated and expressing the opinion that the Merille tribe would not submit unless Maji was occupied by regular troops. He also stated that 25th East African Brigade would only be able to garrison Maji for a limited time as it was wanted for further operations, He asked if the Equatorial Corps could take over the garrisoning of Maji. This was agreed to and the Equatorial Corps moved forward to occupy Maji. The rains had already started and the state of the tracks was, appalling. The country is covered with tropical jungle. Progress was slow and diffi- cult. By 25th April the Equatorial Corps was still ten miles from Maji, having been held up by road conditions and flooded rivers. It was not until early in May that Maji was occupied. The only practicable route into Maji came from the north, and 0.C. Equatorial Corps found it necessary to establish a ison at Masci, nine miles north of Maji, where contact was made with 2/4 K.A.R."

            "description": "moved eastwards, meeting opposition but destroying many enemy tanks. However, we were not quick enough, and a strong enemy anti-tank gun screen in the broken country north-east and north of the Sebkret el Kourzia and near Djebel Kournine prevented eventually all further advance, despite many attempts. The enemy withdrew from the Seba Argout position opposite tthe right of 46 Division. Seeing that no further progress was likely, on 26th April I ordered 9 Corps to stand fast and to return 6 Armoured Division and 46 Division (less one Infantry Brigade Group) to Army Reserve. This attack by 9 Corps only just failed to achieve its object. It did, however, inflict severe tank losses on the enemy, drew his armoured reserves to the south and (based on subsequent statements by captured senior officers) seriously frightened him. It also had the effect of leaving the enemy opposite 19 Corps in a pronounced salient, from which they hurriedly withdrew on 25th April. Our losses were not severe."

On the 21st April it was reported that the whole of the Chinese 55 Divi- sion had been scattered by the Japanese attack, and on the 22nd that the Japanese had captured Hopong and were advancing north towards Hsipaw and Lashio with armoured forces and motorised infantry. It was never possible to discover the exact strength of the Japanese thrust but of the weak- ness of the Chinese forces between them and Lashio there could be no doubt. A good deal of damage was done by panic in the rear areas, especially at Lashio, and I sent Brigadier Martin, my chief liaison officer with the Chinese forces, to attempt to restore order and confidence there, which he succeeded in doing. Under the orders of General Stilwell, 28 Chinese Division (less one regiment) was moved during this period from Mandalay to Hsipaw, but the disorganisation of the rail- ways made this movement very slow. I there- fore took steps to protect my rear by sending a detachment from the British Infantry Depot at Maymyo to hold the Gokteik Gorge on the Lashio Road. On 23rd and 2qth April the Chinese 200 Division captured Taunggyi and advanced towards Hopong. On the aqth April I asked General Stilwell to come and see me at Maymyo. The situation, however, did not permit of his leaving his Headquarters and therefore on the morning of the 25th April, in company with my M.G., G.S., I went to General Stilwell\u2019s Headquarters at Kyaukse \u201cand I arranged to meet there General Slim, Commander 1x Burcorps. Here I learned that the enemy were putting heavy pressure on the Chinese 96 Division which was holding the front, that this Division was breaking up and that the Japanese were advancing from"
