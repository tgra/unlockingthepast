SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 18 OCTOBER, 1948

M.T.B. 77 was now crossing the centre of
the convoy and by some miracle remained
unobserved until the range of the target had
closed to 400 yards, and the port torpedo was
fired. The torpedo was seen to run correctly,
and we decided to alter course 100 degrees to
starboard to attack the rear ship of the port
column. The’ columns were about 5 cables
apart. Having turned 100 degrees to star-
board, -fire commenced on M.T.B. 77, at first
from the second merchant vessel of the star-
board column, but very soon every ship was
firing with machine-guns varying from
40-m.m. to .303-inch, and the destroyers were
firing q-inch H.E. that burst about 50 feet
in the air.

An explosion was felt. shortly
‘M.T.B. 77 had altered round.

5. M.T.B. 77 got into position between 300
and 400 yards on the starboard bow of the
second merchant vessel of the port column and
the starboard torpedo firing lever was pulled.

Unfortunately the firing mechanism failed,
and owing to the heat of the battle it was
not noticed that the torpedo had not left the
tube. At about this time a burst of about ten
heavy calibre cannon shells aimed at
M.T.B. 77 struck the bridge of the merchant

vessel.

6. It was then decided to attack the lead-
ing merchant vessel of the port column with
depth-charges before disengaging. Speed was
increased to 27 knots and M.T.B. 77 steered
so as to pass close under the stem of the
target, Lieutenant D. M. W. Napier, R.N.V.R.
went aft to the port depth-charge to release
a yen in position, but was killed when abreast
of it.

M.T.B. 77 passed right under the stem of
the target, and a tray of twelve 20-m.m. S.A.P.
incendiary from the Breda gun was fired into
the merchant vessel hitting her just above the
water line.

We then decided to disengage to the south-
ward as quickly as possible as the enemy gun-
fire was intense and becoming very accurate;
an attempt to lay smoke was unsuccessful as
the C.S.A. apparatus had been hit. After
about ten minutes, firing on M.T.B. 77 ceased
and course was set to the south-east, M.T.B. 82
having joined us. The escort continued to
fire, at times in the air, for some time after
our withdrawal.

7. M.T.B. 82 (Lieutenant P. R. A. Taylor,
R.N.R.), when the order was received to pro-
ceed on one, engine, followed close behind
M.T.B. 77 and assumed by the course that
M.T.B. 77 was steering that she intended to
attack the port column, and consequently
altered course to the westward to attack from
the convoy’s starboard bow.

On altering course to port to cross over to
the starboard column, M.T.B. 82 sighted the
destroyer ahead of the column and decided to
steer down between the lines and attack the
first merchant vessel of the port column. By
this time M.T.B. 77 was crossing between the
columns and M.T.B. 82 decided to attack the
leading ship of the starboard column.
M.T.B. 82 then came under very heavy fire
from many directions, and fired one torpedo
at the leading ship of the starboard column.

60583

after

5495

M.T.B. 82 altered course to the southward,
being engaged by a destroyer and an E-boat.

8. A cloud of black smoke was observed
alongside the leading merchant vessel of the
starboard column, preceded by a flash. This
was certainly caused by M.T.B. 77’s torpedo
hitting.

During her withdrawal, M.T.B. 82 engaged
an E-boat that was keeping station on her
starboard beam; this action drew accurate fire
from the destroyer. M.T.B. 82 increased to
maximum speed and withdrew to the south-
east, joining up with M.T.B. 77.

9. M.T.B. 61 (Gun Boat) (Lieutenant T. J.
Bligh, R.N.V.R.) sighted the enemy at 2328,
and on receiving the order to proceed on one
engine decided to proceed to the stern of the
convoy to create a diversion in accordance with
pre-arranged tactics.

On hearing M:T.B. 77 start all three engines,
M.T.B. 61 did likewise and passed down the
port side of the convoy engaging the mer-
chant ships with 20-m.m. gunfire. Having
observed the two M.T.B.s disengaging, and
M.T.B. 61 being apparently mistaken for an
E-boat (or unobserved) she stopped abeam of
the stern destroyer. Calcium flares were then
dropped in an endeavour to draw off an E-boat,
but although a destroyer opened fire on the
flares, the E-boats did not leave the convoy.

ro. M.T.B. 6x then proceeded to the star-
board beam of the convoy and opened fire
with all bearing at a range of about
2,000 yards. As the E-boats still declined
action and the merchant vessels showed no.
inclination to straggle, M.T.B. 61 proceeded to:
the port beam of the convoy and opened fire
on an E-boat at a range of 2,000 yards. Fire
was returned by the convoy. M.T.B. 6x then
proceeded to the head of the convoy to investi-
gate possibilities of a smoke screen, but as
three destroyers were keeping close station
there, and the wind and sea were increasing,
it was decided to discontinue the engagement
at or0o0/16.

A course of south 48 degrees east was steered
and M.T.B. 61 joined M.T.B.s 77 and 82 at
the rendezvous at o2io.

During the whole of the time that M.T.B. 6x
was in contact with the enemy she was on hand
steering, which made manceuvring very diffi-
cult, and turning at high speed almost
impossible. so

At 0220/16, M.T.B.s 77, 82 and 61 pro-
ceeded on a course of south 48 degrees east for
Malta, arriving at 0830/16. :

11. It is considered that the following damage
was sustained by the convoy :—

One merchant vessel damaged and possibly

sunk by torpedo from M.T.B. 77;

One merchant vessel damaged by gunfire
from escort;

One merchant vessel dama, fire
from M.T.B. 77; ged by gm

E-boats possibly damaged by our gunfire.
12, Damage sustained by our own forces: —

M.T.B. 77—shrapnel holes in engine-room,
fnkebase and crew space, slight dimage on

M.T.B. 82—one cannon-shell hit on the
stern;

M.T.B. 61—no damage.
