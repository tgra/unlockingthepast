Direct Air Support.

The joint army and air forces organisation
for direct air support becomes a complicated
machinery in major amphibious operations.
Special arrangements were necessary to cover
the period before the army and air force head-
quarters and control staffs were set up on the
far shore and the air formations arrived over-
seas.

For the assault, the problem was complicated
‘by the location of Headquarters Allied Tactical
Air Forces at Uxbridge, while the Navy and
Army Group Headquarters were at Portsmouth
during the assault phase. It thus became neces-
sary to set up the army component of Air
Support Control at Uxbridge, together with a
special intelligence staff which was charged with
supplying the air staff with information con-
cerning the progress of operations. The Anglo-
American army staff at Uxbridge was controlled
from my main headquarters at Portsmouth, and
worked in matters of immediate air support on
general directives, which defined the military
plan and priorities for the application of the
available direct air support. Under the condi-
tions of the initial stage of amphibious opera-
tions it was necessary to move the focus of
control of army/air operations back to Army
Group level, because of the necessary centralisa-
‘tion imposed on the Air Forces and because the
normal point of control (Army Headquarters)
‘had no Air Force counterpart with it and no air
formations within reach or communication.

Special assault tentacles were allotted to all
-assaulting brigades and were to provide the
initial means for requesting air support, pending
‘the landing of the normal detachments. These
‘tentacles worked to Uxbridge, while on the
same network were included Divisional and
‘Corps headquarters ships as well as Army and
Army Group headquarters. Army headquarters
were to monitor calls for support, but the re-
sponsibility for their submission to the Tactical
Air Forces rested with the Army Group detach-
ment at Uxbridge.

In order to provide means of immediate
Xesponse to calls for air assistance during the
‘assault, some squadrons were airborne within
wireless range of divisional headquarters ships
in anticipation of requests for direct support.

Requests for pre-arranged air support during
the assault phase were co-ordinated at main
Army Group headquarters, and submitted to
the air forces through the Uxbridge staff. The
Jatter also co-ordinated the bomblines and
ensured that all concerned were kept informed.

The Build-up.

The general principles upon which the build-
up of our forces and material were planned,
were, first, the provision of the maximum
number of ‘fighting formations on the Continent
in the first few days and, secondly, the introduc-
tion into the build- -up system as quickly as
Possible of the maximum degree of flexibility;
so that changes in priority of troops, administra-
tive, echelons, transport and stores could be
made as the situation demanded.

By the end of D Day it was planned that, in-
-cluding airborne forces, the Allies would have
eight divisions ashore together with Com-
mandos, Ranger battalions and some fourteen
tank regiments. By D + 6 the total forces
would rise to some thirteen divisions, exclusive
of airborne formations, with five British

armoured brigades and a proportionate number
of American tank units. Between twenty-three
and twenty-four basic divisions were due in
Normandy by D + 20. Comparison with the
estimated enemy strength was difficult to make;
some types of enemy divisions, were organised
on a considerably smaller establishment than
our own; some were under conversion from
training organisations and were known to be
deficient of equipment. Our own build-up,
moreover, included a considerable proportion of
fighting units classed as corps and army troops
and which, therefore, were not apparent in the
divisional figures of the build-up table.

Planned build-up tables are inevitably
suspect; it was impossible to estimate the delay-
ing effect on the enemy build-up of our air
action. In our estimates, the effect of weather
on cross-channel movement and beach working
was a major imponderable.

In order to make our build-up flexible, a
special inter-Service staff was organised called
** Build-up Control ’’ (BUCO). This body was
formed, as a result of Mediterranean experience,
to organise the loading and despatch of craft and
ships from home ports, and was the agency by
which changes in priority were effected.

It is of interest to record that in order to fit
the assault force into the available craft and
shipping, British divisions were limited to 1,450
vehicles in the initial lift, the corresponding
figure for armoured brigades being 320. No for-
mation was to be made up in excess of 75 per
cent. of its War Establishment in transport until
after D + 14. Similar limitations were im-
posed on the American units.

Planned Development of Operations.

Once the troops were ashore it was necessary
for them to ‘‘ crack about ’’; the need for sus-
tained energy and drive was paramount, as it
was necessary to link our beachheads and pene-
trate quickly inland before the enemy opposi-
tion crystallized. I gave orders that the lead-
ing formations should by-pass major enemy
centres of resistance in order to ‘‘ peg-out
claims” inland. I emphasised to commanders
on all levels that determined leadership would
be necessary to withstand the strain of the first
few days, to retain the initiative, and to make
sure that there would be no setbacks.

In the planning stages of a major operation it
is customary to issue for the guidance of subor-
dinate commanders and staffs, an estimate of
the progress of operations. Such an estimate
normally takes the form of a series of ‘‘ phase
lines ‘’ drawn on an operational map to indicate
the positions to be reached by leading troops at
intervals of a few days. I was not altogether
happy about the phase lines given, because im-
ponderable factors in an operation of the magni-
tude of OVERLORD make such forecasting so
very academic. While I had in my mind the
necessity to reach the Seine and the Loire by
D + 90, the interim estimates of progress oid
not, I felt, have any degree of reality.
predictions were particularly complicated y
two major divergent requirements. On the
one hand the general strategic plan was to make
the break-out on the western pivoting the
front on the Caen area, where the bulk of
enemy reserves were to be engaged; on the
other hand the Air Forces insisted on the im-
portance of capturing quickly the good airfteld
country south-east of Caen. Though I have
