There were two. possibilities:  

(a) He might -have altered to the Northward on realising that he had been reported;

- (b) He might have kept closer inshore,

If he had done (a) it would have been a hopeless task to attempt to find him. My only chance, therefore, was to work under the assumption that he had  done (2). Therefore,

Fighting lights were switched on. One large destroyer passed down the line to  starboard and was heavily engaged, hit-with the first salvo and set on fire amidships

Fired one torpedo at large enemy destroyer, probably obtaining a hit aft.

Fired one torpedo at  merchant vessel stopped and on fire, but missed.

An ammunitiori ship blew up with an

 enormous  explosion; smoke and flames rose to a height of 2,000 feet and JERVIS who was 1,500 yards away

- was showered with pieces of ammuni- .tion, etc:, weighing up to 20 lbs.; the sea around appeared as a boiling cauldron. Inspectiom reveals that the ammunition was  of German manu-

: facture.
