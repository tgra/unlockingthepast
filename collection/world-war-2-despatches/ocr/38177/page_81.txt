6. The remaining forces available for Tenth ~

Appendix “‘ B’’.*

7. D.I. is the day on which the code word for
action under this instruction — is issued by
G.H.Q., M.E.F.

Intention,

8. Should an attack from the Caucasus
develop, I intend from the start to stop the
enemy as far forward as possible. The enemy
will mot in any event be allowed to establish
himself south of the ‘general line Pahlevi—
Kasvin — Hamadan — Senna — Saqqiz —
Rowanduz Gorge.

Method.

9. It is essential that, while inflicting the
maximum loss and delay on the enemy, our
-own forces should not be depleted to such an
extent that on reaching this line they cannot
hold it. Defences in this area will therefore be
completed as soon as possible (see para. 13 (b)
below).

to. In the event of the Russians asking for
help in the defence of the Caucasus and of an
air striking force being provided, the maximum
light and motorised forces will move as far
forward as possible, into the Caucasus, but not
north of the main Caucasus range, with a view
to:—
(a) protecting the air striking force.
(b) preparing demolitions for delaying the
enemy’s advance into Persia,
Subsequent action will be as in para. x1 below.

11. In the event of no such striking force
being provided, delay will be imposed on the
enemy by:—

(a) Moving light forces with the utmost
possible speed to the line of the River Araxes,
between the Caspian Sea and the Turkish
frontier, with a view to ensuring the demoli-
tion of all the bridges over the river and to
acting as a screen to cover our concentration
forward.

(b) Covering, as long as possible, the. aero-
dromes in the area - Pahlevi—Teheran—
Hamadan.

(c) By thorough demolitions, as laid down
in Operation Instruction. No. 115 and in a
joint directive dated 27th April, 1942, by the
Commanders-in-Chief, and by early evacua-
tion of valuable war materials.

(4) By holding positions in country un-
suited to A.F.Vs. astride his main lines -of
advance.

(e) by counter-attacking whenever a
suitable opportunity presents itself.

12, The boundary between Ninth and Tenth
Armies will be (Ninth Army inclusive): —
Malatya—excl. Karali Dagh (Karadja Dagh)—
incl. Hasseche (El Haseke)—Garat Motteb—
thence Syrian-Iraqi Frontier to Abu Kernal—
Qasr Muhaiwir—thence a line due south to
the frontier to Saudi Arabia.

3.7 The following action will be taken forth-
wit

(a) Preparation and stocking of landing
grounds (in consultation with R.A.F. Iraq).

(0) Preparation of defences on the general
i Pahlevi—Kasvin—Hamadan—Senna—
Saqqiz—Rowanduz Gorge to be ready for
operations in this area by four inf. divs.,
two armd. divs. and one motor bde. gp.

(c) Selection, preparation and stocking of
the staging posts necessary for the movement
’ of formations into Persia.

(4) Improvement of routes in. Iraq and

Persia for the passage of tank transporters.

(e) Development of the route to India via

Kerman for the passage of troops. .

14. The construction and stocking of the
Persian base for the area Ahwaz—Andimeshk
will henceforth have priority over the extension
and improvement of the Shaiba base and the
advanced base at Musaiyib.

Buildings at Shaiba and Musaiyib on which

. construction has begun or for which materials

are on site will be completed. Otherwise
material coming forward will be diverted to
the construction of the Persian base to the
scale, and with the order of priority as between
installations laid down in M.E. letter dated
and May, 1942. Stocking will take place as
soon as possible to the scale laid down in M.E.
letter of 14th May, 1942, without waiting for the
construction of covered accommodation except
for-small ordnance stores and spares. Every
possible means of transportation will be made
available for the carriage of material to
Persian base sites, but the order of priority
already laid down for the use of the Persian
ports and transportation facilities; namely:—
(a) Port construction and transportation

material.
(b) Aid-to-Russia stores. ”
(c) Essential Persian civil imports.
(d) Military stores and base construction
material;
will be adhered to. Persian civil imports should
be reduced to a minimum.

Though the Persian base is hereby given
priority over the Iraq bases, it may well occur
that material can be used in Iraq which can-
not be used in Persia. Provided therefore no
delay is caused to the construction of the Persian
Base, extension may be continued in Iraq.

15. As a precaution against delay in the con-
struction, stocking, and organisation of the
Persian base it is essential to improve the com-
munications between the Shaiba base and the
Persian L. of C.

The’ Persian Railway at Khorramshahr will
therefore be extended to the bank of the Shatt
el Arab at Tanuma. This extension should
terminate in a lighter wharf opposite the wharves
at Margi] so that stores can’ be rapidly tran-
shipped across the Shatt el Arab from the
