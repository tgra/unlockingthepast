            "description": "The 4th Indian Division set out at once on the morning of the 17th December. The 7th Infantry Brigade on the southern flank travelled at great speed, and within twenty-four hours reached Carmusa where one of its battalions relieved the Support Group column which had been sent on ahead. Another battalion captured Martuba landing ground, and the third the aerodrome at Derna, where a number of aircraft were destroyed and much transport and many prisoners taken. The 5th Infantry Brigade, originally directed to advance on Martuba by a more northerly route, traversed very rough country all the way and fell behind considerably. As the country round Derna appeared to be falling into our hands without great trouble, the objective of the 5th Brigade was altered, and it was instructed to secure the cross-roads at Giovanni Berta and at Lamluda, so as to cut off any enemy remaining in the Derna region. By making a wide turning moverhent over country the enemy had believed impassable, the 5th Brigade reached Lamluda on the r9th December and took many prisoners there. Giovanni Berta proved more difficult to capture as the enemy had left a detachment to cover it, but by the evening of the zoth that place, too, was in our hands. Derna was occupied on the 19th December, and by the 2st the 4th Indian Division had overrun the whole of the country east of Appollonia, Cirene, and El Faidia. After offering some resistance, Barce was taken during the afternoon of the 23rd. Bengasi itself was taken by a detachment from the 7th Armoured Division. By December 26th all organised resistance in the Gebel Akhdar had ceased, and the 4th Indian Division became responsible for restoring law and order in the hill country up to Bengasi."

By the 16th December, some ten warships had been sighted in company with a tanker off Miri and Lutong, and these ships became the object of our attacks. On the 17th December, 6 Glenn Martins and 5 Buffaloes of the Netherlands East Indies Air Force delivered an attack from Sinkawang, but scored neither hits nor near misses. The same day, Dutch bombers from Samiuwkoa located and attacked this force, a Dutch navy Dornier scoring a direct hit on a destroyer. Encounters between Dutch Buffaloes and the Navy Zero fighters revealed the clear superiority of the Japanese aircraft. Reports of a Japanese landing at Lutong and Baram Point were received, and on the 18th December renewed attacks on enemy shipping in this area were made, without success, by a mixed force. Eight Glenn Martins from Sinkawang had to return without delivering their attack owing to the bad weather, The following day 6 Netherlands East Indies Glen Martins claimed a  hit on a cruiser and some near misses. The roth December, however, was also marked by Japanese air attacks, Kuching aerodrome and town being bombed by about 15 heavy bombers and one seaplane. Civilians suffered approximately 100 casualties, while the main material damage was the destruction of the Borneo Company Benzine Stores, The air war was also carried to Dutch Territory by a heavy attack on Pontianak, much of the city  being destroyed."

The difficulty of comibating the Japanese attacks on our aerodromes resulted on the 16th and 17th December in the evacuation and demolition of Butterworth, Taiping and Kuantan aerodromes, and our aircraft were forced further South. Ipoh, too, was now being bombed, and the aerodrome petrol dump was hit. . On land, the enemy, having advanced in Kelantan (as far as the Sungei Nal) and in Kedah, was now also attacking detachments of our troops in Perak round about the Grik area. The 3rd Indian Corps was accordingly authotised to withdraw behind the line of the Perak River to protect the communications of our forces North of Kuala Kangsar. The rth Indian Division began withdrawing from the line of the River Muda Southwards behind River Krian, linking up with the 28th Indian Infantry Brigade and protected all the time on the right flank by the z2th Indian Infantry Brigade. During this period the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders made counter-attacks with gallantry and skill. This withdrawal was carried out successfully, the enemy being repulsed with loss at his first attempt to cross the river."

General Stilwell was anxious, in spite of the administrative difficulties, to secure as much of northern Burma as possible, in order to cover the construction of a road from Ledo by Myitkyina to Paoshan to join the Burma Road, and also to secure the airfield at Myitkyina. The construction of the Ledo-Myitkyina road had now been undertaken iby the Americans. It was agreed that all preparations should be continued with the object of an advance into Upper Burma from Yunnan (Chinese force), Ledo (Chinese Corps from Ramgarh) and Manipur (British IV Corps), to begin on the rst March if the progress of road-making and administrative situation permitted."

Shipping had to be found locally. Most of the troops were moved to the mainland but the remainder and all Europeans, except a few who remained behind at their own request, were evacuated. Asiatics serving in the Volunteers were given the option of being evacuated or of staying. The majority decided to stay to protect their families. Lack of transport would have made it quite out of the question to evacuate large numbers of Asiatics. Moreover it was undesirable at that stage to increase the population of Singapore."

A big withdrawal had therefore to be made out of Kedah province to the Krian river. Penang was thus left isolated and was evacuated on the night of 16th/17th December."

By the 22nd December, 51 Brigade began to spread southwards down ithe coastal plain and concentrate at Indin, where it remained until it later rejoined 25 Indian Division in Akyab. It had taken 25 Indian Division less than three weeks to secure their final objectives on either side of the Mayu Range, a fortnight ahead of schedule. The enemy had withdrawn east to Kanzauk and a large column was known to have moved from there to Myohaung. It thus appeared unlikely that 82 (West African) Division would encounter much determined Tesistance on its way into the Kaladan Valley."

After concentrating about Wuntho, 62 and 64 Brigades conformed with the main southerly axis of advance, and, by the 23rd, they reached Kokkogon, 25 miles south-east of Wuntho."
