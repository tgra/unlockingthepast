SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 MAY, 1948

35. At 1900 the Force withdrew to the north-
ward. -No attempt was made by the enemy to
locate the Force or to attack it. I had pre-
viously arranged for a Walrus aircraft from
SUFFOLK ‘to be available for picking up any
survivors, but the only reports of aircraft down
were from FURIOUS. Two of her crews were

known to be in the water in position 260 degs. -

Heinasaari 6 miles, but as thjs was only five
miles off the shore and a long way from my

osition it would have entailed fighter protec-
tlon and remaining for. several hours longer
ntar the flying-off position. I did not there-
foe consider it justifiable to send the Walrus in.

31st July.

6. The activity of the destroyers off Tana
Fidérd had made me suspicious that they might
be using Smalfiord as an anchorage for supply
ships or other such vessels. As this might
form a possible target for a second attack I
arranged for a Fulmar with its distinguishing
3 marks erased as far as possible to reconnoitre

this fiord during the night. Accordingly at

0316 on the 31st July one Fulmar was fiown

> off from VICTORIOUS. This Fulmar re-

turned at 0455 and reported that she had found
four twin-engined aircraft patrolling off the
entrance and had not therefore been able to
reconnoitre the fiord. Five minutes after this

Fulmar returned the Squadron ran into thick

fog, . ~ . .

-. 37. FURIOUS’s fuel situation at this time
made it necessary, for her to return immediately,
as she would have little more than 500 tons on
arrival at Seidisfiord and had no- margin for

=+ possible Joss of fuel due to damage. .I accord-

2 ingly atranged to,complete VICTORIOUS as

far as. possible, with aircraft from FURIOUS..

Owing-to the fog.this could not be commenced.

until 1215 when. it cleared sufficiently to enable

the operation to, proceed. . .

- 38. Whilst transfer was.in progress the Force

was sighted: by a Dornier 18, At about 1300

FURIOUS flew off two Hurricanes which shot

. it down, but not before it -had had time to
make a report of our presence. As the whole

Force was then steering west in company I
wa's not unduly disturbed as I wanted the enemy

1 to think, that’ the, Force was returning together.

39: Transfer “of aircraft was completed at

~~,

-

1530 and course was then altered to 305 degs.,
ie., to the northward, in order to get further
away from the coast and avoid observation by
.the’enemy. At 1633 a report of another aircraft
was received, and fighters were again. flown off,
but saw nothing and returned. This report
of aircraft, I am sure, was false, and due ‘to
an inoffensive skua gull. .

Ist August. .

40. The course of 305 degs. was held until
ooor on the rst August, when FURIOUS* was
detached in a position: 40 miles north-east of
Bear. Island. - This was to be followed by
another signal-in naval cypher to Commander-
in-Chief, Home Fleet, on H/F from such a
position as to give the impression that she -was
proceeding towards the Faeroes. This second
signal would be made using a naval general
call sign, requesting that my delivery group

be included in certain signals on H.D. broad-
cast. The object of these signals was to de-
ceive the enemy into thinking that the whole
Force was on its way back and thus to disguise
my continued presence in the area. The making
of these signals was governed by the proviso
that they were only to be made in conditions
of low visibility, since they were liable to lead
to FURIOUS being found by aircraft in which
case the whose ruse would have been exposed.
This in fact occurred and she was sighted four
hours after making the first signal. It is prob-
able therefore that the enemy had a shrewd
suspicion that I was still about.

41. On parting with FURIOUS I remained
to the north-north-east of Bear Island and oiled
destroyers during the course of the rst August.
I did not consider in any case that an attack
was possible on this day as the chance of sur-
prise did not arise until sufficient time had
elapsed for us to have left the area.

42. I had asked VICTORIOUS to. prepare
plans for possible operations against Tromso,
Hammerfest, Tana Fiord, Honningsvaag or
shipping along the coast and I wished very |
much that I was in VICTORIOUS at this time
so as to be able to discuss the project at first
hand. The Captain of the VICTORIOUS in-
formed me that he had an urgent letter to,
send over and I decided to visit him instead. I
accordingly transferred to INGLEFIELD by

- DEVONSHIRE’s crane, and intended to board

VICTORIOUS in a similar manner. Unfor-
tunately INGLEFIELD appeared to be sucked
in towards VICTORIOUS and fouled one of.
her gantries, which smashed INGLEFIELD’s.
.5 machine gun. I therefore abandoned the
project and exchanged letters with the Captain
of the VICTORIOUS. . . 7

and ‘August.

43. DEVONSHIRE oiled the three
destroyers, ‘giving them 200 tons each, and the
whole operation took 13 hours. The Force’
then’ proceeded to a suitable position from
which. the attack on. Tromso might be made,
passing 40 miles north of Bear Island at 0342
on the 2nd August. Visibility was good and.
Bear Island was clearly visible.

44. At 1033 on 2nd August a signal was
received from Force ‘“‘A’’ addressed to
TARTAR reporting” that they were being
shadowed by aircraft. At that time Force
““A’’ was 138 degs., 148 miles distant from
Force ‘‘ P’’ and‘on a similar course. VIC-
TORIOUS stated that fighter support could be
given from a. distance of 50 miles, and I
accordingly informed’ Force “‘ A ’’ of this fact
and of my position, course and speed, by W/T
using low power.

45. Force ‘‘ A’’, which had previously been
steering to the south, altered course to the
north at 1245, on receipt of «my signal and
reported that they were still being shadowed.
I followed ‘suit with Force ‘‘P’’ and turned
in towards Force ‘‘ A’’ so that at 1352 I was
50 miles away. . Force ‘‘A”’ were also in-
formed of the fighter wave so that they could
direct them. Two Fulmars were flown off at
1335 just as Force ‘‘A”’ reported: that they

. were not wanted, and almost at the same time

VICTORIOUS reported aircraft two miles

away by R.D.F. and a doubtful sighting. Two

more aircraft were flown off for the protection
