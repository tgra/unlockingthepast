than that in the American. However, the air-
field engineers achieved very fine results in
both sectors. The position in the British sector
deteriorated because the good area to the east
and south-east around Caen was not secured
as rapidly as had been planned. Neither did
the situation in the American sector greatly
improve until the advance had progressed to
Le Mans and»beyond.

423. The minimum programme for airfields
to accommodate the forces allocated was as
follows:—

3 E.L.S. (2 American and 1 British) by
D-Day.

4 R. and Rs. (2 American and 2 British)
by the evening of D + 3 and not later than
D + 4.

to A.L.Gs. (5 American and 5 British) by
D + 8 (these A.L.Gs. included 4 of the
R. and Rs.).

18 Airfields (8 American and 10 British)
by D + 14.

27 Airfields (12 American and 15 British)
by D + 24.

43 Airfields (18 American and 25 British)

by D + 40. ”
93 Airfields (48 American and 45 British)
by D + go.

424. Definitions of the terms used above and
descriptions of the different types of airfields
are given below:—

£.L.S.—Emergency Landing Strip.—A
strip having sufficient length of level surface
to enable pilots in distress to make a land-
ing. These strips have a minimum length of
600 yards and are not fit for the operation
of aircraft, but are of inestimable value when
operations are conducted a long way from
bases especially when a long sea crossing
on the way home is involved.

R. & R.—Refuelling and Re-arming Sirip.
—A strip possessing sufficient length of level
compact surface for landing and taking off,
adequate marshalling areas for the rapid turn-
round of aircraft and adequate tracking to
ensure operation under alt normal summer
and autumn conditions. These strips have
a minimum length of 1,200 yards with the
marshalling areas of 100 x 50 yards at each
end.

A.L.G.—Advanced Landing Ground.—A
landing ground possessing the same facilities
as an R. and R. to be brought up to A.L.G.
standard by the addition of dispersal facili-
ties and capable of use to capacity by adopt-
ing the ‘‘ Roulement ’’ system.

Airfield.—A field with the same facilities as
an A.L.G. but with improved dispersal facili-
ties and on which squadrons are established
and not operated on the ‘‘ Roulement ”’
system, as on an A.L.G.

The minimum ‘lengths for both A.L.Gs.
and airfields are 1,200 yards for fighters, with
dispersal facilities for 54 aircraft, and 1,650
yards for fighter bombers, with the same dis-
persal facilities.

All-Weather Airfield._The same require-
ments as for an airfield but possessing hard-
surfaced runways and fit for operation
throughout all seasons and all conditions of
weather for the appropriate type of aircraft.
Within the limits of operational requirements,
it was planned that all enemy airfields with

hard-surfaced runways would be reinstated,
as and when they were captured, if in the
opinion of the airfield engineers, reinstate-
ment could be effected without excessive
labour and/or material.

“ Roulement ’’ System.—A means of using
landing ground facilities to the maximum ~
capacity by flying in squadrons to replace
others as they complete their scale of effort
appropriate to the period.

425. The priorities fixed for the construction
of these airfields were as follows:—

Priority I—E.L.Ss. for emergency landing
of aircraft.

Priority II—R. and R. strips for re-fuelling
and re-arming fighter aircraft.

Priority I1I—A.L.Gs. to become airfields
later.

426. The following construction units were
available for allocation as required in the beach-
head:—

American—16 ‘Aviation = Engineering
Battalions.

2 Airborne Aviation Engineering
Battalions.

British—s Airfield Construction Groups.
I Field Force Basis Construction
Wing.

427. Because we failed in the initial phases
to gain the ground agreed in the optimum plan
which was needed in the vicinity of Caen, the
development of all of the pre-selected sites
could not be started. This naturally caused
some delay and made necessary a re-allotment
of sites in the beach-head area. As a very
high proportion of potential sites selected from
air photographs proved to be suitable for rapid
construction, the intensive preparation of the
beach-head area permitted the leeway to be
made up and the Air Staff requirements to be
met.

428. Later, when the Allied advance became
rapid, the problem of finding space to prepare
airfields was eased. It became more a problem
of getting the airfields constructed rapidly in
the now adequate space available. The system
adopted for constructing airfields near the front
line was to prepare dirt strips 15-20 miles to the
rear of the ground forces. These strips were
then visited by transport aircraft, which
dumped stores and tools there. As a general
tule, fighter strips were 50-70 miles behind the
front line, and bomber strips 100-120 miles
behind. As the ground forces moved forward,
so the dirt strips previously prepared were con-
structed as airfields and became bases for

fighters and later for bombers.

429. The position at the end of June (D +
) was as follows:— .

(i) In the British Sector—1o airfields
completed at Bazenville, St. Croix sur Mer,
Beny sur Mer, Camilly, Coulombs,
Martragny, Sommervieu, Lantheuil, Plume-
tot, Longues. 1 airfield was under construc-
tion at Ellon. .

(ii) In the American Sector.—7 airfields
completed at St. Pierre du Mont, Criqueville,
Cordonville, Deux Jamaux, Benzeville, Axe-
ville and Carentan. 4 under construction and
75 per cent. completed at Chippelle, Picau-
ville, Le Moly and Creteville.
