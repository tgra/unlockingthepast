SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 12 FEBRUARY, 1948

(¢) FoRTBASE assumed responsibility for
general administration of all ports and
beaches in eastern Sicily under command of
Fifteenth Army Group, whilst local adminis-
tration in eastern Sicily was carried out by
Eighth Army through the various Base Areas
and Sub-Areas.

This organisation proved entirely ,satisfactory
under the particular circumstances involving

1025

the capture of an island by two armies main-
tained initially on two separate supply axes
with a view to a further advance across the
sea to the mainland of Italy. It would, how-
ever, have been more satisfactory if Palermo
had been taken over immediately after capture

-by the United States Island Base Section. The

Army Administrative Staff would then have
been free to devote its attention entirely to the
maintenance of formations in battle.
