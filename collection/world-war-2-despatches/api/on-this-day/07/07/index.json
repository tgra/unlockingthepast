This division was incorporated in the 30th Corps, in command of which Major-General Ramsden succeeded Lieutenant-Genera] Norrie on the 7th July. The enemy now began to move tanks and other troops-round the left flank of the 13th Corps which had been stretched as far west as Deir el Harra. Our front was now much extended and loosely knit.

The enemy took advantage of this to extend his positions to the south and east and, on the gth July, he occupied our defensive locality near Deir el Qattara, which had been evacuated in accordance with my policy of avoiding the isolation of troops in detached posts. The enemy continued to exert pressure on this flank and eventually pushed as far east as Qaret el] Himeimat, but"
