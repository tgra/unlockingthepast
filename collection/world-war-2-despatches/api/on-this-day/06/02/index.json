The fighting condition of the tr ops was now such that prolonged resistance was out of the question and the present front could not in his opinion be maintained after.the night 1st/2nd June: furthermore the line to be held was so close to the beach and to Dunkirk that the enemy might soon stop all further evacuation by short range artillery fire. He gave the same opinion to the Secretary of State and received a reply that the British force should be withdrawn as rapidly as possible on a basis of equal numbers of British and French continuing to be embarked from that time onward. This he showed to Admiral Abrial and General Fagalde informing -them that he would hold the sector allotted to him till midnight 1st/2nd June and then withdraw under cover of darkness.

In the south the enemy were holding, on both banks, the foot-bridge which crossed the river where the road met it. A gallant attempt was made to rush this foot bridge but was repulsed with some loss of life. The Brigadier therefore decided on crossing  with the few assault boats available, some three miles south of the footbridge. On 2nd June three platoons of sth K.A.R. were able to get across, and to establish a precarious bridgehead. In spite of heavy  Shelling and the fact that no means existed for",

In addition to the heavy scale of air attack during the afternoon the sea traffic was very seriously interrupted by artillery fire brought to bear on Route X near No. 5 buoy. The fire appeared to be accurate and it is believed some French ships were sunk. Two French destroyers in the vicinity stopped British ships approaching from England on X Route short of this point, and it became evident that a very serious threat to daylight evacuation was in being.. Meantime, the toll of casualties of ships during the day was mounting, particularly amongst the destroyers and shortly after midday the Commander-in-Chief, Nore, called the attention of the Admiralty to this, suggesting the discontinuation of the use of destroyers by day off the French coast. The summarisation of all these incidents led to the Admiralty directing the Vice Admiral, Dover, to suspend evacuation from Dunkirk at 0700, Sunday 2nd June, and for it to be resumed the following night or from 1730/2, depending upon the circumstances. From the above it will be seen that there were to be no ships proceeding to Dunkirk between 0700/2 and 1730/2. The above Admiralty directions crossed a message from the Vice Admiral] stating that all ships had been ordered to withdraw from Dunkirk before daylight the following day, owing to the heavy casualties to shipping.",

II Corps was to secure the -high ground north of Valmontone, seize the northern part of the Alban Hills and pursue any enemy attempting to withdraw northwards across its front. -The Germans were still resisting desperately and still apparently with the same orders, to keep us out of Rome at all costs. Even now, with Fifth Army on the Alban Hills and their centre disintegrating under Eighth Army's blows, they continued to hope that the situation might yet be stabilized; captured enemy documents show that as late as 2nd June von Mackensen was still ordering resistance to the last and making plans for the redisposition of his forces with apparent confidence in the possibility of success.
