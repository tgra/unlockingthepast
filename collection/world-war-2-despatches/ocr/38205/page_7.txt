SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 FEBRUARY, 1048

junctions covering I Division’s beaches. On
the left of the Army front 3 Infantry Division,
with a Combat Command of 2 Armoured
Division, was to land in the area of Licata
and capture the port and airfield. To support
either of these assaulting forces a floating
reserve sailed with the Army, consisting of the
remainder of 2 Armoured Division and one
Regimental Combat Team of 1 Infantry Divi-
sion. In reserve in North Africa was the re-
mainder of 82 Airborne Division, less those
elements which had already been dropped
before the landings, and 9 Infantry Division.
‘The frontage of attack of the two Armies
covered about a hundred miles, from Cape
Murro di Porco to Licata.

The problem of assembling these forces for
a simultaneous assault was perhaps the most
complicated that ever faced a planning staff,
for they were mounted from all over the
southern and eastern shores of the Mediterra-
nean and in part from the Umited Kingdom
and United States. Of the British forces 5 and
50 Divisions and 231 Infantry Brigade came
from Suez in ships; 51 Division came from
Tunisia in craft and part of it staged at Malta
en route, 1 Canadian Division sailed from the
Umted Kingdom in two ship convoys.
78 Division, earmarked for reserve, was waiting
in the Sousse—Sfax area to be ferried across
in craft. Seventh Army used the ports west
of Tunis. 1 Division came from the Algiers
area, partly in ships and partly in craft;
3 Division from Bizerta and 2 Armoured and
9 Divisions from Oran, again partly in ships
and partly in craft; 45 Division came from the
United States, staging in the Oran area. Both
the airborne divisions, I British and 82 United
States, were based on Kairouan in Tunisia.
From the command point of view also there
was extreme dispersion. My Headquarters was
originally near Algiers and later at La Marsa,
near Carthage, with a small Tactical Head-
quarters on Malta. Seventh Army Head-
quarters was near Oran for the planning stage,
subsequently moving to Bizerta, Eighth Army
Headquarters was originally in Cairo and
moved to Malta for the assault; Admiral
Cunningham established his Headquarters also
in Malta, and Mediterranean Air Command
Headquarters and the Headquarters of the
Tactical and Strategic Air Forces were all
grouped around Carthage, adjacent to my main
Headquarters.

Traimng was carried out at a number of
different stations; it was not as thorough as I
should have liked, but the pressing considera-
tions of time and shortage of craft imposed
serious _ limitations. The British forces
mounted from Middle East carried out ‘‘ dry-
shod ’’* training in the desert and had some
very incomplete landing rehearsals in the Gulf
of Agaba. The Canadian Division had been
well trained in the United Kingdom but its
attempted exercise on the Ayrshire coast had
to be cancelled as soon as it had begun owing
to bad weather. 51 Division, which had no
previous training or ‘éxperience in combined
operations, was put through a short course at
Dyidjelli, much hampered by shortage of craft.

* “Dryshod '' was a technical term mea#ing
exercises carned out op land simulating landings
from craft.

The American 3 Division trained at Bizerta and
La Goulette and 1 Infantry and 2 Armoured
Divisions at the old established training area
of Arzew, near Algiers. 45 Division had been
trained in Chesapeake Bay before embarking,
and had a short rehearsal at Arzew after their
armval in North African waters.

The tasks of the Naval forces (British and
United States) fell under four main heads: the
cover of the whole operation against inter-
ference by enemy naval forces, the close sup-
port of the convoys to their destination and
the delivery of the troops to the beaches, close
support of the landings by gunfire, and the
maintenance by sea of the forces landed, in-
cluding the protection of shipping off the
beaches. The Naval Covering Force, consist-
ing of four battleships, two aircraft carriers,
four cruisers and some eighteen destroyers,
was concentrated in the Ioman Sea by gth July.
In this position it was well placed to meet any
threat from the Italian Taranto fleet, or from
the Spezia fleet af it should attempt to reim-
force through the Straits of Messina. ‘An addi-
tional force of two battleships, two cruisers and
six destroyers, based at Algiers, provided cover
for convoys on the North African coast and
constituted a reserve for the reinforcement or
relief of the covering force if required. A light
covering force of cruisers and destroyers’ was
despatched on gth July to protect the northern
flank of Eighth Army. The main bases of this
covering force were Mers-el-Kebir, Alexandria
and Malta, with fuelling and ammunitioning
facilities at Tobruk and at Benghazi.

For the air forces of Mediterranean Air Com-
mand the battle for Sicily could be said to have
begun with the last minute of the battle for
Tunisia, or even, to some extent, still earlier,
and D-day represented merely a peak of in-
tensity. They were faced first by an admin-
istrative problem After the enemy surrender
in Tunisia many air force units required rest
and refitting and an extensive programme of
airfield construction in northern Tunisia was
put in hand. Although, therefore, preparatory
bombing of enemy installations began at once
it was not intended to apply more than steady
pressure until] about one week before the
assault. During the preparatory phase targets
were mainly strategic but a steady programme
of interference with the enemy ground and air
build-up in Sicily was carried out. A particu-
larly heavy scale of attack was directed against
the Messina rail ferry By rst June only one
of the original five ferry boats was still in opera-
tion and the harbour facilities at both ends
were very heavily damaged. The traffic was
continued by lighters and small craft. From
about [ID minus 7 the air forces went over to a
concentrated and powerful attack on the enemy
air force; enemy airfields in the island were
attacked both by bomber aircraft and, where
within range, by fighter sweeps Radar installa-
tions, which would give warning of the
approaching invasion fleets, were also success-
fully attacked. ‘We were thus able to ensure
air superiority over the landing beaches and
very shorily, when the captured airfields in the
south-east came into use, over the whole island.
The total aircraft, including transports but ex-
cluding gliders, employed in the operation came
to over four thousand, divided into one hundred
and ten British and one hundred and’ thirty-
two American squadrons.
