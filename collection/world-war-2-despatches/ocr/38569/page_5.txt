brought success to our undertaking. The em-
bodiment of that spirit was exemplified in our
Commander-in-Chief,
Eisenhower; we counted it a privilege to
follow in his train.

8th December, 1942.

The following report on Operation “ Torch ”
is forwarded.

2. In compliance with Admiralty instruc-
.tions I'hoisted my Flag as Flag Officer, Force
“BE”, in H.M.S. BULOLO at Greenock at
0800 on 14th October, 1942.

3. Most ships who were to form the fast
and slow convoys, K.M.F.1 and K.M‘S.1 res-
pectively, had assembled in the Clyde area by
17th October. I took the opportunity on this
and succeeding days of visiting all L.S.Is*,
with General Ryder, U.S. Army (in command
of the assault on Algiers) and Major-General
V. Evelegh, O.B.E. (in command of the Brit-
ish 78th Division), and spoke briefly to the
ships’ companies, landing craft crews, beach
parties, and military and R.A.F. personnel
embarked. 4

4. Whilst in the Clyde every endeavour was
made to exercise both naval and military per-
sonnel and to prepare them for the parts they
would be required to play in the operation.
In this connection great difficulty was experi-
enced by the Senior ‘Naval Officers of Land-
ing in making contact with the M.T. ships of
the slow convoy ; this was due partly to delay
in preparing ships and concentrating them and
partly to the fact that berths were many miles
apart. In the event, it proved impossible for
the M.T. ships and their landing craft to be
exercised at all.,

5. H.M.S. BERMUDA and all Hunt class
destroyers taking part in the operation carried
out practice bombardments on the Arran
range. All destroyers’ who were available
were also given bombardment communica-
om exercises with their own military F.O.O.st

ore. :

6. On 17th October, the Fleet minesweepers
ACUTE (Commander M/S), CADMUS,
ROTHER, SPEY, ALARM, ALBACORE,
ALGERINE, HUSSAR and SPEEDWELL
were exercised in special night sweeping opera-
tions which included the laying of lit danst.
These exercises were designed: as far as pos-
sible to reproduce the actual requirements of
the operation and proved most valuable.

“7. On the night of 20th/2ist October,
Exercise “Flaxman”, which had been pre-
pared by the staff of Rear-Admiral Combined

Operations, was carried out in the Loch Fyne.
area, Owing to many ships not being avail--
able, “ Flaxman”, which was designed to ex-
ercise fully all ships, military and R.A.F. per-
sonnel and units in combined operations, was
on a very reduced scale. Moreover, as it was
urgently necessary to conserve landing craft,
which could not be replaced if damaged, only,
a minimum of troops, vehicles and equipment
could be landed. In consequence, communi-
cation with the beaches was bad and little in-
formation of what was going on was received
in the H.Q. Ship. Discussions on return to
Greenock proved that while the exercise had
been of value to the S.N.O.L.s,* military,
landing craft crews and beach parties, etc.,
it was quite inadequate owing to the restric-

tions which had to be imposed.

8. On 22nd October, Convoy Conference for
K.M.S.1 was held on board H.M.S. AVEN-
GER ; and on 25th October, the Convoy Con-
ference for K.M-F. 1 was held on board the
REINA DEL PACIFICO. At both these con-
ferences the orders for the operation were gone
through in detail with the Commanding Offi-
cers of naval forces and the Masters and.
S.N.O. (T)sf of Red Ensign ships. :

From U.K. to passage of Straits.

9. Convoy K.M.S.1 sailed from the Clyde on
22nd October, 1942. At 2100 B.S.T. on 26th
October, I sailed in H.M.S. BULOLO with
Convoy K.M.F.1 from the Clyde in single line
ahead at 9 knots.

10. In view of the danger of moored mines,
the Fleet minesweepers and twin-screw cor-
vettes escorting K.M.S.1 and K.M.F.1 carried
out Oropesa search ahead of both convoys
from longitude 06° W. to the 100 fathom line.
The search was made with double Oropesa in
“Hf” formation and covered a 3 mile front
5 miles ahead of leading ships of the convoys.

11. At 0900 on 27th October, H.M.S. SHEF-
FIELD, wearing the Flag of Rear-Admiral
C. H. J. Harcourt, C.B.E., Rear-Admiral Com-
manding, 10th Cruiser Squadron, joined
K.MF.1 with the escort from Belfast, where
she had embarked some 600 U.S. troops under
the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Swenson,
U.S. Army, and 50 naval ratings commanded
by Captain H. St, J. Fancourt, R.N., who were
to take part in the direct assault on Algiers
(Operation “ Terminal ”).

12. The passage of the convoy from the
United Kingdom to the rendezvous with the
additional escort off Cape St. Vincent, and
the division of the convoy into K.M.F.A.1 and
K.M.F.O.1 on 4th November, was wholly suc-
cessful, and there is reason to believe that the
convoy was never sighted or reported by
U-Boats.

13. From 30th October to 3rd November,
A/St patrols:‘were flown from H.M.S. BITER,
and at 1700 on 30th October a Sword!
sighted a U-Boat on the surface 25 miles, 270°

‘from the convoy. The' U-Boat dived‘ before

the aircraft could attack, but the aircraft kept

him down for sufficient time to enable the con-

voy to pass unreported. BITER’s last Sword-

fish became unserviceable landing on in a swell

after the dusk patrol.on 3rd November. No

A/S air patrol was provided on 4th November
