59. By the time JAMAICA ceased firing all
cruisers were out of range and the destroyers
had not yet been seriously engaged by the
enemy. The gun duel between DUKE OF
YORK and SCHARNHORST continued until
18z0 when SCHARNHORST ceased firing at
20,000 yards probably due to a hit by DUKE
OF YORK which reduced her speed, although
this was not apparent at the time. DUKE OF
YORK checked fire at 1844 when the range
had opened to 21,400 yards.

Screen OF FoRcE 2.

60. At this time it seemed quite probable
that SCHARNHORST would escape and much
depended upon the four ‘‘ S ’’ class destroyers.
At 1713 they had ‘been ordered to attack with
torpedoes and I could now see them on my
radar very slowly gaining bearing on SCHARN-
HORST waiting for her to make an appreci-
able alteration of course to allow them to
attack. By 1820 they had closed in to 12,000
yards but were gaining little. At this time
they started to forge ahead and this must have
been due to the DUKE OF YORK’s hit which
teduced SCHARNHORST’S speed and has
already been referred to. This was borne out
by the radar plot and the fact that she ceased
firing at this time.

61. As the effect of this was not apparent for
some time I had already decided to turn towards
the Norwegian coast, hoping the enemy would
also lead round and so give my destroyers
a chance to attack. When, however, I saw the
speed reduction I jturned in straight at the
SCHARNHORST.

62. By 1840 the first sub-division (SAVAGE
and SAUMAREZ) astern of the enemy and the
second sub-division (SCORPION and STORD)
on her starboard beam had closed in to about
r0,000 yards. At this time SCHARNHORST
opened up a fairly heavy though ineffective fire
on SAVAGE and SAUMAREZ which the two
destroyers returned when the range closed to
7,000 yards. That both sub-divisions were not
engaged by even heavier fire and considerably
earlier on appears, from prisoners’ statements,
to have been due to the muddled handling of
the SCHARNHORST’S A.A. and secondary
armament. When DUKE OF YORK first
engaged the enemy SCHARNHORST’S A.A.
armament (4.1 in. guns’ crews and below) were
ordered to take cover, leaving only a skeleton
«ew at the and this order never appears
to have been countermanded. The secondary
armament, on the other hand, seems to have
suffered from considerable disagreement between
the ship’s gunnery officers, resulting in a series
of contradictory orders.

63. While the first sub-division to the north-
westward, and still closing rapidly, was drawing
the enemy’s fire, the second sub-division closed
in apparently unseen and certainly unengaged
from the south eastward. At 1849 the enemy,
his speed now definitely reduced, was illumi-
nated by the first sub-division’s starshells and
was considered by SCORPION to be altering
course to southward. This alteration may have
been to avoid torpedoes fired by STORD wha
at this moment was turning to fire. SCORPION
immediately turned and fired 8 torpedoes at
2,100 yards and STORD 8 at 1,800 yards.
SCORPION claimed one hit, STORD none,

probably due to the fact that SCHARNHORST
combed the tracks) SCHARNHORST con-
tinued to alter round to starboard after this
attack thus placing the first sub-division,
attacking a few minutes later, in an excellent
position on her starboard bow. The second
sub-division was engaged by the enemy’s
secondary and lighter armament while retiring
but the firing was wild and no damage was
incurred. Both destroyers replied to the
enemy’s fire and scored several hits on her
superstructure.

64. At 1851 SCHARNHORST was clearly
seen by the first sub-division in their own star-
shell to be altering to a southerly and then,
after the second sub-division’s attack, to a
south westerly course. SAVAGE with
SAUMAREZ on her starboard quarter both
hastily trained, their tubes to starboard and
turned in to attack at 1855 when on the star-
board bow of SCHARNHORST; SAVAGE
fired 8 torpedoes at a range of 3,500 yards and
SAUMAREZ, under heavy fire and only able
to train one set of tubes owing to casualties
and damage, 4 torpedoes at about 1,800 yards.
Both destroyers came under heavy fire from
the enemy’s entire armament as they attacked
and both ships returned the fire as they retired
to the northward. SAVAGE was undamaged
but SAUMAREZ suffered damage, fortunately
above the waterline, and casualties. Shells
passed through her director and under her
tange-finder director without exploding but she
suffered considerable splinter damage which
reduced her speed to 10 knots on one engine
only. One officer and ten ratings were killed
and eleven ratings wounded. Three hits were
observed from SAVAGE and one from
SAUMAREZ. From subsequent analysis it”
seems probable that the first sub-division scored
three hits altogether though it is not possible
to say from which destroyers the torpedoes
were fired.

65. This gallant attack was practically
unsupported and carried out, particularly in
the case of the first sub-division, in the face of
heavy fire from the enemy. Three heavy under-
water explosions were heard in DUKE OF
YORK and six in BELFAST during this time.
Prisoners state that at least three hits were
scored and that the ship’s company were
generally aghast at the relentless attack by what
turned out to be four destroyers. They attri-
buted the success of the attack mainly to the
bad handling of SCHARNHORST’S secondary
and A.A. armament. One torpedo appears to
have hit in a boiler room and damaged a shaft
which immediately reduced the enemy’s' speed
to 22 knots; another is said to have flooded
several compartments aft. After their attacks the
destroyers withdrew to the northward and
SCHARNHORST steadied temporarily on a
southerly course, still making good about 20
knots though this speed slowly decreased as
Force 2 closed in from the west to re-engage.

Seconp ENGAGEMENT BY Force 2.

66. During the destroyer attack Force 2
closed the enemy rapidly and as the destroyers
withdrew to the northward, DUKE OF YORK
and JAMAICA re-engaged at 1901 at a range
of 10,400 yards, the enemy still steering to the
southward. Soon afterwards NORFOLK
opened fire but checked after two salvos owing
to difficulty in finding the right target. Hits
