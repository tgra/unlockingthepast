(@) Work of the submarimes.—Information
has not yet been received of the results
obtained by the submarine patrols co-operat-
ing in this operation. There is good ground
to believe that the marked inactivity of the
Italian surface forces may have been due to
the marked activity of our submarines.

(e) Tactical and fighting efficiency,—
Although a great number of the ships taking
part had not operated in company previously
and some were newly commissioned, it was
satisfactory to note the good standard ol
efficiency displayed. Nevertheless it must be
appreciated that the highest standard canno:
be achieved unless ships have opportunity to
work together in company and to exercise the
movements and action required to deal with
the situations which anse dunng operations of
this nature.

(f) Behaviour of M.T. ships.—The Rear-
Admiral Commanding, 18th Cruiser Squadron

reports ‘‘that the operation was successfully”

carried out 1s due in no small measure to the

behaviour of the merchant ships in convoy.

Their manceuvring and general conduct was

excellent and caused me no anxiety whatevei.

I had complete confidence that orders given

to. them by me would be understood and

prompily carried out. Their steadfast and
resolute behaviour during air and E-Boat
attacks was most impressive and encouraging
to us all. Particular credit is due to
S.S. MELBOURNE STAR, Commodore of
the convoy,* who set a high standard and
never failed to appreciate directly what he
should do. S.S. DURHAM experienced piston
trouble im her port engine and it was evident
that her engines required careful nursing.

Nevertheless, she was able to maintain a speed

of 14 knots throughout the critical period on

D.3 and D.4, which was only 1 knot less

than her accredited maximum speed.”

10g. The Air Officer Commanding, Medi-
terranean and Officer Commanding, 200 Group,
R.A.F. afforded most valuable air co-opera-
tion which contributed in no mean measure to
the success of the operation.

IIo. It was with considerable surprise that I
learned on arrival at Gibraltar that a number
of women and children had been embarked in
the ships of Convoy M.G.1. Had I known this
earlier, I should certainly have sent a destroyer
to escort each group.

SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 AUGUST, 1948

The preliminary discussions, arrangements

a

and movements in connection with the opera- , ',

tion, which was designed to secure the passage
of H.M.S. BRECONSHIRE* and 8 M.T. ships.
to Malta, have been dealt with in previous
reports of proceedings. This report deals with
the period from r800A on 24th September
(D.-—1x) until the completion of the opera-
tion.

Situation at 1800A on 24th September (D. —1).

2. The situation at 1800 on 24th September /

was as follows: —

(a) Convoy W.S.11X, consisting of H.M.
Ships BRECONSHIRE (Commodore),
QUEEN EMMA, PRINCESS BEATRIX,
ULSTER MONARCH, ROYAL SCOTS-
MAN, and S.S. IMPERIAL STAR (Vice-
Commodore), ROWALLAN CASTLE (Rear-
Commodore), CLAN MACDONALD, CLAN
FERGUSON, AJAX, LEINSTER, CITY
OF LINCOLN, DUNEDIN STAR and
CITY OF CALCUTTA, with PRINCE OF
WALES (Vice-Admiral, 2nd-in-Command,
Home Fleet), EDINBURGH (Rear-Admiral
Commanding, 18th Cruiser Squadron),
KENYA (Rear-Admiral Commanding, roth
Cruiser Squadron),f EURYALUS, SHEF-
FIELD, and the destroyers LAFOREY
(Captam (D), 19th. Destroyer Flotilla),
LIGHTNING, ORIBI, COSSACK (Captain
(D), 4th Destroyer Flotilla), FORY, FARN-
DALE and HEYTHROP in company, were
to the westward of the Straits of Gibraltar,
steering east, to pass south of Europa Point
at 0130A on 25th September. .

_(b) At Gibraltar:__NELSON, RODNEY,
ARK ROYAL, HERMIONE, the destroyers.
ISAAC SWEERS, PIORUN, GARLAND,
DUNCAN (Captain (D), 13th Destroyer
Flotilla), | FORESIGHT, FORESTER,
LIVELY, LEGION and the oiler BROWN
RANGER with her escort FLEUR DE LYS.

(c) Approaching Gibraltar Bay from the
westward:_ZULU, GURKHA and LANCE.

3. NELSON, screened by ISAAC SWEERS,
PIORUN and GARLAND, sailed to the west-
ward at 1815. .The Flag of the Flag Officer
Commanding, Force H, had been hoisted in
RODNEY as a ruse to give the impression that
NELSON, on relief by RODNEY, was sailing
to the westward for the United Kingdom Fare-
well messages were passed between NELSON
and RODNEY to assist the deception. This,
Tuse appears to have created the desired
impression.

4. After NELSON had cleared the entrance,
GURKHA, ZULU and LANCE, who had been
detached by the Vice-Admiral, 2nd-in-Com-
mand, Home Fleet to proceed ahead of the
convoy to fuel at Gibraltar, entered harbour.
