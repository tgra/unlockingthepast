Even then training was a limiting factor, The Middle East Defence Committee thought it well to stress the point made by General Nye that 15th May was only a tentative date dependent upon the rate at which the enemy could build up his tank strength.

I also discussed the organisation of the second position on the Senne canal and of a Corps reserve line east of Brussels. 5th and 48th Divisions were ordered to reconnoitre the Senne position on 15th May.

On the British front, the day passed quietly on the whole. 1st Corps was not attacked in strength ; 3rd Division of znd Corps was attacked north-west of Louvain and its forward positions were penetrated, but a counterattack successfully restored the original line. There was considerable enemy bombing of rearward areas during the day, and the movement of refugees became increasingly difficult to control, This was, in part, due to the bombing of Tournai and other towns on the routes and to the French decision to close the frontier to pedestrian and horsed traffic. Despite my requests, made as early as roth May, the Belgian authorities had done nothing to restrict the use of private motor cars or the sale of petrol.",

Directly Akyab Island was occupied, work began on expanding the existing allweather airfield so that it could accommodate three transport and three and a half tactical squadrons, with a target completion date of the 15th May.. At the same time, to meet the immediate and pressing needs of Fourteenth Anny, a fair-weather transport field for two squadrons was constructed and opened on the 17th February. Two tactical strips were also made. Fourteenth Army's rapid progress, however, made further demands on the airfield development of Akyab. A second fair-weather transport strip was called for, and an advance on the completion date for the all-weather airfield, and finally an increase in the operational capacity of the latter was required. Despite many difficulties this programme of work was completed ahead of schedule. The works on Akyab Island were begun by the Chief Engineer, 15 Indian Corps, but early in February, the responsibility was taken over by the commander of an Army Group Royal Engineers, working directly under my Chief Engineer.",

Although flying was certain to be intermittent and hazardous, air supply became often the only practicable means, but it was entirely dependent on allweather airfields. Al] administrative planning had to include provision for the continuance of adequate maintenance under monsoon conditions. The absolute importance of completing the construction of all-weather airfields for supply aircraft before the monsoon was therefore obvious.",

These dates were, however, not nearly early enough to support Fourteenth Army's rapid advance and it became necessary to develop fair-weather airfields and to put them into operation simultaneously with the construction of the all-weather ones. Two squadrons of C.47 aircraft began supply operations from Akyab on the 20th March, with No, 1 R.A.M.O. which had been switched from Imphal, and a further two squadrons by- the end of the month. Half a squadron operated from Kyaukpyu during April for the supply of troops in Arakan only.
