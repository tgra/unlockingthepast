My experience is that our staff system and system of command 1s too cumbrous and over elaborated, and needs revision. We have lost the merit of simplicity in our system of command, in our tactics and in our equipment, by always trying to provide for every possible contingency.

52. Next to the British, I have had most te do with the Indian soldier, and owe much to him. In this war he has shown in addition to his proved fighting qualities a remarkable ability to adapt himself to the complexities of modern war and to learn new weapons and new methods.

53. I have had the honour to have had placed under my command during this war troops of many other nationalities: Australian, New Zealand, South African, American, French, Polish, Czech, Greek, Dutch, Sudanese, East African, West African, Burmese, Chinese. To them all I tender my gratitude and respect.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

54. During the two years I have been Commander-in-Chief in India, I have been most fortunate in having the support and advice of a great and wise man, His Excellency the Vicetoy and Governor-General, the Marquess of Linlithgow. I offer him my grateful thanks.

55. During the period under review, the

Commander of the Eastern Army Lieutenant- 

General N. M. S. Irwin, C.B., D.S.O., M.C. held a most difficult post, with heavy and extended responsibilities both for command and administration. In spite of frequent ill-health, he carried out his task with great energy and devotion to duty.

56. I am indebted to the Commander-inChief, Eastern Fleet, Admiral Sir James F. Somerville, K.C B., K.B.E., D.S.O., for his ready help in all matters which were within his resources; these did not unfortunately allow of the Eastern Fleet supporting the operations in Arakan.

57. Air-Chief-Marshal Sir Richard E. C. Peirse, K.C.B., D.S.0., A.F.C., has always given me the closest possible support of the Air Force, and has helped me in every possible way. We have worked closely together for nearly 24 years, and I shall greatly value the association.

58. I have acknowledged the services of my principal assistants and staff in paragraphs 41 to 43 of my last despatch.* They continued to give me most able and loyal support during the period under review.

59. A list of recommendations for honours and awards has already been submitted and approved.
