The convoy, composed of 8 transports escorted by H.M.A.S, Yarra, was met at sea by H.M.S. Seabelle from Basra on the morning of 15th April. Later in the day the escort was reinforced by H.M.S. Falmouth who became S.O. (Escort). On 17th April the convoy was joined by H.M.1.S. Lawrence and proceeded towards the entrance of the Shat-el-Arab. The following day the convoy moved up the Shatel-Arab and arrived at Basra at og30 hrs. H.M.S. Emerald was already in Basra."

            "description": "15. Early in the new year, I visited Cairo in order to discuss the question of reinforcement which was then under revision. Operations in the Western Desert were being brought to a successful conclusion and it was hoped that, by the time the weather conditions had improved in Greece so as to allow occupation of more aerodromes, it would be hg to spare additional squadrons from the Middle East Command. The reinforcement plan envisaged a total force in Greece of fourteen squadrons and I intimated that I would be prepared to start accepting the additional squadrons by r5th January.  It was hoped that the whole programme would be complete by 15th April. In planning the reinforcement programme, I again endeavoured to get permission to use the aerodromes in the Salonika area, some of which had remained generally serviceable throughout the winter and could be occupied forthwith. The Germans, however, had commenced their infiltration into Roumania, and the Greek Government were particularly anxious to avoid giving them any idea that we had any hostile intentions in Macedonia which could be directed only against German interests."

On 15th April, the main effort of the German Air Force was directed against our air force, which had been delaying their military operations and had taken toll of their aircraft. Large numbers of short range fighters made their appearance over the Larissa plain and ground straffed Niamata. In spite of A.A., every aircraft of the Blenheim squadron located there was destroyed. Owing to the breakdown of the Greek observer system, our fighters were at a hopeless disadvantage. When, on one occasion, Me. rogs appeared over their aerodrome at Larissa without any warning, three Hurricanes were attacked whilst taking off and two were shot down. The third shot down one Me. r09. Although, when our fighters were able to get off, they played havoc with the enemy, the situation was obviously untenable. I was present on the Larissa aerodrome whilst this attack was in progress and I ordered the Squntions to withdraw to the Athens area forthwith. ."

Zarzis and Gabes proved to be of little value and Sousse was, in fact, not used for Eighth Army maintenance. But Sfax, which was occupied on roth April, was of considerable value. Although the channel was partially blocked, it could be used by light-draught vessels and on 15th April, 1,300 tons were discharged at this port. Oceangoing ships were loaded in the Delta for Sfax and sailed for Tripoli where they were lightened to meet the draught restriction of Sfax and were then called forward, together with such local tonnage as was available. Although limited by a shortage of powered harbour-craft (which was a limiting factor at Tripoli also), , this system enabled a total of over 40,000 tons ~ to be discharged at Sfax by the end of the campaign, an average of over 1,300 tons a day. This, together with the discharge at Tripoli, gave a daily average discharge of stores and supplies from Middle East of over 5,000 tons including bulk petrol."

Meanwhile 146th Infantry Brigade had been ordered, while at sea, to go to Namsos instead of Narvik, but it was evident that the landing of these troops direct from transports was not a feasible operation at Namsos, and that they would have to be transferred to destroyers at Lillesjone and then taken to Namsos on two successive days."

Disembarkation of personnel was done for the most part while ships were in Bygden anchorage and to facilitate this work PROTECTOR and destroyers had to be used. Large numbers of local craft were hired for this and other water transport purposes in the whole area of the operations but were not always reliable as, upon sound of an air raid warning, they scattered away into the fiords and took a considerable time to return afterwards. During the 8 weeks of the operations there were over 140 air raids in Harstad causing a considerable loss of time and work. A withdrawal of the warning system resulted in a strike among the Norwegian labourers and small craft men. The subject of A/A measures and protection is dealt with in a separate chapter of this report. In addition to the landing at Harstad, troops were put ashore at Salangen in Sagfiord on the 15th April and contact was made with Norwegian forces in that area. Advance southward was effected from both places; the Headquarters of the 24th Brigade being established at Bogen in Ofotfiord later."

No great enemy pressure was developed against its positions, although on the morning of 15th April, determined small-scale attacks were made in both the Servia and the Katerini Passes. An attack on the positions of the 4th New Zealand Brigade in the Servia Pass was repulsed with the loss to the enemy of 180 prisoners and at least several hundred killed and wounded. Our losses were negligible. The Greek troops, which had been under General Wilson, had reverted to Greek command on the occupation of the new position."

General Wilson was anxious for the safety of his left flank during this new withdrawal, the more so as the Germans were known to have broken through the Greek troops at Kleisoura. Consequently, a force had to be found to block the roads leading southwards from the Grevena and Matsova areas into the Larissa Plain. Actually, no threat came from this flank and the main danger to the withdrawal arose from the speed with which the enemy followed it up from the north and from the heavy attack launched against a combined New Zealand and Australian force in the Peneios Gorge. This attack began late on 15th April and was pressed home by infantry and tanks, which proved to be the leading elements of one armoured and one mountain division. The 16th Australian Infantry Brigade which had been detailed to form a left flank guard on the Larissa-Kalabaka road was diverted, except for one battalion, to cover the western exit of the Peneios:Gorge and to afford support to the 21st New Zealand Battalion, which was holding the gorge alone. The attack was made in such strength as to necessitate the transference of the weight of the defence from west to east. The defence of the gorge was carried out with such spirit that when at last on the evening of 18th April the Germans were masters of the gorge, the main body of- the"

The preTequisite that the whole of the North African coastline should be cleared of the enemy meant that the battle in Tunisia took first priority and, until that was concluded, it would be impossible to know what resources would be available for the invasion of Sicily. The question of the date to be aimed at was also affected. It was calculated at Casablanca that the Tunisian campaign would be completed by Ist May and the target date for Sicily was provisionally fixed at the favourable moon period in July. The Combined Chiefs of Staff subsequently directed that an attempt should be made to advance this date to the corresponding period in June. This proved impossible, owing to the need for adequate training for the assaulting divisions and the preparation of the necessary administrative basis for the operation, and on 15th April the Combined Chiefs of Staff agreed that roth July should be the target date."

It was not possible to move my Headquarters to Kandy at this time, as the expansion and development of my Command necessitated maintaining the closest contact with G.H.Q. India, and so it was necessary to form an Advanced Headquarters, A.C.S.E.A., consisting of a Planning and Liaison Staff, to accompany H.Q. S.A.C.S.E.A. in its move to Kandy. Air Headquarters, India, was set up as an autonomous unit to control operations on the North-West Frontier and assume responsibility for the LAF., directly responsible under its own A.O.C. to C.-in-C. India. Eastern Air Command was established to co-ordinate air operations on the Burmese frontier. Its Headquarters moved on 15th April to Calcutta in order to maintain closer touch with its subordinate units the Strategic Air Force, Third Tactical Air Force, Troop Carrier Command and Photographic Reconnaissance Force. Thus administrative control of American units also gravitated to Calcutta, since this remained the responsibility of Major-General G. E. Stratemeyer in his other capacity, that of Commanding-General of the U.S.A.A-F, in the India-Burma Sector of the China-Burma-India Theatre."

An Army Air Support Control unit was taken by air from Poona to Jorhat for service with 33 Corps. The movement by air of the servicing echelons of tactical squadrons became a matter of routine. In regard to the maintenance of our troops, the most varied articles were delivered to the forces momentarily engulfed within the flood of Japanese infiltration. At Kohima, for instance, owing to the enemy seizure of the wells, it was necessary to drop drinking water as well as routine supplies and medical necessities. Three hundred and seventy tons of bitumenised hessian were delivered by air at Tulihal to make the airfield there all-weather. On the return journeys all transport aircraft brought out with them casualties or troops not needed for active combat."
