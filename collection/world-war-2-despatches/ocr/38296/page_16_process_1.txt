3116 ..8..On, hearing that. IMPERIAL. was quite

 unable to steet, C.S.7 reduced speed of- his

force to 15. knots. and gave HOTSPUR orders to take off all. IMPERIAL's troops. and crew and.then sink her.. This was successfully

- accomplished at 0445 and..HOTSPUR, who _ now had a total. of goo-men onboard, rejoined -

the squadron just after-daylight. . . ":  . The delay over IMPERIAL had caused

- Force B to be an hour and a half late on their

time  table  and it was not until sunrise that they tured to the southward through the Kaso Strait. Air attacks began at 0606 and.continued at intervals until 1500 when Force B was within io9  miles of  Alexandria.

to. At 0625 HEREWARD was hit by a bomb  which caused her to reduce speed and fall away from her position on the screen. The force was now.in the middle of Kaso Strait and C.S.7 again had to make the. difficult decision whether to wait, in order to assist HEREWARD or to leave her behind. He decided that to wait would be to invite further casualties. As HEREWARD' could then :be seen making for Crete, which was only five miles away, C.S.7 proceeded on his way. HEREWARD was last seen. making slowly towards the island, with her guns  ngaging enemy aircraft, .- | ...  

rr. Arrangements had been made for fighter protection to be provided at 0530 in the Kaso Strait  and C.S.7 had corrected, by  signal, his time of arrival in the Strait to 0630. It is believed that the fighters did reach the Strait at the corrected time but they were unable to make contact with the ships. wg

- 12. At 0645 DECOY reported fractured turbine feet and circulator damage, as the: result of a near miss. This caused the speed of the squadron to be reduced to 25.knots. At,

0700 a very close, miss on ORION caused a. . * further reduction to 2x knots,  .: i

13., Tlie Cornmander:in-Chief,. Meiliterranean,

 realised from C:S.7's signals that our fighters

had not yet appeared and every endeavour was made  to put this right. It is probable, however, that the aircraft had navigational difficulties as they were unable to make contact with the ships until 1200. By this time the force had suffered-severely. -At'o735 the Flag Captain in the ORION (Captain G. R. B. Back, Royal Navy) had  been severely wounded by an explosive bullet from a JU.87.and he died two hours later. At 08275 DIDO was'hit on  B   turret and three quarters of an hour later ORION was-hit on   A ?  turret, both by bombs from JU.87s. In each case the turrets were put out of action. At 1045 ORION was again attacked by rz JU.87s-and a bomb passed through her bridge putting the lower conning tower out of

  action, The force was then about 1oo miles

from Kaso and this was the last attack to be. made by the JU.87s. . : ;

- 14. The ORION had nearly 1,200 troops on

* board and the-casualties on the crowded mess-

decks were very heavy. ' Thr e of the Engineer Officers wer  kill d, all nortnal communication between bridge and  ngine room was destroyed,

the steering gear was put out of action and

three boiler rooms were-datnaged,, It is believed that a total of 260 were killed and"Z80 wounded.



. 15. ORION. was out.of control until the after steering wheel could be connected and a chain of men arranged to pass orders from the Emergency Conning Position to the wheel.  Owing to. contamination of the oil fuel with salt water, , ORION S speed varied between 12 and 25 knots but she was able to average about 2r knots. :

16..There was a  lull in the air attacks unti about 1300 when there was a high level att followed by another at 1330 and a final one fat 1500. . The first and only friendly fighters to /be seen were two Naval Fulmars which appeared at noon. Royal Air Force squadrons had made several attempts to find our ships and in  the course of a: number of engagements, had shot down two JU.88s for the loss of one Hurricane. One JU.87 was shot down by ships  gunfire.

 17. The force arrived at Alexandria at 2000 on the 29th May, ORION having only ten tons of fuel and two rounds of 6  H.E. ammunition

18. Whilst the troops were being taken off at Heraklion, destroyers were withdrawing a smaller party from Sphakia on the south coast of Crete. :

19. Sphakia is a small fishing village with one shingle beach, of which a stretch less than a cable in extent could be used for embarking in boats. The road over the mountains from Suda to Sphakia finished up with a series of - acute hairpin bends and came to an abrupt termitiation at the top of a 500 foot high escarpment. From this point a precipitous goat track led down to the village. It was necessary for the troops to remain hidden from air observation until actually called forward to embark. Touch between the beach area and the top of the escarpment had.to be maintained on foot as there was no signal communication.   The climb required at l ast two hours to complete.  ~

20. The Headquarters of the.General Officer Commanding, Troops in Crete and the Naval

 Officer-in-Charge, Suda, had been shifted to  a - cave near Sphakia. The portable W/T sets and

naval cyphers, which the Naval Officer-inCharge, Suda, had previously sent in M.L.1o1r from Suda to Sphakia, had gone down with the ship on the 24th May, as a result of air attack. A second W/T set was sent by lorry to Sphakia but as this set was  damaged, the Royal -Air Force W/T set at the Sphakia Headquarters was used for outside naval communications. -

21. Force C consisting of D.7 in NAPIER with NIZAM, KELVIN and KANDAHAR had left Alexandria, at o800 on the 28th May after embarking .additional whalers and some provisions and small arms for the troops ashore. After. an uneventful ;passage,.the force arrived off Sphakia and started the embarkation at 0030/29th May. |...  

_22. The embarkation . was completed by

0300/29th May  by  which time the four

destroyers had embarked #early 700 troops and had landed badly need d. rations for "15,000. Soon after  og00 on-the  29th: May, Force C  was attacked by four JU.88s.and NIZAM  suffered _ minor damage from a near miss. Fighter  pro-.. tection for Force g had been aed from | o! 2gth May and at 0940 a crashed, enemy,., pacrees sighted, probably shot down. by
