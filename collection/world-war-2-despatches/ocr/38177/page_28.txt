that the enemy armoured forces were defeated
or heavily embroiled, our forces would have
only infantry to compete with and mostly
Italian infantry at that.

When the armoured battle was over, the Ist
South African Division was to secure a posi-
tion about Sidi Rezegh to cut the Trigh
Capuzzo and the by-pass road and,: by
threatening the rear of the Axis forces investing
Tobruk, to assist the garrison in their sortie.
At the same time General Scobie was to strike
southwards to Ed Duda with the r4th and 16th
Infantry Brigades and the 32nd Army Tank
Brigade. Two feint attacks were to be made in
the western and southern sectors by the Polish
Carpathian Brigade and the 23rd Infantry
Brigade, and the main attack was to take place
soon after dawn on the day after the signal
was received from the 30th Corps.

After the relief of Tobruk the area was to be
cleared of enemy as rapidly as possible. The
goth Division and the 3zend Ammy Tank
Brigade were to work closely with the rst South
African Division in this task. The enemy was
then to ‘be pursued with the greatest energy.
The size of the pursuing force would depend
on the degree of stuccess achieved in the
armoured battle, and on the supply situation
at the time, In no circumstances was it likely
to be less than one armoured brigade and one
lorry-borne South African Infantry Brigade.
Should the enemy hold Mechili in such strength
as to hinder the pursuit, a special force was to
mask that place.

13th Corps. .

The task of.the 13th Corps was to pin down
and cut off the enemy troops holding the frontier
defences, and then to advance westwards to
help the 30th Corps to clear the battlefield,
leaving the enemy garrisons to be reduced at
leisure.

The 11th Indian Infantry Brigade below the
Sollum escarpment and the 5th Indian Infantry
Brigade above it were to contain the enemy
frontally, and to cover our base and railhead
by holding a line running south from Buq Buq.
Then, on the first day of the offensive, the 7th
Indian Infantry Brigade were to secure a posi-
tion astride the frontier to mask the enemy
positions at Sidi Omar.

The 13th Corps were to make no further
move until the enemy armoured forces had
been properly engaged and orders received from
the Army Commander. When the order was
given, the New Zealand Division was to advance
on a north and south axis to isolate the frontier
defences. Such troops as could then be spared
from this division were to move westwards,
coming under the command of the 30th Corps
for operations against Tobruk, if its relief
should not have been accomplished already.

If the enemy were to withdraw from his for-
ward positions, ‘the 13th Corps was to make
every effort to cut him off and, if this was un-
successful, to pursue him vigorously.

After the relief of Tobruk, General Godwin-
Austen was to be prepared to move a motorised
infantry brigade group to Derna.

Oases Force.

The primary task of the Oases Force was to
protect the air forces which were to harass the
enemy in the coastal sector south of Bengasi
and to cause confusion among advancing or
Tetiring enemy columns. The Oases Force had

SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 1948

orders in the first place to protect a landing
ground some eighty miles west of Giarabub
which was just within striking distance of the
coastal road, and in the second to move on
to Gialo to protect our air forces and harass
the enemy as circumstances permitted.

Brigadier ‘Reid had been instructed to con-
tinue with the deception scheme already in
train, so as to make the enemy believe that the
force was much stronger than it was and induce
him to divert or withdraw his armoured forces
to meet this threat. The force therefore in-
cluded a high proportion of guns and armoured
cars and was relatively weak in infantry.

‘One armoured car company of the 7th South
African Reconnaissance Battalion (Lieutenant-
Colonel P. H. Grobelaar) was to carry out a
raid against a target east of Giarabub and south
of the line Tobruk—Mechili, and cause the
maximum destruction. The target was to be
selected so as to produce the greatest possible
disruption in the enemy’s rear. After com-
pleting this operation, Lieutenant-Colonel
Grobelaar’s force was to operate under the
orders of Brigadier Reid.

Long Range Desert Group.

The Long Range Desert Group (Lieutenant-
Colonel G. L. Prendergast) was given the im-
portant role of observing enemy movement
along the tracks across the desert south of the
Gebel Akhdar to the main battle area and along
the approaches to Gialo from the north. With-
out prejudice to its primary role, it was to give
all possible assistance to Brigadier Reid and
to maintain communication with the South
African armoured cars.

As operations progressed, the Long Range
Desert Group was to move westwards and per-
form a similar observation role in Tripolitania.

Raids.

Raids were to be carried out to cause con-
fusion and alarm in the enemy’s rear by the
11th Scottish Commando (Lieutenant-Colonel
G. P, T. Keyes) and by ‘‘L”’ Section of the
ist Special Air Service Brigade.

The Approach March.

The concentration of the Eighth Army took
place during the first two weeks of November.
Only a bare minimum of troops had been
allowed in the forward area in order to keep
the daily maintenance needs as low as possible
and to enable the maximum amount of reserves
to be accumulated. The greater part of the
Army had therefore to be brought up during
this fortnight, and the movement of vehicles
across the desert was almost continuous. Yet
captured enemy intelligence papers revealed no
knowledge of what was happening: This praise-
worthy achievement was due both to the work
of the Royal Air Force in preventing enemy
aerial reconnaissance, and to the high degree
of camouflage, deception and dispersion
reached during the concentration.

By the evening of the 17th November all were
in place, and during the night the 7th Indian
Infantry Brigade took up its position masking
Sidi Omar. Soon after dawn on the 18th, the
armoured brigades, with an armoured car
screen thrown out far in front, crossed the
frontier wire fence near Maddalena, and by
evening had reached their battle positions

_astride the Trigh el Abd, except the 2and

Armoured Brigade which had been delayed and
‘halted ten miles south of its destination. The
