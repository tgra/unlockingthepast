SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 JANUARY, 1947

fell just outside the target area, but a num-
ber scored direct hits. The station was ren-
dered completely unserviceable.

(c) Dieppe/Bernaval le Grand. The
attack on this station on the night of and/
3rd June was completely successful. 104
aircraft dropped 607 tons of bombs. The
majority of the eight or nine blast-wall pro-
tected buildings received direct hits, and
the remainder suffered so many near misses
that their subseQuent operational value was
negligible. In addition, the aerial masts
were all demolished, and the two dispersed
sites were also hit.

(d) Cherbourg | Urville-Hague. This
station is now known to have been the head-
quarters of the German Signals Intelligence
Service in North-Western France. The
attack on this important W/T centre was
made on 3/4th June by 99 aircraft dropping
570 tons of bombs. The results were re-
markable, the centre of a very neat bomb
pattern coinciding almost exactly with the
centre of the target area. The photographic
interpretation report may be quoted ver-
batim:’

‘The station is completely useless.
The site itself is rendered unsuitable for
rebuilding the installation, without much
effort being expended in levelling and
filling in the craters.’’

x12. The success of this last attack on the
Headquarters of the German Air Force Signals
Intelligence must have been a major catas-
trophe for the enemy, and it may well be that
it was an important contributory factor to
the lack of enemy air reaction to the assault.

113. Radio Couriter-Measures. On the night
of 5/6th June in the opening’ phase of the
assault, counter-measures against such instal-
lations as were still active weze put into opera-
tion. These counter-measures covered five
separate and distinct tasks:—

°

(a) a combined naval/air diversion
against Cap d’Antifer:

(6) a_ combined naval/air diversion
against Boulogne:

(c) a jamming barrage to cover the air-
borne forces:

(@ a V.H.F. jamming support for the
first three counter-measures:

(e) feints for the airborne forces.

These various components of the counter-
measure plan were inter-dependent and the re-
sults can, therefore, best be summarised by
giving an indication of the enemy’s reactions.

114. The most important fact concerning this
reaction was that the enemy appeared to mis-
take the diversion towards Cap d’Antifer as a
genuine threat; at all events, the enemy opened
up, both with searchlights and guns on the
imaginary convoy. Further, the V.H.F.
jamming support which was flown by a forma-
tion of aircraft operating in the Somme area
apparently led the enemy to believe that these
aircraft were the spearhead of a major bomber
force, as he reacted with twenty-four night
fighters, which were active approximately
three hours, hunting the “‘ ghost ’’ bomber
stream.

115. The other counter-measures all ful-
filled their purpose and it can be stated that
the application of radio counter-measures
immediately preceding the assault proved to be
extraordinarily successful, Only three out of
the total number of 105 aircraft employed on
these operations were lost, and the crew of one
of these aircraft was saved.

116. While it is not possible to state with
certainty that the enemy was completely un-
aware of the cross1Channel movement of the
assault forces, the success of the plan to dis-
tupt his Radar cover and W/T facilities both
by attacks and by the application of counter-
measures, can tbe judged on the results
obtained. In the vital period between or00 and
0400 hours on 6th June, when the assault
Armada was nearing the beaches, only nine
enemy Radar installations- were in operation,
and during the whole night, the number of
stations active in the ‘‘ Neptune’’ area was
only 18 out of a normal 92. No station between
Le Havre and Barfleur was heard operating.
Apart from the abortive reaction mentioned
in paragraph 114, no enemy air attacks were
made ¢ill approximately 1500 hours on D-Day,
and this despite the presence of more than
2,000 ships and landing craft in the assault
area, and despite the fact that very large air-
bome forces had, of necessity, been routed
down the west coast of the Cherbourg
Peninsula right over the previously excellent
Radar cover of the Cherbourg area and the
Channel Islands.

117. These results may be summarised as
follows: the enemy did not obtain the early
warning of our approach that his Radar cover-
age should have made possible; there is every
reason to suppose that Radar controlled gun-
fire was interfered with; no fighter aircraft
hindered our airborne operations; the enemy
was confused and his troop movements were
delayed.

118. Prior to the launching of Operation
‘* Neptune ”’ each service had almost complete
freedom to use radio counter-measures, as de-
sired. To eliminate any clash of interests when
very large forces would be employed in con-
fined areas, an inter-Service staff was set up
at my Headquarters. The primary concern
being to get the Armada safely across the
Channel, it was agreed that for the 30-hour
period immediately prior to the moment of
assault, control should be vested in the Allied
Naval Commander-in-Chief; subsequently,
control of radio counter-measures became my
responsibility. The advisory staff with repre-
sentatives of the three Services, assisted both
oe Allied Naval.Commander-in-Chief and my-
self.

Attacks on Military Facilities

119. As well as preparing the way for the
assault forces by attacking the enemy’s coastal
defences and Radar system, it was planned to
prepare the way further for the landing by
reducing the enemy military potential, both’ in
the assault and rear areas. Certain ammuni-
tion and fuei dumps, military camps and head-
quarters were considered suitable targets for
attack, in order to fulfil this purpose.
