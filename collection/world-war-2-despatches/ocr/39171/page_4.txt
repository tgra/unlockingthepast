quently, even when cornered, he not only sells
his life dearly, but will frequently commit
suicide rather than surrender. The mopping-
up of captured enemy positions is, therefore,
a slow process, as every Japanese officer and
man has usually to be ferreted out and killed.
Since the crushing defeat inflicted on the
enemy in the Imphal battle, and the failure
of his lines of communication, there have
been a few surrenders of unwounded men,
but they are still rare.

13. To sum up, I would say that, although
his discipline and training are good, the
Japanese soldier has shown himself lacking in
initiative and self-reliance when his leaders
have been killed and he is faced with the un-
expected. The very fact that surrender has
now made its appearance, though on a very
small scale, in an army where such a thing was
undreamt of, is not without significance.

The Outlook in November, 1943.
14, Strategically, Burma is important for
three reasons :— a!

(@) The only way in which we can, either
now or in the immediate future, send help
to China is through or over Burma.

(6) Burma is the principal area in which
we can contain and destroy considerable
Japanese forces.

(c) In our hands Burma provides a step-
ping stone for operations further east or
south. In Japanese hands it is a base for
operations against the eastern frontier of

dia,

15. As a result of decisions reached at the
Quebec Conference, the Chiefs of Staff directed
the Supreme Allied Commander to undertake
operations in Burma with two objects :—

@) The security and improvement of the
air ferry route to China and the establish-
ment of land communications with China.

(6) The close and continuous engagement
of Japanese land and air forces, so as to
cause attrition and diversion from the Pacific
Theatre.

To execute these orders meant, of course,
offensive operations whenever and wherever
possible; but it was obvious that the main
operations to secure Northern Burma, without
which complete security of the China air route
could not be ensured, would have to be
launched from Imphal, Yunnan and Ledo.

16. As our resources were limited, it was
essential to decide on the southern limits of
such an offensive. Examination showed that
only the capture of the Shwebo—Mandalay
area would fulfil the instructions of the Chiefs
of Staff but this was beyond our resources,
either in troops or transport aircraft, Plans of
a less ambitious nature which would obey the
spirit of the instructions to the Supreme Allied
‘Commander had, therefore, to be considered.

17. The plan generally approved at Quebec
‘was? —

_ (@) The capture by Long-Range Penetra-

tion Forces of the Katha—Indaw area which

would be then held by a division, flown in

or moved overland across the Chindwin with

light equipment.

SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951

(b) The capture of Mogaung—Myitkyina
by Chinese-American forces from Ledo with
possible exploitation southwards.

(©) An advance on Bhamo—Lashio by
Chinese forces from Yunnan.

The plan which I had thought gave the best
chance of success was made in September 1943,
when the Commander-in-Chief, India, was still
in command of the operations and I was
G.O.C.-in-C., Eastern Army. This plan aimed
at forcing a crossing of the Chindwin on the
Imphal Front, and the introduction with the _
aid of airborne troops of a force of all arms,
including tanks and medium artillery, into the
Central Burma plain in the Ye-U area. A de-
tailed examination of the many problems which
such a plan created, among them the capacity
of the Assam lines of communication, and the
delays in the concentration programme caused
by the breaching of the main railway line to
Calcutta from the west by the Damodar River,
showed that the launching of such an offensive
before early March was not possible.

This plan was submitted to the British Chiefs
of Staff, who preferred an airborne operation
against Katha—Indaw because there would be
closer support and co-operation with Chinese
forces advancing south from Ledo and across
the Salween. This plan, approved at the Cairo
conference in November 1943, had eventually
to be abandoned as the necessary transport air-
craft were not forthcoming. It became
necessary, therefore, to make a less ambitious
plan.

18. It was not easy, within the means at our
disposal, even partially to achieve the objects
given by the Chiefs of Staff. After several
alternatives had been examined and rejected,
I submitted to the Supreme Allied Commander,
in December, the following plan.

(@ An advance down the Kabaw Valley
towards Kalewa—Kalemyo; the construc-
tion of an all-weather road, via Tamu, as far
as posible towards Yuwa and Kalewa on the

win.

(b) The use (initially) of three Long-Range
Penetration Brigades in the Katha—Indaw
area.

The objects I had in mind were:—

@ To achieve a greater, though not com-
plete measure of security for the China air
route, by forcing the enemy further south.

Gi) To obtain greater freedom of action
for offensive operations in 1944-45, when
more resources might be expected.

Gii) To destroy the maximum possible
number of Japanese land and air forces.

(iv) To gain some control of Upper Burma
by the employment, in conjunction with our
main forces and those of the Chinese Army
in India (C.A.L), of Long-Range Penetra-
tion Troops to confuse the enemy and inflict
casualties.

19. This plan was approved by the Supreme
Allied Commander and was referred by him to
the Chiefs of Staff early in December. It
depended for success not only on overcoming
strong enemy defences in the Tiddim area, but
also on progress in road construction. At the
end of January, the Chiefs of Staff were told
that we did not anticipate reaching the Kalewa
—Kalemyo area before the monsoon. Actually
