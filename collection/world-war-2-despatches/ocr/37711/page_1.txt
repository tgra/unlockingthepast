OPERATIONS IN NORTH-WEST EUROPE FROM 61H JUNE, 1944,
To 5TH MAY, 1945. ;

The following despatch was submitted to the
Secretary of State for War on ist June, 1946,
by Field Marshal The Viscount Montgomery
of Alamein, G.C.B., D.S.O.

T'arrived in England on and January, 1944,
after handing over command of the Eighth
Army, and immediately started a detailed
study of the plans for the assault of the Con-
tinent—Operation OVERLORD.

The Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Naval
Expeditionary Force was Admiral Sir Bertram
Ramsay and of the Allied Expeditionary Air
Force, Air Chief Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-
Mallory. There was no parallel appointment
of Commander-in-Chief of the Allied land
forces, but General Eisenhower decided that
I should act in that capacity for the assault,
and subsequently until the stage was reached
in the development of our operations when a
complete American Army Group could be de-
ployed on the Continent. No definite period
was stipulated for this, but Headquarters
Twelfth United States Army Group were formed
in London and prepared to take command of
First and Third United States Armies at the
appropriate time. This Army Group, when
formed, remained under my operational con-
trol until rst September: when the Supreme
Comimander took over direct control+of the
land battle. ,

The assault was an operation requiring a
single co-ordinated plan of action under one
commander; I jtherefore became the overall
land force commander responsible to the
Supreme Commander for planning and execut-
ing the military aspect of the assault and sub-
sequent capture of the lodgement area.

in the initial stages, the object of Operation
QVERLORD was io mount and carry out an

operation to secure a lodgement on the Con-
tinent from which further offensive operations
could be developed. _

The troops under my operational control
comprised 2x Army Group and First United
States Army (General Omar N. Bradley).
ar Army Group comprised First Canadian
Army (Lieutenant-General Crerar), Second
British Army (Lieutenant-General Dempsey),
the British Airborne Troops (Lieutenant-
General Browning), and various Allied con-
tingents. Attached to First United States Army
were the American 82 and ror Airborne Divi-
sions,

Ninth United States Air Force planned with
First United States Army, while Second British
are! worked with Second Tactical Air Force,

Tue Pan.

The intention was to assault, simultaneously,
beaches on the Normandy coast immediately
North of the Carentan estuary and between
the Carentan estuary and the R. Ome, with
the object of securing, as a base for further
operations, a lodgement area: which was to
include airfield sites and the port of Cher:
bourg. The left or Eastern flank of the lodge-
ment area was to includ> the road centre of
Caen.

Once ashore and firmly established, my
plan was to threaten to break out on the
Eastern flank—that is in the Caen sector; by
this threat to draw the main enemy reserves
into that sector, to fight them there and keep
them there, using the British and Canadian
armies for the purpose, Having the main
enemy reserves committed on the ma flank.
my plan was to make the breakout on the
