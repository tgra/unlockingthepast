He drew attention to the fact that owing to the inevitable confusion, the figures given to him for evacuation varied very greatly. Up to late on the 30th May, he had hoped that the last trip, that of C.S. 15, would result in almost everyone being brought off. The figures, however, suddenly increased by 5,000 on that day."

            "description": "On the 30th May General Ritchie decided the time had come to put his plan into operation. But he did not think he could safely let his tanks go far afield leaving the bulk of the enemy's armour unwatched, until some definite move on our part had caused the enemy to look to his rear. The 1st South African and 50th Divisions with all the heavy tanks were to attack and secure Tmimi and Afrag. The 5th Indian Division would then pass through and penetrate into the Gebel Akhdar, while our armoured divisions moved towards Mechili, operating against the enemy's southern flank or attacking his armour as opportunity offered."

These -were formed mainly with pilots taken from existing squadrons, who had a good deal of flying experience, and so got up to the operational standard much quicker than the two new squadrons formed later; though not up to establishment, the first two squadrons would have been able to fight by the miidle of April, 1941. A total of 167 Buffaloes in all were received in Singapore, and on the 30th May, 1941, permission was given by the Air Ministry to form two further fighter squadrons."
