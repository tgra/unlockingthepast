all visibility from aircrews flying through them,
whose skill and endurance they test to. the ut-
most: navigation through them is fraught with
great risk. Unfortunately at this season several
such thunderstorms were certain to be en-
countered during the course of every long
flight.

State of Aerodromes.

399. Up to this date, 18th January, the policy
of A.H.Q. had been to develop aerodromes in
Northern Sumatra as refuelling grounds for re-
inforcements arriving by air from India, and
as advanced landing grounds for operational
use on the flank of Malaya. In consequence
of this pohcy constructional work on them had
been given priority over that at aerodromes in
the south, and it was the aerodromes in the
south of Sumatra which would now be wanted
for our squadrons to use as their main bases.
By the middle of January small refuelling and
re-arming parties of varying strengths, up to 50,
had been established at the following places: —

(a) Sabang (also for Flying Boats),

(b) Lho’nga.

(c¢) Medan Civil Aerodrome (a large mili-
tary aerodrome was also being constructed
in this area);

(d) Pakanbaroe,

(e) Padang;

(f) Palembang—at the civil aerodrome
known as P.I ;

(g) a secret military aerodrome 20 miles
south of Palembang known as P.II.

In addition there was a strip at Lahat, and a
field under construction by the Dutch at Oest-
haven. Wing Commander Duncan, Squadron
Leader Briggs and Squadron Leader Wightwick
(A.M.W.D.) were already located at Palembang
for liaison with the Dutch in connection with
the development of these aerodromes.

DEVELOPMENT OF R.A.F. ORGANISATION
IN SUMATRA.

400. AH.Q. therefore decided, on the 16th
January, that the time was becoming imminent
when bomber units would have to be trans-
ferred to Sumatra. For this reason HQ
225 (B) Group was formed at Singapore on this
date, and was sent to Palembang in Sumatra
on the 18th January, 1942. Initial appoint-
ments made by A.H.Q. were: —

Group Commander Group Captain A. G
Bishop.

Wing Commander K
Powell.

Squadron Leader
Briggs.

Squadron Leader
Wightwick

Instructions to No. 225 (B) Group.

4ot. On formation of the Group Head-
quarters, the A‘O.C instructed the Group
Commander*— :
(4) to establish a Bomber Group H.Q.;
(6) to accelerate, to the maximum, arrange-
ments for operating bomber units from
Sumatra; such arrangements not only to
provide for all bombers then in Singapore but
also for the following reinforcements : —
(i) Nos. 84 and 21x (B) Squadrons
(Blenheim IV) then en route from Middie
East;

S.AS.O. ...
S.A 0.
AM.W.D

SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

(i) Hudson III’s en route from U.K.
which were to re-equip in succession No.
62 (B) Squadron, and Nos. 1 and 8 (GR)
Squadrons, R.A.A.F.

402 The A.O.C also decided that, depen-
dent on the situation, when bomber units were
located in Sumatra, either Group H.Q. would
be responsible for the selection of targets (with-
in the policy laid down by A.H.Q.) and for the
briefing of squadrons, or alternatively squadrons
would proceed to bases in Singapore and be
briefed there under A H.Q arrangements. To
provide for this latter arrangement, refuelling
and re-arming parties for bomber units would
be maintained at aerodromes on Singapore
Island. At this time it-was fairly confidently
anticipated that the situation on the ground in
Malaya would be stabilised and that a bridge-
head would be held of sufficient area for the
deployment of reinforcements preparatory to
a counter-offensive being undertaken (para.
322). That it would be necessary later to
transfer fighter squadrons from Singapore was
not at this time ‘‘ on the cards ’’.

Development by No. 225 (B) Group H.Q.

403. Group Captain Bishop, on arrival at

Palembang on the 18th January, decided to: —

(2) Establish Group Headquarters at
Palembang.

(b) Expand and accelerate the provision
of accommodation at P.I and P.II aero-
dromes, and improve aircraft dispersal at
each.

(c) Develop Lahat for use by bombers.

(d) Reconnoitre the area to the south of
Palembang for the selection and ‘develop-
ment of further landing strips.

At the same time he put in hand reconnaiss-
ance for siting an Ammunition Park, an Air
Stores Park and an RS.U., which were to be
provided for the maintenance of the Force

A.H.Q. were informed and approved of these
decisions.

404. P.J. was, at that time, a large ‘L’
shaped aerodrome with two hard runways. It
possessed dispersal arrangements which were at
once considerably developed by Dutch
Engineers. There was no accommodation for
personnel nearer than the town, 8 miles away.

P.II was a huge natural field about ro miles
im perimeter with good natural cover for air-
craft. It was not visible from the road, and its
construction had been successfully kept secret
from the Japanese. Similar clearings in the
neighbourhood made it difficult for air crews
to locate it from the air, even by those who
had been briefed as to its location. Great care
was taken to preserve its secrecy and, although
at one time more than roo aircraft were based
on it, Japanese reconnaissance, which fre-
quently flew over it by day and mght, never
located it. Communications between Palem-
bang and P.II were handicapped because there
was no bridge over the Palembang river, on
the north of which lay Palembang town and
P.I, the river had to be crossed by a small
ferry which had a limit of 4 to 6 vehicles. The
Dutch put in hand the construction of huts
for accommodation of personnel at P.IT
aerodrome.
