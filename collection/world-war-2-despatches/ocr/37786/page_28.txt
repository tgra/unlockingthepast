the railway system or to give any reliable esti-
mate of their own civil and military demands
in war. In the absence of reliable information
from the Turkish General Staff it was estimated
that, without the use of Izmir port, 2,500 to
3,000 tons a day would be the maximum im-
port figure and that, after meeting Turkish
requirements, both military and civil, not more
than 500 to 1,000 tons could be relied on for
British requirements; it was realised that im-
Port capacity would be considerably increased

yy the use of Izmir. These figures were in-
evitably guesswork, but were accepted as the
basis of subsequent planning.

2go. It was therefore decided in March that,
to avoid concentrating in Turkey a larger force
than could be subsequently maintained, the
despatch of British forces would be phased.
In the first phase twenty-five Royal Air Force
squadrons would be sent, with an army com-
ponent and two anti-tank regiments, in the
second phase we would send twenty Royal Air
Force squadrons, in the third phase three anti-
tank regiments and five anti-aircraft regiments,
and in the fourth phase, after Izmir port was
opened, two armoured divisions. â€˜This plan
was known as HARDIHOOD.

291. No. 3 Planning Staff was sent to
Turkey in March to continue discussions on the
operational employment of this force and to
implement the programme of administrative
planning required in Turkey for its reception
and subsequent operation and maintenance.
This was followed in March by a visit to
Ankara by Air Marshal Sholto Douglas and in
April by a visit by myself, in order to discuss
the implications of the HARDIHOOD plan

taf, :

292. The maintenance requirements of the
forces contained in the three phases
amounted to some 1,200 tons a day, or 200
tons a day in excess of the maximum capacity
estimated to be available. We hoped, however,
that the action we had taken and were con-
tinuing to take to improve the railways would
enable the force to be maintained.

293. This action was mainly the provision of
additional locomotives and wagons. We
planned to earmark roo locomotives and the
equivalent of 2,500 15-ton wagons; of these 50
locomotives and 1,800 15-ton wagons were
included in the Adana list and would be sup-
pice when available; the remainder were to

held as a reserve in the Middle East. Action
was also taken to build up a reserve supply of
locomotive coal in the Middle East for use in
Turkey should we have to maintain a force
there. Holdings of Middle East railways were
increased by 40,000 tons so that, in the event
ot Turkey coming into the war, it would be
possible to divert incoming supplies direct to
Turkish ports.

294. Further administrative preparations in-
cluded pre-dumping of stores at certain selected
places in Turkey and an extensive programme

of airfield and base and lines of communication -

construction. Certain stores had already been
pre-dumped in Turkey; for HARDIHOOD the
number of dumps was increased from five to
eleven, and dumping continued with a target
of twenty-eight days for the first three phases
of HARDIHOOD.

SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 13 NOVEMBER, 1946

295. In the spring of 1943 there were suffi-
cient airfields in Turkey to accommodate
twenty-five Royal Air Force squadrons during
the dry weather only; it was therefore neces-
sary to undertake an extensive programme of
development to accommodate forty-five
squadrons, including sixteen heavy-bomber
squadrons, under all-weather conditions. This
work was divided between the Turks and the
British Royal Engineer construction parties
already in Turkey. The target date for com-
pletion of runways and hard-standings was 31st
October, 1943; later, certain minimum technical
and domestic accommodation would be neces-
sary. In addition to these airfields the Turks
undertook to provide fair-weather landing
grounds at Milas and Mugla in South-West
Anatolia.

296. In July, 1942, an advanced base had
been reconnoitred in the Ulukisla~Cakmak
area, but by the spring of 1943 very little
construction had been done, although certain
covered accommodation was available and all
the necessary material was on the site. It was
agreed to continue with the project, and repre-
sentatives of No. 3 Planning Staff were in-
structed to prepare a key plan for the HARDI-
HOOD forces. Later, after reconnaissance of
both areas, it was decided to locate the
advanced base at Afyon Karahinsar, which was
more suited to the increased forces of Plan
HARDIHOOD than Ulukisla. Further planned
development of the lines of communication in-
cluded port depots at Mersin and Iskenderun,
a Royal Air Force base maintenance unit at
Cakmak and a road-rail transhipment point at
Ulukisla. These proposals were submitted to
the Turkish General Staff in early June.
Turkish consent to the construction of the
advanced base was not given until August, and
then only on conditions which made it quite
impossible to complete the project by the end
of the year. Work had to be carried out by
the Turks, under the supervision of only those
British personnel already in Turkey, and it
had to be disguised as commercial construction.
Permission to start constructions of the port
depots was not given until December.

297. Plans were also produced to extend the
existing petrol installations at Iskenderun, to
provide tankage at airfields, to build hospitals
and to improve communications by the con-
struction of a network of trunk telephone routes.

298. Our plans in all cases were delayed by
the Turks, with the result that little progress
had been made by the end of the year, and if
it had been necessary to implement HARDI-
HOOD, the administration and maintenance of
the forces would have presented an almost in-
superable problem.

299. In September, as a result of decisions
taken at the Quebec Conference, a new directive
defining the operational and administrative
commitment of my command was received, in
which no provision was made for HARDI-
HOOD other than the construction parties
already in Turkey. Our various construction
programmes, however, were to continue and
No. 3 Planning Staff was to remain in Turkey
to maintain continuity in planning.

300. In October, 1943, as a result of instruc-
tions to the Middle East Defence Committee by
the Chiefs of Staff, an invitation was extended
to Turkey to enter the war. The Chiefs of
Staff pointed out that should Turkey enter the
