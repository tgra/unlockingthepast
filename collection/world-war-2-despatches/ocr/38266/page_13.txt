Method.

3. In determining the method by which you
tender such assistance you are constantly to
keep in mind the needs of the Commander, 14
Division. The following courses are, amongst
others, to be considered:—

(a) Maintain attack by night patrols, on
the enemy’s river L. of C., both in for-
ward areas and south of Rathedaung.
Our air forces will endeavour to force

the enemy to operate these L. of C. by -

night.

(b) Attack enemy armed craft in the Mayu
River.

(c) Harass the enemy forces on the river

anks, ‘
(@) Increase the mobility of our land forces
by carrying troops or towing sampans.
You are to bear in mind that your repair
facilities are limited and that it will not,be
possible to provide you with reinforcements
before the end of the monsoon.
