55. “ Having taken a vital part in the defeat
of the Japanese in Burma”, I said, “ the
USAAF. units are being withdrawn from
Eastern Air Command to fight the Jap in
another Theatre. The closing down of the fully
integrated Eastern Air Command Headquarters
is, therefore, an important milestone in the war
against Japan.

“Eastern Air Command was formed on 15th
December, 1943, at a critical time in the Battle
of Burma, in order to weld into one Command
the British and American Air Forces on this
front.

“The British Army was hanging on to the
western fringes of Burma, having stemmed
the Japanese advance into Bengal.

“When the British Army was besieged in
Imphal due to Japanese infiltration resulting
from their superior mobility, the first task of
the newly formed Eastern Air Command was
to obtain air superiority in order to enable
our close support squadrons to assist the land
forces.

“Within a short time air superiority was

- obtained, due in no small measure to the long
range fighter squadrons of the U.S.A.AF. It
enabled the Allied Transport Squadrons to sup-
ply and reinforce the beleaguered Army ; also,
it gave them the mobility which previously the
Japanese had monopolised. From this time,
until the capture of Rangoon in May, 1945,
the Allied Land Forces enjoyed all the benefits
of air supremacy which, in turn, kept inviolate
the air supply lines and endowed the Allied
Army with the mobility and striking power to
forge ahead to Mandalay, followed shortly by
Rangoon. It made possible the isolation of
the Japanese Army in Burma by Allied air-
craft, thus preventing the arrival of reinforce-
ments and supplies from Siam and Malaya.

“Jn Northern Burma, the Tactical and
Transport Squadrons of the 10th U.S.A.A.F.
played a decisive part in the repulse of the
enemy from the Chinese border and in the re-
opening of the overland route to China.

“A Japanese officer who was captured in
Burma attributed the defeat of the Japanese
Army to the superior mobility of the Allied
Army. This mobility was almost entirely due
to the air supply provided by the Allied Air
Forces, whose record tonnage exceeded 2,900
tons per day in April, 1945. Due mainly to
their superior numbers and operating at maxi-
mum effort, the American Transport Squadrons
carried the greater portion of the air lift in
support of the land forces in Burma.

“Tn conclusion, it is fair to say that without
the support of the American Air Forces in
Burma, we could not have defeated the
Japanese Army as rapidly and as decisively in
1945. All British Forces, both land and air,
are deeply grateful for the whole hearted sup-
port and complete harmony that existed
‘between the American and British Air Force
units in this Theatre.

“T am exceedingly proud to have had these
American Air Force units in my Command,
and, together with all members of the British
Air Force in South East Asia, wish them good
luck, and good hunting.”

, 56. In my Order of the Day announcing dis-
integration of Eastern Air Command, I did not
make especial mention of units of the Air
Service Command, but, instead I wrote to

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951

Lieutenant General D. I. Sultan, Commanding
General, India-Burma Theatre, U.S. Army, and
expressed the valuable and splendid work
which the Air Service Command had per-
formed under Major General T. J. Handley,
Jnr. Without this help, we should have failed
to carry through the intensive operations of the
previous 12 months.

57. While it was necessary to sever the
British and American Combat units of Eastern
Air Command, and Air Command, South East
Asia, there was, however, no break as yet with
the Air Service Command.

58. With disintegration of Eastern Air Com-
mand, the air offensive in South East Asia
now passed in its entirety to the Royal Air
Force, and an exceedingly active period in the
deployment of squadrons in Burma began.
Thus, the integration ordered by the Supreme
Commander in December, 1943, had been ful-
filled in so far as it concerned the integration
of British and American Air Forces employed
in the defeat of the Japanese in Burma.

The Impact of “Tiger Force” on Air Com-
mand.

59. For some time after the capture of Ran-
goon in May, there were indications that Tiger
Force was going to be favoured by London in
men and material resources previously pro-
mised to South East Asia Command.

60. The Supreme Allied Commander,
Admiral Mountbatten, showed his reliance on
the Air Force in this Theatre, by a strong signal
to the Chiefs of Staff expressing his intense
disappointment at the contemplated step since
he considered it would delay his carrying out
their directive to open up the Straits of Malacca
and to recapture Singapore at the earliest pos-
sible date.

61. I also communicated the concern felt
by the Supreme Allied Commander to the
Chief of Air Staff, emphasising that future
strategy and operations in this Theatre had
been based on the agreed rate of build-up of
the British Air Forces and especially of British
Transport and Heavy Bomber squadrons.
Moreover, the withdrawal programme of the
US.A.AF. forces for China which had now
begun, had been agreed and phased in with
the rate of build-up of the British Air Forces.

62. The question of airfields in South East
Asia for staging Tiger Force through to the
Far East also presented some difficulties, since
the most suitable area’ was Rangoon where
insufficient bases for our own aircraft were
available. In the United Kingdom it was
thought that Chittagong and Cox’s Bazaar were
too far from Manila, and they were not
accepted as alternatives.

63. It became clear that Air Command,
South East Asia, must accept the situation

‘ wherein the air war in the Pacific against

Japan received higher priority than ourselves.
This was finally confirmed by a signal from
the Chief of Staff in London on June 22nd,
part of which read :—

“In case you are in doubt, ‘ Zipper’ and
*Mailfist’ have been approved by the Com-
bined Chiefs of Staff with the proviso that
these operations are conducted without pre-
judice to the preparation and execution of
operations for the invasion of Japan and
other operations directly connected there-
with.”
