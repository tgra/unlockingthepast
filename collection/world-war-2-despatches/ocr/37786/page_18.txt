control of the island. The mission left Haifa
by sea on 8th September (the day on which
the armistice with Italy was announced) and
went to Castelrosso, which capitulated to a
small detachment of the Special Boat Squadron
on roth September. Meanwhile, the very
scanty warning of the Italian collapse which
I had received was cut still further by the
weather. The first attempt to drop two officers
by parachute on Rhodes, on oth September,
failed, so that the Germans got an extra day
in which to organise their positions on the
island and to undermine the morale of the
Italians. It was not until the night of gth-
roth September that Major the Lord Jellicoe
and another officer were dropped by parachute
and established contact with Admiral
Campione, the Italian Governor, whose spirit
was clearly affected by the delay and by the
fact that the Germans were already present
whilst we were not.

igo. At 1715 hours on rth September, in-
formation reached me that Campione had lost

heart, had refused permission for us to enter ”

the island and did not wish to have any further
dealings with us. The 234th Infantry Brigade
was in the meantime being prepared for opera-
tions, but, owing to th2 limitations of shipping
and the time taken to collect it, the brigade
could not be ready to sail until 18th September.
The urgency was such that this delay was
unacceptable, and one battalion was ordered to
embark in motor launches and Royal Air Force
launches for transit to Rhodes, while prepara-
tions for the mounting of the remainder of the
brigade went on as fast as possible. It was,
however, imperative that we should have a
guarantee of unopposed entry into the port of
Rhodes and an unopposed occupation of an
airfield either at Marizza or on Cos before the
expedition could be launched, since a landing
against opposition was out of the question.
Before anything could be done, the German
commander, Von Kleeman, had taken ad-
vantage of Campicne’s weakness and in-
decision, and the Germans assumed undisputed
control of Rhodes.

I9x. The positive nature of the enemy’s re-
action in Rhodes, and our inability to restore
the situation, made it necessary to revise com-
pletely our planning for the Aegean. Hitherto

all the plans which had been made involved -

the employment of considerable forces, and had
as their first objective the capture of Rhodes.
Future plans would, of necessity, have to be
made on a smaller scale and, since it was
essential to act quickly, they would have to
be improvised. .

192. German resources in the Aegean had
been stretched to the limit by their recent take-
over in Rhodes and Crete, and there was a
possibility that by a rapid move we could
obtain control of other Aegean islands, notably
Cos, and by so doing partially neutralise the
recent enemy successes over the Italians, en-
hance our prestige throughout the Middle East,
and act as a diversion for the operations in
Ttaly.

193. General Eisenhower had already made
it clear that little material support, especially
in the air, could be given by North Africa to
such an undertaking, and had emphasised that
the campaign in Italy must not be prejudiced
by any other operation in the Mediterranean.
There was, however, a good chance that,

even with the limited resources at our disposal,
the occupation of such islands as Cos, which
hhad an airfield and landing grounds, Leros,
where there was an Italian naval base, and
Samos could be undertaken, since the garrisons
seemed likely to welcome the prospect of a
British occupation.

194. With the limited number of German
aircraft ‘based on (Greece and Crete at this
time, and with our own fighters based on Cos,
the possibility of major seaborne or airborne
German operations was slight, and with the aid
of the loyal garrisons of Cos and Leros, who
were thought to be reasonably well equipped
for ground and air defence, there was every
prospect of maintaining ourselves in these
islands until an attack could be launched on
Rhodes from the Middle East.

195. I therefore decided on the despatch of
small forces to Cos, Leros and Samos, to act
as stiffening to the Italians. Cos and Samos
were secured by the detachment of the Special
Boat Squadron which had occupied Castelrosso,
and troop movements began, both by sea and
air, on 15th September. Sea transport was
almost entirely limited to Royal Navy des-
troyers going direct to Leros, or to small coast-
ing vessels going as far as Castelrosso; thence
the journey to the islands had to be made in
small sailing ships. Owing to the shipping
difficulties, the limitations of port capacity and
disembarkation equipment, and our inability
to break down Bofors guns and heavy equip-
ment into small loads, troops could take with
them only their personal weapons, rifles,
mortars and Bren guns. No anti-tank, field or
anti-aircraft guns could be taken, nor could
any transport other than jeeps be sent. Re-
liance for such equipment had to be placed on
the Italian equipment already in the islands,
which, in the case of Leros especially, was
thought to ‘be reasonably up-to-date and effec-
tive. This regrettably was not the case. The
defences of Leros were not at all well developed,
much of the anti-aircraft material was out of
date, and the system of fire control was deplor-
able; certain natures of ammunition were in
short supply, and motor transport was always
inadequate. The defences of Cos were on an
even lower scale.

196. For the first few days the transport of
troops went on without opposition, and in addi-
tion to the occupation of Cos, Leros and
Samos, the islands of Simi, Stampalia and
Icaria were occupied on 18th September. Air
transport was used to reinforce Cos by day,
troops being landed at Antimachia airfield,
while destroyers went direct to Leros, the rein-
forcements to Samos going thence in small local
craft,

197. Cos was easily the most important of
these islands to us, since it possessed an airfield
from which single-engined fighter aircraft could
operate over the Aegean and could cover an
attack on Rhodes when the time arrived for
that operation to be resumed. By comparison
with the facilities at Rhodes, this airfield at
Antimachia was a poor one, and it was not
considered possible, even from the start, to
hold Cos in strength without Rhodes, for which
Cos was to bea preliminary step. The island,

about thirty miles long and nowhere
more than seven miles wide, is the
most fruitful in the Aegean; water
