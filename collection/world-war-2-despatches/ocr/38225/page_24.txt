1612 SUPPLEMENT To THE
landing craft from Red beach, having been
brought close to Blue beach in H.M.S. Royal
Ulsterman. 2 South Lancashire Regiment was
in floating service in M.V. Sobieski, and about
500 men with no vehicles could be landed from
her by using all available R boats (fast naval
motor boats carrying about 18 men) and othe:
unarmoured landing craft, which were not usec
in the initial assault. Any men or vehicles
above these numbers had to come in the second
and later trips of landing craft, which had to
return the eight or ten miles to the anchorage
to reload. It had been hoped that the assault
ships could close the beaches as soon as the
Courrier Bay batteries were in our hands. Un-
fortunately the large number of enemy mines
between the convoy anchorage and the beaches
prevented this starting until 0750 hours,
although the success signal was received from
5 Commando at 0615 hours, The remaining
mines, however, still kept these ships several
miles from Blue beach, which by this time was
the only practicable beach. During the morn-
ing a strong wind rose blowing from N.E,
raising a heavy chop, which slowed up the flat
bowed landing craft and drenched the occu-
pants with heavy spray. The combination of
these circumstances seriously delayed the pro-
gress of the landing. It had been hoped to
complete the landing of 29 Independent
Brigade personnel by about ogoo hrs ; in the
event this was not achieved until about 1100
hrs.; similarly their vehicles were not complete
until about midnight, instead of 1800 hrs. as
had been hoped.

H.M.S. Bachaquero,

22. Difficulty and delay experienced in find-
ing a suitable beach for Bachaquero was a
severe set back to the progress of landing
vehicles, She had been loaded with 19 Field
Battery of 9 Field Regiment (17 Infantry
Brigade Group) on a reduced scale of trans-
port and with carriers and load carrying
vehicles, a total of 54 vehicles and guns. It
was hoped to beach her sometime about og00
hrs..in the vicinity of Blue beach, or at least
on some beach whence exit could be made to
the main axis of advance. Unfortunately a reef
off Blue beach prevented her approach; her
movements were seriously hampered by the
numerous mines; and a suitable beach for ler
could not be found in the Ambararata Bay
area She was therefore ordered, in the after-
noon, to beach in Courrier Bay.

She made several attempts and in one of
them two quads and two guns were men-
handled ashore and up a most difficult beach
by men of the 19 Field Battery working up
to their necks in the water. Finally just
before dark, she was brought in on the rising
tide at full speed and reached a depth of water
in which she could discharge her vehicles
rapidly. This was not the end of the dis-
appointments. In spite of vigorous recon-
naissance, no practical route could be found
from the Courrier Bay area to the main axis of
advance. The battery was therefore ordered
into action on the Andrakaka Peninsula, but
carriers of 2 Royal Scots Fusiliers and some
of the 15 cwts. eventually during Dz found
a way through and rejoined their units on
the main axis.

LONDON GAZETTE, 4 MARCH, 1948

Disembarkation of 17 Infantry Brigade.

23. The personnel of 17 Infantry Brigade
Group in S.S. Oronsay and Duchess of Atholl
arrived in the anchorage shortly before 1100
hours and, as the situation then seemed to be
going remarkably well, were ordered to land
m accordance with the pre-arranged provisional
landing table. This commenced at 1115 hours
although vehicles did not start until midnight.
2 Royal Scots Fusiliers, the first battalion to
land, took over the beach area, and also found
one detached company for the Red beach area,
thus freeing the last of the 29 Independent
Brigade and 5 Commando from the beaches.
This battalion was followed by working parties
for the beach areas provided from the first
reinforcements of 17 Infantry Brigade.

It was agreed with S.N.O.L. that landing
should stop between dark and moonlight (1800
hours to 2230 hours), to prevent damage to
landing craft and to rest their crews and the
docks operating company. The landing of
the remainder of 17 Infantry Brigade then
continued and companies commenced the march
forward as they got ashore and formed up.

Landing and Assumption of Control by Force
Commander,

a4. 1 had embarked in H.M.S. Ramullies
for the passage to Diego Suarez, expecting to
be sent by destroyer to H M.S. Keren, in which
ship were $.N.O.L. and the majority of my
H.Q., by about ogoo hours on D1, when it
was expected that the first troops of 17 Infantry
Brigade would land. In view of the delay
in disembarkation, I decided to remain with
the Combined Commander until 1230 hours.
Unfortunately, by this time, the sea had risen
and made transfer to a destroyer impossible
until a lee had been found. The result was
that I did not arrive in the Keren until 1530
hours. Rear Admiral Syfret was always pre-
pared to put me ashore at any time, and the
lateness of my arrival in the Keren was entirely
,my own fault. I failed to appreciate the time
lag required for:â€”
(a) Movement of the Ramullies to calm
water.
(b) Transfer to a destroyer in a sea boat.
(c) The destroyer trip to the Keren. _
Once there I examined available information;
landed, reaching Blue beach 1700 hours; and
started in a carrier for H.Q. 29 Independent
Brigade. The carrier however broke down
and, although I later boarded another vehicle,
with the AD.M.S., I failed to reach 29 In-
dependent Brigade H.Q. in the dark. The
G.S.0.1, however, got through on a motor
cycle and returned with a first class situation
report. On receipt of this I returned to the
Beach Signal Station. There I met Brigadier
Tarleton and instructed him to get his brigade
as it landed, forward along the road so that
he would be able to assist 29 Independent
Brigade as early as possible on Dz. I finally
returned to the Keven where I was able to
get good signal communication to the Ramillies
and the aircraft carriers and hoped to get
some communication to 29 Independent
Brigade. I arranged to land at first light on
D2. At this time and indeed throughout the
operation, we were suffering for the heavy cuts
which had been made in H.Q. and signals to
increase the number of fighting troops and
vehicles.
