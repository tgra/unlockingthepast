Kamaing was captured on the 16th June and Mogaung invested. The situation in the Mogaung Valley on the 22nd June was that the Japanese in the Kamaing area were being forced into the southern end of the valley; while Special Force was attacking their supply lines in the area north of Indaw. Special Force also had a detachment, known as \u201c Morrisforce\u201d, blocking the Myitkyina\u2014Bhamo road."

A similar operation on 16th June was followed on 17th June by the most ambitious \u2018\u2018(Circus\u2019\u2019 yet attempted. This involved an attack on a Chemical Plant and Power Station near Bethune by eighteen Blenheim bombers, escorted by no less than 22 squadrons of fighters. The enemy fighter force reacted vigorously, and although we lost nine pilots, those who weturned reported a very favourable outcome of their combats, It seemed that the long-expected \u2018\u2018 fighter battle on terms tactically favourable to ourselves \u2019\u201d had come at last. aoa"

But he did not think it essential to hold Acroma, and considered that our defence south of Tobruk must be ensured by a mobile force with a maxi- mum quota of artillery, since isolated -strong- points would be liable to be overwhelmed in detail owing to the weakness of our armoured forces. It might take time to organise the artillery of the rst South African and 5oth Divi- sions for employment in a mobile role, and in the interval General Ritchie visualised a situa- tion arising in which Tobruk might become temporarily invested. On the 16th June I told him that, although I was determined Tobruk must not be besieged, I accepted the possibility of its becoming temporarily isolated, and left him full liberty to make his dispositions accordingly. \u201cI was glad to have the assurance of the Prime Minister that the instructions I had given to General Ritchie were approved in London. The position seemed to me to be quite different to that which had obtained in 1941, as we now held fortified positions on the frontier, and it did not seem as if the enemy had enough forces both to invest Tobruk and at the same time neutralise our troops to the east of it. I was therefore able to tell the Prime Minister that I hoped to be able to prevent the control of the country between Tobruk and the frontier pass- ing into enemy hands."

Meanwhile Tempest V, Spitfire XIV, Spitfire XII, Spitfire IX, Typhoon, and at night Mosquito aircraft of No. 11 Group had been in action against flying bombs since the beginning of the main attack. As we have seen, their rate of success at this stage amounted to about thirty per cent. of all the bombs which crossed or approached the coast. On the 16th June I had issued orders defining their area of patrol as the Channel and the land between the coast and the southern limit of the gun-belt, and prohibiting them from passing over the gun-belt except when actually pursu- ing a flying bomb. I soon found that in good weather the fighters were much more successful than the guns, which were badly hampered by the fact that the flying bombs did not fly at the height of 6,000 or 7,000 feet previously estimated by the Air Ministry, but at that very height of 2,000 to 3,000 feet which we had always realised would make the gunner\u2019s task most difficult.* On the other hand, when the weather was bad, poor visibility hampered the fighters, and in these conditions the guns were likely to prove the more effective weapon. Accordingly, I arranged on the roth June that in very good weather the guns should abstain from firing in order to give the fighters com- plete freedom of action. Conversely, when the weather was bad, the guns would have freedom of action and no fighters would be used. In middling weather fighters would operate in front of the gun belt and enter it only when pursuing a flying bomb. When a fighter entered the gun belt for this purpose the guns would, of course, withhold their fire; otherwise the"

The total number of patriots was about 8,000. Reports that the enemy in Debra Tabor were only waiting for the arrival of a British force before surrendering proved incorrect. There was much jealousy between the patriot forces who were making no serious attempt to capture the town. After reconnaissances, plans were made to attack in co-operation with the patriots but on no less than five separate occasions, after all plans and arrangements had been made, the patriots failed to co-operate. The total strength of our column was only 250 men, too weak to stage a successful attack without patriot co-operation. The diffictilties of co-operating with patriots are exemplified by the fact that on every occasion our commander was assured that \u2018\u2018 the attack would really go in this time.\u201d"

            "description": "On 16th June the garrison of Debra Tabor, though not surrounded, was completely cut- off, patriot forces being astride the road both east and west of the town. The total number of patriots was about 8,000. Reports that the enemy in Debra Tabor were only waiting for the arrival of a British force before surrendering proved incorrect. There was much jealousy between the patriot forces who were making no serious attempt to capture the town. After reconnaissances, plans were made to attack in co-operation with the patriots but on no less than five separate occasions, after all plans and arrangements had been made, the patriots failed to co-operate. The total strength of our column was only 250 men, too weak to stage a successful attack without patriot co-operation. The diffictilties of co-operating with patriots are exemplified by the fact that on every occasion our commander was assured that \u2018\u2018 the attack would really go in this time.\u201d"

Jt was not until 14th June that the road was sufficiently repaired for the column to start from Dessie, reaching Debra Tabor on 16th June where contact was made with the patriot forces."

Our main forces had now reached the line on which the enemy had decided to stand but on the Adriatic they were not yet up with that line which in this sector was the River Chienti. On 16th June I had instructed the Poles to press on with all possible speed to secure the capture of Ancona. The Polish advance was indeed rapid and by the 2oth they had crossed the River Aso and captured Fermo and Pedaso. On the 2ist they even managed to secure a small bridgehead over the Chienti but next day this was destroyed by a heavy enemy counter-attack. It was clear that to force the Chienti would require a full Corps attack. General Anders} decided that in view of the time needed for concentration and for bringing up the necessary supplies and ammunition the probable date would be 4th July. I agreed to this plan and proposed to stage the attack in such a way as to be able to press directly on from the Chienti to Ancona, some twenty-two miles beyond the river."
