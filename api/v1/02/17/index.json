            "description": "Our position in Cyrenaica had just been stabilised, when I received three disturbing pieces of information, none of them entirely un- expected. On the 17th February came a pre- paratory order from London to send two more divisions to the Far East. On the 18th Admiral Cunningham received a telegram from the Governor of Malta reporting that the supply situation in the island was extremely precarious. And a few days later J learned that an enemy convoy carrying. a large number of tanks had reached Tripoli."

            "description": "During the early stages of the war opera- tions on the Boma Plateau had been confined to patrol activity only. It was not until forces operating from Kenya along the west side of Lake Rudolph were ready, that the Equatorial Corps could undertake an advance into south- west Ethiopia. Maji was the centre of the Italian resistance in this area. The natives were friendly neither to the Italians nor the British and even before the war had been a constant source of trouble. Sudan forces in this area consisted of four companies of the Equatorial Corps and a nebulous force of patriots who, in this area, achieved very little. Time and resources did not allow the making o. an all-weather road across the Boma ?.ateau towards the frontier. It was therefore not possible to maintain regular forces in active operations during the rains, which, in this area, begin early in the year. On 17th February these decisions were conveyed to the O.C. Equatorial Corps, He was instructed to take steps immediately to dump forward sufficient supplies to maintain at least one company of the Equatorial Corps and the patriots, who uuumbered about 500, during the rains."

            "description": "To overcome the administrative difficulties of an advance down this coast, the plan was to use barges, dhows and small ships to move both troops and stores by sea first to Aqiq, and later to open a small port at Mersa Taclai. It was intended that if this force should be used later to threaten Massawa, Marsa Kuba would be opened as well. By zoth February, a column consisting of 1 Royal Sussex had occupied Mersa Taclai and by the rath, after some minor engagements, was moving towards Nakfa and Cub Cub. 7th Indian Infantry Brigade Group gained wireless touch with 4th Indian Division on 17th February and from then on a nightly conversation in Pushtu took place between the G.S.0.I. of 4th Indian Division and the Brigade Major of 7th Indian Infantry Brigade. The first serious resistance encountered was at Cub Cub where the Battalion Garby distinguished itself. By ist March, 7th Indian Infantry Brigade Group had cleared the Mescelit Pass, some 20 kilos north of Keren, and here the advance paused for a time to concentrate its scattered units and recast its plan for the advance on Keren."

Directly Akyab Island was occupied, work began on expanding the existing all- weather airfield so that it could accommodate three transport and three and a half tactical squadrons, with a target completion date of the 15th May.. At the same time, to meet the immediate and pressing needs of Fourteenth Anny, a fair-weather transport field for two squadrons was constructed and opened on the 17th February. Two tactical strips were also made. Fourteenth Army\u2019s rapid progress, how- ever, made further demands on the airfield development of Akyab. A second fair-weather transport strip was called for, and an advance on the completion date for the all-weather airfield, and finally an increase in the opera- tional capacity of the latter was required. Despite many difficulties this programme of work was completed ahead of schedule. The works on Akyab Island were begun by the Chief Engineer, 15 Indian Corps, but early in February, the responsibility was taken over by the commander of an Army Group Royal Engineers, working directly under my Chief Engineer. \u2019"

The remainder of the 48 Brigade was now brought up into line on the right of 16 Indian Brigade, where both 5/17 Dogra and 8 Burma Rifles were found to have vacated their positions, To protect the right flank an organisation of watchers backed up by Burma Military Police was put in operation along the coast."
