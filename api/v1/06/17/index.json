The total Japanese casualties on this front, after they crossed the Chindwin in March up till the middle of June, may safely be put at not less than 30,000. Against this, our own losses in killed, wounded and missing, from the 4th March to the -17th June totalled 12,525, of whom only 2,669 were killed. We captured a large amount of equipment, including nearly 100 guns,"

            "description": "1g. Although the progress of the 2oth Indian Infantry Brigade Group,was slow, preparations were well in hand for another force to advance by the Tigris. This force, under Brigadier Weld,\u2019 Commander ist Indian Infantry Brigade, was to proceed by river to Kut and thence by motor transport to Baghdad. All available barges and steamers were collected; many from up-river, and the barges decked so, as to take motor transport, guns and armoured cars. These plans were made in conjunction with the Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf (Commodore C. M. Graham, R.N.), and the convoy sailed on 12th. June under command of-a Naval Officer and with naval escort. The military force consisted of 21st Indian Infantry Brigade (less two battalions), two troops of 13th Lancers (armoured cars), one troop 157 Field Regt. and ancillary units. It reached Kut on 17th June and Baglidad on roth-June. This move up the Tigris had a most salutary effect on the tribes along the route, who, according to reports, were likely to. be very troublesome and actively hostile. \u00ae :"

This involved an attack on a Chemical Plant and Power Station near Bethune by eighteen Blenheim bombers, escorted by no less than 22 squadrons of fighters.

Since the enemy had reacted most energetically so far to the \u2018\u2018Circus,;\u2019 against a target near Bethune on 17th June and another against a target in that area on 21st May, we\u2019 concluded that the industrial area which included Bethune, Lens and Lille was probably his most sensitive spot. By attacking this area it was hoped to induce him to concentrate in North-East France such fighter units-as he still had in the West. \u2018Bombers without escort might then \u2018hope to reach \u2018West and North/West Germany in daylight round the flank of the defences, and this in turn might force the enemy to bring back fighters from the Eastern Front in order to defend the Fatherland."

Before I reached General Creagh\u2019s Headquarters, General Messervy had ordered the withdrawal of. the forward troops, as it appeared to him that unless he withdrew without delay the enemy column from Sidi Omar combined with the enemy column from the westward would completely surround him and close his line of retreat. The 7th Armoured Brigade had by: this time, as already stated, only some 20 Cruiser tanks in action, while the 4th Armoured Brigade was reduced to less than 20 \u2018\u2018I\u201d\u2019 tanks. Both air force and ground observation estimated the advancing enemy columns as containing at least 200 tanks supported by numerous artillery."

By the early hours of the 17th June the first A.A. regiment fo move had taken up its new positions and the deployment of the balloon barrage had also begun. When drawing up the plan we had calculated that deployment would take eighteen days to complete and that it would be wiser to allow twenty-five days; the Air Ministry had expected to be able to give us a month\u2019s warning. In the event we had received no warning at all, apart fom that provided \u2018by the Germans themselves on the 13th June. In the circumstances it was imperative that we should get the job done quickly. The original time-table went by the board. Thanks to the admini trative arrangements which had already been made and to remarkable feats by both AntiAircraft Command and Balloon Command, the whole of the planned deployment was virtually complete by the 21st June, only five days after. the issue of the order to deploy."

I originally wanted this operation to be Jaunched if possible before the spring offensive opened but it had been postponed to a date between 2oth and 25th May. On 16th May I was informed that it had been further postponed till mid-June. This removed almost all the value of the operation as by that time our troops, advancing overland, would be almost level with the island and on rath June I asked whether the forces earmarked for Elba could not rather be used for a landing on the\u2019 mainland in support of Fifth Army. However, this was considered unacceptable as the French would not consent to the use in Italy of \u2018g Colonial Infantry Division, which they wanted to keep for the landings in France. The operation therefore went in as planned in the early morning of 17th June; the occupation of the island was complete by the afternoon of the roth. Steps were taken to emplace medium guns in the north-eastern corner of the island to command Piombino but the town fell on 25th June without the necessity for their use."

            "description": "On these orders the pursuit was pressed rapidly. The main difference was that 13 Corps was no longer directed on the TerniRieti area but farther afield; this meant that the South Africans were no longer to turn eastwards to cross the Tiber to seize Narni as originally planned, but to press on to Orvieto. Here again a difficult question of routeing was involved since both they and II Corps were in danger of arriving simultaneously at Viterbo. I decided to give precedence to the armour and II Corps was halted in place until the South Africans were through. Meanwhile VI Corps made rapid progress up the coast in spite of the arrival of two fresh German divisions. On the gth it captured Tarquinia and a task force from 1 Armoured Division, operating on the inland flank, cut into II Corps\u2019 territory to capture the Viterbo airfield. On the rrth, however, VI Corps was relieved by IV Corps and moved to Naples, coming under command of Seventh Army for operation ANVIL. II ad pushed forward with 85 and up the axis of Route 2 and consolidated the position between VI and 13 Corps. It was relieved by the French on oth June. On the oth Eighth Amy had also carried out a regrouping; the Tiber was now to be the boundary between 13 and 10 Corps, with the latter commanding all the troops formerly in 13 Corps east of the river. The final result was to give 13 Corps 78 and 6 South African Divisions, with 4 Division in reserve, and 10 Corps 6 British Armoured and 8 Indian Infantry Divisions, with 10 Indian as reserve. The Canadians were grounded south of Rome. The Polish Corps, which had passed to Army Group reserve on 26th May after the capture of Piedimonte, assumed command of the Adriatic sector from 5 Corps on 17th June, remaining under direct command of my headquarters until 29th June when it passed to Eighth Army.
