was sanctioned by the Air Ministry and carried
out, but five squadrons ‘were definitely too
many for the total number of Buffaloes avail-
able, and overstrained the reserves. 4

84. The Buffalo proved disappointing, at any
rate when up against the Japanese Zerotfighter.
This was due partly to technical reaSons and
partly to incomplete training of pilots. With
Tegard to the former the performance of the
Buffaloes at heights of 10,000 feet and over
were relatively poor. (See Appendix “L’’).
Whilst it had been realised that the Buffalo
Jacked speed, it had been hoped that, with good
warning system and the comparatively small
area of important objectives, e.g., the Naval
Base, it would be able to reach the height neces-
sary before the arrival of enemy aircraft, and
that its better armament would enable our
squadrons to give a good account of themselves.
Whether deliberately or not, the Japanese
appear to have sacrificed armour and armament
in their Zero fighters in order to save weight,
thereby obtaining the advantage of rate of
climb and manoeuvrability at heights. In the
case of these two particular types, the technical
advantage certainly lay with the Japanese.
Attempts were made to improve the perform-
ance of the Buffalo by substituting .303 for the
-5. In addition some trouble was experienced
with the valve gear of the ‘Cyclone engine in the
Buffalo, and with the interrupter gear of the
two fuselage guns. The Buffalo was unsuitable
for night flying owing to the exhaust flames,
flame dampers would have been essential for
night flying but were not available. Actually
this was not serious as I had laid down that the
Buffalo was to be used for day work only, and
that, by night, reliance was to be placed on
the A.A. guns assisted by Blenheim fighters.

Pilots have been referred to in paragraph 83
above. What the R.A.F. lacked in Malaya was
a good proportion of pilots with practical war
experience. Apart from forming a leaven when
operations started, they could have taught the
new pilots those niceties of manoeuvre and aim-
ing which just make the difference between miss-
ing the enemy and bringing him down, the type
of training that can only be given as a result of
experience. Again all the Buffalo squadrons
were formed in Malaya and there was no
squadron with practical war experience to set
a standard, and it is possible that in some
respects ours was not sufficiently high for
modern conditions.

85. Apart from the fighter squadron in
Burma, we had in Malaya in December, ro4r,
a total of four Buffalo squadrons, one Dutch
fighter squadron, which arfived on the oth
December, and one Blenheim squadron, the Jast
principally for night fighting. This total was
considered adequate both by the Chiefs of Staff
and by my own General Headquarters, but
results showed that more fighter squadrons were
required, largely because the scope of a fighter’s
duties has widened. One Buffalo squadron was
specially trained for Army co-operation, and we
really wanted two. I had also agreed with the
Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Fleet, that one
squadron, which ought to have been a Buffalo,
should be trained in the duties of fighter pro-
tection for ships. Fighter squadrons are also
the most efficient type with which to attack
enemy aerodromes. To carry out these func-
tions at all adequately, as well as the normal
duties of a fighter, at least seven fighter

squadrons were needed in Malaya alone, with-
out allowing for night fighters.

Long-Range Bombers. .

86. The need for long-range bombers had
been constantly pressed from the time I was first
appointed Commander-in-Chief, Far East. At
that time I had merely felt that they would be
wanted without having any concrete proposals,
but as the Japanese advanced into Southern
Indo-China, the object for which they would be
used became clear and definite. The targets
which we wished to reach in Southern Indo-
China were just within reach of Blenheim IV’s
from the Northern end of Malaya, and of Hud-
sons, but we had too few of the former and the
latter were required for overseas reconnaissance.

Six Beauforts were flown from Australia a
few days before the war started, but as these
aircraft were not operational, and as the crews
tequired considerable operational training in
their use, the Air Officer Commanding, with my
concurrence, sent all bar one, which was re-
tained in the hope of using it for photographic
work, back to Australia in order that they might
continue their training under suitable conditions.

Other Requirements.

87. Other requirements which were realised
too late were special aircraft for photographic
reconnaissance and transport aircraft for facili-
tating the rapid movement of squadrons. Photo-
graphic aircraft were first asked for in August,
1941, after the visit of a special photographic
officer. The Dutch were ready to help us in the
second requirement, but once war had started
were making full use of their transport aircraft
for their own purposes, and we felt the lack of
having a few of our own available at very short
notice.

It was also suggested at one time that a
balloon barrage would be valuable for the pro-
tection of Singapore, especially the Naval Base.
Experiments, however, proved that the climate
and meteorology of Malaya were quite unsuit-
able for the use of kite balloons.

88. The strength and location of the Royal
Air Force in the Far East on the 7th Decem-
ber, 1941, are given in Appendix J and a sum-
mary of serviceable aircraft in Malaya on
different dates in December in Appendix K.

Our most serious deficiency at that time was
in reserves, partly of pilots, but principally air-
craft. It was not only a stock of reserve aero-
planes we wanted, but also a continuous flow of
new aircraft to replace wastage, for aeroplanes
must be regarded as expendable material, and
there must be a regular, continuous channel
of supply. ‘Without these it was impossible to
keep the squadrons up to their first-line estab-
lishment. Apart from the material weakness,
failure to keep up what is commonly known as
“* a full breakfast table ’’ always has an adverse
effect on squadrons’ morale.

89. There were several civil flying clubs in
Malaya, and the Air Officer Commanding had
organised for these an Auxiliary Air Force,
which did useful work in communication and
assistance to the Army in certain aspects of
training.
