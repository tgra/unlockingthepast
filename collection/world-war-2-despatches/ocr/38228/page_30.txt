General Sir Archibald Wavell, and there he
gave me a resumé of the situation in Burma
and a verbal directif to the following effect: —
“ The retention of Rangoon was a matter
of vital importance to our position in the
Far East and every effort must be made to
hold it. If, however, that was not possible
the force must not be allowed to bé cut
off and destroyed but must be withdrawn
from the Rangoon area for the defence of
Upper Burma. This must be held as; long
as possible in order to safeguard the oil fields
at Yenangyaung, keep contact with‘ the
Chinese and protect the construction of the
toad from Assam to Burma.”

Part I.—OperATIONS RESULTING IN THE Loss
3 OF RANGOON.

3. After this conference with the Com-
mander-in-Chief I flew to Magwe, which I
reached that evening. On the morning of the
5th March I flew to Rangoon, arriving at Army
Headquarters at midday.

4.* Situation at the Time of my Arrival. On
arrival at Army Headquarters I found that
General Hutton was away at the front, and,
in his absence, the situation was explained to
me by the staff as follows:—

17 Indian Division were holding the area
Pegu-Hlegu with—48 Infantry Brigade and 7
Armoured Brigade in area Pegu;.16 Infantry
Brigade—Hlegu. .
Both these Infantry Brigades were very weak

and disorganised as explained in General
Hutton’s Report.

63 Infantry Brigade, having just disem-
barked, was at Hlawga, sixteén miles north of
Rangoon, but its transport was still on board
ship.

? Burma Division having handed over the
defence of Southern Shan States to Chinese
Sixth Army was located :—

13 Indian Infantry Brigade—Mawchi.

I Burma Brigade—Pyu.

2 Burma Brigade—Nyaunglebin.

There was a gap of 40 miles between forward
elements of 1 Burma Division and 17 Division.
There were Japanese forces in Waw and the
neighbouring villages north and north-east of
Pegu, and in addition Japanese columns had
been infiltrating across the Sittang River between
Pegu and Nyaunglebin under cover of dark-
ness for some days. These had entered the
Pegu Yomas, the jungle country north and
north-west of Pegu.

5.* Operations at Pegu. In view of this situa-

tion, which looked, to say the least, serious, °

I set off at once for the* Headquarters of 17
Division at Hlegu where I met General Hutton
and Major-General Cowan, commanding 17
Division. The situation was here explained to
me again but in more detail and General Hutton
told me of the orders for the evacuation of Kan-
goon which he wished to issue but hadyheld
up pending my arrival. I was not satisfied
that Rangoon could not be held but it appeared
to me that the only course of action which ‘could
save the situation was to effect a junction be-
tween 1 Burma Division and 17 Division with
the object of preventing any further Japanese
infiltration into the Yomas. I accordingly
ordered 17 Division to carry out offensive

* See General Hutton’s Report, Section IX.

SUPPLEMENT To tue LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 10948

operations against the Japanese at Waw and in
the neighbouring villages with a view to reliev-
ing pressure on their immediate front, and at
the same time I ordered 2 Infantry Brigade
of xr Burma Division to advance south from
Nyaunglebin to join hands with 17 Division.
The offensive carried out on 5th March by the
17 Division and part of the Armoured Brigade
from Pegu was locally successful but during
this operation the Japanese attacked from the
wooded country bordering Pegu on the west
and succeeded in capturing a part of the town.
Considerable fighting took place there on 6th
March but 17 Division were not successful in
ejecting the Japanese. Meanwhile, the wider
enemy encircling movement which had been in
progress when I arrived had developed, and the
road from Rangoon south-west of Pegu which
had been under snipers’ fire on 5th March was
definitely cut on 6th March.

6. Decision to withdraw from Rangoon.
Counter-attacks to open the road failed and I
then ordered 63 Indian Infantry Brigade to be
put at the disposal of the Commander 17
Division.

An attack on 6th March by this Infantry Bri-
gade to open the road was not successful and
the situation by noon on this day was as
follows : — .

The troops cut off in Pegu consisted of —

7 Hussars, 48 Indian Infantry Brigade, 1 W.

Yorks, and 1 Cameronians.

{There was further confirmation that a force
of 2,000 Japanese previously reported by
Burma Frontier Force patrols had passed
through Paunggyi about 30 miles north of
Hlegu and was moving in a south-westerly
direction.

fIt was also confirmed about this time that
a number of traitor Burmans with Japanese
officers had landed at the mouth of the Ran-.
goon River, threatening the Syriam refineries
where there was only a small garrison.

In view of this situation I considered that the
retention of Rangoon was quite impossible with
the comparatively small forces at my disposal,
dispersed as they were and with part of them
already encircled.

I therefore decided that the right course of
action was to order the destruction of the oil
refineries at Syriam, the evacuation of Rangoon
and the regrouping of my forces north of Ran-
goon in the Irrawaddy valley. The order to
put the Denial Scheme into operation was issued
at midnight on the 6th March.

7. Force cut off and breaks out at Taukkyan.
On the morning of the 7th March, Army Head-
quarters, administrative units and troops not
required to cover the demolitions in Rangoon
area moved out of Rangoon on the Prome road.
Near Taukkyan, twenty-one miles north of
Rangodh at about zz.00 hours, the leading
vehicles of Army Headquarters ran into an
enemy road block and the column was held up.
Attempts by the x Glosters, 2/13  F.F
Rifles and some tanks of the 7 Hussars
throughout the day failed to clear the block.
It must be remembered here that the force in
Pegu was still cut off, all the efforts on the
6th March of the 63 Infantry Brigade to relieve
it having been unsuccessful.
