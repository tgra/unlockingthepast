SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON

Command. The provision of reserves of sup-
plies, stores, ammunition and petrol, of signal
equipment and personnel, and of personnel to
man various installations on the lines of com-
munication, was a severe strain on my slender
resources. By reduction to the minimum else-
where, provision was made, but on a scale of
signals far below requirements.

At the end of August advantage was taken
of the presence of the agth Brigade at Mombasa
to test defensive arrangements by a practice
attack. In addition to the Naval, Military and
Air operations involved, whch were made as
Tealistic as circumstances permitted, the whole
of Kenya, the eastern half of Tanganyika and
the Islands of Zanzibar were, by special legis-
lation, placed under a state of emergency for
a’ period of several days. Surprise landings by
the Royal Navy and Royal Marines took place
at various points between Mombasa and Dar

-e3 Salaam. Pseudo-prisoners of war escaped.
“Fifth Columnists’ interrupted road and
signal communications and spread false
rumours, Activities of this nature were wide-
spread and kept even remote places alive. The
Civil Governments and population, both Euro-
pean and African, entered wholeheartedly into
the exercise with beneficial results.

On r1th August, authority was received from
the Chiefs of Staff to proceed with the execu-
tion of Madagascar operations. Admiral Sir
J. F. Somerville, K.C.B., K.B.E., D.S.O., and
myself were charged with the joint Direction
of the operations We nominated Rear-
Admiral W. G. Tennant, C.B., M.V.O., and.
Major-General R. G. Sturges, C.B., A.D.C., as
Joint Commanders. The latter in turn ap-
pointed Brigadier F. W. Festing, D.S.O., and
Captain G. A, Garnons-Williams, D.S.C., as
Joint Assault Commanders for the operations
against Majunga and Tamatave,

The assault on Majunga. was finally settled
to.take place on roth September, a delay of
two days owing to the slow speed of some of
the vessels in the three convoys that started
from Mombasa.

; .  , Landing at Majunga.

By noon on gth September the three con-
voys from Montbasa and the convoy carrying
zand (E.A.) Brigade Group from Diego Suarez,
met at their rendezvous in the Mozambique
Channel. By. dusk the whole force was just
out of sight of land West of Majunga. Neither
air nor surface craft had sighted the move-
ment. Secrecy and surprise appeared to have
been obtained. The spirit of all ranks and
ratings was high. Shortly before midnight the
leading ship of the column of 49 moving in
single line ahead, dropped anchor. The re-
mainder moved silently to their appointed
stations. The moon had ‘not yet risen. The
Royal Navy under Admiral Tennant had, with
great efficiency, brought every ship, un-
observed, to its exact position with a short
margin of time in hand, and ‘gave us the chance
of effecting a successful landing. Great credit
is due to them. .

Shortly after or0o hours the Royal Welch
Fusiliers and East Lancashire Regiment landed
at a point on an open beach eight miles north
of Majunga, quickly followed by Headquarters,
2gth Independent Brigade. Their task was to
attack the town from the North and North-East
at dawn thus getting behind the coast defences,

GAZETTE, 317 JULY, 1946 3717

At first light, the South. Lancashire Regiment
and 5 Commando landed at selected points on
the sea front of the town itself,

Resistance was slight. No firing by naval
guns was necessary. By o800. hours the town
was in our hands at a cost of twenty
casualties. The reserve battalion and the
transport of the Brigade were retained on
board. ’

Soft sand and scrub in the dark caused some
delay to the landing, behind the Royal Welch
Fusiliers, of the South African Armoured Cars
and one portée Company of 1/1 (Nyasaland)
King’s African Rifles whose task was to make
a dash for the bridges over the River Kamoro
and. River Betsiboka. Despite this delay the
first of these bridges, 90 miles inland, was
secured intact by 1800 hours on the same day.
roth September, but the centre bridge of the
three over the River Betsiboka, 40 miles
further on, was found in the early hours of the
following morning to have been blown. As
the road-way of this bridge, over 400 feet .
long, had fortunately fallen straight down on
to the river bed without turning over, the
construction of ramps at each end enabled a
continuous, though slow, stream of traffic to be
maintained until the first heavy rains in Octo-
ber made it impassable.

Simultaneously with the landing at Majunga,
the Island of Nosy Be on the North-West
coast was occupied with its important sugar
and carborundum factories. A South African
Battalion Group of the 1st City Regiment be-

nm an advance from Beremanja towards

ajunga. Some days later a small column
started North from Majunga to meet the South
Africans. When junction had been effected,
both columns returned to their bases. Other
small columns of South African troops went
down the North East coast and cleared the
road to Vohemar. A party of forty from 5
Commando landed from H.M.S. ‘‘ Napier”
at Morandava, a small town on the West
coast, of the Island. By advancing some forty
miles inland on their push-bicycles, and by
intelligent use of the telephone, this party
created the desired impression that a column of
various arms with mechanised transport was
advancing on the capital from this place. After
48 hours on land, the diversion was re-
embarked.

As soon, as it became apparent that Majunga
was safely in our hands, landing of 2and
(E.A.) Infantry Brigade Group commenced
and the 29th Brigade returned to their ships
preparatory for their voyage round the North
of the Island for a fresh landing at Tamatave.
Their re-embarkation was completed by the
13th September. They sailed the same day.”

gand (E.A.) Infantry Brigade had been pre-
viously organised, into three Battalion Groups
so that there would be no delay in the despatch
of a small self-contained force as far inland
as the strength of opposition permitted. At
the same time care had to be taken against
becoming prematurely involved with a
superior force, and the possibility of defeat in
detail. From-a careful examination of
“fonn ” it appeared to me that the advan-
tage of time gained outweighed the risks.
When it became a practical fact that four to
five days would be -required to land each
battalion group complete with its transport and
supplies, the advantage of an early forward
move became more obvious, i
