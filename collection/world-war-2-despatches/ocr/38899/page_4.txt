27. There can be little doubt that the
psychological effect upon our troops of seeing
. these heavy ships bombarding close inshore
played a large part in relieving a situation
which at one time showed every indication of
becoming extremely grave.

The End of the Operation.

28. The Military situation, stabilised on
D+6, 15th September, gradually improved;
indications of a general German withdrawal
were seen on D+7. On 19th September,
Eboli and, on 20th, Campagna and several
other towns in the vicinity were captured.
Five days later the port of Salerno was re-
opened, followed quickly by the capture of
Castellammare on 28th and of Torre
Annunziata the next day. Naples was
entered on lst October and with its capture,
Operation “ Avalanche ” drew to a close. The
port of Naples had been carefully and
methodically wrecked by the withdrawing
enemy, but even so, two days later five
Liberty ship berths, six coaster berths and
eight holding berths were cleared. By the 6th
October discharge over the Salerno beaches
was almost completed, the port of Naples was
functioning slowly, and on that day Operation
“ Avalanche” was officially deemed to have
been completed.

Lessons Learnt.

29. Owing to the considerable period which
has elapsed since Operation “ Avalanche ” was
carried out and the fact that the experience
gained therein has been embodied in other
operations, it is redundant to remark at length
upon the lessons learnt. Owing to the short
_period which had elapsed between Operations
“ Husky ” and “ Avalanche”, but few of the
difficulties brought to light in the first operation
were remedied in time for the second. My
remarks on Operation “Husky” still hold
good, but to some extent these mistakes have
now been rectified and it is not intended
to elaborate upon them further.

Conclusions.

30. Operation “ Avalanche” was the most
ambitious amphibious operation so far
launched. That it succeeded after many
vicissitudes reflects great credit on Vice-
Admiral Hewitt, U.S.N., his subordinate
and all those who served
That there were extremely
anxious moments cannot be denied. The enemy
employed new types of weapons and defended
his positions with a ferocity which we have
now come to regard as normal, but at the time
it provided a severe test to our Military Com-
manders. I am proud to say that throughout
the operation, the Navies never faltered and
carried out their tasks in accordance with the
highest traditions of their Services. Whilst full
acknowledgment must be made of the devastat-
ing though necessarily intermittent bombing
by the Allied Air Forcés, it was Naval gun-
fire, incessant in effect, that held the ring when
there was danger of the enemy breaking through
to the beaches and when the overall position
looked so gloomy. More cannot be said.

APPENDIX I.
PLANNING.

On completion of the Sicilian Campaign
there were many and changing factors involved
in the decision as to the location of the main
assault on the Italian coast. Not until August
19th was it decided that the planning and
mounting of Operation “Avalanche” should
be given first priority. Plans involving landings
in the Gulf of Gioija* (Operation “ Buttress ”),
in the Gulf of Taranto and on the Italian coast
North of Brindisi (Operations “ Musket” and
“ Goblet”), were all examined: and progressed
to a certain extent. Operation “ Buttress ” was
in fact fully planned and: detailed orders were
issued to the ships concerned. This uncertainty’
led to an immense amount of work for my
planning staff and for the British Naval ‘Com-
manders involved, all of whom had two or
more problems to examine.

2. It was the intention that the “ Buttress ”
Force would become the Northern Assault
Force for “ Avalanche” and that an American
force would provide the “ Avalanche ” Southern
Assault Force. By this means it was hoped
that it would be practicable to switch
from Operation “Buttress” to Operation
“ Avalanche” without upsetting the detailed
planning to any marked extent. For a variety
of reasons this combination proved not to be
so simple as had been imagined, the chief
difficulty being that “ Buttress” involved the
use of only one port, namely Vibo Valencia,
whereas in “Avalanche” the plan had to
allow for the eventual capture and development
of Salerno, Castellammare, Torre Annunziata
and Naples.

- 3. As a result of the several plans under
consideration, planning for Operation
“ Avalanche”. was conducted almost simul-
taneously on the levels of the Commander-in-
Chief, Mediterranean, the Western Task Force
Commander, who had no other operation to
plan,. and the subordinate Task Force. Com-
manders, one of whom, Commodore G. N.
Oliver, R.N. (the Northern Assault Force Com-
mander), was planning in detail’ for both
“ Buttress ” and “ Avalanche” concurrently.

4, Naval planning memoranda were issued
as for previous operations in this theatre to
disseminate the building of the plan to the
subordinate Commanders. It is no exaggera-
tion to say that without this system these
subordinate Commanders could never have pro-
duced their own orders in time for the opera-
tion, as planning was taking place on all levels
simultaneously, as stated in the Preceding
paragraph.

5. Further difficulty was experienced through
the frequent changes of plan introduced by the
Fifth Army, many of which took place at a
very late date. The Commander Western Naval
Task Force comments strongly on this point
in his report.

6. The sailing and routeing of the assault
convoys called for careful timing and accurate
