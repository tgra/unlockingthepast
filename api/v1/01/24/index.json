As a result General Anderson was appointed by General Eisenhower on ist January to “‘ co-ordinate ’’ the whole front and on 24th January both XIX and II Corps were placed directly under his command. At the same time General Kuter, of the United States Army Air Corps, was appointed to co-ordinate all Allied air support under command of General Spaatz then Deputy Commander-inChief Allied Air: Forces.",

            "description": "91. Before going on to the next phase of operations and the Japanese reactions to our crossings, which are described in the next section, I will draw attention to the progress made in Northern Burma on the Northern Combat Area Command front since my last mention of it (paragraphs 43-47). Nambkam fell to 30 Chinese Division on the 15th January. 38 Chinese Division entered the village of Muse on the 22nd, linking up with the Chinese Expeditionary Force which had just captured Wanting, thus reopening a through route from Burma to China. The American “Mars” Brigade were operating in the area 30 miles north-west of Hsenwi, into which 56 Japanese Division from the ‘Wanting area was withdrawing. The main body of 36 British Division (26 and 72 Brigades) was advancing south on Mongmit and, at the end of January, it had teached a point on the Shweli River 18 miles to the north of that place. One detached brigade (29 Brigade) of this Division had made considerable progress down the east bank of the Irrawaddy, capturing Twinnge, 15 miles north of 19 Indian Division’s bridgehead at Thabeikkyin on the 24th January. It then turned due east along the main road to Mongmit.",
