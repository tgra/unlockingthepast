g. The A/S Air Patrols, when the necessary Walrus Aircraft were available, were carried out outside a circle 27 miles radius centred about the points 68 35 N17 10 E. The various outer surface A/S Patrols being situated on the circumference of this circle. The sectors, centred in Harstad Harbour being:

40 miles.

Y. Between 300  and 245  to a depth of

50 miles,

Z. Between 245  and 225  to a depth of

Too miles.

Q. Between 225  and 190  to a depth of

80 miles.

io. After the sinking of U.49 on x5th April, no contacts with enemy submarines were made throughout the remainder of the operations, though many reports of them being sighted in the vicinity were received. An Irish Guardsman fishing at Bogen landed a used Escape

Apparatus belonging to U.64. ir. Five enemy aircraft were seen on the 2oth May, apparently laying mines in

Tjeldsundet South Channel, and in the subsequent sweeping operations 4 mines were exPloded, 2 by non-magnetic sweep and 2, later, by magnetic.

A SUMMARY OF THE EVENTS IN THE Mosjo En Mo Bopo Ara.

1. On the 29th April, I received a message from C.I.G.S. informing me that it was essential that the Head of Saltfiord should be occupied to ensure that there should be no chance of Germans arriving by parachute. The telegram indicated that a force to occupy the area would be leaving U.K. immediately. A destroyer was sent forthwith and was followed by a detach-

ment of the Scots Guards, 150 strong. The .

destroyer reported no Germans or shipping of any sort in the vicinity.

2. On the rst May an order was received from the Admiralty to send a destroyer to Mo to prevent an enemy landing and the excellent proposal was made by the Admiralty to Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, that a Division of Destroyers should be established to patrol the coast from Namsos North to prevent the movement of every troopship/s by sea. This unfortunately never materialised.

3. Preparations for the embarkation in U.K. of Independent Companies of troops for Mo and Mosjoen were made known to me by signal, and T also received information that 2 Flying-Boats were coming out to reconnoitre aerodromes in the Bodo area. Their life was short. They were caught and put out of action on the water by enemy aircraft on the 4th May.

4. On May 4th, I came to the conclusion that it was time that policy and responsibility in the Bodo area was defined and I accordingly addressed the following message to the Admiralty :

 * Request I may be informed of the general policy regarding Bodo, Mo and Mosjoen. It

GAZETTE, 10 JULY, 1947 3973 seems most important to hold in force the Mo road leading north. From Admiralty messages it appears the forces being sent are hardly adequate for this purpose and with such weak detachments in the air another naval commitment comes into being. These areas do not, I presume, come under Narvik. Are there any other allied forces to the south of me. 

5. The Admiralty reply received next day was to the effect that it was not possible to maintain large forces in face of enemy air superiority well in advance of established fighter aerodromes and that Bodo was the only place south of Narvik where such could be established. That small parties only would be maintained at Mo and Mosjoen with the object of cbstructing enemy advance and to prevent landings by sea and air. On the 7th May I learned that all Independent Companies operating in Northen Norway would come under Narvik  Command and I was given details of their disposition under Colonel Gubbins. Anxiety was expressed by the Norwegian Commander-inChief as to the potential aerodromes in Bode , Mosjoen area. :

6. On the 7th and 8th the enemy advance north began to make itself felt. A French detachment at Mosjoen first reported the enemy 100 miles to the south and on the 8th I heard that Mosjoen was about to be evacuated. On the gth the Germans were ro miles off Mosjoen and Brigadier Gubbins reported that there was great concern amongst the Norwegians about the continued enemy advance and that he would withdraw gradually to Mo and eventually to Bodo.

7. I suggested to the Admiralty on the 7th that, if the Division of Destroyers they had originally proposed could not be provided, 2 Destroyers might be added to my force and I would manage the patrol, but on the roth the Admiralty required me to reduce my Destroyer force by 4 vessels on account of the need for concentration in the southern part of the North   Sea. On the same day, the Admiralty informed me it was essential to hold Bodo for the present.

8. On the evening of the roth May, the enemy were successful in landing a force of 650 men at Hemnes near Mo partly from a coasting steamer which came north with aerial escort. Intelligence concerning the movements of this vessel reached me unfortunately too late for her to be intercepted by CALCUTTA and ZULU who were sent for the purpose. CALCUTTA sank the steamer at Hemnes an hour and a half   after she had got alongside. Reinforcements with light A.A. guns were embarked in ENTERPRISE for passage to Mo.

g. Wing-Commander Atcherley who had visited the area reported to Air Ministry and Admiralty by W/T on the advanced state of preparedness of the aerodrome at Mo and its great value to the enemy should it fall into their hands. '

Io. Mosjoen was evacuated, equipment being abandoned, on the rath May. ENTERPRISE accompanied by CAIRO landed reinforcements at Mo on the 12th and other reinforcements had reached Bodo on the 11th. The enemy was now subjecting Mo to heavy air attacks and at the same time I was informed that while no fighter or A.A, reinforcements beyond those already authorised could be  expected, forces at Bodo must be supplied from the Narvik area.
