SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

of the Allied forces in the Mediterranean theatre,
the Commando Supremo assumed that we were
able to pat on shore, at any point of the Italian
coastline we chose, a force of such a size that,
with the assistance of the Italian troops in the
country, the Germans would either be destroyed
or driven from Italy in rout. The least they
hoped was that the Germans would be forced to
evacuate all Italy south of the Apennines, the
later ‘‘ Gothic ’ line. In that case the authority
of the Royal Government would continue over
the greater part of the country, the capital would
be secured, the Italian Armed Forces, though
reduced in size, would remain in being with
the position of the Commando Supremo unim-

paired, and Italy would be able to take her place.

among the United Nations.

I have dwelt at some length on the military
conceptions underlying the Italian offer because,
unless they are thoroughly grasped, the pro-
gress of negotiations and subsequent operations
will be misunderstood.* They were clearly
brought out at the meeting in Lisbon between
Castellano and General Eisenhower’s emissaries.
The latter began by presenting the Allied
Armistice terms; these had already been pre-
pared on the news of the fall of Mussolini in
anticipation of an approach by the Italians and
the approval of the Allied Governments ob-
tained on ist August. They were short and
straightforward, dealing only with military
matters; the full terms were not yet presented
but the Italian Government, in accepting the
short terms, was to undertake to sign the more
comprehensive instrument at a later date.
Castellano’s reaction was as might have been
expected from the circumstances of the Italian
decision; almost disregarding the question of
surrender terms, which he said, indeed, he was
not authorised to discuss, he declared that his
purpose was to concert the means by which
Italy would transfer her allegiance from the

German to the Allied side.t What -he was -

interested in was our plans for the invasion of
Italy, to see what help we could give to the
Ttalian forces in resisting the Germans. He was
told that there was no question of our revealing
our intentions; not only was this an obvious
measure of security in so dubious a situation
but also, and more important, if the Commando
Supremo had been apprised of the fact that
the utmost we could do was to land three
divisions no further north than Salerno they
would undoubtedly have decided to postpone
capitulation to a more propitious date.
Castellano was therefore merely informed that,
if the Italian Government accepted our terms,
cessation of hostilities would take effect from a
date and hour to be notified later; this would
be five or six hours before the main Allied Jand-
ings, which would be in considerable strength.
At that time the Supreme Allied Commander

*¥For instance the time which elapsed between
18 August, our first contact with the Italians, 3
September, the signing of the armistice and 9 Sep-
tember, the Salerno landing, has been ascribed to our
intransigent insistence on, and Italian reluctance to
accept, the principle of unconditional surrender. In

fact the Italians never, raised any difficulties on this ; .

their delay was caused possibly by natural hesitation
and certainly by their desire to discover our plans be-
fore committing themselves finally. The date of 9
September, of course, was determined by the avail-
ability of landing craft and the phases of the moon.

‘t General Castellano has published an account of
these negotiations under the title ‘Come Firmai
TArmistizio di Cassibile ”. It is strikingly factual and
sober.

would broadcast an announcement of the
armistice; the Italian Government must simul-
taneously make a similar announcement and
order its forces and people to collaborate with
the Allies and resist the Germans, its fleet and
shipping to sail to Allied ports and its aircraft
to fly to Allied bases, and ensure that all Allied
prisoners in danger of falling into German hands
should be released. Italian formations in the
Balkans should be ordered to march down to
the coast preparatory to evacuation.

With this Castellano had to be content; there
was a considerable element of bluff in our atti-
tude but it seemed likely that the bluff would
be successful. It was clear throughout that his
interest was centred, not on the distastefulness
of surrender, but on apprehensions of what the
Germans might do. One threat with which the
latter had made great play was to employ gas
against the Italian cities. For our part we did
not allow ourselves to be carried away by the
prospect of invading Italy with Italian assist-
ance. I was sceptical as to the amount of assist-
ance we should actually receive and determined
not to attempt any rash operation, such as try-
ing to land our three divisions out of range
of air cover, in reliance on such assistance.
This judgment, based on past experience, was
justified in the sequel; I had expected a little
more resistance to the Germans than was actu-
ally offered, but not much more. Any help,
however, was welcome, for the German forces
in Italy were growing at an alarming speed.
At any rate the Italian Government was clearly
in earnest, as it proved by the subsequent des-
patch to Lisbon of General Zanussi and General
‘Carton de Wiart.*

Our next direct contact with General Castel-
lano was on 31st August at Cassibile in Sicily. I
had moved my headquarters there on the bth,
The scene of a historic disaster in 413 B.C.,
which marked the downfall of the Athenian em-
pire, it was now destined to be the scene of the
signature of an armistice which sealed the dis-
solution of the Italian empire and the disappear-
ance of Htaly from the ranks of the Great
Powers. General Smith, representing General
Eisenhower, Admiral Cunningham, Air Marshal
Tedder and I were present, and General Clark
also attended. It was clear that the Italian
Government was prepared to accept any terms
we offered but that it was obsessed by the fear
that the Germans would be able, when the
armistice was announced, to seize control of
the whole country in spite of any resistance
their troops might offer. German troops con-
tinued to pour in; from Naples southwards there
were the four divisions which had been evacu-
ated from Sicily, reinforced by two armoured
divisions which had not yet been engaged, but
there were between ten and twelve divisions in
the rest of Italy, including two well placed
for a stroke against Rome. Castellano now said
that his government could not accept our terms
unless we revealed our intentions, so that they
could judge whether we were coming in siffi-
cient force. He pleaded with us at least to
assure him that the landing would be made
north of Rome and. in strength not less than
fifteen divisions: he even seemed to think that
we could land a force of that size in the area

*The former was sent, apparently on his own
iniitiative, by General Roatta, Chief of the Army General
Staff; Lieutenant-General (now Sir Adrian) Carton de
Wiart, V.C., K.B.E., C.B., CM.G., D.S.O., a prisoner
of war in Italy, was released as a pledge of good faith.
