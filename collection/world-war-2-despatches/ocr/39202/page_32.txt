quarters ship H.M.S. BULOLO which carried
jAir Vice-Marshal Bandon and his advance
H.Q. 224 Group staff who moved ashore to
Kelanang airfield on September 10th; Telok
Datok on September 14th ; Kuala Lumpur on

383. The landing at Port Dickson, some fifty
miles south of Swettenham, went forward as
planned and without untoward incident.

384. On the eve of the 11th September, the
D-plus-3 convoy dropped anchor among the
great concentration of shipping already lying
off Morib Beach. The scene, with every vessel

inkling lights, resembled more a Cowes
regatta than one of the largest amphibious
operations of the campaign.

385. The landings at Morib cannot de
described as attaining the same degree of
success as those experienced at Ports Swetten-
ham and Dickson—due principally to the diffi-
culties encountered on the water-covered
beaches which, at that part of the coast, are
nothing more than mud brought down by the
Klang River. Morib is some 20 miles south
of Port Swettenham and 30 miles north of
Port Dickson. (While there was much to com-
mend Port Swettenham and Port Dickson for
landings by a fighting force, this unfortunately,
could not be said of Morib. A number of
M.T. vehicles which were driven off the landing
craft by their Army drivers into what was
considered axle-deep water, later plunged into
slime and mud while negotiating the shore and
remained fast. There were several casualties.

386. These are important factors which
might well have produced serious consequences
had “ Zipper” been mounted against opposing
forces on dry land at this part of the coast,

Some ASPECTS OF THE OCCUPATION OF SIAM,
F.LC. ann Hone Kone.

387, On the occupation of Siam, the Don
Muang airfield at Bangkok provided two im-
portant functions. It enabled released Allied
prisoners-of-war to be evacuated by our aircraft
to Rangoon and Singapore, while it also
formed a valuable staging post to Saigon in
French Indo-China as well as a refuelling point
for aircraft lifting there.

388. In Bangkok, the Siamese Air Force was
found to be extraordinarily co-operative and
markedly pro-R.AF., since many of them had,
in fact, been trained in England.

389. An unusual document, giving an out-
line of the activities and organisation of the
Siamese Air Force, and also emphasising its
attitude of passive resistance to the Japanese

_ throughout the enemy’s occupation of Siam,
was handed over by the Siamese Air Force to
R.AF. Intelligence,

390. History must judge this document for
itself. Whatever may have been happening
politically behind the scenes in the Far East,
in these dark days of December, 1941, there
seems to be no doubt that units of the Siamese
Air Force, on December 8th, took the air to
resist the Japanese invader, only to be out-
numbered and overwhelmed by units of the
more superior Japanese Air Force. While this
commendable spirit of resistance by the
Siamese Air Force may have been evident, they

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951

‘were to learn sadly, the same day, that the

Siamese Government in Bangkok was actually
negotiating with the Japanese Ambassador.

391, “From outer appearances we played
up to mislead the Japanese”, is one cot
in the Siamese document when discussing the
defence of Siam during the period of Japanese
occupation. In their participation in the
defence of Don Muang airfield and Bangkok
against Allied aircraft, it was maintained by
the Siamese Air Force that “we just did it in
a formal fashion. The United Nations aircraft
would fly one way and our aircraft the other
way, or at different heights. If by rare chance
we had to meet we carried on just for appear-
ances sake.”

392. Such are some of the statements by the
Siamese Air Force. But it is on fact, rather
than on professions of loyalty, that any final
assessment must be made. In this respect,
there is one incontrovertible fact concerning
Allied prisoners-of-war, which does reveal the
silent co-operation rendered by the Siamese
Air Force from the time of their first prisoner-
of-war—William MacClurry, an American
pilot from the American Volunteer Group
(Tiger Squadron), who bailed out at Cheing
Mai at the onset of the war in the Far East,
and whose custody by the Japanese was
vigorously contested by the Siamese Air Force,
until they finally confined him themselves to
ensure his better treatment and safety.

393. It must also be marked to the credit
of the Siamese Air Force that they did, to our
knowledge, assist in furthering liaison and
communication work within Siam, which
included the conveyance of passengers in and
out of the country; rendering assistance to,
and providing safeguard for Allied personnel
sent into Siam to gather information, and also
indicating for our benefit, precise targets in
the hands of the Japanese. Such acts of co-
operation were fraught with grave risk, and it
is not surprising that the Japanese ultimately
adopted an attitude of suspicion.

The occupation of Saigon.

.394. The outward welcome accorded to the
Allied Forces from both the French and
Annamese alike on our entry into French Indo-
China was decidely embarrassing. Our Forces
obviously found themselves in a divided house.

395. The main R.A.F. party flew into Saigon
from Burma on September 12th, and was given
a demonstrative reception by the French. At
the same time, there were banners throughout
Saigon’s streets erected by the Annamese
which welcomed the Allies but bore caustic
anti-French slogans. ;

396. R.A.F. reconnaissance parties who in-
spected Japanese Air Force installations at
Than Son Nhut and Saigon, found them most
disappointing. Comparatively few aircraft
were discovered, and none, indeed, were
serviceable. It appeared that all serviceable
aircraft had either been withdrawn for the
defence of Japan or flown to Phu My aero-
drome, twenty miles east of Saigon, after the
cessation of hostilities. The majority of
Japanese Air Force personnel previously at
Saigon had also been withdrawn.

397. The Saigon-Than Son Nhut area was
the maintenance and repair unit base for the
Japanese in French Indo-China, but, since only
