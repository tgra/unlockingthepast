SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

425. The work of the Electrical and
Mechanical Engineers has already been men-
tioned in the early parts of the Despatch. I
would like to draw attention to a few miscel-
laneous points which carry valuable lessons for
the future. Just before the crossing of the
Irrawaddy, most formations concentrated their
workshops forward. The necessity for work-
shop personnel being trained to defend them-
selves became immediately apparent. Japanese
“jitter-parties ” crossed the river every night,
while other parties of enemy stragglers, often
quite large, attacked our E.M.B. recovery
parties ; enemy patrols laid mines actually in
our workshop areas.

426. When it was decided to fly 2 British
Division out of Burma, arrangements were
made to collect their vehicles. Unfortunately
the lessons which should have been learnt from
similar circumstances in the Kabaw Valley were
forgotten, and again it was not appreciated
that elaborate precautions are necessary to
guard vehicle parks. The result was that
several hundred vehicles were rendered tem-
porarily useless within 24 hours of being col-
lected because valuable parts were stolen ; con-
siderable repair resources had to be diverted
to make them serviceable again.

427. Another lesson learnt during this period
was that when a force is dependent on air
supply, careful consideration must be given to
the provision of heavy spares such as tank

This large force was mainly concentrated on
the Northern L. of C. from Manipur Road to
Imphal and southwards, and from Assam
southwards down the Ledo Road with the
United States forces. There were, however, also
considerable numbers in the Chittagong area,
one with the forward elements of Fourteenth

ry.

430. By the end of April, 1945, the labour
employed in Burma had reached the half-
million mark, of which about half was unregi-
mented civil labour. Some 53,000 of the regi-
mented part of this labour force were employed
on building and maintaining the Ledo Road
to China. The Americans provided technical
troops and recruited civilians, but organized
military labour was commanded by Indian
Pioneer Corps Group Commanders. There was
a British Pioneer and Labour Staff on the incre-
ment with American H.Q., and the arrange-
ment whereby the British provided the main
labour force for the effort worked smoothly.
The advance of Fourteenth Army entailed close
support by Pioneer units, and there was a
steady flow of Pioneer companies from the L.
of C. into the Army area, especially during
March, 1945. Civil Labour Control teams,
composed of 150 officers who had received

parts. A reserve of essential parts must be
created as far forward as possible by the time
the advance begins. There were occasions when
heavy tank parts could not be brought in when
required, because at the time the air lift needed
was too great in proportion to their value.

428. Fourteenth Army took over 30,000
vehicles into Burma. Although the advance
was over roads previously considered impas-
sable for mechanical formations, only one sixth
of these vehicles failed to reach their final
destination. But the wear and tear was heavy ;
on an average, each vehicle passed through
E.M.E. second or third line workshops once
every three months. An additional load was
placed on the EME. by the long road
L. of C. Replacement vehicles had to travel
600 miles from Manipur Road railhead to the
Irrawaddy, and at least half the distance was
over extremely bad roads. Nearly a third of
these replacement vehicles required extensive
repairs, and all of them required careful over-
haul, before they could be issued to units.

429. It is not surprising, from what has been
said so far of the enormous administrative
effort which the Burma campaign entailed, that
the labour force required was very consider-
able. As far as military labour was concerned,
the Pioneer and Labour formations in the
Allied Land Forces, South-East Asia area in
November 1944 consisted of the following
units : —

special training, were flown into Burma in
March, and they were most successful in obtain-
ing local civilians to work for the Army. At
Mandalay and Shwebo in particular, the arrival
of these teams to organize civil labour avoided.
the necessity of transporting large labour forces
over the already strained L. of C. The labour
aspect of the development of Rangoon was
well handled. Pioneer companies and Civil
Labour Control teams were included in the
earliest convoys, and the result was that at no
stage was the port development hindered by
shortage of labour.

431. The work done by the Pioneers and
other labour units was both strenuous and
varied. Their many duties included the build-
ing of roads, railways and airfields, and the
handling of all military stores at docks, stations,
depots and airfields. Pioneer companies took
part in all the amphibious “right hook” opera-
tions on the Arakan coast, and they went well
forward portering with Fourteenth Army and
36 British Division. They formed, moreover, a
vital part of the great air supply organization,
providing the working parties at both the Rear
and Forward Airfield Maintenance Organiza-
tions ; in the case of 36 British Division, they
