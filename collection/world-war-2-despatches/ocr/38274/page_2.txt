of the war against Germany by the commence-
ment of the period of this Despatch had a tonic
effect on India. No less heartening had been
the Allied recovery in the South West Pacific,
where the Japanese were being driven back,
had lost heavily in aircraft and shipping and
were clearly finding it difficult to maintain and
protect the widely dispersed commitments they
had undertaken,

These events had not failed to have their
effect on our fighting forces; they were reflected
am their high morale and general desire to get
at the enemy. Many difficulties, however, had
hindered the development of our resources and
communications in India and particularly in
the north-east. Delays in the provision of
stores ad materials, shortage of labour, limited
transportation capacity, natural obstacles to
constructional work due to, the. forests and
climate in Assam and Burma, and disease—all
had handicapped progress. During the winter
and spring of 1942-43 a succession of major
projects had in fact accumulated and competed
for the limited engineer and transport resources
available, and though progress was made, com-
pletion forecasts were seldom realised: At the
onset of the monsoon in June, 1943, much
still remained to be done of what had been
planned in the previous year. Such then was
the situation in June, 1943.

- Part I of this Despatch deals with plans
that have been: prepared and examined during
the penod.

Part II describes such operations as have
taken place on land, sea and in the air. For
various reasons which were unavoidable, those
on land and sea were insignificant. In the air,
however, there were operations on an important
scale throughout the period.

Part III contains an account of progress in
organisation, training and administration, both
in regard to land forces and those preparing for
amphibious operations, also in regard to the
air forces and’ the building up of their wide-
spread ground organisations. So much effort
was expended in these directions during the
period, and the range of ‘activities was so wide,
that I have in this part of the Despatch gone
into considerable detail. The importance of
building a firm foundation on which to base
future operations was so great as to justify the
inclusion of a full record of the work done.
The new, South East Asia Command was to
depend almost entirely on India as its base
for the prosecution of future operations against
the Japanese.

Part I--PLANS FOR FUTURE OPERATIONS.

1. The Basis of Planning during the Period
June—November 1943.

Coincident with my appointment as Com-
mander-in-Chief in India, the intention to set
up a new South East Asia Command was
announced. This Command was to relieve the
India Command of responsibility for the con-
duct of operations against the Japanese in this
theatre. Later, in August, Admiral the Lord
Louis Mountbatten was appointed Supreme
Allied Commander, .

Although this would relieve me in due course
of the planning and execution of future opera-
tions against the Japanese, there was much to

be done during the mtervening months, if con-
tinuity of effort was to be preserved until the
new Command started to function and there-
after. During this time, therefore, at my Head-
quarters much work was done in the framing
and examination of plans. ‘These plans con-
formed with the decisions of the Washington
and Quebec Conferences, and while at work
yon them I was in close touch with the Alhed
“Chiefs of Staff.

Meanwhile, intensive training and prepara-
tion for the future continued in India. On the
eastern frontier and along the lines of com-
munication leading to it development proceeded
so far as monsoon conditions would allow.
The progress of these preparations and of work
on the Imes of communication is recorded in
Part III of this Despatch. Before describing
ihe progress of planming it 1s necessary, how-
ever, to explain the overriding effect of the
meagre resources of India and of the severely
limited capacity of the lines of communication
on any military operations undertaken on the
eastern frontier.

Although these conditions may apply to any
theatre of war they exerted a particularly
serious influence in this theatre for the follow-
ing reasons :—

Firstly, the original conception of the load |
to be placed on the lines of communications,
though based on sound reasoning at the time,
had proved to be too small. 9F

Secondly, in addition to securing the purely
mulitary needs of the land and air forces en-
gaged with the enemy, including the large
demands of the air transport route to China,
the lines of communication had to cope with
heavy civilian requirements, such as those of
the tea and jute industries, indispensable to
the war effort of the Allied Nations.

Thirdly, the normal economic life of Assam
and Eastern Bengal had also to be sustained
and this entailed the transportation of large
quantities of commodities over the railways,
rivers and roads which constituted the lines of
communication serving the China-Burma-India
theatre of war.

This was the maintenance situation, and on
the 7th August I issued an instruction to my
Long Term Administrative Planning Com-
mittee to examine the problem. Any feasible
short term measures for expansion were als)
to be examined, and an account of these as
well as the results of the examination by the
Long Term Planning Committee will be found
in Part III. On the 17th August, my Quarter
Master General’s Staff (Transportation Direc-
torate) produced two documents on the pro-
vision of Transportation Stores in India for
1944-45. The first of these documents described
the foundations on which our administrative
preparations for the operations of the South
East Asia Command were built, whilst the
Sécond afforded some idea of the magnitude
of the transportation problem involved.

In reading, therefore, the account of opera-
tional planning which follows and the record of
~-administrative progress and development set
cut in Part III of this Despatch, the above
facts require to be remembered as their in-
fluence affects all plans for operations based
on India against the Japanese whether on the
Jand, the sea or in the air. '
