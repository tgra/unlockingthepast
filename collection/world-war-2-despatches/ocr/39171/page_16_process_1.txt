208. The rate of building all-weather roads in mountainous or thick jungle country has never amounted to more than one third of a mile a day. This is not fast enough to support a major land operation. The methods by which movement can be accelerated, particularly across physical barriers, are:  

(a) By the carriage of formations with weapons and M.T. in aircraft and gliders.

(6) By cutting jeep tracks in advance of the all-weather main road axis.

(c) By the deployment of the maximum possible engineer force and equipment, with the aid of aircraft, along the proposed alignment.

Both (a) and (5) restrict the size of modern transport. The only way in which larger vehicles can be transported by air is by so designing them that they can be broken down for air transport and re-assembled quickly on landing.

As regards (c), the deployment of an engineer force along a road alignment can only be done if no interference by the enemy is likely.

209. This presupposes the extensive use of airborne troops in an initial operation, to secure focal areas on the line of advance from

. which engineers and their machines can work in several directions simultaneously and thus rapidly provide a road artery. Without such an artery, operations for permanent occupation will be seriously hampered.

ing that aircraft and landing fields for gliders are available for such operations, there remains the necessity for designing types of mechanical equipment which can be broken down for transportation by air and re-assembled quickly after landing. The mechanical equipment at present transportable by air is either too small or, in the larger types, takes too long to assemble.

210. The crossing of mountain and jungle barriers can be accelerated by the use of airborne engineers, and airborne engineer machinery and bridging equipment.

The emplacing of engineer detachments along a proposed alignment is a tactical operation.

The provision of engineer equipment for air travel designed for rapid breakdown and reassembly, is essential.

Research has reached an advanced stage. Steps are also being taken to's en the allotment of engineer units under Corps control,

to facilitate reinforcement of forward divisions or, alternatively, to reduce the divisional task.

The Civil Affairs Service, Burma.

211. The Civil Affairs Service (Burma) (C.A.S.B.) came into being in February 1943, with the appointment of a Chief Civil Affairs Officer (C.C.A.O.). Originally under the control of the Commander-in-Chief, India, it was transferred to the South-East Asia Command, os pane of 11 Anny Group, on the Ist January On the ist January 1944, the Supreme Allied Commander, South-East Asia Com-

mand, assumed full judicial, legislative, executive and administrative responsibility for all the territories of Burma which were then occupied, or might at any future time be occupied, by the forces under his command, and he delegated to the Chief Civil Affairs Officer full authority to conduct on his behalf the military administration of the civil population in these territories.

212. Administration. (a) In the Fort Hertz and Sumprabum Sub-Divisions of the Myitkyina District, the zone of military administration began to expand in March 1944, Sumprabum itself being re-occupied on the 19th  March. By the end of that month, the number of freed inhabitants had reached 80,000 and the administration was in charge of a Senior Civil Affairs Officer, responsible to the Devas C.C.A.O. at Headquarters, Fourteenth

my,

(6) In the Kamaing Sub-Division the whole Hukawng Valley had been liberated by the 31st March, and was similarly in charge of a Senior Civil Affairs Officer.

The number of inhabitants under administration was 9,000. -

(c) The Japanese offensive in March only left some 25,000 tribesmen of the Chin and Naga Hills and Upper Chindwin under the British Military Administration, but the situation since that date has changed and the figure has risen to 186,000.

(@ In Arakan, the line has fluctuated during the past six months. At the end of March, the administered civil population was 100,000.

213. Supplies. The replacement of the Government of Burma Directorate of Supply by a C.A.S.B. Lines of Communication organization became effective in November 1943. Only in exceptional cases is this organization allowed to purchase locally in the open market; normally, it obtains its requirements from Army depots.

214. Police. Early in 1944, the Inspector General of Police, Burma, joined the C.A.S.B. as Chief of Police, bringing with him a large part of the organization he had built up since the evacuation. The Intelligence Bureau, established for the collection of information concerning civilians on conditions in enemyoccupied territory, was absorbed into the CAS.B., but the Burma Police Depot (in India) remains for the time being under the Government of Burma,

215. Public Health. A controller of Medical Services was appointed to the C.AS.B. in February, from the Government of Burma.

The frontier fringes are served by small hospitals and dispensaries.

216. Welfare. The C.AS.B. Welfare Organization, under a Staff Officer, Civil Affairs, began work in January, when the

 recruitment of field staff began.

Plans for this organization to work in the Hukawng Valley, and in 4 Corps  area (Naga Hills, Upper Chindwin and Chin Hills), were not put into effect. The Commanding General of the Sino-American forces operating in the Hukawng Valley decided that he did not require its services, and the Japanese offensive nullified plans for 4 Corps  area. These plans have not been prepared in vain.
