which might be expected to arrive five nours
after the ships had been first located by recon-
naissance. Whether this information was ever
teceived by the Commander-in-Chief, Eastern
Fleet, I do not. know.

109. The ships were attacked by high-level
bombers and torpedo bombers, the latter being
by far the more effective. It is possible that the
high-level bombers were used with the object
of attracting any of our fighters that might
have been with the ships away from the tor-
pedo bombers. The Japanese would probably
have expected that such fighters would be flying
high, and that they would naturally attack high-
level bombers in the first instance, thus giving
sufficient time for the torpedo bombers to get in
their attack before our fighters could get down
to them. Admittedly, this is conjecture, but it
is on similar lines to the bombing attack carried
out on Singapore Island early on the 8th
December. It also indicates the value of the
dive bomber as a third alternative method of
attacking ships, thereby giving greater facilities
for surprise.

110. The psychological effect on Malaya of
the loss of these two ships was somewhat miti-

ted by the fact that shortly after they arrived
Fhad summoned a Press conference, and talked
to those present on the following lines:—

* The arrival of the two capital ships in
no way reduced the need for continuance of
every effort being made to improve the de-
fences of Malaya and Singapore; indeed, it
enhanced the importance of this effort. War-
ships must not be tied down to their base;
they must be free to operate to the full limit
of their range of action and know that they
can still return to a safe base when necessary.
These ships would be of value to the Far East
asa whole, but must not bbe regarded in any
sense as part of the local defences of Malaya
and Singapore. Further, in the same way as
these ships had arrived from distant stations,
so, if the situation changed and they became
needed elsewhere, we had to be prepared for
them to be ordered away.”

Based on this, the local papers published good
leading articles, bringing out the particular
points I made. In addition, Mr. Duff Cooper,
at my request, gave an excellent broadcast on
the evening of roth December, pointing out that
the loss of these ships must not lead to despond-
ency, but merely to a determination to fight all
the harder and so avenge their loss.

Japanese Command of the Sea.

1r1. From the point of view of the defence
of the Far East as a whole, what was more
serious was the Japanese attack on the United
States Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbour. In
appreciations of the situation we had always
telied on the deterrent effect of the existence of
this Fleet, even if the United States were not
in the war from the start. It was expected that
this deterrent would prevent the Japanese from
allotting more than a limited number of war-
ships for escort duties, which fact would limit
the number of convoys sent into the South
China Sea, and that it would also stop them
from sending an expedition round the East side
of the Philippines towards the Netherlands East
Indies, especially the Eastern islands.

An indirect result of the Pearl Harbour
attack was to prevent the surface ships of the
Asiatic Fleet from Manila co-operating with

SUPPLEMENT 10 tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 22 JANUARY, 1948

British and Dutch ships in the Java and South
China Seas in accordance with the A.D.B.
agreement. This Asiatic Fleet was, by orders
from Washington, limited to operations between
Sourabaya and Port Darwin.

As a final result, the command ot an sea
acquired by the Japanese was greater than we
had ever anticipated. We were, in fact, fighting
under conditions of which the British Empire
had very little previous experience.

Penang.
112. Penang Island was of no small import-
ance for three reasons: —
(a) Very fair port facilities.
(b) Stocks of ammunition and stores.
(c) The point of departure of two Over-
seas cables.

It was decided that the true defence of Penang
was on the mainland and that, should the forces
in Kedah be driven south, direct defence ot
Penang would be of no value. This enabled
most of the garrison of Penang to be released
to reinforce the mainland. One of the great
weaknesses of Penang lay in the fact that there
were no A.A. guns, which was entirely due to
shortage of weapons. It had been laid down
that the Naval Base, Royal Air Force aero-
dromes, Singapore Harbour and Kuala
Lumpur had to have priority above Penang,
and there were not enough to go round.

There was no analogy between Penang and
Tobruk.. Even had the garrison of Penang held
out for some weeks, it would have been entirely
isolated both by land and by sea, and could
not have carried out any‘ attacks against the
Japanese line of communications except
possibly an odd spasmodic raid. Any troops
that might have been utilised for a jzarrison
under these conditions would have been more
valuable elsewhere.

113. The first attack on Penang was at [100
hours on the 8th December, when the aero-
drome was bombed by Japanese aircraft, the
effect generally being small. At r000 ‘hours the
r1th December, Georgetown was bombed and
heavy casualties caused among the native popu-
lation; these were due not so much to any in-
adequacy of A.R.P. as to the fact that the
native population turned out into the streets
to watch the sight, presumably under the im- -
pression that another attack was about to be
made on the aerodrome. As a result nearly
the whole native population left the town and
the labour problem became acute. Next day
the military authorities had to take over many
civil duties, including burial of the dead, and
the naval authorities had to work the ferries
between the Island and the mainland..

114. In view of the situation in Kedah, it
was decided to move women and children, other
than Malays and Chinese, from Penang on the
13th December. This was intended to apply
to Indians as well as Europeans, but owing to
some misunderstanding the Sikh Police were
not given the opportunity to send their women
and children away, and in the end only the
Europeans left, the total numbers being about

520.

At 2030 hours, the 15th December, orders
were received by the Military Commander at
Penang to destroy all military stores, etc., that
could not be moved and to come away with
the remainder of the garrison and British
civilians. About half a dozen British residents
