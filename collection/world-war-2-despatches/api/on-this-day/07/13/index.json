It was, however, now very clear that without some very radica] re-arrangement, two-thirds of the V.1s would continue to get through to London. The fighters were still having only a limited, success, though that success was much better than the guns were experiencing, _ | Fighter Command were evidently thinking on the-same lines, for at a meeting called on the afternoon of 13th July, at their H.Q.,.atter a lengthy discussion the C.-in-C. Fighter Command decided that the guns should be moved to the coast, and orders to that effect were given. % ."

(tank-landing ships, with a capacity of fifty vehicles, or twenty-two tanks and twenty vehicles) were to load half at Suez and half at Alexandria. L.C.Ts. (tank-landing craft, with a capacity of ten vehicles or six tanks) were to load at Benghazi. The M.T./Stores convoys were planned to arrive as follows: the assault convoy on roth July, first follow-up convoy on 13th July, amd second follow-up convoy on 24th July. Thereafter reinforcements and maintenance convoys would be sailed every fourteen days until 22nd August, when they would be sailed every ten days."

Syracuse was occupied at 2100/10th July, the port peey entered during the forenoon of 11th July and the D+3 personnel convoy arrived there according to plan on 13th July : unloading all twelve ships and sailing them again at 1800 the same day was a notable achievement. Attempts were made to enter Augusta which was reported as having been evacuated at 0500 on 12th July but on her way to do so ESKIMO with Naval Commander Force  A  onboard was damaged in an air attack. Later in the day other ships of Force  A  again entered Augusta, and I myself went in in the evening in BROCKLESBY with Naval Commander Force  A . At this time the enemy on the outskirts of the town commenced to shell our ships intermittently with field guns and we had to clear out. I strongly support the recommendation of Naval Commander Force   A  that the foremost elements of the army should have some means of notifying their positions to supporting warships, as on this occasion we saw a large amount of M.T. which we thought belonged to the Eighth Army but which in fact belonged to the enemy. In consequence we missed an excellent and easy target."

            "description": "landing craft was found to be serviceable on D-1 than had been anticipated, and as a result it was possible to commence loading the first flight of the ferry service before ships and craft which had been engaged in the assaults had returned. The Eighth Army plan was to clear the high priority vehicles and stores from Malta before working craft in any numbers from Sousse and ipo and in the first seven days 56 L.S.T., 36 L.C.T. and 33 L.CI.(L) cleared loaded from Malta. Some initial difficulty was experienced over the control of the Ferry Service, as the Military Movements organisation set up in Malta did not appear adequate to meet the demands made upon it, but after'a shaky start things went much better, and the planned programme was finally completed earlier than anticipated. *. 24. It was decided, both to reduce signalling and to avoid delays to sailings, that the short passage between Malta and Sicily should be made by L.S.T. and major landing craft engaged in the ferry service without making any sailing signals. The organisation of a convoy was often only completed immediately before it sailed, and I am satisfied that this apparently casual method was fully justified in order to continue the build-up of the army as fast as possible. As far as I know there was only one mishap; WALLACE engaged an L.C.L(L) on the night of 12th/13th July, but happily only one rating was wounded. It would not have been possible to continue to sail these landing craft convoys in this manner, unescorted or only lightly escorted as they were, had the weather not remained calm after D day, and had there not been an increasing period of moonlight. Although the first quarter of the moon at first sight appeared unfavourable for landing operations from the naval aspect, in the event it proved greatly to our advantage against a weak enemy and with our possession of great air superiority."

The question of the rules for the engagement of aircraft off the beaches was always a vexed one during planning, and the orders were twice altered by agreement with the RAF. As finally framed, ships were free to open fire at night at aircraft whose approach indicated hostile intent, and it was stated that if friendly airoraft had to fly over our convoys they would do so above 6,000 feet. All troopcarrying aircraft were routed in Janes to avoid our convoys on the night of D-1/D, but for the second airborne attack on D+3, they flew low over the Gulf of Noto. It is understood that Mediterranean Air Command had"

            "description": "86. From a more general aspect there was one weighty argument against moving the guns to the coast. To do so would split the operational area of the fighters into two, and thus, to all appearances, infringe the principle of separate and clear-cut spheres of operation for guns and fighters which I was anxious to establish. Up till then the fighters had been by far the most successful weapon against flying-bombs; out of 1,192 bombs which had been destroyed or brought down up to sunrise on the 13th July, they had accounted for 883. No move which threatened to impair their effectiveness was to be undertaken lightly. Still, to a great extent interception over the sea and interception over the land were already separate problems. Hence in practice the disadvantage of having three spheres of operation for guns and fighters instead of two would not be so great as it looked at first sight."
