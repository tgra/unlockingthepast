SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON

H.M.S. GREYHOUND, but a curious contrast
of opinion has arisen over the actual targets
engaged. The technical records of the action
show that H.M.S. WARSPITE engaged the
rear-most ship first and subsequently shifted
target left to the second ship in the enemy line
(the leading ship is now thought to have been
a destroyer).

*My own opinion supported by the Chief of
Staff, the Captain of the Fleet and several Staff
Officers, is that H.M.S. WARSPITE engaged
the leading 8 inch cruiser (2nd in the line) and
subsequently shifted fire right to the rear ship.
It is a point which cannot be absolutely de-
cided until the full story of this action from
both sides is known, but it appears that the
Gunnery Records must be wrong.

17. On conclusion of the battlefleet action,
the signal was made ‘‘ All forces not engaged
in sinking the enemy, retire north-east’. The
order was intended to ensure withdrawal on
parallel tracks clear of the destroyer melee,
and was made under the impression that
cruisers and striking force were in contact with
the enemy. Heavy fighting had been observed
to the south westward which supported this
belief. Unfortunately the cruisers were not in
fact engaged and the Vice-Admiral, Light
Forces, accordingly withdrew to the north-east.
He had sighted a red pyrotechnic signal some
distance to the north-west 40 minutes earlier
and was at this time about to spread to in-
vestigate (see report of V.A.L.F., paragraph
35). This red light signal was sighted simul-
taneously by Captain D.14 bearing o10 degrees,
who seeing it in the direction of the 7th Cruiser
Squadron and knowing from their {G.A.B.
signal they had seen it, forebore to investigate.

There seems little doubt, from subsequent
analysis, that this must have been the re-
mainder of the Italian Fleet withdrawing to
the north-west (see diagram No. 9).

T am of the opinion that the course I selected
for withdrawal led the fleet too far to the east-
ward, and that a more northerly course should
have been steered.

18. I hoped when ordering the eight
destroyers of the striking force to attack that
the cruisers would regain touch to assist
Captain D.14 to jaunch his attack. The bearing
and distance of the enemy given to the striking
force when detached (286 degrees 35 miles from
H.M.S. WARSPITE) was fase on the plot
and was in fact approximately correct but the
enemy’s course appears to have been 45 degrees
further to the north-westward than that esti-
mated. In spite, therefore, of Captain D.1q’s
intention to pass to the northward of the enemy,
the striking force apparently passed under the
stern of the enemy to his southern flank whilst
the cruisers were steering on an approximately
parallel course on the enemy’s northern flank
(see diagram No, 7). The red pyrotechnic was
shown between these two British forces.

19. The mistake made by H.M.S. HAVOCK
(paragraph 38) in reporting the POLA as a
LITTORIO class did not actually bring about
any ill effect, since the flotillas had by then
missed the VITTORIO and did useful work in
polishing off the damaged cruisers (diagram

No. 10). The movements and the results

achieved by H.M‘A.S. STUART’s division
during the night remain most obscure. H.M.S.
HAVOCK certainly sank an enemy destroyer.

They had an exciting night and did consider-
able execution, but the presence of undamaged
enemy cruisers in the area at that time seems un-
likely and it is not improbable that the ships so
reported by H.M.A.S. STUART were in fact
some of the others of his own division.

20. It seems that the enemy must have been
able to increase speed again during the night,
since although extensive reconnaissance was
flown next morning, he remained unsighted and
must by then have been nearing the Italian
coast. The search for survivors was interrupted
by the appearance of German aircraft and it
was decided to withdraw the fleet before the
expected heavy air attacks developed, as no
more useful work appeared to remain to be
done.

The fleet was in fact subjected to a fairly
severe dive bombing attack by Ju 88s at 1530,-
when H.M.S. FORMIDABLE was narrowly’
missed by several bombs.

2i. The mistake which prevented the Greek:
sears ieee taking ae in the action was:
perhaps not ‘ortunate (see paragraph 30).
These destroyers had been sent through a
Corinth Canal to Argostoli with admirable
promptitude to a position where they were well
placed to intercept the retreating enemy fleet,
a task which they would certainly have under-
taken with characteristic gallantry. Neverthe-
less the presence of yet another detached force
in the area, and that force one with which I
could not readily communicate, would have
seriously added to the complexity of the situa-
tion. It was, however, disappointing for the
Greeks.

az. The results of the action cannot be viewed
with entire satisfaction, since the damaged
VITTORIO VENETO was allowed to escape.
The failure of the cruisers and destroyers to
make contact with her during the night was
unlucky and is much to be regretted. Never-

+ theless substantial results were achieved in the

destruction of the three ZARA Class cruisers.
These fast well armed and armoured ships had
always been a source of anxiety as a threat to
our own less well armed cruisers and I was
well content to see them disposed of in this
summary fashion. There is little doubt that
the rough handling given the enemy on this
occasion served us in good stead during the
subsequent evacuations of Greece and Crete.
Much of these later operations may be said
to have been conducted under the cover of
the Battle of Matapan.

NARRATIVE OF THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF,

MEDITERRANEAN.

Preliminary Intelligence.

From the 25th March onwards various in-
dications were noticed of increasing activity on
the part of German and Italian forces. Features
of the activity noticed were an increasingly
active sea reconnaissance by aircraft to the
south and west of Greece and Crete and daily
attempts to reconnoitre Alexandria harbour.

2. These activities together with the obvious
imminence of the German attack on Greece and
Yugo Slavia led to belief that some important
step by the enemy was impending. The un-
usual keenness with which the enemy was
