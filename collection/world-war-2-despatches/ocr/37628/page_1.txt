OPERATIONS IN THE WESTERN DESERT FROM
DECEMBER 7tu, 1940, TO FEBRUARY 7tTu, 1941.

The following despatch was submitted to the
Secretary of State for War on 21st Jume,
1941, by GENERAL SIR ARCHIBALD
P. WAVELL, G.C.B., C.M.G., M.C., Com-
mander-in-Chief in the Middle East,

Part I.—First PHasz--BATTLE OF SIDI
BARRANI—DECEMBER 7 TO 13, 1940.
1. Introductory.

r. In a former despatch I gave a summary
of events in the Middle East Command down to
the 15th November, 1940. The present
despatch will deal with events in one part of
the Middle East only, the Western frontier of
Egypt and Cyrenaica, from the 7th December,
1940, when the counter-offensive against the

. Italian army began, down to the 7th February,
the date on which Benghazi surrendered.

2. In the previous despatch the advance of
the Italians to Sidi Barrani was described. In
accordance with our pre-arranged policy, little
opposition had been offered to the enemy’s
advance, and it was not proposed to oppose
him in s' ch until he reached our prepared
defences at Mersa Matruh. It was not, how-
ever, intended that the defence should be a
passive one. On the 21st September I had
issued orders for a counter-stroke to be pre-
pared against the enemy, so soon as he became
engaged with the defences of Matruh. I found
that General Wilson, Commander of British
Troops in Egypt, and General O’Connor, Com-
manding the Western Desert Force, had already
made the preliminary arrangements for such a
counter-stroke. During the next month, as our
defences and our forces grew in strength, so the
plan for the counter-stroke was developed; and
a scheme was eventually prepared for striking
at the enemy as he approached Matruh. This
plan was studied in detail by the commanders

and troops concerned, and all possible arrange-
ments made to put it into effect, if the enemy
advanced against Matruh in the manner that
we judged most probable.

2. Preparation of Plan of Attack.

3. About the middle of October, when the
enemy had been stationary for a month and
there seemed no immediate probability of his
further advance, I began to consider the
possibility of an early offensive action in spite
of our numerical inferiority. The enemy’s
defensive arrangements seemed to me to be
thoroughly faulty. He was spread over a wide
front in a series of fortified camps which were
not mutually supporting and were separated by
wide distances. His defences seemed to lack
depth.

On the 20th October I issued a personal note
to General Wilson instructing him to consider
the possibility of an attack on the enemy
The plan I directed him to
consider was an attack at both ends of the
enemy’s line, by the yth Armoured Division
reinforced with some mobile infantry battalions
against the enemy’s right flank on the escarp-
ment near Sofafi, and by the 4th Indian
Division, reinforced, if possible, by one addi-
tional brigade, against the camps immediately
east of Sidi Barrani, near the coast. If the
initial attacks were successful, I proposed that
the Armoured Division should exploit its
success northwards towards the coast and the
4th Indian Division westwards. I stated that
the operations would be dependent on all the
troops being made mobile and being able to
move 30 to 40 miles in a night, so as to cover
in two successive nights the distance between
our front and the enemy’s and to attack on
