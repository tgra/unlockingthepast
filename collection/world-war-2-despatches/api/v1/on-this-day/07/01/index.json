            "description": "At about this time the 4th Indian Division relieved the 5th Indian Division in the island, and Major-General Tuker finally reorganised its defences. The basic principle of the defence was that the air forces on the island should be kept in full operation. It was not considered possible to prevent the enemy getting a foothold at some point on the coastline, and the main effort of the defence was therefore to be concentrated on protecting the landing grounds in the central plain. For the same reason all important depots and installations were sited inland wherever feasible. As large a proportion of the garrison as possible was to be made mobile so that it might operate against enemy landings. Instructions laying down these principles were issued on the 1st July.*"

On 1st July the 2nd Battalion The Black Watch had been sent to Aden by cruiser, at the request of General Legentilhomme, who considered that the support of British troops might assist him to resist an attack on Jibuti, and that this assurance of British support would be a powerful factor in persuading the garrison of Jibuti to continue the struggle. This battalion was therefore also available to reinforce Somaliland,"

They were most severe in the centre where the Germans opposed xo and 13 Corps; on the west coast, although the  American advance was considerably slowed down, as compared with the first two weeks after the fall of Rome, the Germans were unable to prevent a steady gain of ground. IV Corps on the left, with 36 and xr Armoured Divisions leading, captured Follonica on 24th June and Piombino on the 25th. Then stiffer resistance was met, particularly inland where 1 Armoured Division, opposed by a skilful enemy and difficult country, lost seventy-one tanks in the course of these ten days. The stiffest resistance was at Cecina, at the mouth of the river of the same name; the battle for the town lasted from 2gth June to 1st July and cost 34 Division, which had relieved the 36th, fairly heavy casualties. 16 S.S. Division had been brought in here to strengthen the German defence and fought with skill and fanaticism. The French, directed on Siena, were held up from the 22nd to the 26th June on the River Orcia and were able only to make an advance of some two miles. On the night of the 27th, however, the Germans began to withdraw and only delaying actions were fought south of Siena, which was entered on 3rd July. By the 7th, with the capture of Colle di Val d Elsa, the whole of Route 68, from its junction with Route 2 to the sea, had been secured."
