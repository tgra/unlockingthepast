4486 SUPPLEMENT To tuE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 AUGUST, 1948

Three others tried to work round the star-
board bow, and the convoy was turned away
60° to port. These aircraft were turned away
by the gunfire of the screening destroyers,
having dropped their torpedoes well outside the
screen. One torpedo narrowly missed

‘LIGHTNING, but they dropped at too great

a range to be a danger to the convoy. One
of these aircraft was shot down by fighters
as it retired.

55- Of the 7 or 8 aircraft who turned away
when first fired at, 3 returned from astern
of the convoy at 1354, two of which retired
again on being fired at. The third pressed
on to attack ARK ROYAL, but was shot down
by the combined fire of that ship and
NELSON, while still z,000 yards from ARK
ROYAL and before he had dropped a torpedo.

56. At 1358 onevaircraft, seen right ahead
of NELSON, dropped a torpedo outside the
screen. COSSACK was able to avoid this
torpedo by the warning given by hydrophone
effect on her A/S set.

57. At this time (1359) one C.R.42 was seen
to be diving on the starboard wing destroyers,
and performing aerobatics over them, evidently
to make a diversion for the T/Bs. In so far
as the destroyers expended a large amount of
ammunition he succeeded, but after six minutes
was either shot down or failed to pull out from
a dive. None of the destroyers reported being
machine-gunned.

58. Result of Third Attack.—Two more
enemy T/Bs and one C.R.42 fighter were shot
down, and no further damage inflicted on H.M.
Ships or convoy. : .

It was most noticeable that this attack was
hot pressed home with the same determination
as the first two attacks, Of the ro or IZ
$.79s which originally approached, only four
fired torpedoes, and these were dropped at too
great a distance to endanger the convoy. The
only aircraft of this group to close within effec-
tive range was destroyed before its torpedo was
dropped.

59- No further actual attacks developed
before dark, though on several occasions R.D.F.
indicated that enemy aircraft were closing the
fleet. Generally by the time they were within
15 miles of the fleet, R.D.F. reported our
fighters among them and they were driven off.

An attack threatened from the port bow at
1409 and the convoy made an emergency tun
towards to 060° but as no attack developed
course 096° was resumed a few minutes later.

General Remarks on Day Attacks.

60. So far as can be ascertained 30 T/B
aircraft attempted to attack, but not more than
18 came within torpedo range.

Aircraft Destroyed:

6 T/Bs and x fighter certainly destroyed by
gunfire.

4 T/Bs and 1 shadower certainly destroyed
by fighters,

1 T/B probably destroyed (cause unknown).

Total: Certain ro T/Bs, x fighter, x Cant
506 float plang. 0

We lost 3 Fulmars, two crews being sovell,

One torpedo hit was inflicted on NELSON.

6x. H.L.B.* attacks had been expected,
synchronised with T/B attacks, but none
developed at the time and no bombs were
dropped.

Attempt to Intercept Enemy Battlefleet, p.m.
| 27th September (D.3).

62. Reports of air reconnaissance from |
Malta carried out on D.2 (26th September), in-
dicated that main units of the Italian fleet were °
located as follows: —

¢
Taranto—zr Cavour in floating dock, j
2 Littorios and 1 Cavour, f
6 Cruisers,
5 Destroyers. i

Naples—2 Cavours,
r Cruiser,
12 Destroyers or Torpedo-Boats.
Messina—Bolzano.

Palermo—Nil.

63. While the third T/B attack was still in
progress at 1404, an emergency report was re-
received from aircraft B (R.A.F. Malta) of
2 battleships and 8 destroyers in Position
38° 20’ N., 10° 40’ E., steering 190° at 20 |
knots at 1340. ri

64. NELSON’s position when this report was
received was 37° 46’ N., 09° 04’ E.; the enemy
unit was therefore 74 miles, 076° from NEL-
SON assuming it had continued at the same
course and speed. At this time NELSON, }
with gun armament unimpaired, was thought /
to be capable of 18 knots or possibly more.

65. My appreciation of the enemy’s inten-
tions was that either he did not realise I had
more than one battleship with the convoy and
that he would attempt to intercept the convoy
near the western entrance to. the Skerki Chan-
nel, or that he wished to draw away my escort-
ing force to the north-eastwards, thus leaving
the convoy open to attack by light surface
forces in the Skerki Channel at dusk.

66. I therefore: decided : —

(i) To proceed towards the enemy at best
speed with NELSON, PRINCE OF WALES,
RODNEY and 6_ destroyers, _leavii
KENYA, EDINBURGH, SHEFFIELD an
to destroyers with the convoy; ARK ROYAL
escorted by EURYALUS, HERMIONE,
\PIORUN and LEGION to continue operating
in the vicinity of the convoy. .

(ii) To fly off two Swordfish from ARK
ROYAL to take over shadowing duties and
keep the enemy under observation until the
striking force could attack.

(iii) To fuel, arm, range and fly off an air
striking force as soon as possible.

67. These dispositions would place the battle-
ships between the enemy and the convoy and
enable the enemy to be brought to action should
he persist in attemptirig to intercept the convoy.

68. At 1408 I ordered ARK ROYAL to pre-
pare am air striking force. This involved a
delay of at least an hour before the striking
force could be flown off since as stated pre-
viously the Swordfish had been drained of fuel
to reduce fire risks during air attacks. Two
