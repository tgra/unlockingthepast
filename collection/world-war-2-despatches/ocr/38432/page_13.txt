SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 18 OCTOBER, 1948

home. The results obtained give clear proof
of the very high fighting efficiency of these two
boats.

43. The gallant action fought single-handed
by M.G.B. 603 against six E-boats not only
showed determination to Jose no chance of
engaging the enemy but may well have saved
M.G.B. 607 from destruction.

44. Unit J (M.T.B.s 442 and 439) (Senior
Officer, Lieutenant C. A. Burk, R.C.N.V.R.).
—Here again good use was made of radar

’ during the action. Considerable damage was
undoubtedly done to the enemy and but for
action damage a kill might well have resulted.

General.

45. This action gives general proof of a great
improvement in the efficiency of the Coastal
Forces particularly as regards communications
and the use of radar. The small number of
material breakdowns: also indicates a higher
standard of interest and handling by the Com-
manding Officers and crews of boats and
reflects great credit on the maintenance officers
and staffs of the bases. Furthermore, it clearly
demonstrates the value and essential need of
constant training and practice.

46. The dispositions and movements of forces
were controlled by Commander H. A. Taylor,
R.N., and the success of the operations was in
large part due to his skill and extremely clever
and prompt anticipation of enemy movements.

47. In addition to the successful defence of
the convoy, it is considered permissible to feel
a modicum of satisfaction in the number of
times the E-boats were engaged. They were
roughly handled six times in or near the convoy
route (H.M. Ships WORCESTER and
MACKAY" twice, H.M.S. PYTCHLEY and
Unit R once each), once by Unit V when
retiring from H.M.S. WORCESTER’s second
action, and by Units ¥ and J on their home-
ward passage when they probably felt they
were clear of our forces. Had the RAF.
been able to attack them after daylight it would
have been a strong deterrent to E-boats leaving
their return to their bases till so late.

ENcLosuRE I To C.-IN-C., MEDITERRANEAN
STATION’S LETTER.

From The Captain Coastal Forces,
. Mediterranean.

DATE 18th November, 1944.

To The Commander - in - Chief,

Mediterranean Station.

The remarks of the Commander Coastal
Forces, Western Mediterranean, are fully con-
curred in.

2. The Senior Officer, 57th M.T.B. Flotilla
has written such an excellent report and so
ably summed up this prolonged action in his
paragraphs 39 and 40, that little remains to
be said. To the factors which page victory
possible (vide paragraph 39 of the Action
Report) must unquestionably be added brilliant
and inspiring leadership, as the Commander
Coastal Forces, Western Mediterranean has in-
deed already remarked. I have on several
previous occasions remarked on Lieutenant-
Commander T. J. Bligh’s splendid leadership
of his flotilla in action. On this occasion he
set a seal on his previous performances.

3. In my letter dated 3rd October, 1944, I
remarked on the brilliant success of three boats
of the 56th M.T.B. Flotilla in a prolonged night
action. It is a matter of great personal satis-
faction to me, knowing all the officers of both
flotillas and having watched the happy mixture
of close co-operation and friendly rivalry exist-
ing between them, that the 57th Flotilla has
now crowned its career with an equally, and
possibly even more brilliant success.

(Signed) J. F. Stevens,
Captain, R.N.

Submitted: ’ .

Forwarded:

2. This highly successful action was

characterised in its initial stages by skilful
anticipation of enemy movements; and later,
by the manner in which prevailing conditions
and available resources were turned to such
good account in securing maximum oppor-
tunity for attack, but for which our boats
would have undoubtedly incurred greater
damage and casualties. Throughout, the
engagement was carried out with skill and
determination under brilliant leadership, in the
face of heavy enemy fire.
