north-western Persia the country is mountain-
ous, and therefore unfavourable to the employ-
ment of armoured forces. Briefly, my intention
was to stop the enemy as far forward as we
could by moving light forces’ rapidly to the
River Araxes and covering for as long as pos-
sible the landing grounds in northern Persia.
The Tenth Army was in any event to prevent
the enemy establishing himself south of the
general line Pahlevi—Kasvin—Hamadan—
Senna—Rowanduz Gorge.

The Persian railway was to be extended from
its existing terminus at Khorramshahr to the
Shatt-elArab opposite Basra, so that the Tenth
Army operating in Persia might draw on the
main Iraq bases at Basta and Shaiba. Various
other improvements in communications were
also ordered.

During May we pointed out to the Chiefs of
Staff that we could not plan and prepare to
fight the enemy in Northern Persia, as we must
do if we were to keep his air forces at a suffi-
cient distance from our bases and oil installa-
tions at the head of the Gulf, unless we had full
facilities to explore and prepare the ground.
These facilities the Russians, who controlled this
zone, would not give us. Moreover, we had no
information of their plans for the defence of
the Caucasus. We asked that arrangements be
made without delay for us to co-operate with
the Russians; but this seemed impossible,
owing, apparently, to the Russian High Com-
mand’s insistence on centralisation and great
secrecy. We therefore acted ourselves, and on
my instructions General Quinan sent recon-
naissance parties into Northern Persia to pro-
cure at least some of the essential information.
These parties established good relations with the
Russians and did their work with little friction.

The preparation of defences and communi-
cations in Iraq and Syria went on steadily
throughout May, and I was concerned to use
as much local and hired labour as I could
procure, in addition to all available organised
labour units, in order to give the few fighting
troops the fullest opportunity for training.

At the end of May the Germans launched
their expected offensive in Russia and from that
moment the danger, against which we were still
so ill-prepared, steadily grew more imminent.
Simultaneously Rommel launched an attack in
Cyrenaica.

Rommel’s Counter-offensive.

The continual reinforcement of the German
and. Italian army in Libya, which in the
absence of heavy bombers and strong naval
forces in the Mediterranean we had been unable
to prevent, and which had caused our own
offensive to be deferred, had progressed so far
by the middle of May that it was evident the
enemy thought himself strong enough to take

the offensive. I was reasonably confident that -

the Eighth Army was prepared to withstand
assault. Although General Ritchie, in close
consultation with myself, had been maturing
his plans for an early resumption of the offen-
sive, precautions for meeting an enemy attack
had not been neglected; and during March,
April and early May the defensive system
within the quadrilateral formed by Gazala,

Tobruk, Bir el Gubi and’Bir Hacheim had been °

-steadily developed and strengthened. As the
days went by it became more and more certain
that our offensive would be _forestalled.
Accordingly General ‘Ritchie and his two Corps

Commanders put the finishing touches to their
arrangements: for meeting the attack and for
passing at once to the offensive, when it had
been repulsed. E

» In planning to launch our own offensive in
mid-June, the fact that we should have only
a small margin of superiority over the enemy
‘by land and in the air had occasioned me some
anxiety. I was disposed therefore to regard
the prospect of fighting the first action on our
own prepared ground as likely to counter-
balance this disadvantage. To enable General
Ritchie to form a reserve of infantry, I arranged
to send reinforcements to the Eighth Army,
including the roth Indian Division which I
brought across from Iraq. I regretted that I
had no more armoured formations which were
ready for battle, to send him. Numerically the
Eighth Army was superior in tank strength to
the enemy; but in quality our tanks were on the
whole still inferior to his, notwithstanding the
inclusion in our armoured brigades of a number
of new American medium tanks. On the
other hand, the Eighth Army was now getting a
quantity of the new six-pounder anti-tank guns
which would neutralise to some extent the
marked advantage in this type of weapon the
Germans had hitherto enjoyed. It was unfor-
tunate that the troops had not more time to
become accustomed to their use.

The enemy appeared to have two courses
open to him: one to pass armoured forces
round the south of Bir Hacheim and then to
strike northwards, and the other to concen-
trate all his armour and most of his artillery
in an attempt to break through our centre.
In either event his objective would be Tobruk;
and in either event our reaction would be the
same, namely, to use our armour to counter-
attack the enemy and destroy him east of our
minefield belt.* For this purpose our armoured
forces, comprising the 1st and 7th Armoured
Divisions, three armoured brigades altogether,
under General Norrie, the Commander of the
30th Corps, were to be held centrally, ready to
act in either direction.

As it turned out, the enemy chose to make
his main thrust by the southern route and,
having concentrated his armoured formations
round Segnali, moved them during the night
of the 26th May to the east of Bir Hacheim.
Early on the 27th he struck rapidly northwards
towards Acroma and E] Adem. Meanwhile he
made an abortive attack on Bir Hacheim and
a half-hearted demonstration against our posi-
tions between Gazala and Alem Hamza.
Though somewhat scattered, the 30th Corps
met the enemy’s northward thrust, and heavy
but indecisive fighting continued all day and
resulted in the enemy being held south of a
line through Knightsbridge and El Adem.

We learned later from captured documents
that the enemy planned to take Tobruk by the
30th May, after destroying our armoured forces
and attacking our troops holding the Gazala
defences from the rear as well as from the front.
The success of this plan depended upon reduc-
ing Bir Hacheim or breaching our minefield
further north and then: inflicting upon our
armour a decisive blow. In all of these objects
the enemy was thwarted. On the 28th May
the enemy moved against Acroma but with-
drew, and on the 29th his main armoured force
