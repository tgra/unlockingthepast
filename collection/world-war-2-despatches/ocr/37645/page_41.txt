SUPPLEMENT To tHe LONDON

miles. The Order of Battle of 11th (A) Divi-
sion on 11th March is given in Appendix “ E,”’

72. Information was now in the hands of the
Air Force that the enemy were using almost
exclusively Dire Daua aerodrome and its two
satellites close by. Another fighter ground
attack was organised and took place between
z3th-15th March, This operation resulted in
the loss to the enemy of 20 aircraft, 6 destroyed
in the air, 9 on the ground and 5 damaged.
Qur losses were two Hurricanes. The value at
this particular period of these heavy losses to
the enemy was very great. Our further ad-
vance was over mountain roads through many
narrow defiles and passes, where our columns
would have been extremely vulnerable to air
attack. Although they were bombed sporadi-
cally the attacks were not pushed home and
lite damage resulted. Our columns were still
able to advance by day.

73. On 19th March supply arrangements per-
mitted 11th (A) Division to continue the ad-
vance from Dagabur with the whole of the
Nigerian Brigade.

The remaining two brigades which had been
placed under the orders of 11th (A) Division,
namely, ist S.A. Brigade and 22nd E.A.
Brigade, were not able to operate forward of
Dagabur till 2rst and 26th. March respectively
owing to administrative restrictions.

Giggiga was attacked on 17th March and

occupied by advanced forces of the 23rd
Nigerian Brigade with only slight opposition,
the enemy retiring to a position covering the
Marda Pass.

74. Meanwhile, A.O.C. Aden, taking advan-
tage of the threat to Giggiga, through which ran
the only easily passable road from British
Somaliland into Abyssinia, successfully attacked
Berbera on the 16th March from the sea, with
two Indian Battalions and attached troops.

The plan for the capture and opening of the
port, the provision of the port personnel and
the landing of the stores necessary for the
further advance of my troops, were all in his

ds. ‘

I would like to place on record my apprecia-
tion of the great ability shown by Air Vice-
Marshal G. R. M. Reid, D.S.0., M.C., in
carrying out the operation, and the fine spirit of
co-operation and helpfulness displayed by both
Air Vice-Marshal Reid and his staff in the estab-
lishment of the port. Colonel A. H. Pollock,
M.C., who commanded the troops which carried
out the landing, and who subsequently became
Area Commander Berbera, was responsible,
with the assistance of the Royal Navy from
Aden, for the handling of the supplies from
Aden destined for my troops. I wish also to
commend the efficiency shown by the Royal
Navy and Colonel Pollock in this work.
Although short-handed and with poor facilities,
great energy and determination resulted in land-
ing sufficient stores to enable my advance be-
yond Harrar to proceed without a pause, a state
of affairs which at one time I did not think
would be possible.

975. As our advance was proceeding north-
wards from Mogadiscio the enemy in British
Somaliland had issued orders for the with-
drawal of their forces. The rapid advance on
‘to Giggiga, however, cut their normal route for
retirement and the 7oth Colonial Brigade under
General Bertello attempted to escape by
Borama and Dire Daua. The ‘ subse-

quent adventures of this column are obscure.
Jt became known that General Bertello had
passed through Dire Daua mounted on a mule
shortly before we captured that place. Further-
more, large parties of prisoners in British Soma-
Hiland and just south of the border were cap-
tured at various subsequent dates. It is
assumed therefore that 7oth Brigade melted

away.

On the zoth March a small column of
Nigerians occupied Tug Wajale on the British
Somaliland border, and two armoured cars, led
by the Chief Engineer E.A. Force, motored
through Hargeisa to Berbera and established
contact with Aden Force.

76. The occupation of Giggiga marked the
end of the fighting in the flat bush country, and
the commencement of a period of hill fighting in
the Abyssinian highlands, Up to the present
our tactics had almost invariably been the same,
the reconnaissance to find the flanks of the
enemy position by armoured cars, its rapid en-
velopment by armoured cars and embussed
infantry if the going permitted, or infantry on
foot if it did not. It was seldom during the
period up to Giggiga that some form of mechan-
ised column could not be placed behind the
enemy position. It was our experience that as
soon as the Italian Colonial Infantry realised
there was something behind them their resist-
ance gave way.

With the entry into the hills it was clear that
A.F.Vs. could no longer be depended upon to
the same extent as heretofore, and that the
Infantry would have to revert to true infantry
fighting on their feet. In anticipation of such
a situation arising I had formed a small trans-
port company of 600 mules in Kenya, and had
arranged to portee one 3.7 in. How. Battery,
mules and guns complete. Owing, however, to
the extreme difficulty of getting them over the
long distance from Kenya, I was not able to
get them up in time for the operations covered
by this report.

77. The Marda Pass appeared to be held
strongly by the enemy, and viewed tower-
ing above the extensive fiat plains of
Giggiga, looked indeed a formidable proposi-
tion. Nothing could move on the Giggiga
plain without being seen, and the aerodrome
was in full view of the hills 9,000 yards away.
The enemy appeared to be holding a broad
front and therefore Commander 11th (A) Divi-
sion decided he would await the arrival of 1st
S.A. Brigade and attack the pass with two
brigades on 23rd March. Patrol activity by the
Nigerian Brigade during this period resulted in
a claim by the enemy that heavy attacks had
been carried out, all of which had been re-
pulsed with great loss. On 20th March I
received definite indications that the enemy
was planning a further withdrawal and it was
decided to attack with the Nigerian Brigade
only, next day. After stiff fighting ist
Nigeria Regiment were able to take a height
overlooking the pass on its northern side by
2000 hours on the evening of the arst. The
enemy evacuated the pass that night. It
transpired that the position was in fact 4 miles
in breadth. It was heavily wired, had gun
positions iunnelled into the hills, extensive
tank traps and mine fields. It had however
no depth, and there is little doubt that, the
occupation of the height captured by our troops
had made it untenable.
