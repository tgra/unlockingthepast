SUPPLEMENT to THz LONDON GAZETTE, 17.O0CTOBER, 94t “5915

The éneriy had, during the previous day,
penetrated as far as Amiens, and rail communica-
tion with the bases was severed at that point.
‘Conimunications by road and rail over the
Sonime at Abbeville were still holding on 19th
May and the town was being placed in a state
of defence with such resources as were available,
mainly. units of r2th Division. However, there
was little doubt that enemy armoured forces
in-that area, which at the time I estimated at
five armoured divisions, would shortly break
through to the coast.

The force could then no longer be supplied
through the ports south of the Somme, and the
great bulk of the reserves, which were in the

. rearward areas, would shortly cease to be
available to the force for the purposes of main-
tenance or replacement. Several days’ reserve
had, however, for some time past been maintained
north of the Somme,

The prospect of securing the reinforcement of
the Armoured Division had likewise become
remote.’ I had been advised that two Armoured
Brigades. of this division would disembark at
Havre on 16th May, and were to concentrate at
Bolbec, and I had therefore sent instructions by
the hand of a staff officer to the Commander
(Major-General R. Evans). He was to move the
leading brigade on disembarkation with all
speed to secure the crossings of the Somme west
of Amiens, from Picquigny to Pont Rémy, both
inclusive, with a view to the concentration of the
remaining -brigade behind the Somme and the
move of his division to join the main body of
the B.E.F. However, in the meantime, orders
had been issued locally to concentrate the
Division south of the Seine, and the plan to
cross the Somme and join the B.E.F. proved
impossible to execute. The division therefore
remained in the Lines of Communication Area
and never came under my effective command.

About midnight on the 18th/roth May,
General Billotte came to see me, and gave me
an account of the situation as he saw it. He
also told me of the measures which were being
taken to restore the situation on the front of
the French gth Army, though clearly he had
little hope that they would be effective. Reports
from the liaison officers with French formations
.were likewise not encouraging; in particular
I was unable to verify that the French had
‘enough reserves at their disposal south of the
gap to enable them to stage counter-attacks
sufficiently strong to warrant the expectation
that the gap would be closed.

Thus, in my opinion, there was an imminent
danger of the forces in the north-eastern area,
that is to say the French forces next to the sea,
the Belgian Army, the B.E.F. and the bulk of
the French rst Army on our right, being
irretrievably cut off from the main French
forces in the south.

There were three alternative courses of action
open to the northern forces under General
Billotte : first, in the event of the gap being
closed by successful counter-attacks made
simultaneously from north and south it would
in theory be possible to maintain the line of the
Escaut, or at any rate the frontier defences,
and thence southwards on one or other of the
canal lines.

Secondly, there was the possibility of a with-
drawal to the-line of the Somme as far as its
mouth. This plan had the attraction that we
should be falling back on our lines of communi-
cation and if it was successful would not entail

the abandonment of large quantities of equip-
ment. It would obviously be unwelcome to
the Belgians who would be faced with the
alternatives of withdrawing with us and aban-
doning Belgian soil, fighting on a perimeter of
their own, or seeking an armistice.

So far as I am aware, the French High
Command had never suggested such a move-
ment up to that date and it is doubtful whether

- even had they.decided on immediate withdrawal

as soon as the French gth Army front on the
Meuse had been penetrated, there would ever
have been sufficient time for the troops in the
north to conform.

Thirdly there was the possibility of with-
drawal north-westwards or northwards towards
the Channel ports, making use of the successive
river and canal lines, and of holding a defensive
perimeter there, at any rate sufficiently long to
enable the force to be withdrawn, preferably in
concert with the French and Belgians. I
realised that this course was in theory a last
alternative, as it would involve the departure
of the B.E.F. from the theatre of war at a time
when the French might need all the support
which Britain could give them. It involved
the virtual certainty that even if the excellent
port facilities at Dunkirk continued to be
available, it would be necessary to abandon
all the heavier guns and much of the vehicles
and equipment. Nevertheless, I felt that in
the circumstances there might be no other
course open to me. It was therefore only
prudent to consider what the adoption of such
a plan might entail. On this day therefore at
about 1.30 p.m. the Chief of the General Staff
telephoned to the Director of Military Opera-
tions and Plans at the War Office and discussed
this situation with him.

The Position of the French 1st Army and the
British right flank reinforced.

31. The French rst Army had by 19th May
completed its withdrawal and was in touch
with the right of rst Corps. On the night of
19/2oth May they took up positions on the line
of the Escaut as far south as Bouchain; but at
that point, instead of continuing to hold that
tiver towards Cambrai (which according to my
information was not held in strength by the
enemy) they had drawn back westwards along
the river Sensée. Thus in the quadrilateral
Maulde—Valenciennes—Arleux—Douai, some
nineteen miles by ten, there was assembled the
bulk of the French 1st Army, amounting to
three Corps of two divisions and two divisions
in reserve—a total of eight divisions. The
Commander of the French 3rd Corps, General
de la Laurencie, remained that night in close
touch with General Mason-MacFarlane, at the
headquarters of Macforce.

Further west the French Cavalry Corps was
assembling at Oppy, north-east of Arras.

None of these forces were being seriously
pressed at this stage, but since the enemy had
already penetrated. so deeply further south, I
felt it necessary, without more delay, to
strengthen the dispositions for the defence of
what had become the bastion of Arras. It was
also necessary to secure cro westwards
from the right of Macforce, along the line
Carvin—La Bassée.

I therefore ordered 50th Division, then in
G.H.Q. reserve, to send one Infantry Brigade
(25th) to take up positions on the Canal on the
line La Bassée—Carvin under the command of
