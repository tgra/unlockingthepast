At a con- ference which took place here on the afternoon of the rst April the Commander-in-Chief agreed that, in view of the difficulties of the country and the fatigue of the troops in 17 Division, a withdrawal from Prome to the Allanmyo area should commence forthwith, and that this with- drawal might have to be continued even further north into the dry zone south of Taungdwingyi, where the country was more open and more suitable for the employment of tanks. On the evening of the 1st April the enemy attacked Prome and penetrated the defences held by the 63 Infantry Brigade securing the high ground south of the town, The 17 Division was forced to withdraw on the and Apml north and north- east of Prome. On the 3rd April the 17 Division moved back through 1 Burma Division, in position in the area Dayindabo- Pyalo, to the area Ywataung-Kyaukpadaung- Bwetkyichaung, the 48 Infantry Brigade and the 7 Armoured Brigade, less one regiment, moving during the night of the 3rd to 4th \u2018April to Satthwa. On the 3rd April xr Burcorps issued an Operation Instruction covering the possibility of a withdrawal to the line Minhla- Taungdwingyi and the withdrawal from Prome, which was originally intended to stop at Allan- myo, was, in view of the tired state of the troops, continued to this line, which was reached by the night of the 4th-5th April ex- cept by the 2 Burma Brigade, moving up the west bank, which did not reach Minhla till the night of the 8th-gth April."
