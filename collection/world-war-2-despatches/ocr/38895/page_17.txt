SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 28 APRIL, 1950 "2093

the town, the Naval Officer-in-Charge tempo-
tarily withdrew his party except for some key
ratings.

H.MS. ROBERTS: to Acid North—HM.S.
ROBERTS from Force “V” was ordered. to
move to Acip Nort ready to be called for-
ward either to join Force “K” or to supple-
ment the anti-aircraft defences of captured
ports as and when required. In the meantime
she was placed under the orders of Naval Com-
mander Force “A”.

U-boats.— Although . it was estimated that
some eighteen Italian U-boats were at sea in
the area of operations of the Eastern and
Western Task Forces there had so far been no
contact with‘any. This day, however, several
were encountered.

H.MS. OAKLEY claimed a “probably
sunk ” in the vicinity of Sousse, and the Greek
Hunt class destroyer PINDOS was unsuccess-
fully attacked two miles east of Cape Passero
at 0445. _The latter U-boat was counter-
attacked, and one pattern of depth charges
dropped, but though A/S vessels hunted until
noon no further contact was obtained. ~

BRONZO captured —While the 14th Mine-
sweeping Flotilla were engaged in screening the
cruisers bombarding Augusta, H.M.S. SEA-
HAM sighted a periscope shortly before 1300
and closed at full speed with the intention of
ramming. The U-boat surfaced and fire was
opened on it with all possible weapons and hits
were observed on the conning tower with the
3-inch. The U-boat replied, but surrendered
after a sharp engagement, which had lasted
about half-an-hour. The U-boat was the Italian
BRONZO, and she.was towed by H.M.S. SEA-
HAM to Syracuse. Twenty prisoners were
taken out of a crew of forty, the remainder in-
cluding the Commanding Officer having been
Bilcd by gunfire or drowned when abandoning
ship. _

H.M.S. BLANKNEY and BRISSENDEN in
collision. While on A/S patrol off Bark
West, HM.S. BLANKNEY and H.MS.
BRISSENDEN came into collision. Both sus-
tained damage-and were detached to Malta for
repairs, BRISSENDEN proceeding there p.m.
12th July and BLANKNEY p.m. 13th July.

D+3 Day... --
Tuesday, 13th July.

Weather,—The -weather remained fine, and
the calm sea permitted the passage to Sicily
from Malta of lighters and harbour craft for
use in the captured ports.

N.C.F.Y. takes over from N.C.F.B.—In pur-
suance of orders given by Naval Commander
Eastern Task Force when in Sicily the previous
day, Naval Commander Force “V” at 0400
took over the BARK areas from Naval Com-
mander Force “B” who proceeded to Syra-
cuse to assume duty as Flag Officer Sicily.

Situation at beaches,
A. BARK SOUTH. ' ‘

‘S.N.O.L.(Q) left for Sousse during the fore-
noon and §.N.O.L(S) from Bark West took
over the sector. ‘ ~

The follow-up convoys, K.M.F. and K.M.S.
19, consisting of three personnel, fourteen
M.T. ships and two petrol carriers arrived
at Bark SoutH at 0700. Unloading of M.T.
by L.C.T. and of stores by a fleet of about

B

fifty D.U.K.W. began at once. By 1630 the
personnel ships, using L.C.L(L) and L.CM.,
had discharged and by 1930 sailed for Malta,
in addition to four M.T. ships of the slow
assault convoy for Tripoli. This left eight ships
of the slow assault convoy and the newcomers
remaining at the beaches.

B. Bark East and WEsT.

Naval Commander Force “V” decided in
the forenoon to continue his predecessor’s
policy of using Bark East only for L.C.T.
when the assault convoy M.T. ships had been
cleared. This entailed all ships, as opposed to
craft, leaving Bark East p.m. and resulted in
the S.N.O.L. ship H.M.S. ALYNBANK being
withdrawn. The latter was in any case par-
ticularly needed to increase the anti-aircraft
protection at BaRK SOUTH.

In the afternoon, however, there was a par-
tial reversal of this plan when, with a view
to avoiding the increased concentration at
Bark SOUTH which would result from the deci-
sion to close Bark West, the Naval Com-
mander Force “ V ” ordered three nearly empty
M.T. ships from Bark West to BarK EAstT
the following day. The one ship of the follow-
up convoy for Bark East which had been
diverted, was also sent back there.

The decision to close BARK WEST was
reached because Bark SOUTH was in every
way superior. L.S.T. and L.C.T. could beach
at the eastern end without using a ramp, and
L.C.M. could land stores almost dry shod at
the western end which was backed by a good
maintenance area.

In consequence of these changes S.N.O.L.(S)
transferred to BarK SouTH while S.N.O.L.(R)
Temained at Bark West and S.N.O.L.(N)
moved ashore and set up his headquarters in
a house on Isola Piccolo.

The two Category “A” ships of the slow
assault convoy at Bark East sailed a.m. under
escort to join the Acip portion of a convoy for
Tripoli, and the three Category “B” ships
cleared by the evening.

C. Acip SourH and Nortu.

The follow-up convoys M.W.F: and M.W.S.
37 arrived. The fast section entered Syracuse
at 0945 and at once began to discharge. Such
good progress was made that by 1800 all twelve
ships were empty and away from the port. The
slow section of thirty ships anchored off the
beaches at 0900. Thirteen ships of the slow
assault convoy having previously been cleared
from the anchorage sailed immediately with
the escort of M.W.S. 37. Of the new arrivals
ten were ordered to enter Syracuse at first light
the following day.

Gun Support.

Gun support units continued their activities
as required.
