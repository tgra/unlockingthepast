SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 16 SEPTEMBER, 10948

assistance to the Royal Navy in their task of
safeguarding the convoys whenever they were
within range of our fighters. At the same time,
attempts were made to place the matter on a
more satisfactory basis, and in particular to
obtain from the Air Ministry a clear statement
of the Command’s duties in respect of ship-
ping and the degree of priority to be accorded
to them. These attempts culminated at the
end of October and beginning of November,
1940, in the receipt of a series of communica-
tions from the Secretary of State for Air which
gave renewed sanction to the Command’s exist-
ing practice of protecting convoys whenever
possible by holding fighters at readiness rather
than flying standing patrols; confirmed that
the defence of the aircraft industry was still
the primary task of the Command; but added
that convoys, and also flotillas and minesweep-
ing craft, must be protected so long as their
protection was practicable.

93. This pronouncement did not end my pre-
decessor’s perplexities, since—perhaps inevit-
ably—it neither defined the practicable nor
assisted him to determine how much of his re-
sources he would be justified in diverting from
his primary task to what was clearly a,.second-
ary—and yet, apparently, essential—one.

94. The difficulty of the problem will be the
more easily grasped if it is borne in mind that,
at this stage of the war, practically the whole
resources of the Command could have been
expended on either of these rival tasks, without
glutting the appetite of the Minister of Aircraft
Production in the one case or the Naval authori-
ties in the other.

’ 95. The renewal of mass attacks on shipping

at the beginning of November brought fresh
demands from the Naval authorities. Accord-
ingly, my predecessor again asked the Air
Ministry, this time by means of a formal letter,
to, clarify their policy in regard to the fighter
protection of shipping. In this letter he placed
before the Air Ministry a series of proposals
based on the practice which had grown up
gradually within the Command.

96. No reply to this letter had been received
when I took up Command, and I therefore
assumed the Air Ministry’s tacit consent to the
proposals. Henceforward three degrees of
fighter protection for shipping were recognized,
namely close escort, to be given only in special
cases and by prior arrangement; protection,
which meant that specified fighter units were
detailed to defend specified shipping units in a
given area and over a given period, either by
flying patrols or remaining at readiness; and
cover, which meant that note was taken of the
position of the shipping, and arrangements were
made to intercept any aircraft which appeared

* to threaten it.

97. Fortunately the scale of attack against
coastwise shipping declined considerably after
the middle of November. In the circumstances
the Naval authorities remained, to all appear-
ances, reasonably contented with a standard of
protection which would probably not have satis-
fied them had the attacks of early November
continued. :

within fighter range in December 1940, and
only two in January 1941, as against eleven in

99. Apart from operations against shipping,
the enemy continued in November to make the
fighter and fighter-bomber sweeps over Kent
and Sussex which had been a feature of his
operations in October. But in November these,
sweeps were made at less extreme altitudes
than in October, perhaps to avoid causing con-
densation trails or to reduce the strain on
pilots. Consequently they were rather easier
to counter. Heavy casualties were inflicted on
the enemy’s fighters as well as his dive-
bombers, and in this month No rz Group
claimed the highest proportion of enemy air-
craft destroyed to their own pilots lost which
had yet been recorded. '

roo. The fighter sweeps virtually ceased in
the middle of December and were resumed on a
reduced scale in February. In the meantime
the Germans made a number of so-called
* pirate ’’ raids on aircraft factories and similar
objectives These raids were made by single
aircraft, flying over carefully prepared routes,
often in cloudy weather. The German pilots
showed great skill in taking advantage of every
favourable circumstance of topography and
weather to elude the defences. Although the
taids were too infrequent to do much harm to
our war potential, they caused some anxiety
and resulted in great pressure being put on me
to provide local fighter protection for the
threatened factories. ,

mor. The unsoundness of this method of de-
fence, which, if carried to its logical conclu-
sion, would have been impossibly extravagant
and would have exposed our fighter force to
defeat in detail, needs no elaboration. Never-
theless the Minister of Aircraft Production was
so insistent that eventually J devised a scheme
whereby a number of aircraft factories were
to be allotted fighters for local defence, these
to be piloted by the firms’ own test pilots.
Although put into effect later in the year, the
scheme achieved little practical success and was
eventually allowed to fall into abeyance. As
to its thorough unsoqundness from the military
viewpoint there can be no doubt; but I think
that it may have been worth while at the time
simply for its moral effect. Workers who,
seeing no fighters in the immediate neighhour-
hood of their factory, were unaware of the pro-
tection that they were receiving from the
general air defence system, may have been and
probably were heartened by the knowledge that
there was a fighter on the factory airfield ex-
pressly for the purpose of defending them.

ro2. A more important measure taken at this
stage concerned the flying of Balloon Barrages.
On the outbreak of War the intention had been
This practice
proved so expensive, chiefly because of the
large number of balloons carried away, or
damaged by bad weather, that it soon gave
way to a system whereby balloons were close-
hauled in doubtful weather and raised only on
the approach of hostile aircraft. The dis-
advantage of this system was that the weather
conditions in which balloons were likely to be
close-hauled were precisely those in which a
“pirate ’’ raider might hope to approach its
target undetected, or at least without its pur-
pose being divined in time for the barrage to
be raised. Thus, if the barrage commanders
interpreted their freedom to close-haul the
balloons too liberally, there was a risk that
