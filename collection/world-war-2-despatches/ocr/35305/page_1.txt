The following Despatches have been received by the Secretary of State for
War from General the Viscount Gort, V.C., K.C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O., M.V.O., M.C.,

Commander-in-Chief, British Expeditionary Force.

(France and Belgium 1939-40. )

FIRST DESPATCH
(Covering the period from 3rd September, 1939, to 31st January, 1940).

General Headquarters;
British Expeditionary Force,
25th April, 1940.
Sir,
1. I have the honour to submit a report on the
employment of the British Expeditionary Force

in France from 3rd September, 1939, the date I
assumed command, until 31st January, 1940.

2. The move of the Force to France began as
a whole on roth September, although small
advanced parties and technical personnel had
been arriving since 4th September. The success
of the initial o opersiieat was due primarily to the
many detailed and complex plans carefully
prepared under conditions of absolute secrecy
in peace time. The perfection of these plans, the
ready co-operation of the Board of Trade, the
complete arrangements made by the Admiralty
for the safety of ships while at sea, and the
willing help of the French Naval, Military, and
Civil authorities all combined to ensure the
Surgeestil landing of the British Troops in

Trance. 7

3. The plans for the despatch of the Force
differed in two important respects from those of
August, 1914.

The possibility of attack by sea and air made
it necessary to use the Western ports of France
instead of the Channel ports, while the total
¥ lacement of animals by mechanical vehicles,

ich had been completed by 1939, presented
a new problem in transportation.

The troops were landed at Cherbourg ‘and
their stores and vehicles were despatched to
Nantes, St. Nazaire, and Brest.

This ples entitles the early despatch of staff
with the r complement of units of the
Docks ani er Transportation Services.
personnel My these Services were in the main
recruited from the Port Authorities in Great
Britain at the outbreak of war.

These units were operating to full capacity the
berths allotted to the Force, within forty-eight
hours of Janding, and the programme wes
carried out according to the time table through-
out the whole period of the disembarkation of
1st and 2nd Corps. This I regard as a feat
