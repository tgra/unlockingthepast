orders, however, did not reach one battalion of the 6/15 Brigade which was left behind.

By mid-day the front ran approximately from the hills east of the Bukit Timah Rifle Range on the right, along the line of the railway, then forward to the junction of- Ulu Pandan and Reformatory roads and then south to a point oh the coast north of Pasir Panjang Village.

526. By o7oo hrs. it had become clear that a dangerous gap existed between the MacRitchie Reservoir and the Racecourse which was not held by any of our troops. As a temporary measure I ordered a composite unit from the Reinforcement Camp to move up immediately and take up a position at the west end of the Golf  Course. Later a troop of our light tanks preh d further west as far as Swiss Rifle Club

At the same ame I ordered the Commander Northern Area to take over responsibility for this sector of the front as far left as a line

529. During the morning a letter from Lieut.-General _ Yamashita, Commander-inChief  of the Japanese Army, was dropped from: an aeroplane calling upon me to surreader the fortress. I made no reply to this and reported to Headquarters, South-West Pacific Command as under:  

  Have received letter from Commander of Japanese Army asking for surrender of fortress. Letter was dropped by air. Have ho means of dropping message so do NOT propose to make reply which woulc of course in any case be negative. 

530. To meet the threat developing from .

the west, the Comrnander Northern Area decided to withdraw units from the beaches held by the 18 British Division and organized a force under Brigadier Massy Beresford, known as   Massy Force.  It consisted of three infantry battalions, a light tank squadron, a battery of artillery and a detachment of mechanized cavalry. It was given the dual task of (a) securing the pumping stations at the eastern ends of the Peirce and MacRitchie Reservoirs, and (b) filling the gap between the MacRitchie Reservoir and the right of Tom Force. Later in the day, the second task became the more important, but strong patrols were maintained between the two reservoirs to prevent infiltration. Units of the force were moved into position as they reached the rendezvous east of MacRitchie Reservoir.

531. During the morning a strong enemy attack developed against the 22 Australian Infantry Brigade, now reduced to a few hundred men only, which was in position north of the junction of the Reformatory and Ulu Pandan roads (about one mule south of Bukit Timah Village). Fierce fighting went on in this area throughout the day during which the

prayer



brigade held its ground thost gallantly in face  of infantry attacks supported by aerial bombing, artillery, mortar and small arms fire.

During the evening 31th February Tom Force, which was on a very extended front, was withdrawn to more concentrated positions astride the Bukit Timah Road with the right battalion in the Racecourse area and the left south of Racecourse Village. The gap between Tom Force and the right of the 22 Brigade was filled by an Australian battalion and later by 2 Gordons.

534. In the Causeway sector there was no change in the situation during the morning. Our artillery succeeded in keeping the gap in the Causeway open and at the same time inflicted numerous casualties on enemy. parties trying to.repair it. :

A project to recapture Bukit Panjdng Village with the 27 Australian Brigade Group, in order to ease the pressure on the Bukit Timah front, proved aboriive. That Group was at this time too dispersed for any co-ordinated action.

During the day enemy troops penetrated between the 28 and 8 Brigades towards Nee Soon Village and at 1600 hrs. the, Commander 11 Indian Division was instructed by-the Commander Northern Area that his task now was to protect the left flank of the 18 British Division by holding a line from the River Seletar to Peirce Reservoir.

537. The loss of the food and p trol depots and dumps in the Bukit Timah area, in spite of all our efforts to hold them, was 4 very serious blow. We now only had about 14 days  military food supplies in the depots which remained under our control.
