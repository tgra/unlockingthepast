(d) Where necessary, military demands on indigenous production of articles essential to the civil population, of which there was a shortage, should be diverted elsewhere

. (e) The fullest possible use should  be made of the Central Provision Office's stocks as well as of the productive capacity in Eastern Group countries in order to relieve India.

(f) Sufficient transportation  _ facilities whether by rail, road, inland water, or coastal shipping, should be reserved in order to maintain India's internal economy and productive capacity at suitable levels.

The above recommendations were accepted and telegraphed with observations in greater detail, by the Governor-General to H.M. Government (India Office) on 21st October, 1943.

24. The following short-term improvements on the Assam L. of C. were immediately considered :  

(a) Increasing the number of train paths in Assam by various improvements in operation, One of these was supervision by military personnel* and, another, the relaxation of certain running precaution involving abnormal risks.

(b) The immediate increase of locomotive and rolling stock on the Bengal and Assam Railway by transfers from other parts India the latter to be replaced by fresh stock from the U.S.A. on arrival,

(c) The speeding up of river transportation

* by installation of navigational lights and by night running.  (d) The despatch by air from Calcutta to

Assam airfields of stores destined for China.



25. Progress im Manpower and Recruiting.

I now come to the actual progress that has been achieved in pursuance of existing plans or policy.

It has been remarked above that one of the main headings under which limitations existed in regard to the total war effort of this country is manpower.

The problem became more complicated  as the drain on the United Kingdom and India increased.

The shortage of officers in the United Kingdom coincided with heavily increased commitments due to the setting up of of the South East Asia Command, and the formation of the Headquarters of the rth Army Group and the Fourteenth Army. At the same time there was a decline in the intake to our officers  training schools in this country. As a result, when the period ended there was an acute shortage of officers jor both the British and Indian Armies. (The officer situation in the Air Forces is dealt with separately in that portion of this Despatch relating to Air Force Administration.)

With regard to British other ranks, the supply from the United Kingdom was up to expectations apart from technicians We were thus, able to build up strength in the majority of arms, and in some cases even to increase their TeServe.

As regards Indian other ranks, there was a decline in recruiting particularly during October and November.

The following are the figures:

The causes of decline are thought to be several. Clearly, the manpower of the 1aces and tribes which furnished the  bulk of recruits before the war had heen heavily tapped since 1940, and the increasing opportunities for wellpaid employment in civil labour conflicted with the attractions of service in the fighting forces.

Another complication was the ever-increasing demand for educated recruits to be trained as technicians. All services have required them, but priority was accorded to the Indian Air Force for the dilution scheme designed to conserve British manpower. Though the scheme helped the Air Forces (and their need was paramount) it tended to restrict the flow to the Indian Army of much-wanted educated personnel especially clerks.

Similarly the Roval Indian Navy suffered in the recruitment for its more highly educated categories. It obtained, however, the men it needed for its lower grades, and was able to take a higher proportion of these from Southern India. i

* See also paragraph 27 below under  Transportation Road and Raul. 

Recruitment for the Women's Auxiliary Corps (India) averaged 400 per month in the first half of the period but fell to about 300. per month later. Here accommodation difficulties entailed the cessation of the publicity campaign and the intake fell as a result.

26. Line of Communication Development.

The last two Despatches from the India Command give details of the efforts made since early 1942 to build up our lines of communication in the extremely difficult zone comprising Assam and North Eastern India generally, During the period under review, progress was severely handicapped by the monsoon. This was only to be expected, but nevertheless much was done under adverse con-. ditions. The post of Inspector of Transporta-- tion, Assam, was created to supervise the working of the Assam line of communications. Also a Joint Transportation Committee, representing all branches and departments of the Government of India concerned, was set up to initiate, supervise and progress transportation projects of all kinds arising from the needs. of the South East Asia Command.
