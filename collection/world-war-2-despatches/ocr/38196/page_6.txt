Sidi Rezegh, he had rejected the advice of his
two divisional commanders and dashed off on a
raid to the Egyptian frontier which, in face of
the stubborn British maintenance of the objec-
tive, led directly to the loss of his positions
round Tobruk and his retreat to Agheila at the
~ cost of sixty per cent. of his forces. His present
poiition in front of Alamein I hoped would turn
out to be another example of this tendency.
Whether it was on his own initiative or by order
of Hitler that he held the whole of his forces
forward at Alamein it is impossible to say; but
if he had organized a firm defensive position
further back, vat Matruh or Sollum,with a light
covering force to detain us at Alamein, he would
have been much more difficult to deal with
Rommel’s superior in the Mediterranean
theatre was Field-Marshal Albert Kesselring.
‘Also a regular officer of the old Imperial Army,
of Bavarian origin, Kesselring had served as
an artillery officer and on the staff until the
creation of the Luftwaffe, when he transferred
to the new arm in which he rose rapidly. After
commanding the 2nd Air Fleet (Luftflotte) in
the Battle of Britain and on the Russian front
in 1941 he brought it to Italy in October of
that year. In April 1942 he assumed the title
of Commander-in-Chief South. His authority
extended to all the shores of the Mediterranean
and by contrast with Rommel, who was an
Army commander only, he was now suprerae
commander of all three services. This superior
‘position réflected his superior strategical abilities
but he was naturally obliged to leave the actual
coriduct of operations in Africa to his more
impetuous subordinate. Rommel had a tend-
ency to blame, in certain circumstances, his
Jack of success on the inadequate logistical
support he received from Kesselring—unyustly,
for in these matters the latter was obliged to
work through the Italians. I was later to be

moré directly opposed to Kesselring in the ~

talian campaign afd in my judgment’ he was
greatly superior in all elements of generalship
to Rommel.

‘Preparations for a Defensive Battle.

+ Jt was obvious. that if the enemy were to
‘retain any hopes of success they must attack
us before we could develop our full strength and
there were not wanting indications that this
‘was their intention. I had decided already
that we must meet this dttack on our present
positions without any thought of withdrawal.
As rapidly as’ possible thereafter we should pre-

ate to concentrate our strength and assume

he offensive. On 9th August, therefore, I
issued a written Directive to General Mont-
Bomery in the following terms, confirming
Previous verbal instructions: -

‘I. Your prime and immediate task is to
+ prepare for offensive action against the

German-Italian forces with a view to destroy-

ing them at the earliest possible moment.

2. Whilst preparing this attack you must
hold your present positions and on no
account allow the eriemy to penetrate east
of them.”? | ;

It was now becoming possible to reinforce
the troops in the desert and Eighth Army
decided to strengthen 13 Corps on the southern
flank, since the northern part of the front was
held strongly enough and it was likely that the

enemy attack would take the form of an out-.
flanking move to the south. 44 Division, which
had arrived in Egypt at the end of June, had-
just completed its concentration and training
and on 1§th August I gave orders for it to
join Eighth Army. The divisional head-
quarters, with 131 and 133 Brigades, was sent
to reheve 21 Indian Brigade on Alam el
Halfa ridge with orders to develop the posi-
tions there in the greatest possible strength.
The remaining brigade, the 132nd, with one
regiment of artillery, was placed under com-
mand of 2 New Zealand Division. 10 Armoured
Division (8 and 9 Armoured Brigades) had been
training for some time but it had never fought
as a division, since its tanks had been taken
to make up for battle losses in 1 and 7
Armoured Divisions. 8 Armoured Brigade,
however, had just been re-equipped and I
ordered the division, less g Armoured Brigade,
to proceed to the forward area. On arrival
it took command of 22 Armoured Brigade, of
7 Armoured Division, and took up positions at
the western end of Alam el Halfa ridge,
between 44 and 2 New Zealand Divisions. 23
Armoured Brigade, which had been dispersed
in support of the infantry of 30 Corps, was
concentrated on the Corps left flank where it
would be available also as a reserve for
13 Corps. With the arrival of these reinforce-
ments there were ranged on Alam el Halfa
ridge, threatening the flank of an enemy
advance, in the southern sector, some sixteen
medium, two hundred and forty field and two
hundred anti-tank guns, all under Corps com-
-mand, besides the guns of nearly four hundred
tdnks and over a hundred anti-iank guns
manned by the infantry. The minefields and
wire entanglements had been largely extended
and the position was a very strong one.

While these preparations were going on in the
desert I paid particular attention to the
campaign which was being conducted by the
Air Force against the enemy’s lines of com-
munication. Never had the Axis supply lines in
Africa been so stretched as they were when they
stood at El] Alamein and the strain was felt,
above all, in fuel. In dumps or in motor con-
voys fuel was relatively immune from air attack
but to reach Africa from Italy it had to come
in tankers and these had been given the first
Priority as objects for air attack. Working to
a plan drawn up in consultation with my staff,
the Royal Air Force, assisted by bombers of
the oth United States Air Force* had been
waging a most successful war against Axis
tankers during which more had been sunk than
had arrived. The resulting shortage had a vital
effect on the development of the subsequent
battle.

The Battle of Alam el Halfa

I had expected the enemy to attack on or
immediately after 25th August, the night of
the full moon, and this was indeed his original
intention, but the fuel situation caused a delay.
In the meantime the concentration of forces on
the southern flank made obvious the imminence
