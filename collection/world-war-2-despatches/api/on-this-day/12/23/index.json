The 2and Armoured Brigade reached Saunntu on the 23rd December, but there they were again immobilised by lack of petrol. That evening the enemy armoured forces retired to Agedabia."

            "description": "The Japanese floated troops down the Perak River by night, and on the 2and December the rath Indian Infantry Brigade was forced back South of Kuala Kangsar, The, 28th Indian Infantry Brigade was also pressed in the same direction, small detachments only being left North of Kuala Kangsar and West of the Perak River. Bridges were destroyed as the troops retired. While this was taking place on the Perak front, the Kelantan withdrawal was also continuing, the 8th Indian Infantry Brigade retiring South of Kuala Krai along the railroad. A problem similar to that of Krohco] and the r1th Division referred to above (see para. 115) now arose in regard to 8th Indian Infantry Brigade and the main body of III Corps in Perak, and, to a lesser degree, in regard to the force at Kuantan and the 8th Indian Infantry Brigade. {It was therefore decided to withdraw this 8th Brigade much further South into Central Malaya, and it took-up completely new positions in the Kuala Lipis-Raub area. A small party known as   Macforce   was left with an armoured train at Dabong to withdraw down the railway, demolishing it as they went. The Kuantan force was ordered to prepare to withdraw Westwards at short notice. On the 23rd December all our fighters on the mainland were withdrawn to Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Port Swettenham being kept as advanced landing grounds. The enemy was also occupying various points down the East coast of Malaya, and had proceeded from Kuala Trengganu to Dungun. By the 25th December it would be true to say that something like onehalf of Malaya had passed from our control."

Sufficient assault, personnel, and motor transport shipping was allotted to carry the formations and units with their vehicles on a reduced scale, similar to that used on various exercises carried out in the previous year. This Force was reasonably well found. The infantry bngades, 102 R.M. Brigade and 36 Infantry Brigade, had been water trained and had exercised on shore over long distances and with little or no transport. Signals were just adequate.. All units were tactically stowed and a minimum of personnel was allowed to enable signals to function after capture of objective. The provision of one squadron of aircraft only, fifteen Lysanders, subsequently reduced to six, appeared to me a little peculiar, but the decision by the Chief of the Air Staff was that this was perfectly adequate for the occupation of the objective."
