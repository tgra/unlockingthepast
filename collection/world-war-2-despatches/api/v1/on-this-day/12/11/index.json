There is evidence to show that on the 11th December, 1941, i.e., three days after the outbreak of hostilities, the Japanese had 124 aircraft in Thailand and 280 in Indo-China.

The range of the fighters had been greatly increased by the use of auxiliary petrol tanks."

This movement was carried out during the day and a good position occupied. Unfortunately the runways at both the Gong Kedah and Machang aerodromes had to be left intact, for at neither had the demolition arrangements been completed. Orders wete given for the demolition of the Guillemard Bridge over the Kelantan River, the longest railway bridge in Malaya."
