appreciated therefore that the defence of Kenya
had to be carried out by holding isolated
localities where water existed, on the tracks
leading out of Kenya into Italian territory.
Most of these localities have been mentioned
in the description of the line held above. The
policy for defence was to provide the localities
with the strongest physical forms of defence
possible, e.g., wire, mines, tank traps, etc.,
but that they should be lightly held. The main
defence depended on the provision of highly
mobile reserves kept outside and behind the
localities for immediate counter-attack.

3. My predecessor had been able to establish
energetic patrol superiority over the large area
of desert which separated the two forces, but
owing to shortages of various sorts, chiefly
M.T., was unable to do more,

An important part in establishing control
over No Man’s Land was played by the Irregu-
lar Companies. The first two Somali Irregular
Companies were formed in September 1940
with the object of countering the activities of
Italian Banda in the Northern Frontier District
of Kenya, Italian Banda consisted of Colonial
troops specially enlisted and normally operat-
ing in the vicinity of the areas from which they
were recruited. They were well led by specially
selected Italian officers who “‘ lived native ”
and with their knowledge of the country, and
independence of communications, not only had
a serious nuisance value but also provided the
enemy with much valuable information about
our troop movements,

The two Somali Irregular Companies each
about 125 strong under British officers selected
for their local knowledge, proved a valuable
counter to Italian Banda in the Northern
Frontier District. Backed up by offensive
patrols of regular troops, they operated from
one water hole to another, and although always
inferior in numbers to the Italians very soon
forced the enemy to adopt a much more de-
fensive attitude in the vast No Man’s Land
which them separated our leading troops from
those of the enemy.

_At a later stage Irregular Companies were
similarly organised from Abyssinian refugees
and deserters, and later still from Turkana
tribesmen in the area west of Lake Rudolf.
During the operations in this area, and in the
operational area of the rst S.A. Division,
Irregular Companies were frequently employed
to cooperate with regular troops. Their prin-
ciple role was the protection of exposed flanks,
and movements directed against the enemy’s
L of C in cooperation with attacks carried out
by regular troops.

4. With the arrival of the 2nd S.A. Brigade
and later of the 5th S.A. Brigade the rst S.A.
Division was established under command of
Major General G, E. Brink, C.B., D.S.O. I
was then able to place the force on a three
division front, 1rth (A) Division on the tight,
rath (A) Division in the centre ,and ist (S.A.)
Division on the left. The length of the front
to be held seldom permitted me to form a force
reserve, though from time to time I depended
on formations out resting in the Highlands or
units under training. The Order of Battle of
E.A. Force on 1st January r94x is given in
Appendix ‘' A’, and the Air Forces stationed
in Kenya in Appendix “‘ B’’,

5. In view of the mixed composition of E.A.
Force, e.g. all the artillery less the light bat-
teries was South African, I felt I must be in
a position to move South African formations
and units from one Division to another as the
situation demanded, I appreciated that the
desire on the part of the South Africans to
keep 1st (S.A.) Division complete would very
naturally be strong. 1 was able to take advan-
tage of Field-Marshal Smuts’ visit to Kenya
in the first week of November to put this point
before him. Field-Marshal Smuts most help-
fully gave me a free hand in the matter, with
the exception that he did not wish me to break
the Brigade Group organisation. I was able
to give this undertaking readily. As a result
one S.A. Brigade was continuously employed
under one or the other of the African Divisions,
and other South African units were changed
about as required. This gave an elasticity to
the force which was of the very greatest value to
me and enabled me to use the splendid South
African troops to the best advantage. I am
most grateful to Field-Marshal Smuts, and to
the South African Commanders and troops who
accepted this decision so loyally, and co-oper-
‘ated so well with the Imperial Commanders on
the occasions when jit became necessary to
place them under African formations.

6. Although everywhere except at Marsabit
itself our troops were in desert country, the
characteristics of the terrain on the east of the
forward line held were quite different to that
on the west. The 400 miles of country from
the sea to just short of Marsabit was all water-
less, flat bush. The actual density of the bush
varied considerably, but there were very few
places where the light tanks could not push
their way through. Movement of armoured
cars off the tracks was restricted in parts of this
area, but large portions of it were by no means
impassable to these vehicles. Except in the
rains, the surface of the soil permitted move-
ment by M.T. anywhere, where the bush was
thin enough to let it through. During the rains
the many large patches of black cotton soil
became impassable for days at a time.

Round Marsabit and west of it was quite a
different picture. The Chalbi desert and the
lava escarpment which surrounded Marsabit
hill were completely open. The lava belts were
impassable to M.T. without preparation, but in
dry weather the sandy portions of the Chalbi
desert could be driven over anywhere. Further
west, north and west of Lake Rudolf, was
stony country with some very thin bush, and
hills from which observation was possible over
great distances. Furthermore armoured cars
could drive over it anywhere, albeit slowly.

To the east the bush country extended un-
broken to the foot hills of British Somaliland
and the Arussi Hills. In the west, on the north-
ern side of the Chalbi desert, the country facing
ist (S.A.) Division was firstly similar to that
north of Lake Rudolf already described, and
then consisted of low hills covered with bush
of varying density.

7. Thad been instructed by General Wavell
at the Khartoum Conference at the end of
October to examine, immediately on my arrival,
the possibility of carrying out an operation for
the capture of Chisimaio before the rains broke
in March. I came to the conclusion that the
forces required for such an operation at that
time, would be six brigade groups, one of which
