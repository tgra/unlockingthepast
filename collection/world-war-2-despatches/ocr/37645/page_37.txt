SUPPLEMENT To tHe LONDON

Berbera. This Brigade, less one battalion which
went by road with the first line transport, em-
barked at Mombasa on 16th March and arrived
at Berbera on 23rd March.

38. Meanwhile, on the northern front, 21st
E.A. Brigade occupied Iavello which patrols
had discovered to have been evacuated by the
enemy.

On 31st March, 21st E.A. Infantry Brigade,
after a short, well-conceived and skilfully
carried out operation, drove the enemy out of
Soroppa, capturing the commander of the 18th
Colonial Inf. Bde., 27 Italians and 360 natives,
as well as five field guns and a number of
machine guns.

39. On 6th April, rath (A) Division assumed
command of the ast and 25th E.A. Infantry
Brigades and the area for which 1st S.A. Divi-
sion had hitherto been responsible,

40. At the beginning of these operations to
the east of Lake Rudolf the 2nd and 5th S.A.
Brigades had to endure appalling conditions of
heat and dust from the hot lava bed of which
the country up to Gorai is composed. What
made it worse was that there was no shade
whatsoever. Although in subsequent operations
the heat was not so great, the men always had
to be on short rations of water, as until they
captured Mega, it had to be carried up 200 miles
from the rear. Until the fall of Moyale opened.
up the shorter L. of C., the difficulties of supply
were always great, as the roads were either so
rough that considerable driving ability was re-
quired in crossing them or so thick in powdered
dust that ’even a little rain. made them
impassable,

41. I wish to place on record my appreciation
of the sound judgment and determination in
face of great difficulties of terrain, shown by
Major-General G. E. Brink, C.B., D.S.O.,
Commander rst S.A. Division, in bringing these
operations to a successful conclusion.

B. Operations of 11th and 12th (A) Divisions.
(th February to 25th February, 1941.)

42. After the raid at El Wak, and while our
forward policy was developing, the enemy de-
cided to withdraw practically the whole of his
Colonial Forces to the Giuba, leaving west of the
river only a screen of Banda, and one battalion
and some guns at Afmadu in a strongly wired
position.

At the commencement of the operations I
estimated that his forces were disposed as
under:

Lower Giuba and Chisimaio (i.e., south
and inclusive of Gelib), ro2and Division (Four
Brigades and Div. troops, three Banda groups
and Chisimaio command.)

Upper Giuba (north of Gelib exclusive),
rorst Division (Iwo Brigades and Div.
troops, and three Banda groups.)

Against this force I employed four brigade
groups fully motorised. The Order of Battle
of 11th and r2th (A) Divisions at the com-
mencement of these operations is given at
Appendix ‘‘ C.’’

43. It will be recalled that although patrol-
ling was being carried out many miles forward
of them, the actual forward localities occupied
by my troops were along the River Tana to
Garissa, thence to Wajir, joining up with the
Ist S.A. Division at Matsabit. The defended

GAZETTE, 10 JULY, 1946 3563

localities at Bura, Garissa and Wajir were initi-
ally the bases of the various advancing columns.

44. My plan for the capture of Chisimaio
directed r2th (A) Division (1st S.A., 2and
E.A., and 24th Gold Coast Brigades) from the
Garissa-Wajir area on to Afmadu. From there
one column (1st S.A. Brigade) was to move
south, capture Gobuen, and form a bridgehead
at Giumbo, while another column (24th G.C.
Brigade) was to capture Bulo Erillo, and move
on to Allessandra and threaten Gelib. I did
not expect, in view of the strong positions held
by the enemy in this area, that this brigade
by itself would be able to capture Gelib, and
gave instructions that provided sufficient threat
was developed to draw the enemy reinforce-.
ments at Margherita northwards, or at least to
prevent them moving south, I would be satis-
fied until greater strength was available. The
timing was so arranged that this threat was to
be produced before Gobuen was attacked. In
view of the importance of Gobuen the bulk of
the artillery and the tanks went to the 12th (A)
Division.

rth (A) Division (23rd Nigerian Brigade)
from the Bura area, proceeding by Lac Badana,
was to attack and capture Chisimaio. As I
wished first to make sure of the key position of
Gobuen, and to conceal the advance of the
southern column against Chisimaio as long as
possible, the move forward of the rxth (A)
Division was ordered to take place on 15th
February, viz., after the attack had developed
on ‘Gobuen.

45. The Royal Navy, “‘ Force T’’ under
Capt. J. H. H. Edelsten, R-N., and consisting
of H.M.S. Shropshire, H.M.S. Hawkins,
H.M.S. Hermes, H'M.S. Capetown, H.M.S.
Ceres, H.M.S. Kandahar, were co-operating by
bombarding Brava and movement on the
coastal road in the early stages of the opera-
tion so as to assist the deception that the attack
was to take place farther north, and a plan
was prepared for the bombardment of Chisimaio
in support of the attack of 11th (A) Division.
Arrangements were also made to sail a convoy
into Chisimaio as soon as practicable, and if
Gobuen and not Chisimaio were captured an
attempt was to be made to land stores on the
beach near Gobuen, so as to enable operations
to continue.

46. Previous to the operation the S.A.A.F.
had carried out a most successful fighter attack
on Afmadu, Dif and Gobuen accounting for ro
enemy aircraft.

Highly effective bombing of Afmadu and
Gelib was also undertaken on the afternoon of
the day preceding the attack..

Arrangements were made whereby fighters
and A.C. aircraft should land on Afmadu and
Gobuen aerodromes as soon as they were cap-
tured.

47. In order to lead the enemy to believe that
another column was advancing via El Wak a
feint was made on this sector. From subse-
quent information received it is believed that
the Italian Commander of the sector opposite
Wajir claimed that his troops had stopped the
advance of an enemy division, this ‘‘ division ’””
consisting ‘in fact of “little ‘more than two ”
platoons and a few armoured cars.

48. Food and water were taken with the
forces engaged to last up to 2zst February.
If Chisimaio had not been captured by then, or
