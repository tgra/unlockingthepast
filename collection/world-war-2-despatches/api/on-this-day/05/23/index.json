That the fleet suffered disastrously {1 this encounter with the unhampered Germ Air Force is evident but it has to be rem bered on the credit side that the Navy's duty was achieved and no enemy ship whether warship or transport succeeded in reaching Crete or intervening in the battle during these critical days. Nor should the losses sustained blind one to the magnificent courage  and endurance that was displayed throughout. I have never -felt prouder of the Mediterranean leet than at the close of these particular operations, except perhaps, at the fashion in which it faced up to the-even greater strain which was so soon to be imposed upon it."
