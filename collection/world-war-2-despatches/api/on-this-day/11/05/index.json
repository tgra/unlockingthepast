            "description": "81. Nevertheless, this experience pointed to the desirability of expanding the operational training organisation so that full advantage might be taken of the increased supply of pilots from the Flying Training Schools which would eventually become available. On Ist November 1940, three Operational Training Units were in existence and the formation of another had been ordered. On 5th November my predecessor proposed to the Air Ministry that two more should be added and that all six should be incorporated in a Fighter Operational Training Group within the Command."

            "description": "209. Up to the end of October, operations in the Aegean had been controlled by Middle East Command through the 3rd Corps Headquarters (Force: 292) and the 234th Brigade (MajorGeneral Brittorous) on Leros, but recent developments obviously justified the establishment of a separate command to take over operations in that sphere. On x1st November, MajorGeneral Hall was appointed G.O.C. Aegean, with the specific task of holding Leros and Samos in order to cause as much damage as possible to the enemy's lines of communication in the Aegean. In addition, he was given command of all British, Allied and Italian land forces in the Aegean, including and north of Rhodes, Scarpanto and Crete, as well as of naval personnel in shore establishments not under Commander-in-Chief, Levant, or Senior British Naval Officer, Aegean, in that area. General Hall and Brigadier Tilney, who was to take the post of Fortress Commander, Leros, arrived at Leros on 5th November, and from that date Headquarters, Aegean, started to control operations."

The westward move to this area was made openly in daylight and when the division moved due north after dusk it was represented in the staging area by the measures I have already described. A wireless network of Io Corps, with all its brigades, was represented as operating in the southern sector up to D-day and from D mirfis 1 onwards occasional false messages were sent suggesting a move forward into 13 Corps  area."
