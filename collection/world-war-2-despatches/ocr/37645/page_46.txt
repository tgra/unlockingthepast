and confirmed that the enemy were holding a
strong position in the area of Uaddara.

Io5. On 6th April 12th (A) Division H.Q.
moved to Neghelli and took over from 1st S.A.
Division, the 21st and 25th E.A. Infantry
Brigades and all Divisional troops not proceed-
ing to Middle East. The 24th G.C. Brigade
less 3rd G.C. Regiment at Neghelli remained
under command of Force in the area Lugh
Ferrandi-Oddur-Iscia Baidoa with the task of
clearing up and patrolling the area.

The Order of Battle of rath (A) Division at

this time is given in Appendix ‘‘ H
Part ITI.—GENERAL.

106. Control and Headquarters.

The problem of control of the operations was
intricate. Although originally Force H.Q. was
based on a Corps Staff Establishment, it was
found necessary owing to the many local pro-
blems of supply, personnel, finance, &c., to
expand it into a minor G.H.Q. whose dealings
were very largely concerned with South Africa,
the Government of Kenya and the Governors’
Conference. A large portion of my staff, and
strictly speaking myself also, had firm roots in
Nairobi and many major responsibilities in that
place.

In the campaign which has been described it
will be remembered that the main advance in
the south was, in the initial stages, carried out
by two divisions at one time, and it was quite
clear to me that it would be necessary either to
improvise a Corps H.Q. and place one of the
Major-Generals in command, or to go forward
and control the battle myself. It was quite im-
possible for me to give a general directive to
ist S.A. Division in the north and to rely on
General Brink to carry it out, but in view of the
interplay between the 11th and rath (A) Divi-
sions which was bound to happen when they
reached the Giuba, I was convinced I could not
follow this procedure in their case. I did not
like the idea of forming an improvised Corps
H.Q. as neither the Commander nor the staff
would have time to get to know each other.
I therefore decided to form an Advanced H.Q.
and go forward and fight the battle myself.

107. On oth February, therefore, Force H.Q.
was divided into two, with Rear Force H.Q. at
Nairobi and Advanced Force H.Q. at Garissa.
Advanced Force H.Q. consisted of the majority
of the General Staff and representatives of the
branches, while the Rear H.Q. continued to
operate with the remaining personnel. As
operations progressed, Advanced Force H.Q.
moved forward. Moves were carried out in
three echelons. The main operational group
was air-borne. It was preceded by an advance
signal centre and a portion of Advanced H.Q.,
which went by road two or three days ahead to
establish communications. After the departure
of the air party the rear ecnelon of Advanced
Force H.Q. followed by road. Owing to the
distances involved in the moves and the state
of the roads, it was usually a week after the
departure of the Advance Party before the Rear
Party arrived, and Advanced Force H.Q. was
complete again. .

The following moves were carried out by
Advanced H.Q. :—

roth February. Nairobi—Garissa.
18th February. Garissa—Chisimaio.
a7th February. Chisimaio—Mogadiscio.

108. Although the arrangements for Advanced
H.Q. worked reasonably satisfactorily, things
were not so happy at Nairobi. Many important
matters were either neglected or left in the hands
of junior officers who had not the experience to
deal-with them. Heads of services had no one
to go to for guidance and control, and, more-
over, were out of touch with what was going
on in front. I was only once able to go back to
Nairobi myself.

Before serious operations began I had always
felt that the best solution would have been to
add a floating Corps H.Q. to the Force which
could have taken charge of any front where two
divisions were being employed; my experience
during operations confirmed this view.

As Advanced H.Q. got further and further
away from Nairobi I asked for a Major-General
with the idea of making Nairobi a base area
under ‘his command. ‘Before sanction had been
obtained, however, Addis Abeba had fallen and
a new situation presented itself.

109. I should call attention here to the neces-
sity for rapid, accurate and efficient staff work
in all branches which the speed and nature of
the operations demanded. Both at my Advanced
and Rear H.Q. and in all formations the staffs
and subordinate personnel were not found want-
ing. 1 wish to mention particularly the work of
Brigadier J. K. Edwards, M.C., my B.G.S., as
being of outstanding merit. In his cool-headed
yet rapid and clear interpretation of my direc-
tions he showed himself a staff officer on whom
complete reliance could be placed

Administration was the key-note of the opera-
tions, the burden of which fell mainly on the
shoulders of the A.Q.M.G.s Colonel A. C. Duff,
O.B.E., M.C., and Colonel Sir Brian H.
Robertson, Bt., D.S.O., M.C., one of whom
was always with me forward and the other at
Rear H.Q. I found them undaunted by the
magnitude of the demands made on them. That,
through all the vicissitudes of bad roads, and
ports without appliances, ample supplies were
able to keep up with the troops, must be
accounted a fine achievement by these two offi-
cers and all who worked to the same purpose.

10. It would not have been possible to split
the H.Q. into two unless large numbers of male
clerks, signallers, cipher personnel and M.T.
Drivers had been replaced in Rear H.Q.-by
women.

Great credit is due to Lady Sidney Farrar
for raising a F.A.N.Y. unit from local resources
and for the tireless efficiency shown in training
and organising it. The work of these ladies was
invaluable, and in spite of long and arduous
hours always remained excellent.

111. Intelligence.

By the end of January, 1941, the smail In-
telligence Section, which had been formed in
September, 1939, had been expanded into a
G.H.Q. Section complete, with a total strength
of 75 officers and 110 O.Rs. All these, except
ttwo officers, were found from South African,
East African and West African resources.

Information about the enemy was obtained
from many sources. Until Italy declared war,
reasons of policy had prevented employment of
agents in Italian territory, but after June, 1940,
