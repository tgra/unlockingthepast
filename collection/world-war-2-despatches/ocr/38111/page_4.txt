Channel, thirty-six U-Boats were sighted by
Coastal Command in the first four.days of the
assault and twenty-three were attacked. Six
were destroyed and four seriously damaged.
Sixteen of the attacks were at night. Two of
the U-Boats destroyed were sunk on: one sortie
-within 20 minutes by a Liberator of No. 224
Squadron, piloted by Flying Officer, Moore. In
almost every case the enemy fought back
desperately with, his anti-aircraft armament, for
in those four days the U-Boats were|in too much
of.a hurry to be uble to proceed isubmerged.
They inflicted a high proportion of casualties

. On our attacking aircraft, but very few got
through. Prisoners of war from the U-Boats
have told us that the penetration of the
Channel was a nightmare. ‘

1g. After D plus 4 the enemy was forced to
change his tactics. During their sojourn in the
Bay ports almost all the U-boats had been fitted
with the exhaustible air intake (Schnorkel),
and from the fourth day of the assault until the
end of June sightings mainly congjsted of peri-
scopes and ‘‘ Schnorkels ’’ of U-Boats trying to

get through by remaining submerged continu- .

ously and by. relying on ‘‘ Schporkels’’ to
ventilate the boat and charge batteries. The
‘* Schnorkel ”’ is a most difficult target for air-
borne radar, and it cannot be denied that the
‘enemy’s recourse to this cautious method of
approach reduced his losses. At the same time,
however, the effect of remaining submerged
had an adverse effect on the morale of the U-
Boat crews and their achievements were notable
by their absente.
end of June forty-seven sightings of U-Boats
were made by Coastal Command in southern
waters and twenty-four were attacked. During
this period at least one more U-Boat was sunk
by aircraft and two kills were shared with ships

of the Royal Navy,, who were tdking an ever ©

increasing part in the policing of the Channel
and its approaches. In addition, aircraft

- damaged another four U-Boats arid shared with
the Navy in’ damaging a fifth.

20. In July the picture was the same. The
enemy was still trying to get in amongst‘ our
shipping by making the fullest. use of his
schnorkel device. In all, twenty-two sightings
were made and fifteen U-Boats attacked during
this month, of which two were surik ‘and another
damaged, ' .

21. By the end of July there/was no doubt
that the enemy’s threat had been beaten. Only
‘a.small. number of U-Boats had got through to
our shipping lanes, and, in. the three months

from D-Day to the end of August, of the -

.thousands of mefchant ships taking part in
the Channel operations, only nine were sunk by
U;Boat.action. 4 .

. _ 22, Finally, the steady progress of our armies
made it obvious to the enemy. that he would
- soon lose the use of the Bay pdrts. He there-
fore began to evacuate them during August
and to send U-Boats aorthwatd ‘to his Nor-
wegian bases. During the month some ferocious
actions were fought in the Bay of Biscay
almost within sight of land with! U-Boats trying
. to, escape, and ‘six’ were accounted for by
Coastal Command aircraft, three of these being
shared with the Navy: By early September,
the Biscay U-Boat forcé had ‘withdrawn and

was making its passage, underwater nearly all”

the time, to the Norwegian ports.

23. In the whole battle in the North and the
South from’ mid-May to the end of August,
Coastal Command sank twenty-seven U-Boats,
damaged another so badly that when it reached
its base it-was paid off, shared in five more
sunk, and damaged another twenty-nine, in-
cluding two shared with the Royal Navy.

24. In these operations, where skill counted
as much as courage, and where both were in-
dispensable, _we lost thirty-eight anti-U-Boat
aircraft by enemiy action and another twenty-
two through the hazards of maintaining our
patrols in fair weather and-in foul. ‘A high
proportion ,of these aircraft were four-engined
heavies with large crews.

Anti-Shipping Operations P

25. While the U-Boats were being defeated
in the south-west and the north-east, Coastal
Command was also in action against enemy sur-
face forces. Soon after the assault ‘began, the
enemy tried to reinforce his surface craft in the
assault, areas by bringing up ‘three destroyers
from the Gironde. These vessels were attacked
by our aircraft while still south of Brest on 6th
June, but the damage inflicted did ‘not prevent
the enemy from making port. Two days later
the ships.tried to round the Brest Peninsula,
but were brought to action by the Royal Navy.
ig Seetier class destroyer was driven ashore,
the Tjerk Hiddes was sunk, and the second
Seetier was forced back to Brest. The beached
destroyer was later attacked by Beaufighters
with rockets and bombs, and became a total
loss. After this the enemy made no further
attempts. to reinforce his surface craft from the
west, and the only ‘serviceable Seetier and
Elbing destroyers’ were withdrawn to the
Gironde.

26. In the early stages, as was expected, the
enemy operated ‘his light forces on quite a con-
siderable scale against our assault forces in
the assault area. | E-Boats were the main
weapons. Some thirty of these vessels were
based between Boulogne and Cherbourg, but

’ the number was-later reduced by air attack,

by surface action, and by the outstandingly
successful attacks by Bomber Command against

Le Havre and Boulogne. .

.' 29. The ‘operations of Coastal Command

_against these light ‘forces consisted mainly of

continuous anti-shipping patrols in the Channel.

-Albacores, Avengers, Swordfish, Beaufighters

and Wellingtons made a great many attacks,
mostly at night, against E-Boats, R-Boats,
““M’’ class minesweepers and trawlers.
Wellingtons did a great deal of reconnaissance
work, dropping flares and directing naval forces
to their targets. . Results were naturally ex-
tremely difficult to assess, but we know from
prisoners of war that hardly an E-Boat put
to sea without being spotted and attacked from
the air. In the darkness and in the face of
flak from other. vessels it is almost. impossible
to investigate the result of a bombing attack
on..an.E-Boat flotilla,. but there is no doubt,
that the menace of the enemy’s.light forces was
held in check by the. operations of the Royal
Navy and: Coastal Command,

units in the Baltic, . Moreover, with the ex-
ception of one or two. flotillas of -E-Boats, ‘he
never attempted to reinforce the Channel from
the East, in spite of the fact that he had a
