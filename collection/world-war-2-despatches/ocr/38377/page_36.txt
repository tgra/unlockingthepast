comparatively easy prey for enemy aircraft.
Three M.T. ships were hit by bombs and sunk.
The remaining five M.T. ships reached Malta.

30. That these five ships did make their goal
is a magnificent tribute to the resolution shown
by all concerned, and a special word of praise
is due to the gallant Master of the OHIO (Cap-
tain D. W. Mason), to PENN (Lieutenant-
Commander J. H. Swain, R.N.), LEDBURY

SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 AUGUST, 10948

40..During the return passage of H.M.S.
FURIOUS from Operation ‘‘ Bellows,’’ H.M.S.
WOLVERINE, one of her escort, detected,
taramed and sank a U-Boat* in position
37° 18 N., or° 55’ E. at 0050/D.3. There were
no survivors. H.M.S. WOLVERINE severely
damaged her bows and was escorted part of the
way back to Gibraltar by H.M.S. MALCOLM,
who later reinforced ‘H.M.S. NIGERIA’s

oT Rig

screen.

41. H.M.S. NIGERIA was shadowed con- f
tinuously on D.q4 and was attacked by three }
torpedo bomber aircraft at 1515. She success- {
fully combed the tracks and was not further ]
toolested by aircraft.

(Lieutenant-Commander R. P. Hill, R.N.) and
BRAMHAM (Lieutenant E. F. Baines, R.N.),
to the Malta Local Forces, and to the Royal
Air Force based on Malta.

31. Having turned over his charges to the
Malta Escort Force, Rear-Admiral Command-

oA,

ing, roth Cruiser Squadron with Force X less
H.M. Ships PENN, LEDBURY and BRAM-
HAM withdrew at 1600/D.4.

32. H.M.S. NIGERIA and three Hunts had
already started back, as had H.M. Ships
ESKIMO and SOMALI who had been sent by
Rear-Admiral Commanding, oth Cruiser
Squadron to help H.M.S, MANCHESTER.
H.M.S. TARTAR, who had sunk H.M.S.
FORESIGHT at 0955/D.4, was also on her
way back to Gibraltar.

33. Throughout D.4 Force Z continued to
the westward, apparently unobserved by the
enemy, turning to the eastward at 2300/D.4,
when H.M. Ships RODNEY and INDOMI-
TABLE with 5 destroyers were detached to
Gibraltar.

D.5 (14th August).

When 5 miles south of Alboran, at 1644/D.5, /-
she avoided torpedoes fired by a U-Boat. Prior /
to this attack her screen had been reinforced
by four Western Approaches destroyers
despatched by Vice-Admiral Commanding,
North Atlantic.

42. H.M. Ships ESKIMO and SOMALI were
attacked by a JU.88 and a torpedo bomber
aircraft when west of Galita p.m. on D.4,
and a near miss on H.M.S. SOMALI caused
her to lose steam and stop for five minutes.

43- Force Y sailed from Malta at 2030/D.1.
Though aircraft flew over them on D.2, their
Italian deck markings seemed to nonplis the
enemy’s observers. Off Cape Bon on the night
of D.2, Force Y encountered and was fired on
by a darkened Vichy minesweeper and on D.3_
was shadowed occasionally by single aircraft
who remained mystified. No incident occurred
subsequent to noon on D.3 and the force arrived

safely at Gibraltar at 1000/D.5. ‘
General Remarks. ?

34. During D.5 I was uncertain of the posi-
tion of Force X and how it was faring, though

from intercepted manceuvring and radar re- 1

porting signals, it was clear that they were
being subjécted to air attacks to the west
of Galita Island. In fact they were undergoing
severe attention from the enemy’s air forces

but fortunately they came through unharmed.

: 35. With the object of being near at hand if
support was required, Force Z cruised to the
northward of Algiers until about 1500/D.5,
when I was relieved to receive a signal from
RearsAdmiral Commanding, oth Cruiser
Squadron, giving his noon position, course and
speed as 37° 21’ N., 06° 27’ E., 272°, 20 knots.
Course of Force Z was then set to make contact.

36. An Albacore was sent to establish .a
visual link with Force X and at 1800/D.5
Force Z and Force X met and the combined
forces withdrew to Gibraltar, arriving at
1800/ D.6.

37. Of the remainder of the forces at sea,
H.M.S. FURIOUS and screen arrived Gib-
altar at r900/D.3, H.M. Ships NIGERIA,
TARTAR and 3 Hunts at ooro/D.6, and H.M.

Ships ESKIMO and SOMALI at 0530/D.6.

38. Force R cruised in the western basin until
it was certain that they would not be required to
fuel Force X, when they were ordered to return
to Gibraltar, arriving a.m./D.7.

39. H.M. Ships PENN, LEDBURY and
BRAMHAM arrived at Malta with S.S. OHIO
at 0755/D.6. They sailed for Gibraltar at
2030/D.9 and arrived there at 0715 on 2ist
August,

44. Planning and assembly.—It was a great
advantage that the planning could be done at
the Admiralty for the following reasons: —

(a) Early decisions could be obtained and
questions answered, thus saving signals,

(b) Communications were better and there
was less chance of loss of security.

(c)\ General views on policy could be
obtained.

(ad) Experts in all branches were readily
available.

(e) The advice and help of the Naval Staff
was always at hand.

45 Assembling and sailing of ships at Scapa
Flow not only enabled me to discuss the opera-
tion with the majority of Commanding Officers
of ships taking part, but also gave many advan-
tages from the security point of view. The use
of a telephone, fitted with a scrambler, was
invaluable as it enabled many points of detail
to be cleared up, up to the moment, of sailing.
I am sure that the decision to bring NELSON
and RODNEY from Freetown to Scapa was
fully justified.

It was some disadvantage from the co-
operation point of view that INDOMITABLE
and EAGLE and their attendant ships should
‘have had to start from Freetown and Gibraltar
respectively; from the security point of view,
however, this was probably advantageous.
