canvas and chewing gum, X.7 also suffered
some inconveniences due to small boats and
minor war vessels. :

aand September
Phase I

X.7 left the lee of the Brattholm group of
islands at 0045 to commence the penetration of
the known and unknown defences of Kaafiord,
followed an hour later by X.6; neither boat
having made friendly contact during the night.
Operationally such contact was not necessary
and it had not been allowed for in the plan.

At 0340, X.7, first in the field, straightened
up for the entrance through the A/S boom
defence gap at the entrance to Kaafiord- and
by 0400 was through, only to be put deep by
an M.L. outward bound. As a result of this
temporary blindness X.7 got caught in the un-
occupied square of A/T mets, once used to
house LUTZOW but now empty. X.6 following
later, and having inéreasing trouble with her
periscope, dodged a small ferry boat and an
A/S patrol vessel and at 0505 also passed
through the A/S boom gap. "

Meanwhile, life in Kaafiord in general and
TIRPITZ in particular pursued its normal
course. Hands were called, normal A/A
defence and anti-sabotage watch ashore and
afloat were set, the boat-gate in the A/T nets
was opened for boat and tug traffic, and the
hydrophone listening office ceased work, all at
0500. .

Phase II

X.6, suffering from a flooded periscope, went
to 60 feet to strip and clean it, while proceed-
ing by D.R.* towards the western end of the
fiord. On coming to periscope depth again she
found she was so close to NORDMARK ikat
she had to alter course to avoid the mooring
buoy. To add to her difficulties, the periscope
again clouded over and the periscope hoisting
motor brake burnt out resulting in manual con-
trol of the brake being necessary when raising

. ‘or lowering the periscope.

By 0705 X.6 had closed the A/T shore net
defence of TIRPITZ and was through the boat
entrance, and within striking distance sf the
target. .

X.7 having got caught in the unoccupied A/'T
defences in the middle of the fiord spent a busy,
if cautious, hour in getting clear at the expense
of breaking surface, unseen, and putting the
trim pump out of action. The violent action
required to break free of the nets also put the
gyro compass off the board. By o600, having
had another incident with a wire across the
periscope standard, X.7 was clear, though pre-
cariously trimmed at periscope depth, and
headed for the target.

At o710, having decided in favour of passing
under the TIRPITZ A/T net defences, X..7
endeavoured to do so at 75 feet and get caught.

Up to this point no suspicions had been
aroused in TIRPITZ and normal harbour
routine was in progress. .

Phase II

submarine-like object ’’ there was a five minute
delay passing the information on to higher
authority as it was thought that the object
sighted might be a porpoise.

Five minutes later, X.6 in backing and filling
to get clear of the ground and to get pointed

-in the nght direction to close TIRPITZ,

again broke surface about 80 yards abeam of
TIRPITZ and was sighted and correctly
identified.

X.6 by this time had no gyro compass, as

>this had been put out of action by the ground-

ing and subsequent violent angles on the boat,
and the periscope was almost compietely flooded.
She was therefore taken blindly in what was
imagined to be the target’s direction, hoping
to fix her position by the shadow of the battle-
ship.

After five minutes X.6 got caught in an
obstruction which she took to be the A/T net
on the far (starboard) side of TIRPITZ but
which was probably something hanging down
either from TIRPITZ or onc of the craft along-
side. Lieutenant Cameron straightened his craft
up, manoeuvred clear of the obstruction, and
surfaced close on the port bow of TIRPITZ
when a brisk fire from small arms and hand
grenades was opened on the submarine. The
submarine was too close to the ship for any
of the heavy A/A or main armament to hear.

Reahsing that escape was hopeless, Cameron
destroyed the most secret equipment, backed
his craft down until the stern was scraping TIR-
PITZ hull abreast ‘‘B”’ turret, released his
charges and scuttled the craft. X.6 started to
sink as a power boat from TIRPITZ came
alongside, picked off the crew of four and
vainly attempted to take X.6 in tow, but X.6
followed her explosives to the bottom.

On board TIRPITZ and in Kaafiord the
alarm had now been properly raised, and it is
clear from the entries in the battleship’s log
that complete surprise had been achieved by our
forces.

Although the first sighting had been made
at about 0707 (a note in the log states that times
between 0705 and 0730 are inaccurate) it was
not until 0720 that the order was given to close
watertight doors, and the A/A guns’ crews
closed up. A power boat “‘ manned by one
officer and equipped with hand grenades ”’ left
the ship at about 0715, and was the one which
took off the crew of X.6, having used her hand
grenades, happily to no effect.

“ Action stations’? was sounded, steam
raised and the ship was prepared for sea, in
order to get her outside the nets. This order
was apparently not given until 0736, when
watertight doors were reported closed. Divers
were ordered to go down to examine the hull for
limpet mines* but it appears that some form
of charge dropped under the ship was also ex-
pected, as the extract from the log recording
the preparations for sea,reads “‘in order to
leave the net enclosure if possible before the
time-fuzed mines detonate ’’.

Destroyers in the fiord had also raised steam,

and were requesting depth charges.

While TIRPITZ was making up her mind
howy,,to deal with the situation, X.7, so far un-
seem but stuck in the nets ahead of TIRPITZ,
