However, from 28th September to 16th November, a total of 3,000 tons was shipped to Samos and of 480 tons to Leros, including civilian foodstuffs."

The following night TRUCULENT again closed Staalet Point to within 24 miles, but the weather was so bad that it was considered that it would have been impossible to have recovered any X-craft or her crew.
