The enemy was certainly taken by surprise: his forces were actually in process of taking up fresh dispositions for an attack on Tobruk due to take place on the 23rd November. On the igth what appeared to be the bulk of the German armoured divisions moved south from the coastal area, where they had been lying, and engaged the 4th and 22nd Armoured Brigades a few miles west of Sidi Omar."

            "description": "This shifting of the balance of strength between the opposing armoured forces produced a most critical situation and led General Cunningham to represent to me that a continuation of our offensive might result in the annihilation of our tank force, and so endanger the safety of Egypt. I visited General Cunningham at his advanced headquarters on the 23rd November and told him to continue to press the offensive against the enemy. He loyally gave effect to these orders; but on my return to Cairo on the 25th, I most reluctantly decided that I must relieve him of his command, as I had come to the conclusion, after long. and anxious consideration, that he was unduly influenced by the threat of an enemy counterstroke against his communications. I therefore replaced him on the 26th November by Major-General N. M. Ritchie."

On the 23rd November they stormed Point 175 on the ridge only five miles west of Sidi Rezegh. This occurred a few hours before the mishap to the 5th South African Infantry Brigade. Indeed one of the New Zealand battalions, instructed to make contact with the 30th Corps, arrived just east of the South African leaguer when some of the enemy tanks which had overrun it were emerging. Fortunately the battalion was able to beat them off and returned safely to its brigade when the 3oth Corps retired."

In response to an urgent request from General Cunningham I flew to his advanced headquarters near Maddalena, accompanied by Air Chief Marshal Tedder. Further news had come in by the time we arrived, and I learned of the disorganisation of the 4th Armoured Brigade and of the disaster which had overtaken the 5th South African Infantry Brigade."
