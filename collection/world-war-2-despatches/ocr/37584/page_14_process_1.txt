1. His Majesty's Government have placed you in command of all British and French troops operating in Central Scandinavia, excluding any which may be operating in the Narvik area or based on Narvik. These latter will continue to be commanded by MajorGeneral Mackesy under the orders of Lord Cork and Orrery.

2. The policy of His Majesty's Government is ultimately to evacuate Central Norway.

3. Your object, therefore, will be to evacuate your troops from Central Norway.

His Majesty's Government do not wish to impose any delay upon your operations which would be conanteat with the military security of your force. They hope, however, that it will be militarily possible to postpone evacuation until after the capture of Narvik.

The final decision as to when the evacuation ought to take place rests with you. The final withdrawal and re-embarkation, however. is a joint operation, for which Admiral............ is appointed Naval Commander and Air Marshal Air Commander. The actual dates, times and places are the joint responsibility of yourself, the Naval Commander and the Air Commander.
