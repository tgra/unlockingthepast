SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 4 MARCH, 1948

5 Commando to capture the beaches, embark-
ing them with minimum transport in the four
assault ships semi-permanenily allotted to the
Expeditionary Force for training and opera-
+tional purposes; secondly, by the-use of 17
Infantry Brgade Group, already embarked
close stowed in convoy WS 17, as the second
bngade; thirdly by the immediate acceptance
by 29 Independent Brigade of the modified
“Bonus ’’ plan for the assault forces. If the
operation was postponed after sailing, a bgade
group fronr 2 Division in WS 18 would take the
place of 17 Infantry Brigade Group.

This plan had certain serious disadvantages.
The first was that Force H.Q , 29 Independent
Brigade, 5 Commando, and Force troops were
reduced to hat could be put in the four
assault ships. Examination of the problem
showed that this was only possible by making
severe reductions in the personnel and even
severer reductions in vehicles previously con-
sidered essential. The second disadvantage was
that 17 Infantry Brigade Group had no experi-
ence or trairing in combined operations, and its
personnel and vehicles had been embarked as for
a normal WS convoy and not for an assault
landing. Neither time nor shipping was avail-
able to rectify this.

5. Embarkation of vehicles and stores in the
four assault ships was to commence on 18th
March, and all planning had to be completed
to this schedule. After examination of the new
intelligence available, which did not as yet
include the air photographs, we decided that
our previous plans were sound and could be
carried out with the reduced forces available.
On the military side, new topographical in-
formation suggested that the beaches were far
better than was originally reported, The post-
Pponement of the operation from April to May
placed it at the beginning of the dry season,
which considerably reduced anticipated diffi-
culties of advance along the only. very doubt-
ful, road which was available. Thanks to this
‘and ‘‘ Bonus ’’ Captain Garnons-Wilhams and
myself were able to meet Brigadier Festing and
Brigadier G. W. B. Tarleton, commanding 29
Independent Brigade and 17 Infantry Brigade
respectively, and my advisers and heads of ser-
vices, all of whom arrived in London on the
morning of 15th March, with a completed out-
line-plan and an outline draft of the Force
operation order.

From the 15th March to r9th March, Captain
Gamons-Williams, Brigadier [esting and
myself with our staffs were engaged in close
co-operation in preparing the necessary plans
for loading the ships and completing necessary
preparations for the Force to leave the United
Kingdom. .

6. A difficult combined problem was to decide
in detail the composition of the naval and
military forces to be embarked in the four
assault ships; H.M.S. Keren and Karanja,
M.Vs. Winchester Castle and Sobieski. To
these were to be added H.M.S. Royal Ulster-
man and Bachaquero. These two ships could
not meet the convoy until arrival at Durban,
and any troops and vehicles required to make
the assault from them had either to be embarked
in the four assault ships or be taken from those
units already embarked with 17 Infantry
Brigade Group, The four assault ships could
take an approximate total of 323 officers, 4,753
O.Rs. and 115 vehicles. Of these 76 officers,

1607
499 O.Rs., were finally allotted to Force H.Q.
and Force troops including the Docks Operating
Company: 38 officers, 328 O.Rs. to Royal
Navy: leaving 209 officers, 3,926 O.Rs. for the
fighting troops of the assault force. It must be
realised that this small allotment of H Q. and
Force troops had to command and administer
not only the assault force, but also 17 Infantry
Brigade Group, and later the 13 Infantry
Brigade Group which was to be added to the
Force. In addition they were to be faced with
the problems of the control and consolidation of
the captured base.

I had also, in this short planning period, to
hand over the command of the Royal Marine
Division. It was a great disappointment to the
two Royal Marine Brigades that they were not
employed on this operation, from which they
were excluded by the need for extreme speed
in embarkation and by the chance disposition
of the brigades when the operation was ordered.
agth Brigade were quite fortuitously embarked
in the assault ships for exercises and these
assault ships were then actually detailed for the
operation.

7. On 17th March I met Major-General
H, P. M. Berney-Ficklin, commanding 5
Division from which 17 Infantry Brigade Group
was to be taken. On the 18th March, I was
interviewed by the Chiefs of Staff on my plans
for the operation and on 19th March I met the
Prime Minister. On the evening of the same
day I left for my H.Q. at Melrose, and on 21st
March embarked nm M.V_ Wenchester Castle
which sailed on the 23rd March. On the 22nd
March I saw Lieutenant-General E. C.: A.
Schreiber, commanding the Expeditionary
Force which I was now leaving. . 1 thanked
him for the great assistance that his staff had
given to Force 121, ahd handed over 101 and
102 RM. Brigades to his direct command.

During this brief and very fully occupied
planning and embarkation period, very great
assistance was given to us all by HQ Ex-
peditionary Force. Without it the expedition
could not have sailed, in the time and the'state
of preparation it-did. I was also assisted by
those branches of the War Office concerned and
by the Adviser of Combined Operations and his
staff.

The speed with which the revised operation
was mounted was only possible because of the
experience that all the staffs, advisers and ser-
vices concerned had gained in planning pre-
vious projects, and carrying out exercises based
on them,

8. Captain Garnons-Williams, Brigadier

Festing and myself with limited staffs had em-
barked in M.V Winchester Castle. We were
therefore able to continue our study of the
operation in constant consultation. Owing to
the short planning period, detailed study of the
operation, ‘other than that required for em-
barkation and loading, had not been possible
for Brigadier Festing and his staff. Immedi-
ately before sailing the air photographs of the
beach area had been received on board MV.

graphs stopped a few miles short of Antsirane
