In the initial stages, until Cos fell, this plan was darried out,. and small stores-ships sailed direct from Egypt and Palestine to Castelrosso, Leros and Cos; there the cargo was transhipped for distribution throughout the islands by caique and other small craft. Arrangements were also made for maintaining Cos by air, but this method was only used to meet urgent demands which could not be satisfied in time by sea.

            "description": "The raids were launched on the night of 13th September. At Tobruk the plan was to capture the port by a combined operation from two sides, by sea and overland, and hold it long enough to allow the destrisction of the stored fuel and hasty demolition of the port. The small overland force successfully carried out its part of the operation but very few members of the two seaborne forces managed to land and the attack was a failure. The attack on Benghazi was to be carried out by a small motorized column from Kufra, over five hundred miles to the south. It reached. its destination successfully but a last-minute alteration in its plans, based on unreliable information, caused an abandonment of the operation after an attack had been made on a part of the defences which was on the alert. A third force attacked Gialo on the night of 14th September, mainly in order to cover the retirement of the column raiding Benghazi but also in the hope of holding it for a short while as a base for future operations. The oasis was strongly held and it was impossible to capture it but the operation served its purpose in that the Benghazi force was able to retire urimolested by the Gialo gartison. A diversionary raid on Barce was completely successful. From the material point of view the raids had been a failure and our losses had been heavy but it is possible that they had o 3 How Admiral Sir Henry Harwood, KCB,"
