SUPPLEMENT: to tae LONDON GAZETTE, 11 FEBRUARY, 1948

charge to fire 2 hours after release. It was
released at 1655Z, as was verified by the Com-
manding Officer. At 1840Z—1} hours after
telease—by which time, from log readings and
revolutions taken by SEANYMPH, X.8 was

distant-34 miles from the position of release, the‘

charge detonated astern with tremendous force.
This caused such damage to X.8 as to flood the
“wet and *’ compartment, distorting the
doors to this compartment, fracturing pipes,
and generally causing such damage to the craft
that she was no longer capable of diving. The
explosion also caused a number of lights to be
broken in SEANYMPH.

4g. It is not clear why the second explosion
caused such damage at an apparent range of
3% miles while the first explosion, only 1,000
yards away, did none. Both charges had been
dropped in approximately the same depth of
water (180 fathoms). It may be that only partial
detonation occurred in the first charge, which
had been set to “‘ safe.’’ Whatever the reason
the force of the second explosion would appear
to have illustrated the efficiency of the charges.
I find it hard to believe that the explosion
was in fact 3} miles away; but whatever the
horizontal range was, there is no doubt about
the depth of water, so that in any event the
result of the explosion was indeed remarkable.

50. The 17th September was the first day
(D-—3) on which the transfer of crews was to
take place if the weather permitted; but the
weather had deteriorated and by the evening the
wind was from the south-west, force 4, with a
sea and swell of 4-5, and it was too rough to
make the change-over,

5r The P.R. on the 15th September had
shown no change in the disposition of the
targets, and submarines were so informed by
signal on 17th September, which also confizmed
the Target Plan as No. 4. Further information
on the nets round LUTZOW and the A/S* net
across Langfiord was also passed by signal this
day,
18th September.

52. X.8 informed SEANYMPH at daylight
of the full particulars of her damage; and as
she could now serve no useful purpose in the
operation and, if sighted on the surface, might
compromise it, the Commanding Officer,
H.M.S. SEANYMPH, decided to embark her
crew and scuttle her. In anticipation of the
possibility of just such a situation, Admiral
(Submarines) had transmitted a signal on 16th
September, informing the Commanding Officer,
H.MS SEANYMPH, that if he considered it
necessary in the interests of the general security
of the operation as a whole to scuttle X.8, such
action would have his full approval.

53. By 0345Z the crew had been embarked
from X.8 and the craft sunk in position
71° 41.5’ N. 18° 11’ E.

54 I consider that the Commanding Officer
of: X.8 acted correctly in releasing the side

charges when it became apparent that they were .

flooded, and that the Commanding Officer.
H.M.S. SEANYMPH’s decision to sink X.8,
to avoid compromising the operation, was the
correct one.

55. After sinking X.8, SEANYMPH_ Be
ceeded to the north of 73° North to repoffby

56. At 0555 SYRTIS, having transmitted the
signal reporting the loss of X.9, set course for
her patrol area. SYRTIS’s signal was never
received, and it was not until the 3rd October,
when = Admiral (Submarines) received!
SYRTIS’s signal timed 2001A/and, that is was
known that X.9 had broken adrift from her tow
and had not been seen since 16th September, -
and therefore had not taken part in the attack.

57. Weather conditions had improved slightly
by dusk on the x8th, and at 2015Z
STUBBORN, 1n position 70° 57’ N. 20° 35’ E.,
decided to transfer the operational crew to X.7.
The change-over was successfully completed by
2124Z. The remaining submarines with X-
craft in tow—TRUCULENT with X.6,
THRASHER with X.5 and SCEPTRE with
X.ro—decided that the weather was still too
bad to effect the transfer.

58. at 2128Z STUBBORN, on going ahead
after changing over the crews, parted her tow.
The main tow had already parted, on the 15th
September, and with the auxiliary tow also
parted, it was necessary to use a 2}-inch wire
spring. Some difficulty was experienced in
passing this, but at 2345Z STUBBORN went
ahead, only to find that the pin of the screw
shackle of X.7’s end of the tow had come
adnft and the tow had to be passed afresh.
It was not until or25Z on 19th September that
STUBBORN was able to go ahead with X 7
in tow.

19th September.

59 At 0855 on rgth September, Admiral
(Submarines) received SEANYMPH'’s signal
reporting the scuttling of X.8 and that she was
herself returning to Lerwick. Although SEA-
NYMPH now had no X-craft to recover, I
decided she could still assisf¥in the recovery of
other craft or might be required to proceed on
patrol to intercept enemy forces should they
be ‘‘ flushed ’’ by the X-craft attack and try
to escape to the southward. SEANYMPH was
therefore ordered to patrol in the vicinity of
position 71° 25’ N. 17° 16’ E., until the 21st
September, when she was to proceed to her
patrol sector to assist in the recovery of
X-craft. I decided not to inform the other sub-
marines taking part that X8 had been
scuttled, as to do so might have had a slightly
dampening effect, nor to alter the Target Plan
though it meant that LUTZOW (who was the
target for X.8) would not be attacked

60. SCEPTRE and SYRTIS made their
landfalls from the vicinity of their ordered land-
fall positions during the day and THRASHER,
TRUCULENT and SCEPTRE (the weather
having moderated since the previous evening)
all successfully transferred their crews after
dark. .

6x. At 1843Z SYRTIS from position
91° 03’ 40” N. 22° 13’ E. sighted a submarine
bearing 308°, 2 to 3 miles, which dived five
minutes later. From an analysis of track
charts and other patrol reports, this was prob-
ably a U-boat.

20th September: Day D.

62. The position now was that the operational
crews of the four X-craft still remaining had all
been transferred successfully. TRUCULENT, .
THRASHER, SCEPTRE and SYRTIS—the
latter with no X-craft—had all made successful
landfalls and were in their patrol sectors.
STUBBORN, wha.had been delayed by parting
