The actual surrender of the North Ger- man Ports began on 26th April when a Naval Officer of 30 Advance Unit (the naval unit specially formed tor the collection of intel- ligence) reached the Bremen City Hall at 1030 and accepted the surrender of the city from the acting Bergermeister, U.S. Naval Task Force 126 designated for this port was already on the Continent and the Commander of this force (Rear-Admiral A. G. Robinson, U.S.N.), made a preliminary reconnaissance on the 27th April. He found that there was no apparent damage to docks, quays and other harbour installations but that warehouses were totally destroyed and prisoners-of-war stated that many mines had been sown in the enclosed basins and the ad- jacent river. The capacity of the port\u2019 was re- stricted to some extent by sunken ships and in fact no war or merchant ships were found afloat."

We had, however, caused the enemy to concentrate almost all his mobile reserves zgainst this sector, and had iflicted heavy losses on him. It was a good preparation for the final blow. On 25th April the enemy with- drew from the salient now protruding south of the Bou Arada\u2014Pont du Fahs road, followed up by XIX Corps. The latter were now within striking distance of the Pont du Fahs defile, having cleared Gebel Fkirine on 26th April. Tank battles continued on g Corps front all day of the 26th but that evening 6 Armoured Division was withdrawn into Army reserve."

The main mili- tary objective at this time was Dessie which our troops were approaching from the North and South. The main effort of the S.A.A.F. at this stage was, therefore, against objectives in that area, bombing and machine-gun attacks being made by S.A.A.F. Battles, J.U.86\u2019s and Hurricanes on enemy troops and M.T., and against Combolcia (Dessie) aerodrome. Our forces advancing from the South captured Dessie on the 26th April but the enemy still retained his positions at Amba Alagi, \u2018holding up our advance on Dessie from the North."

            "description": "6. During 26th April the situation at Namsos did not materially alter. From reports re- ceived from the South however it became in- creasingly obvious that in the face of artillery and mortar fire and incessant bombing, to none of which the Allied troops could effectively teply, the German advance could not be _ stopped. General Paget stated it as his opinion that his troops could not endure for more than four days unless adequate air sup- port was forthcoming, During the whole of this day the bombing of Andalsnes and Namsos continued and the possibility of these ports being rendered inoperative as bases had to be faced. During the afternoon I became aware of the previous day\u2019s failure of the Gladiators to operate from a shorebased aerodrome, and it then became evident to me that the chances of our getting any air support which would enable us in any way to compete with the German air menace had practically vanished. I was convinced that evacuation would there- fore be necessary. I reported my views ver- bally to the C.1.G.S. who informed me that the Chiefs of Staff had that morming been considering the possibility of re-instituting a modified operation for the direct attack on Trondheim, and had come to the conclusion that it would take some ten days to mount. I understood from him that, in view of the situation, the Chiefs of Staff were not prepared to recommend this course to the Government as they doubted, as I did, whether the forces in Southern Norway could hold on long enough to enable the operation to be put into effect."

It had been pos- sible before leaving England to embark one G.S.O.2 with brigade H.Q. and one Assistant Military Landing Officer (A.M.L.O.) in each ship of 17 Infantry Brigade Group, all ex- perienced in Comb:ned Operations training. These officers had been able to do the valu- able work in assisting this brigade group to prepare itself for the operation. In addi- tion to this a few officers from 29 In- dependent Brigade were exchanged with offi- cers of 17 Infantry Brigade for the voyage from Freetown to Durban and were thus able to pass on-their experience gained in combined exercises. I was therefore by now assured that 17 Infantry Brigade Group could land over the beaches and play a . valuable part in the operation, especially from D2 onwards, if enemy resistance made this necessary. 13 Infantry Brigade Group was a very different matter. . Their personnel ships only arrived at Durban on 26th April when I met Brigadier V. C. Russell, the brigade commander for the first time. I was able to do litile beyond issuing them with wmtten operational and administrative orders and instructions, and _ discussing potential situations and problems with Brigadier Russell."

Brigade and it then appeared likely that Maraventano would surrender, but in spite of being harassed by his pursuers, hampered by the lack of transport and food, and bur- dened with many sick and wounded, he stub- bornly continued his arduous trek towards Uorro Tlu where he apparently decided to remain as he considered the country suitable for defence and shelter, and food was available. On 14th May, however, there were indications that Maraventano was in on the move, this time in the direction of Debre Sina (Agibar). A small force was sent off at speed to take and hold the fort at Uoghidi-which commanded. the enemy line of retreat. This fort was success- fully occupied and its Banda garrison joined our forces. On 17th May our main force had followed up and gained contact with the enemy rearguard travelling over extremely difficult country."

However, we were not quick enough, and a strong enemy anti-tank gun screen in the broken country north-east and north of the Sebkret el Kourzia and near Djebel Kournine prevented eventually all further advance, despite many attempts. The enemy withdrew from the Seba Argout position opposite tthe right of 46 Division. Seeing that no further progress was likely, on 26th April I ordered 9 Corps to stand fast and to return 6 Armoured Division and 46 Division (less one Infantry Brigade Group) to Army Reserve. This attack by 9 Corps only just failed to achieve its object. It did, however, inflict severe tank losses on the enemy, drew his armoured reserves to the south and (based on subsequent statements by captured senior officers) seriously frightened him. It also had the effect of leaving the enemy opposite 19 Corps in a pronounced salient, from which they hurriedly withdrew on 25th April. Our losses were not severe."

The situation in 20 Indian Division\u2019s area on the 26th April was as follows. 80 Brigade in the Magwe area had pushed patrols across the river, which reported enemy motor transport moving west out of Minbu. Magwe itself was being heavily shelled from the west side of the Irrawaddy. 100 Brigade was pass- ing through 32 Brigade on the road leading from Satthwa to Allanmyo. After clearing opposition 26 miles north of Allanmyo on the 27th, 100 Brigade again made contact just north of the town. Allanmyo fell the following day, after 36 hours fighting, and we captured five guns. Meanwhile, 80 Brigade, advancing south from Magwe, was destroying many par- ties of the enemy who were trying to cross the river from the right bank and escape east- wards. At Allanmyo, 100 Brigade were 252 miles from Rangoon on the 28th April. By the 2nd May, breaking through all enemy attempts to stop it, it had advanced a further 40 miles and captured the great river port (now in ruins) of Prome, the eastern terminus of the road from Taungup. The last escape route of the rem- nants of the Japanese forces in South Arakan was now blocked."

The resistance en- countered was reported as \u201cincreasingly dis- organized \u201d and many casualties were inflicted ; also three locomotives were captured, together with rolling stock loaded with rations. On the 27th April, the armoured column met deter- mined opposition at a village near Milestone 68 and fighting continued throughout the day, Japanese suicide parties, who attempted to destroy our tanks with pole-charges, having to be eliminated. 17 Indian Division had passed through 5 Indian Division on the 26th and was busy mopping up and repairing crossings be- hind the armoured column. Five bridges south of Nyaunglebin had been destroyed by the enemy and another washed away by a flooded chaung. Valentine +bridge-layer tanks had enabled our armour to cross, but our lorried infantry was temporarily held up pending the arrival of Bailey bridging."

The next week was spent in mopping up scattered parties of the enemy in the vicinity; on the 29th April, for example, 200 Japanese were surrounded and killed just south-west of the Lewe airfield, and a further 150 ten miles south-west of Toungoo.
