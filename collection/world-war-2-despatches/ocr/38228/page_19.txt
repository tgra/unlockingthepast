SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 1: MARCH, 10948

The companies apparently withdrew for the
night with the intention of attacking the next
day. Reports had been received that further
enemy forces were coming down the river and
there is little doubt that they were correct. The
following day the two compames supported by
a company of the 3 Burma Rifles (the two com-
panys of this Battalion having been transferred
from Rangoon) advanced again to the attack.
It is hard to get a clear picture but the attack
failed and meanwhile the Japanese had worked
round the flanks and ambushed the transport.
For the time being the force was broken up
into small parties, most of whom eventually
made their way back to Moulmein through the
jungle. .

It should be mentioned here that the 6 Burma
Rifles was a newly raised Battalion which had
had no opportunity for carrying out higher
training in any form, and in the absence of any
definitely appointed commander the action of
these three companies was probably not too well
planned or directed.

During the next two days a good deal of use-
ful information was forwarded to Tavoy re-
garding the movements of Japanese troops by
men of the Tenasserim Battalion and by mine
managers and so on. In some cases these
reports were passed through by telephone after
the Japanese had passed by.

However, early on the morning of the roth
the enemy appeared near the,Tavoy aerodrome
and commenced to attack it. At first the detach-
ment of the Kokine Battalion The Burma
Frontier Force put up a spirited defence but
were eventually forced to withdraw and the
aerodrome was lost.

The remainder of the troops in Tavoy now
completely disintegrated. The enemy had
established himself astride the road leading to
Ye and most of the troops eventually found
their way back to Moulmein moving in‘small
parties through the jungle.

In these operations round Tavoy, parties of
the Tenasserim Battalion B.A.F. did excellent
work under their officers in blowing up bridges
and roads and many of them remained behind
for long periods after the other troops had left,
eventually getting back through the jungle or
by boat and bringing with them much useful
information.

71. Southern Tenasserim. .Before recording
the main operations which started at Myawaddy
and ended at the River Sittang it is convenient
to dispose of the remaining event in Southern
Tenassetim.

The Japanese were in-occupation of Victoria
Point and it was known that patrols were work-
ing up towards Mergui. With the possibility
of Tavoy falling into the hands of the enemy
Mergui would be in a very precarious position.
Consequently on the 18th January, it was
decided, during my absence in Kengtung, to
evacuate Mergui while there was yet time and
to transfer the troops to Tavoy and to make
every endeavour to hold the aerodrome at that
place. I confirmed these orders on my return.

Before this move could be completed Tavoy
had fallen, so the garrison and civil officials,
etc., were evacuated direct by ‘sea to, Rangoon
where the last parties arrived on the 24th
January.

72. Effect of Operations. The results of the
action at Tavoy were unfortunate. It had
caused the withdrawal from Mergui and 4 is

possible that in the light of after events that it
might have been wiser to hold on to Mergui
even if the eventual withdrawal of the garrison
or part of it were thereby prejudiced. Its re-

- tention would have enabled our air forces, small

as they were, to have carried out effective
bombing attacks along the L of C supplying
the enemy’s forces in Malaya. It should’ be
remembered, however, that at the time the
plans were made our air forces available for this
purpose were practically nil and that if the plan
actually made had succeeded it might have en-
sured the retention of Tavoy for a considerable
period.

Another and perhaps more serious effect of
the operation at Tavoy was that the units of
the Burma Rifles involved suffered a serious
loss of morale from which they did not entirely
recover. The enemy received a corresponding
encouragement to undertake similar enterprises
in future.

73. Operations in Northern Tenasserim. Be-
fore dealing with the operations in Northern
Tenasserim it is desirable to draw attention to
the fact that nearly all the fighting took place
in dense jungle for which form of warfare the
Japanese were especially trained while our
troops were not. Communications were very
limited and in the jungle runners ‘had to be
almost entirely relied upon.

The mobility of the Japanese brought home
the fact that our troops had far too much
baggage and reserves of all sorts with them
which often in the end were either lost or had
to be destroyed.

Throughout the operations leading up to the
Battle of the Sittang I had constantly in mind
the necessity for fighting as far forward as pos-
sible so as to have room in which to deploy
the expected reinforcements. I therefore took
every unit I could from elsewhere, including
1 Burma Division, to strengthen our forces on
this front. This involved taking considerable
risks in the Southern Shan States, on the
Karenni front and in Rangoon. There was also
an internal security problem that might become
critical at any time.

74. First Japanese Attack. Active operations
on a larger scale commenced on the 2oth
January when 1,000 Japanese troops, reported
to be Thais but probably Japanese, attacked
the post of the 1/7 G.R. at milestone 48 on
the Myawaddy road. Other positions were
heavily bombed and machine gunned at in-
tervals throughout the day. There was every
indication that a large scale attack was about
to take place.

The following morning the attack developed
as expected and most of the forward troops
were forced out of their positions.

By midday the enemy were severely press-
ing the main position of the 16 Indian
Infantry Brigade about Kawkareik. As they
appeared to be in considerable strength (it was
later estimated from the information that be-
came available that there were about 2,500
enemy troops in the initial attack) and no re-
inforcements or reserves were available, it was
possible that if 16 Indian Infantry Brigade
tried to fight it out on this position it might be
overwhelmed. Orders were therefore issued
that this Brigade was not to get so involved as
