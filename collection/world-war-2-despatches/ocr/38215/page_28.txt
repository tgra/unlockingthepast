to Kuala Krai and thence out of the State, and
plans for the denial of sea and river cra{t to
the enemy were put into effect. The few re-
maining Japanese civilians were rounded up for
internment. Many of the Japanese civilians
had left before the outbreak of war. The Sultan
of Kelantan and his household left for his resi-
dence near Kuala Krai. The few Asiatic
civilians who wished to leave did so under
control and there was no refugee problem.

147. During the night 8th-gth Deceraber
heavy fighting went on at the Kota Bharu
aerodrome. At dawn the Japanese put m a
heavy attack astride the aerodrome road and
the Commander, Kelantan Force, decided to
withdraw to a position with a good held of fire
South of Kota Bharu. Eventually the hne was
stabilized at the new position and a large num-
ber of troops who had been cut off in the with-
drawal rejoined their units. In the afternoon
the 4/19 Hyderabad Regt. arrived from ‘the
Command Reserve and was ordered to take up
a position some 12 mules south of Kota Bharu
covering the camp at Chondong In the mean-
time, the troops in the north half of the right
sector of the beach defences had been ordered
back from the beaches to cover the road Kota
Bharu—-Pasir Puteh. The troops on the roain
road were withdrawn through the Hyderabads
and night positions were established north o
Chongdong. *

148. On the roth December units were re-
organized The strength of each of the
battalions which had been heavily engaged was
now up to 600 or more. As so often happened
later in the campaign our casualties did not
prove to be so heavy as at first reported.
Sever attacks made by the enemy were beaten
off.

149. Having in view the threat to his com-
munications should the enemy make fresh Jand-
ings further south on the coast of Kelantan, the
Commander, Kelantan Force, decided on the
morning of the 11th December to give up the
Gong Kedah and Machang aerodromes, which
were no longer required by our Air Force, and
to concentrate his force south of Machang to
cover his communications. This movement was
carried out during the day and a good position
occupied. Unfortunately the runways at both
the Gong Kedah and Machang aerodromes had
to be left intact, for at neither had the demoli-
tion arrangements been completed. Orders
wete given for the demolition of the Guillemard
Bridge over the Kelantan River, the longest
railway bridge in Malaya.

Information was received that the Japanese
had on the roth December landed another force
at Besut in South Kelantan.

150. The Kuantan Front —On the oth
December Japanese aircraft attacked the
Kuantan aerodrome They were engaged by
small arms fire, there being no anti-aircraft
guns available for the defence of this aero-
drome. In the afternoon the aerodrome was
abandoned as being unserviceable  Subse-
quently the greater part of the aerodrome was
cratered by Army engineers, one runway only
being left for emergency use.

Early on the night oth-roth December re-
ports were received from the northern part of
the beach defences that enemy ships were
approaching the beaches. Defensive fire was
opened and spread southwards and at about
0400 hrs torpedobombers attacked three ships

off this coast. No landing took place but subse-
quently some boats with Japanese equipment
were found on the beach south of Kuantan.
This incident had a great influence on the move-
ments of the ‘‘ Prince of Wales’’ and
“* Repulse ’’ which will be recorded later.

151. Naval Operatwus.—In accordance with
pre-war plans, submarines of the Royal
Netherlands Navy operated off the east coast
of Malaya and in the approaches to the Gulf
of Thailand during this period They reported
sinking 4 Japanese transports off Patani on the
12th December, and a merchant ship and a
laden oil tanker off Kota Bharu on the 12th
and 13th December.

Towards dark on the 8th December, Admiral
Sir Tom Phillips put to sea with the battleship
“Prnnce of Wales’’ and the battlecruiser
“* Repulse’ to attack the Japanese ships in the
Gulf of Thailand. They were escorted by 4
destroyers. The decision to take the fleet to
sea was made by the Commander-in-Chief,
Eastern Fleet, after discussing the situation
with the Commander-in-Chief, Far East. .

On the evening of the oth December the
British Fleet was sighted by a Japanese sub-
marine and also by Japanese reconnaissance
aircraft. The Japanese air striking cforces,
which were being held in readiness, probably in
South Indo-China, for this purpose, set-off for
a mght attack on the Fleet but ran into thick
weather and were forced to return to their base.

The Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Fleet,
realising from his having sighted Japanese air-
craft that his movements had been seen, and
that the element of surprise had been lost, de-
cided to abandon the project and return to
Singapore. During the night gth-roth Decem-
ber, however, he was informed by his shore
Headquarters at Singapore that a landing had
‘been reported at Kuantan. Reconnaissance
aircraft were flown off and the Fleet closed the
shore in order to clear up the situation before
returning to Singapore. Shortly after day-
kght the Fleet was again located by Japanese
reconnaissance aircraft and their striking force
was again despatched. At about 1715 it
attacked the “Prince of Wales’’ and
“* Repulse’ when about 60 miles off Kuantan,
and by 1320 both these ships had been sunk.
Fighter aircraft from Singapore were despatched
as soon as the attack on the ships was re-
ported, but only arrived in time to see them go
down, 2,185 survivors were picked up by the
destroyers and brought to Singapore. The
Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Fleet, was lost
and was succeeded by Vice-Admiral Sir
Geoffrey Layton

With the sinking of these two ships the
Japanese again obtained undisputed control of
the sea communications east of Malaya and the
whole of the east coast became exposed to
attack.

I wish to pay tribute to the gallant manner
in which the C.-inC. Eastern Fleet en-
deavoured to assist the land and air forces by
attacking the enemy’s sea communications.

152. Air Operations.—Early on the 9gth
December our Air Force attacked targets in the
Singora area. Owing to lack of fighter support
5 out of 11 of our aircraft were lost. During
the morning Alor Star aerodrome was again
heavily bombed and was evacuated later in the
day, the buildings being set on fire. The sound
of thé explosions and the sight of the burning
