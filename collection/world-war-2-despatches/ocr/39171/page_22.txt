(6) The physical standard of young soldiers
in the Indian Army has improved during the
period under review, particularly in combatant
units.

164. The Army Pathological Service suffers,
in this Theatre, from the lack of laboratories.
The importance of accurate laboratory
diagnosis requires no stressing.

165. Dental facilities are altogether in-
adequate. The accepted ratio of dental officers
to troops is one per 1,000 for British and one
per 10,000 for Indian. The present ratio is
one per 7,000 and 30,000 respectively.

166. The present standard of training of
medical personnel in this Theatre does not
compare altogether favourably’ with that in
others, but, taking into consideration the ex-
pansion which the Medical Services have under-

gone, and the acute shortage of medical officers _

in India, it is, J am sure, as good as can be
expected. Training is, I know, continuous and
intensive in the India Command and the situa-
tion is improving.

167. The supply of medical stores, including
drugs, has been most satisfactory. The con-
sumption of mepacrine in Fourteenth Army as
a malaria suppressive has reached twelve
million tablets a month.

168. The problem of providing adequate
medical supervision for the large amount of
civilian labour employed in the Fourteenth
Army area is being met at present, but it may
become more difficult when civilian labour
forces have to be moved into re-conquered
territory as our troops advance.

169. The thirteen convalescent depots in 11
Army Group have proved their value as an
essential link between hospital and reinforce-
ment camp. The “ patients” in the British
Depot at Kohima played a notable part in the
defence of that place during the siege, though
such strenuous work had hardly been recom-
mended as part of their convalescence.

Miscellaneous A.G. Points.

170. Legal and Judicial. (a) As a result of
the Supreme Allied Commander’s Proclamation
No. 1 of 1944, under which he assumed control
of re-occupied territory, British Military
Administration Courts have been set up in
Burma.

(b) Arrangements have been made with
General Headquarters, India, for assistance to
be given to Fourteenth Army in the prosecution
of those suspected to be military traitors who
fall into our hands. More detailed interroga-
tion is now to be carried out at Forward
Interrogation Centres and the majority of
prisoners will be dealt with in forward areas.

171. Leave. (a) All British personnel have
had to be restricted to fourteen days leave
during 1944, owing to the lack of accommoda-
tion in suitable areas, and to transportation
difficulties which can only be solved by the
provision of more aircraft.

(5) Representations were made that British
Service officers, both with British units and
those seconded to the Indian Army, who were
willing, should be granted home leave in lieu
of repatriation. Many such officers have
valuable experience in jungle warfare and their
retention is most desirable. :

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951

(©) Transportation difficulties originally pre-
cluded the achievement of the target of twenty-
eight days leave per annum for Indian ranks,
but these have since been overcome.

172. Morale and Welfare. The large
number of troops who have taken part in
operations have gained confidence from their
contact with the enemy. It is universally felt
that the Japanese soldier, although a good in-
fantryman, is no match for our well-trained
and well-equipped troops, supported by a
powerful air force.

173. The still inadequate but increased and,
I may add, well deserved publicity now being
given to this theatre of war, coupled with
the introduction of more amenities such as
mobile canteens, cinemas, wireless sets, sports
equipment, a daily newspaper (“ SEAC ”),
and also visits from “Ensa”, have all con-
tributed to the improvement in morale. Men
are beginning to feel that they do not belong
to “ The Forgotten Army ”. :

In all my efforts to improve the lot of the
British rank and file, I am closely in touch
with the Commander-in-Chief, India, whose
troops share with mine in the severe handicaps
of climate, homesickness, and the feeling that
the Burma Border is not, at ent, the de-
cisive Theatre. In spite of the steps that
have been, and are being taken, the under-
current of feeling against service in the East
still persists, and many “ grouses” are still in
evidence, though the spirit of the troops in
forward units is magnificent.

Among British troops, the most burning
question has been, and is, that of repatriation.
In particular, the disparity in the terms of
overseas service between the Army and the
R.AF. is a continual source of grievance, The
measures recently taken to improve this will,
it is hoped, allay some of the feeling that has
undoubtedly existed.

174. The chief anxiety of Indian troops, as
always, is the welfare during their absence of
their families, but the leave situation is now
satisfactory. The effect of enemy paganda
on the Indian soldier has been negligible.

175. The work of philanthropic bodies such
as the Red Cross, the Y.M.C.A. and Toc H
has been most valuable and I am very grateful
indeed to the large body of voluntary workers
who have contributed so much to the welfare
of the troops, both British and Indian.

The Lines of Communication.

176. I have already referred to the Northern
and Southern Lines of Communication Areas,
but there are in fact three lines of communi-
cation supplying Fourteenth Army :—

(@ The Assam Line of Communication,
which has three railheads: that at Manipur
Road, also called Dimapur, supplying the
Imphal Front; and those at Ledo and
Chabua which supply the Chinese-American
forces operating in Northern Burma, and
the air ferry route to China.

(6) The Eastern Bengal Line of Com-
munication, which serves our bases in
Eastern Bengal and the airfields in the Surma
Valley, which are extensively used for air
supply. :
