intended to hold this for some time. During
the early morning, 21st January, the gun posi-
tions of 25 Field Regiment and H.Q. Gazelle
Force were charged irom the flank by a party
of about sixty enemy cavalry. They pressed
home their attack with gailantry, throwing
bombs at our troops, and were only stopped 25
yards from the gun positions by the guns firing
point-blank, and by fire from L.M.Gs., rifles,
and even anti-tank rifles. An attack by an
enemy battalion from Keru was repulsed by
Skinner’s Horse. Throughout the day there
was considerable enemy air activity though no
great damage was done. Signal communica-
tion was very difficult, the wireless being
variable owing to the proximity of the hills,
atmospherics and distortion. By the evening,
3/14 Punjab and 32 Field Regiment had
arrived at Sabdarat. 5th Infantry Brigade,
less 4/6 Rajputana Rifles, all its carriers and
much of its M.T., had arrived at Kassala and
was there joined by a detachment of four “I ”’
tanks. 3/14 Punjab Regiment were unfor-
tunate in being the only unit to suffer
casualties from enemy air action, during the
concentration period. The train in which they
were travelling was bombed south of Derudeb,
one British Officer and 23 O.Rs. were killed,
two British Officers and 20 O.Rs. wounded.

During the early hours of 2and January,
4/11 Sikh Regiment, less one company, which
was the motorised battalion operating with
Gazelle, attacked the enemy positions on a hill
to the south of the Keri gorge. This action
was successful.

During the night 2and/23rd January, the
enemy retired eastwards from his strong posi-
tions, probably due to the arrival of roth
Indian Infantry Brigade across the road Aicota
—Biscia east of Keru, but it was not until
1500 hours on 23rd January that Gazelle Force
was able to get through the Keru gorge, due
to the large number of mines and~ damage
done to the road. Practically the whole of
the enemy force, 41 Colonial Brigade, fell into
the hands of the Mechanized Column and roth
Infantry Brigade, the enemy Brigade Com-
mander and most of his staff with about 800
prisoners being captured.

With the unopposed occupation of Aicota on
2ist January, and the forcing of the Keru
gorge by 23rd January, the enemy had been
forced off his first line of resistance. The way
was now open for our forces to advance on
Agordat and Barentu. 4th Indian Division,
whose L. of C. had to remain on the line
Kassala—Sabdarat—Wachai—Keru, was faced
with considerable administrative difficulties and
ever increasing length of signal communication.
It was still encumbered by its “‘ tail’’, con-
sisting of 5th Indian Infantry Brigade, a large
proportion of whose transport had not yet
caught up. The road Kassala—Keru and
beyond was little more than a track. It had to
cross several khors and, constant work was
necessary to keep it passable. The evacuation
of wounded over this long and rough track
caused considerable hardship.

5th Indian Division, on the other hand, once
they had passed Tessenei, were on to the main
strada which runs all the way from Tessenei
via Barentu, Agordat and Asmara to the sea
at Massawa. This strada was a well made
motor road, capable of taking two lines of
traffic, and although it was not tarmac it had
a good macadam surface.

SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 10 JULY, 1946

roth Infantry Brigade and the mechanized
column which had been sent from Aicota to
cut off the Keru garrison, once 4th Indian
Division had passed on towards Agordat, were
collected about three miles south of Biscia.
It could either be moved back through Aicota
and thence east along the strada to assist 29th
Indian Infantry Brigade advancing on Barentu
from west; or, if a way could be found,
directed south-east across country to cut the
Barentu—Agordat road. This would allow an
attack to be developed against Barentu simuk
taneously from north and west. The only
available maps gave no clue. A route was
found starting approximately two miles east of
Biscia railway station, which, after running
across country in a south-easterly direction,
struck the Barentu—Agordat road near
Terchina, 25 kilos north of Barentu. During
the period while this track was being made
by the sappers, some of the transport of roth
Indian Infantry Brigade was lent to 4th Indian
Division to assist, 11th Indian Infantry Brigade
forward towards Agordat. 11th Indian In-
fantry Brigade was directed to cut across the
Agordat—Barentu road south of Agordat as
early as possible on 26th January.

In the meantime 29th Infantry Brigade had
advanced along the strada from Aicota
towards Barentu, and, having fought two suc-
cessful small actions, first at Gogni, which
they captured on 25th January, and secondly
at Tauda on 29th January, was closing in on
Barentu from the west.

The cross-country move of roth Indian
Infantry Brigade, which had one and a half
field regiments and one troop of 6-inch
howitzers under command, was carried out
without interference from the enemy. Barentu
was threatened from the north by 28th January
as well as from the west.

While these advances were taking place, the
force operating up the Setit River had been
active, and by 26th January had occupied
Umm Hagar. The enemy force in the Walkait,
finding that their line of retreat through Barentu
was likely to be cut, were directed across-
country on to Tole. Up to this time there was
no information that a road or track practicable
for M.T. existed, leading eastwards from
Barentu towards the escarpment at Arresa, and
it was not until late in the action against
Barentu that ground reconnaissance behind the
enemy position discovered this route, by which
the enemy eventually attempted to escape.

Biscia is the terminus of the Italian narrow-
gauge railway. From Biscia towards Agordat
the road is slightly better, and was in
metalled. 4th Indian Division, led by Gazelle
Force, moved rapidly on to Agordat and by the
evening of 25th January. Skinner’s Horse were
in a position west of Agordat from which the
town could be seen. The route had been
blocked in various places by fallen tree-trunks
and a few mines, but nothing serious was met,
and it was clear that the enemy had been
hurried in his retreat. On this side of Agordat,
the road runs for some miles close to the Baraka
River, which at that time was a broad, sandy,
dry river bed—a considerable obstacle for M.T.
without the use of Army track or other extem-
porised crossing material. Both banks are
thickly overgrown with palm trees, impassable
for M.T. except on the tracks. While 11th
Indian Infantry Brigade was being pushed
