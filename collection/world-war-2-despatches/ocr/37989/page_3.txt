SUPPLEMENT To THe LONDON

and steered to the morth-westward under cover
of smoke. AJAX and ACHILLES imme-
diately hauled round, first to north, then to the
west to close the range and regain bearing,
accepting the temporary loss of ‘‘ A” arcs.
Both ships were by this time proceeding at full
speed.

It appears probable that the First Division’s
concentration and also EXETER’S fire had up
to this point been most effective and it is thought
that this and the firing of EXETER’S torpedoes
were the cause of the enemy making smoke and
altering course away.

0638-0650.

a2. At about 0638 EXETER altered course
to starboard so as to fire her port torpedoes.
She then steered to the north-east to close the
First Division till about 0645 when she turned
to a westerly course to keep within range.

23. During this period, EXETER received
two more 11 in. hits. “‘ A’’ turret was put out
of action, and the second shell burst in the
Chief Petty Officers’ flat amidships, started a
fierce fire, and caused the 4 in. magazine to be

: flooded by burst water mains. All compass re-
peaters were now out of action, and Captain
Bell, using a boat’s compass, resolutely main-
tained EXETER in action with “‘ Y ’’ turret
firing in local control and the gunnery officer,
Lieutenant-Commander R. B. Jennings, Royal
Navy, controlling the fire from the after search-
light platform.

24. At 0640 an 11 in. direct. action shell fell
short of ACHILLES in line with the bridge and
burst on the water. Splinters killed four ratings
in the D.C.T. and stunned the gunnery officer,
Lieutenant R. E. Washbourn, Royal Navy.

- Captain Parry and the Chief Yeoman who were
on the bridge were also slightly wounded at the
time. The D.C.T. itself was undamaged and,
after 2 few minutes, resumed control from the
after control position which had temporarily
taken over. ‘The survivors of the crew of the
D.C.T. took over the duties of the casualties in
a most resolute and efficient manner.

About 0646 reception on ACHILLES fire
control W/T set faded, and thereafter she
carried on in individual control. .

0650-0708.

25. During the period ACHILLES was in in-
‘dividual control, she had great difficulty in
finding the line, and at first her salvos were
falling well short. Reports of the fall of these
salvos were transmitted by the aircraft of
AJAX whose gun control officer, not knowing
that ACHILLES was no longer in concentration
firing, accepted them as referring to his own
fall of shot, and corrected accordingly.

The enemy was making smoke at the time,
and conditions for direct observations were very
bad.

This resulted in AJAX salvos falling well
over and the target was not found again until
0708,

26. AJAX and ACHILLES hauled round to
the north-westward at 0656 to open their “A”
arcs. GRAF SPEE made frequent alterations
of course to throw out our gunfire, and from
0700 onwards she made great use of smoke;
she appeared to have some form of. chloro-
sulphonic apparatus aft, and used this as well
as smoke floats... © -. .  --- :-

27. Captain Bell, of H.M.S. EXETER,
hauled round to the westward at 0650, and was
still engaging the enemy, adjusting his course
so as to keep ‘‘ Y’’ turret bearing.

EXETER now had a list of 7 degrees to star-
board, and had several compartments flooded
forward as a result of an 12 in. ‘hit under the
forecastle. She was still being engaged by
GRAF SPEE, but the latter’s fire appeared at
this time to be falling a considerable distance
over EXETER.

0708-0728,

28. GRAF SPEE’S range from the First Divi-
sion was still 16,000 yards at o710. I then
decided to accept the loss of ‘‘A’’ arcs ia
order to close the range as rapidly as possible.
Course was altered to the westward, and AJAX
and ACHILLES were ordered to proceed at
their utmost speed.

2g. At 0716, GRAF SPEE made a drastic
alteration of course to port under cover of
smoke, but four minutes later she turned to
the north-west and opened her “‘ A“ arcs on
the First Division. AJAX was immediately
straddled three times by Iz in. at a range of
11,000 yards, but the enemy’s secondary arma-
ment was firing raggedly, and appeared to be
going consistently over, between AJAX and

HILLES.

2761

30. At 0720, the First Division turned to
starboard to bring all guns to bear. Our shoot-
ing appeared to be very effective, and a fire

« was observed amidships in GRAF SPEE.

31. At 0725, AJAX received an 11 in. delay
action hit on the after superstructure. The
shell passed through various cabins, then “ X ”’
turret trunk, wrecking the turret machinery
below the gunhouse and finally bursting in the
Commodore's sleeping cabin, doing consider-
able damage. A portion of the base of the
shell struck ‘‘ Y ”’ barbette close to the train-
ing rack and jammed the turret. It was this
shell that killed four and wounded six of “‘ X’’
turret’s crew. This one hit therefore put both
“xX and ‘“Y’’ turrets of AJAX out of
action.

32. It now appeared to me that GRAF SPEE
intended to neglect EXETER and was deter-
mined to close the First Division on a north-
westerly course. Thinking she would hold this
course, it was decided to fire one broadside of
torpedoes from AJAX,

At 0724 AJAX turned to starboard and fired
four torpedoes at a range of 9,000 yards.
GRAF SPEE probably saw these being fired,
as she at once turned some 130 degrees to port,
though she came {back to the north-west three
minutes later.

0728-0740. . . .

33. EXETER had been dropping gradually
astern, as she had to reduce speed owing to
damage forward. ‘She still continued firing
“¥"" turret: in local control until about 0730,
when power to the turret failed due to flooding.
She could then no longer keep up with the
action, “and abot 0740 steered to tle south-
east at slow -speed,. starting to repair damage
and make herself ‘seaworthy. ~ A

34. AJAX and ACHILLES hauled back to
about 260 degrees af 0728 to ‘close the range
still: further, -.At 073, -the’ dircraft reported
