            "description": "27. The main offensive was launched on the 19th January, and, despite strong opposition, our preliminary operations against the enemy's outposts were very successful. The original plan had included a sea landing by 2 British Division further south down the Mayu Peninsula. As we did not wish to drive the Japanese into the toe of the Peninsula until 2 British Division had effected a firm lodgement, our attack on the main enemy positions was deferred to synchronize with the sea landing, the date of which could not be put forward as it was governed by the state of the tide and moon. Unfortunately, the craft required for the amphibious operation were taken away and, therefore, this  right hook  had to be cancelled. Thus our je ctteneiy tae been held up to no ose. By the ebruary, home the stack on Razabil had achieved a measure of success, but the main position stili held out. Progress elsewhere had been steady, but slow."

(These had been held back in Gedaref area for reasons of secrecy and deception.) Gazelle was ordered to be prepared to operate east of Sabdarat. Reliable information revealed that the enemy now intended to evacuate the Walkait (Tsegede) garrison. There were only mule-tracks from this area to Gondar and the L. of C. was to Tessenei. From this it was reasonable to suppose that these forces would retire on Barentu covered for the first part of their move by Umm Hagar garrison. This was confirmed next day by the Manager of the Italian Cotton Scheme south of Tessenei who gave himself up at the Butana Bridge and stated that the enemy intended to retire to the hills   on account of the superiority of our tanks.  The date of the attack on Kassala was fixed for 19th January."

            "description": "French ships. The assault force consisted of some fifty thousand American and British troops and over five thousand vehicles. The voyage was uneventful and the force was neither observed nor intercepted by the enemy. The first assault troops touched down on the beaches at 0200 hours on the 22nd; opposition was negligible and it was clear that complete surprise had been obtained. The enemy defences, except for a few coastal artillery positions, were unmanned and it was soon discovered that the only German unit in the area was a battalion  of 29 Panzer Grenadier Division which had been so severely reduced in the recent fighting that it had been sent there the day before to rest and refit and to acquire some training in demolition by blowing up, at its leisure, the small harbour of Anzio*. Fortunately it had made no progress with the task before its training was interrupted. The failure of enemy reconnaissance is undoubtedly to be ascribed at least in part to a heavy air raid we had laid on for the purpose against the enemy's long-range air reconnaissance base at Perugia on 19th January. This was so successful that no reconnaissance was flown between Toth and zand January. A local diversion was made by the Navy who bombarded Civitavecchia and simulated landings there on the night of the 21st; the feint was taken sefiously at first by the enemy who flew a reconnaissance over the area  the pilot asked where the landing was. Army Group  C  informed the German High Command at o600 hours that a landing had taken place directed at Rome and requested the reinforcements which had been agreed for that case; but the first real news that the landing was taking place at Anzio was given by a Messerschmidt at 0820 hours, six hours after the assault troops landed."
