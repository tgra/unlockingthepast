+ SUPPLEMENT. to. THE LONDON ‘GAZETTE, 13 NOVEMBER, 1946

in Middle East Base during the period from Feb-

Tuary to May. Of these 1,688 were flown direct .

to the base, The successful evacuation of

_ casualties by air was due to excellent co-opera~
tion between the medical services and the Royal
Air Force, and to the pilots of the seven ambu-
lance aircraft, who flew their machines in all
weathers and operated from the most forward
landing grounds; the chief difficulty was the
shortage of suitable aircraft,

42. That Eighth Army was successfully main-
tained over a line of communication: stretching
some 1,000 miles ‘by sta from Middle East Base
and a further 400 miles forward of the advanced
base at Tripoli, is in itself proof of the sticcess
of the planning, organisation and co-ordination
which went into the task. .

43. The result, however, was not achieved
without severe strain. The demands made on
engineering, signalling and movement services
by the long line of communications were very
heavy, and the drain on Middle East stocks was
also a serious factor, aggravated as it was by
the large quantities locked up in transit and in
the advanced bases. For example, the demands
Tose at times to as much as goo tons of supplies
a day, and to meet this demand reserve stocks
had to be back-loaded from Syria and the
Sudan. Similar steps had to be taken to meet
the demands for anti-aircraft ammunition,. of
which supplies had to be called in from out-
lying areas and obtained from Persia and Iraq
Command to meet Eighth Army’s requirements.
Reinforcements, too, had at times to be diverted
from other tasks, and a draft of 1,500 which
had been allotted a special role in preparation
for the invasion of Sicily was sent up to Eighth
Army at the end of March. An indication of
the difficulties involved can be gathered from
the fact that, although towards the close of the
campaign great care was taken to prevent too
much ammunition being sent forward, yet when
the campaign ended there were 35,000 tons of
ammunition in, or en toute to, the forward
areas,

44. When Eighth Army began to move for-
ward, the system of normal deliveries, de-
manded well in advance by Headquarters
Tripolitania Base and Lines of Communication,
had to be supplemented on occasions to meet
urgent demands for operational requirements,
particularly for specialised stores such as sig-
nals, medical and survey equipment.

45. Throughout the Tunisian campaign all of
these problems were further complicated by the
fact that I had been given the task of training
and mounting the Eastern Task Force for the
invasion of Sicily; planning and trdining for this
task were taking place from February onwards.

Cyrenaica.

_ 46. As the lines of communication extended,
the army had to be relieved, as much as pos-
sible, of responsibility for rear administration
so that it could concentrate entirely on the ma‘n-
tenance of actual operations. This was success-
fully done by the establishment of administra-
tive headquarters, under: Middle East Com-
mand, to control the sectors of the lines of
communication, _ : . oe

47. The organisation and administration of
a large portion of the lines of communication
‘was catried out by Headquarters Cyrenaica
District, which had béen formed in the’ Delta

5573

under the command. of “Major-General A..L.
Collier, and had moved .up to take: over
Benghazi from the Eighth Army on 15th Feb-
cuary, 1943, by which date-‘maintenance of
Eighth Army through Tripoli was assured.
Cyrenaica District assumed direct responsibility,
under ‘General Headquarters Middle East, for
the whole of Cyrenaica, In March,’ Head-
quarters Cyrenaica District, moved from
Benghazi to Barce, and on 15th April the
southern boundary of the District was extended
to include Kufra, which had formerly been
under Headquarters, Sudan.

48. Within the District the first task was to

-assist the forwarding of supplies to Tripoli and

Eighth Army. In order to shorten the ship-
ping tun, packed petrol, oil and lubricants
were sent up by rail to Tobruk and thence by |
sea to Benghazi and Tripoli. Pumping sets,
figating pipelines, and bulk petrol storage to a
capacity of over 6,000 tons were kept in repair
at Tobruk, and over 11,000 tons storage
capacity was maintained at Benghazi. A tin
factory was also put into operation at
Benghazi by 1th March, whilst extra sidings
were ‘built to the railways and docks at both

. of these ports.

49. Traffic on the ‘Western Desert Railway
declined, with the development of Tripoli’ Port;.
from 65,000 tons in January to 22,000 tons in
March, but the line still had to be maintained
and worked. At the same time, not only had
the road itself to be maintained, but petrol
points and staging areas for road convoys had
also to be organised. ‘

50. In addition to forwarding supplies to
Tripoli, Cyrenaica District had to re-organise
and adminster its own territory when the army
had passed westwards. Much valuable salvage
work was achieved, with special emphasis on
petrol containers (of which almost a million
and a half were salvaged from the District by
the end of the year), whilst stores left behind
as the army advanced were also put into circu-
lation again. There were, for example, 11,000
tons of ammunition left in Benghazi when
maintenance of Eighth Army through that port
ceased.

51. These tasks entailed heavy demands for
both skilled and unskilled ‘labour, some of
which was provided ‘by Middle East Command,
some from civilian sources. A signals head-
quarters and three companies were required
there, with a further headquarters and three
companies for Air Formation Signals. This
undertaking was later reduced as these units
had to be made available elsewhere, and much
of the responsibility for maintaining signal com-
munications was taken over by a South African
unit, the Union Defence Force Lines of Com
munication Signals. .

52. By the end of the campaign there were
sixty-eight pioneer companies stretched from
the Egyptian frontier to Eighth Army area; the
companies came from India, the High Com-
mission Territories, East Africa, Mauritius and
the Seychelles, and were mainly employed as
shore labour in the ports, in the advanced
depots, and on airfield’ and road construction.
In addition, there were some 10,000 civilians
employed forward of the Egyptian frontier. As
far as Cyrenaica District was concerned, the
extent of the problem may be gauged from the
