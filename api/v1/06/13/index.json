The convoy sailed from Suez on roth June, and on 13th June all assaulting troops of the 5th and 50th Divisions, with associated beach bricks and special service troops, were landed on the beaches. Troops re- embarked on the following day. This involved the embarkation into twelve personnel and four M.T./Stores ships of 23,000 men and\u2018 350 vehicles; the stores ships were tactically stowed with dummy stores and non-operational vehicles specially issued for the exercise."

The scale of the effort described above was maintained, whenever weather permitted, until 13th June, when the force involved was reduced to three low cover and two high cover squadrons. All these squadrons operated from England. In addition, a reserve of two squad- rons from those by then operating on the Continent was maintained at readiness for extra low cover if required. This arrangement con- tinued, again whenever weather permitted, until sufficient fighter squadrons had been moved to the Continent to take over the commitment (see para. 329)."

Apart from the forces in Brittany which it was anticipated would move by road, the main source from which the enemy could draw his reinforcement at this time was the Pas de Calais area. I therefore arranged for R.A.F. Bomber Command to attack centres in that area. On the night of 12-13th June, that Com- mand made heavy attacks on Poitiers, Arras, Cambrai and two rail centres at Amiens. On the following night Douai, St. Pol and Cambrai were the targets. These attacks, together with those of the fighter and fighter bombers harassing movements on the railway lines, effec- tively delayed the transfer of the enemy reserves into the battle zone."

On D + 2, however, attacks against shipping off \u201c* Sword \u201d\u2019 beach resulted in a destroyer being sunk. Another destroyer was sunk by day by an aircraft torpedo attack off Portland Bill on 13th June. Sea mines laid in the shipping lanes and approach waters during the month also caused damage and loss to some ships and in- volved continuous employment of naval mine- sweepers. Considering the number of ships employed.in narrow waters, these enemy gains were remarkably low."

            "description": "siderably, as also did the number and location of the sites used. It can, however, be stated that these attacks hampered and kept in check the launching rate; the average number launched per day over the period 13th June to 31st August was 95 against the estimated possible number of 6,000 per day, had the German plan not been upset by Allied bombing. It has already been noted that the air bombing in the preparatory period was so successful in countering the enemy\u2019s preparations for the use of the flying bomb, that it was no longer a direct threat to the preparations for, or the carrying out of the Allied assault and subse- quent land operations. In the event, the flying bomb was launched mainly as a \u201c\u2018 terror\u201d weapon against the civilian population of Southern England and not as a counter to the plans for the invasion of the Continent. I do not propose, therefore, to make any wider comment beyond emphasising the cost to the invasion operations by virtue of the diversion of avail- able air effort that had to be made in order to secure this degree of immunity. An indica- tion of the scale of this diversion is given by the statistics in the paragraphs above. Another less calculable cost was the fact that a number of Tempest and Mustang fighters\u2014which had been allocated to re-arm squadrons in Second British Tactical Air Force\u2014had to be trans- ferred to A.D.G.B. for duties on flying bomb interception patrols. We thus lost the use of these very valuable and latest type of fighters over the battlefront."

In the event we had received no warning at all, apart fom that provided \u2018by the Germans themselves on the 13th June. In the circum- stances it was imperative that we should get the job done quickly. The original time-table went by the board.

            "description": "66. Outwardly these results were not too bad. Nevertheless, I was far from satisfied that the defences were working properly. In the first place, an average of 25 bombs a day was still reaching Greater London. The overall average since the beginning of the attacks amounted to nearly 40 bombs a day. London had endured heavier bombing than this in 1940; but for various reasons an intermittent drizzle of malig- nant robots seemed harder to bear than the storm and thunder of the \u201c Blitz\u2019. Nor were the material results of the bombardment in- considerable. Between the 13th June and the 15th July it killed about 3,000 people, seriously injured 10,000, and irreparably damaged 13,000 houses. Although no objectives of vital importance to the war effort were hit, many public buildings such as churches, hospitals, and schools appeared in the casualty list."

            "description": "54. Events were soon to substantiate our doubts. Shortly after midnight on the night of the 12th-13th June the German Jong-range guns opened fire across the Channel. In this there was nothing novel; what was unusual was that for the first and last time during the war, a town some miles from the coast was shelled. Eight rounds fell at Maidstone, one at Otham, two-and-a-half miles to the south- east, and twenty-four at Folkestone. The bombardment doubtless achieved its purpose, inasmuch as it gave some people the impression that a novel weapon was being used and tended to create an atmosphere of uncertainty and rumour. At least one Me.q1o flew over the London area during this phase and was shot down by anti-aircraft fire near Barking."

Its leading brigade, the 157th, under an able and cool-headed commander, Brigadier Sir John Laurie, was rushed up and placed under the orders of the Tenth French Army. On the night of r2th/13th June it took over the right sector of the III Corps front east of Conches, in a very exposed position, with a gap of eight miles on its right, and two newly arrived French battalions on its left west of Evreux."
