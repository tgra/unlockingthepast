. 8. Having regard to the probable disparity
in strength between the enemy and our own
forces, it is essential that our forces should not
be irretrievably committed, and that we avoid
engagements with the enemy except on ground
favourable to ourselves. In the event of an
enemy attack, mY policy will therefore be:—

(a) To protect aerodromes in, Northern
Syria and Northern Iraq, from which our
air forces can attack the enemy’s vulnerable
communications through Turkey.

(6) To effect the demolition of communi-
cations and oil installations north of the line
Dizful—Paitak—Little Zab River—Ana—
Abu Kemal—Damascus—Ras Baalbek—
: Tripoli, and to withdraw to previously pre-
pared positions on that general line.

(c) To delay the enemy as long as possible
in front of that line by making bold use of
the forces available to attack him in flank
and rear.

(@) To fight a series of delaying actions
* on ground of our own choosing, back to posi-
tions in Southern Iraq and Southern Pales-
tine, covering the ports on the Persian Gulf
and on the Suez Canal.

g. Our plans and preparations must be ad-
justed without delay to this new situation. On
the other hand it is of paramount importance
that we avoid disclosing our weakness or our in-
tentions to the enemy, to Turkey, or to the
local populations, because by so doing we may
encourage the enemy to attack, drive Turkey
into submission, and bring about a serious
internal security situation. .

My policy, therefore, is: —

(a) To maintain troop movement in the
northern frontier areas on the same scale as

* in the past.

(0) To continue slowly with the construc-
tion of those roads in the northern areas on
which a start has been made, and with work
now actually in progress on defences at Mosul
and Qaiara, but not to start any new works
in these areas. The object is to avoid giving
the impression that we have changed our
plans, and at the same time to make avail-
able the maximum amount of material and
labour for the essential task defined in (c)
below.

(c) To complete defences on the general
line Dizful—Little Zab River—Ana—Abu
Kemal—Damascus—Ras Baalbek—Tripoli in
the following two stages: —

Stage A.—On a scale suitable for a
delaying action by the forces given
in para. 7.

Stage B.—On a scale suitable for the
forces given in Appendix ‘“‘ A’, so that
prepared positions may be available, if
reinforcements arrive in time.

SUPPLEMENT To tHzE LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 1948

(2) To prepare, without delay, bases
of supply for mobile striking forces in the
neighbourhood of Fatha, Haffa and Qatana,
and in the Jebel Druze and Lava Belt. The
bases of supply hitherto contemplated at
Palmyra and to the north will not be formed
for the present, but plans will be completed
so that the bases can be made available at
short notice, if required.

(e) To complete the bridges at Raqqa
(because construction cannot now be
stopped without disclosing a change in policy)
and Haffa and Fatha.

Approaches to the bridges to Deir ez Zor and

Meyadine will be completed if not already

started, but the bridges will not be built.

Similarly, work started on the Khabur

bridges should be completed, but no new

work initiated.

(f) To prepare a defended staging post in
the Rutba area—if possible at Al Ga’ara—
without delay. A reconnaissance will be
carried out immediately, and a report swb-
mitted to G.H.Q.

(g) To reconnoitre immediately, positions
in Southern Iraq and Southern Palestine, in
each case for a force of two infantry divi-
sions and attached troops.
ro. An immense amount of work remains to

be done, and all available resources in the
immediate future will be applied to the com-
pletion of the defensive arrangements required
on the line given in para. 9 (c). Reconnais-
sances of the rearward lines, supply ‘bases and
staging posts will be carried out simultaneously,
and reports will be submitted to G.H.G. by
roth March 1942.

11. The policy of stocking will be decided
when the recommendations of Army Com-
manders have been received. :

12. The success of a withdrawal of this nature
will depend very largely upon the state of
training of our formations in mobile warfare.
In the near future, a proper proportion must
be maintained between the conflicting demands
for training and for the construction of
defences. Local labour will be used to the
greatest possible extent, to free formations for
the training in manceuvre which will be so
essential to success.
