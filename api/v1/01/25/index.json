At 1515 hours 25th January I held a conference at Rear Headquarters Westforce near Kulai, The Commanders 3 Indian Corps, Westforce and 11 Indian Division were present. The only matter discussed at this conference was the immediate policy for the conduct of operations. All were agreed that an immediate withdrawal from Batu Pahat was necessary and that, as a result of this, the other columns should be withdrawn from the line Jemaiuang — Kluang — Ayer Hitam.:. I instructed the Commander 3 Indian Corps, who was responsible for the whole of these operations, to issue orders accordingly and to coordinate the action of the various columns. A copy of the Minutes of this conference are attached as Appendix ‘‘G”’ to this Despatch.",

Up to the 25th January, when we still had possession of the important chain of aerodromes and landing grounds and the lateral road in Central Johore, there was still a hope, though by then only a slender one, that our strategy might be successful. The loss of the Batu Pahat force, however, forced upon us the necessity of withdrawing into the Singapore Fortress area and of concentrating upon its defence. We had then failed in our object of protecting the Naval Base. Our task thereafter was to hold the Singapore Fortress area.",

This attack was halted by the Hermann Goering Division after gains of up to two miles. The advance was resumed on the 27th but was again halted well short of its objective; 3 Division was still three: miles from the town and it was evident that a more concentrated and better prepared attack would be necessary. I Division in the meanwhile was endeavouring to push up the main road from Anzio to Albano with Campoleone as its first objective. An attack on the so-called ‘‘ Factory Buildings  (actually the first buildings of Mussolini’s new town of Aprilia) was successful on the 25th, though it met strong resistance from 3 Panzer Grenadier Division; but we could only advance a mile and a half beyond the ‘' Factory ’’ and it was clear that Campoleone, like Cisterna, could only be taken by a strong and consolidated attack. I had returned to the bridgehead on the 25th, after being there on D-day, and as a result of my observations ordered General Clark on the 27th to press the advance with the utmost energy. before the enemy reinforcements could arrive; they were then suffering considerable delay from our air attacks on communications. I told him I considered that, with the prospect of the balance of 45 Divisiom arriving in the bridgehead shortly, risks must be taken and I suggested that all efforts should now be concentrated on full-scale co-ordinated attacks to capture Cisterna and Campoleone, followed by a rapid advance on Velletri.",
