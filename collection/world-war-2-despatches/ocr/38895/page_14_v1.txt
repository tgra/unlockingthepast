some wind and surf persisted at BARK WeEsT and Acip.

Situation at beaches. A. Bark WEST.

The beaches assaulted were unsatisfactory for maintenance owing to flat gradients, the sandbars already mentioned, and poor exits. Sucar Rep beach I was opened and proved Satisfactory for L.C.M. and vehicles and guns were unloaded here throughout the day, while L.S.T. and L.C.T. discharged on to ROGER Rep. Unloading as a whole was slow, some of the delays being attributable to the inexperience of the men handling the Vehicle Landing Ramp, its liability to  snake  and the length of time required for adjustment when an L.S.T. came up to it.

HMS. BOXER, THRUSTER and BRUISER having completed, sailed with three M.T. ships for Malta, leaving twelve ships of the slow assault convoy to complete discharging.

B. Bark SouTH.

Unloading of L.S.T. continued satisfactorily throughout the day and by nightfall nearly all of the first flight was unloaded and twenty had  sailed for Malta with HMS. ROYAL ULSTERMAN, S.N.OL. (Q) having landed and established himself and party ashore at AMBER beach. The General Officer Commanding 30 Corps had also disembarked during the afternoon and set up his headquarters ashore. At 1900 H.M.S. LARGS sailed for Bark East and the A/S patrol off Bark SouTH was discontinued, the destroyers thus released reinforcing the patrol at BARK East.

C. Bark East.

Unloading at this sector was delayed as a result of the time required for discharging L.C.T. with 51 Division stores which had been transferred from Bark SourH owing to the poor beaches in the latter area. In addition, L.S.T. 9, also from Bark Soutu, grounded on Isola Grande.

D. Acip SourH and Norts.

The only outstanding incident was the successful launching of D.U.K.W. from L.S.T. over the ramp while the L.S.T. were under way. It was found that this method of discharge presented no difficulty in fine weather.

Good progress was made with unloading M.T. and stores, the flow to the beaches increasing steadily and much of the arrears due to delays in discharging L.C.T. the previous day was made up.

Large LSJ. sail from Malta Convoy M.K-F. 18 consisting of eleven larg  L.S.1. sailed from Malta westbound and soon after midday twelve similar ships left eastbound in M.EF. 36.

Malta shuttle service begins- The first empty landing ships and craft arrived back at Malta from Sicily and the shuttle service commenced. The first empty M.T. ships were also sailed from the beaches.

Gun Support.

Supporting fire was provided by ships at various points as required from time to time. In particular:

@ between 0030 and 0250, at the request of 1st Canadian Division, H.M.S. ROBERTS



fired from anchor four rounds in each of three prearranged shoots from 12,400 yards at high ground in the Pozzallo area. H.M.S. BLANKNEY and BLENCATHRA had earlier in the night carried out harassing fire on the same area. The object of these shoots, which was achieved, was to force the enemy to retire before the Division advanced at 0300.

Gi) between 1130 and 1205, simultaneously with a shoot by H.M.S. DELHI on Spaccaforno and by H.M.S. BRISSENDEN on Pozzallo, H.M.S. ROBERTS on request from Ist Canadian Division carried out a prearranged shoot on an area N.E. and S.W. | of Rosolini in which the enemy were concentrating. At a range of 18,000 yards, 30 rounds were fired from anchor, the area being swept three times. All enemy troops who came under this fire were demoralised and surrendered promptly.

Gi) H.M.S. BRISSENDEN, under way, fired 40 rounds at a gun emplacement and 120 rounds at a building and area in the vicinity of Pozzallo. At the conclusion of the shoot a white flag was hoisted on the gun emplacement.

Gv) H.M.S. ORION carried out a bombaniceny of Medica at the rear of Bark

 EST.

(v) H.M.S. UGANDA engaged a hostile battery at the southern end of Augusta Bay.

(vi) H.M.S. UGANDA and MAURITIUS bombarded the enemy's line of retreat in the vicinity of Augusta.

Enemy Air Activity. There was rather more activity by enemy

aircraft and it was more widespread than on Dday. Some particulars follow : 

A. Bark WEST.

Sporadic attacks during the night D day/ D+1 day caused no damage to ships but were responsible for a few casualties.

B. Bark SouTu.

No loss or damage was suffered, though there were several  Red  warnings.

C. Aci Souts and Nortu.

Several sharp raids took place and at 1235, S.S. BAARN at anchor off Jic sector was near missed by a Ju.88 and cased petrol in No. 1 hold set on fire. The fire became uncontrollable and in view of the risk of a serious ammunition explosion she was later sunk. Another M.T. ship JOSEPH C. CANNON off How received a direct hit at about 1900, but although the ship's bottom was penetrated no fire resulted as the hold was nearly empty and she was eventually able to proceed to Malta. Raids after dark were ineffective.

Syracuse occupied. The army entered Syracuse at 2100 on 10th July, and at 0600/11th July, fleet sweepers and B.Y.M.S.*, escorted by H.M.S. NUBIAN and H.M.S. TARTAR, proceeded to sweep the approach channel into the port. No mines were swept; there was no opposition, and at 0830 H.M.S. WHITEHAVEN passed through the gate. Naval Commander Force  A  entered in H.M.S. CROMARTY shortly after, and the majority
