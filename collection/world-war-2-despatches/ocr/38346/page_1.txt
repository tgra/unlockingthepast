by the Dutch and U.S. destroyers.

At 1616 enemy 8 in. cruisers opened fire at
a range of 30,000 yards on EXETER and
HOUSTON.” DE RUYTER led round and
action was engaged on parallel courses at a
range of 26 to 28,000 yards, at which ranges
only our 8 in. cruisers could reply. The
enemy’s gunfire was extremely accurate; the-
average spread was estimated at 150-yards for '
elevation, firing 10-gun salvos.”

in to attack soon after action was joined. One
destroyer was hit by gunfire from PERTH and
