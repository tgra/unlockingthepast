SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 1o JULY, 10947

on the other hand, had not a single aerodrome
or landing ground fit for use. The enemy thus
had complete mastery in the air, except on the
somewhat rare occasions when the Fleet Air
Arm were able to intervene with carrier-borne
aircraft. The vigour and daring of the pilots
of the Fleet Air Arm when they were able to
engage the enemy earned the admiration of the
whole Force, but even their strenuous efforts
could not compensate for the absence of land
based aircraft owing to the unavoidable relative
weakness of performance of carrier-borne
aircraft.

' 38. Shortly before Group Capt. Moore,
R.A.F., who had been selected to command the
Air Component, and I arrived in the theatre of
operations, an energetic and inspiring start in
the selection and preparation of possible landing
grounds had been made by Wing Comd.
Atcherley, R.A.F., who carried out this difficult
task with great energy and perseverance.

Group Capt. Moore pushed on the work with
the utmost determination and was ably assisted
by Brigadier Pyne, my Chief Engineer. The
work of preparation was hampered by much of
the country being still under deep snow, making
it impossible to determine whether expanses of
a reasonable size and flatness would prove suit-
able for landing grounds in respect of their
surfaces. The mountainous nature of the
country forced upon us the selection and
development of the most unlikely sites, of which
that at Skaanland was an example. Few lay-
men would have thought it possible that this
site could possibly be made into a landing
ground for Hurricane fighter aircraft.

39. The need for some support in the air for
Goth the sea and land forces was urgent, particu-
larly for H.M. Ships which were suffering
heavily from the daily and almost continuous
attacks made on them in the narrow waters
round Narvik by the thoroughly efficient enemy
bomber aircraft. Nevertheless, Group Capt.
Moore rightly, in my opinion, resisted all
pressure to induce him to call for the aircraft to
be sent before he was quite satisfied that the
landing grounds could be said to be reasonably
ready to receive them.

The existing landing ground at Bardu Foss,
30 miles north of Narvik, was selected to be
the main air base and work to make it fit for
fighters was pressed on with the utmost energy
and in face of considerable difficulties, not the
least of which was the conditioning of the road
to it from Sorreisa at which place all stores,
vehicles and equipment had to be disembarked
from the ships in landing craft.

The preparation of the new landing ground
at Skaanland also presented great difficulties
and even the laying of a specially prepared mat
brought out from the United Kingdom failed
to overcome the softness of the surface caused
by the peaty nature of the soil.

Another possible site was found at Elvenes
near Salangen, north-east of Harstad, and. was
put in hand as an alternative landing ground,
while work was also commenced at Elvegaard,
near Bjerkvik, as soon as the enemy had been
ejected from this area by the successful French
Janding on 13th May. .

The possibility of operating aircraft from
Lakelvn on Forsanger Fjord, east of Hammer-
fest was also considered as there is an excellent

3187

landing ground there capable of taking two
squadrons and relatively free of snow, but it
was too far from the scene of active operations.

40. Eventually the first Squadron of Gladiator
Fighters flew off one of the ai t carriers
on the 2ist May and was safely éstab-
lished at Bardu Foss, with the loss of two air-
craft from crashes into the mountain side in
bad weather. Just before their arrival anti-
aircraft artillery, heavy and light, had been
installed at Bardu Foss after much labour and
energy had been expended in their disembarka-
tion and subsequent transport by road from the
sea. The importance of giving this one and only
aerodrome the maximum degree of’ protection
against air attack was so great that its defence
was given priority over all other needs. Twelve
heavy and sixteen light anti-aircraft guns were
installed there.

It was not until 26th May, that is two days
after the orders to evacuate Norway had been
received, that it was possible to receive the
second squadron, consisting of Hurricane
fighters, at Skaanland. Even then, this landing
ground proved unequal to the weight of these
aircraft and they too had to be operated from
Bardu Foss which remained the sole landing
ground in regular use until the final evacuation.

41. At the cost of a great amount of skill and
energy on the part of Wing Commander Maxton,
R.A.F., an advanced landing ground was got
ready at Bodo and used with great effect by
our aircraft in support of the troops in that area
until it was so heavily bombed by enemy air-
craft as to be unusable without extensive
repairs.

42. Once established, the R.A.F. soon proved
their superiority over the enemy bombers and
fighters, and I have no doubt that the com-
parative immunity from air attack enjoyed by
the forces during the later phases of the cam-
paign was due to the severe losses inflicted by
our aircraft on those of the enemy. The effect
on the morale of the force as a whole of their
vigorous and successful operations was most
marked.

In general terms, my instructions to Group
Capt. Moore for the employment of his fighter
aircraft were: —

(a) To protect from hostile air attack the
following : —

(i) The Naval anchorage at Skauland
and its approaches.

(ii) The base at Harstad.

(iii) Allied sea and land forces in con-
tact with the enemy.

(iv) Airfields occupied by the R.A-F.

(6) The primary aim of fighter aircraft
should be to destroy enemy aircraft approach-
ing the areas to be protected.

(c) To co-operate closely with the land
forces operating against the enemy when re-
quired.

Organization of the Base. °

43. A Maintenance Project had been pre-
pared by my Administrative Staff whilst waiting
in London before we sailed. This envisaged the
creation of a main Base Area at Skaanland with
a Hospital Area at Harstad, and personnel on
the coast road running South. Skaanland would
have come under the same A.A. protection as
the Naval Anchorage.
