At a conference which took place here on the afternoon of the rst April the Commander-in-Chief agreed that, in view of the difficulties of the country and the fatigue of the troops in 17 Division, a withdrawal from Prome to the Allanmyo area should commence forthwith, and that this withdrawal might have to be continued even further north into the dry zone south of Taungdwingyi, where the country was more open and more suitable for the employment of tanks. On the evening of the 1st April the enemy attacked Prome and penetrated the defences held by the 63 Infantry Brigade securing the high ground south of the town, The 17 Division was forced to withdraw on the and Apml north and northeast of Prome.

Unfortunately, the relaxing of the pressure had, as already shown, allowed the Japanese to reinforce the Mandalay sector from this front. The bulk of 18 Japanese Division had been brought into the Meiktila battle, while later 56 Japanese Division with the remaining regiment of the 18th were ordered to withdraw their main forces for the main battle and hold the right flank with minimum strength. On the 30th March, I issued orders for 36 British Division to come under command of Fourteenth Army on reaching Kyaukme. I also directed, that one brigade should be flown into Mandalay as quickly as possible. The whole of 36 British Division was then to relieve 19 Indian Division and assume control of operations in the Maymyo—Mandalay—Ava area. This would relieve the strain on Fourteenth Army until the Japanese had been pushed further south, but it could only be regarded as a temporary expedient since the American aircraft, on which 36 British Division was dependent for maintenance, were to be withdrawn in May, before which the Division would have to be flown out to India. 36 British Division, less 26 Indian Infantry Brigade which remained in Burma, vee actually flown out between the 1st and 21st",
