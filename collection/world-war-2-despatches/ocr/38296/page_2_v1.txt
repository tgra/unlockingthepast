3104 ari It was on the morning of the 22nd, May, that things commenced to-go awry, The enemy convoy sighted by Force C was almost, certainly a large one (see paragraph 27). The

Rear Admiral Commanding, Fifteenth Cruiser

Squadron was presented with a unique oppor-.

tunity of effecting its destruction but unfortunately, in the face of heavy air attacks, and with H.A. ammunition stocks beginning to run low, he decided that he would not have been justified in pressing on to the northward and gave the order to withdraw. The situation

_ Was undoubtedly a difficult one for him, as this   .attack was  certainly on a majestic scale but it

appears that no diminution of risk could have,

been achieved by retirement and that, in fact,  

the safest place for the squadron would have been among the enemy ships. The brief action

did, however, have the effect of turning back 

the convoy, and the troops, if they ever did reach Crete, were not in time to influence the ttle. .

. 6. In the meantime, a further unlucky decision had been taken (see paragraphs 25 and 26). DIDO, wearing the flag of the Rear  Admiral (D), Mediterranean; had expended 7o per cent. of her A.A. ammunition.  The destroyers were also running low; but AJAX and ORION had 42 and 38 per cent. respectively remaining. The Rear. Admiral (D), Mediterranean, correctly decided - that DIDO must withdraw from the Aegean;  but, from yery natural reluctance to leave other ships.of his squadron to face the music after he himself had retired, he took AJAX and ORION with him. This decision, . although such  results could hardly have been foreseen, deprived the hard pressed Force. C of their assistance at a

time when the weight of their A.A.. fire would *

have been an invaluable support.

7. The junction of Forces A and C on the  

afternoon of the zand May,  left the Rear Admiral Commanding, Fifteenth Cruiser Squadron, after. a gru lling two days, in-command of the combined force. Before he. had really  time to grasp the situation of his force, a_series of disasters occurred, the loss of ay GLOUCESTER and  finally

8. Past experience had gone to  show that when under theavy scale of air attack it .is

essential to keep ships together for mutual,sup-.

port. The decision to send KANDAHAR and KINGSTON fo the rescue of GREYHOUND's people cannot be cavilled at but in the light of

subsequent events it would probably have been -

better had the whole force closed  to their support. The Rear Admiral Commanding, 15th Cruiser Squadron: was however not aware of the. shortage of -A. ammiunition in GLOUCESTER and FIJI. Asa final misfortune, when rejoining after the joss of GLOUCESTER, FIJI steered a course diverg-

ig from that of the fleet, which she could no _ Jonger see. ss

9. Late on the 2and May, a   Most Immediate   message was received by the Com_ Mander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, from the Rear Admiral Commanding, Seventh Cruiser Squadron, from which it appeared, owing to calligraphic error, that .the battleships of Force Az had no, pom-pom ammunition left. In fact they had plenty. It was.on this account that orders were given at 0408/23rd

-



May for all forces to-withdraw to the eastward. Had this error not occurred the battleships would not have been ordered back to Alexandria and would have been available as a support  and rallyimg point for the sth Destroyer Flotilla on the morning of the 23rd May, so that the loss of KELLY and KASHMIR might well have been avoided (see paragrap! 46): 0 . 10. That the fleet suffered disastrously {1 this encounter with the unhampered Germ Air Force is evident but it has to be rem bered on the credit side that the Navy's duty was achieved and no enemy ship whether warship or transport succeeded in reaching Crete or intervening in the battle during these critical days. Nor should the losses sustained blind one to the magnificent courage  and endurance that was displayed throughout. I have never -felt prouder of the Mediterranean leet than at the close of these particular operations, except perhaps, at the fashion in which it faced up to the-even greater strain which was so soon to be imposed upon it.

xr. Where so much that was meritorious

--was performed it is almost invidious to particu-

larise, but I feel that I must draw the attention .

of Their Lordships to two outstanding examples. These are - the conduct KANDAHAR (Commander W..G. A. Robson, Royal Navy) and KINGSTON (Lieutenant Commander P. Somerville, D.S.0., Royal: Navy) during the whole period of the operation and, in particular, the rescue of the crews of GREYHOUND: and FIJI (see paragraphs 34 to 39). KANDAHAR has recorded that  between 1445 and 1930 she was subjected to 22 separate air attacks and"all the ,rescue. work during daylight. was carried  out in  face of

 heavy bombing and machine gunning. The

other story is that of the gallantry and dev tion of Commander W. R. Marshall A Deane, Royal Navy, of GREYHOUND, whose self sacrifice stands out even amongst this record of fine deeds. -, 3. After the loss of his own ship he was picked up by KANDAHAR. Whilst .KANDAHAR was engaged in rescuing the crew of the FIJi,

of *

Commander Marshall A Deane dived overboard, -

in the darkness, to the assistance of a man some way from  the ship. He was not seen again,

. 2, Rear Admiral H. B. Rawlings, O.B.E.;

in the WARSPITE, had a particularly anxious  

time. He handled a series of difficult situations in a determined and skilful manner and by his timely support undoubtedly did  all possible to extricate Forces C and D from their awkward situation on the evening of the 2and May.

13. The skilful operation of the forces under the Rear Adriiral (D), Mediterranean, which led to the destruction of the first enemy convoy has already been mentioned.  

. 14. The Naval Officer-in-Charge, Suda, Captain J. A. V. Morse, D.S.O., Royal Navy, followed up his excellent work in organising the port at Suda by consistently presenting a clear and concise picture of the situation by his signals during: the battle. His presence at Suda was invaluable. , . . . (Signed) A. B. Cunnincuam. a Admiral. Commander-in-C hief, Mediterranean. '
