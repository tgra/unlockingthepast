SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MAY, 1948

Thursday, 24th April. D.x Day.

21. Embarkation from the area east of
Athens and Nauplia on the night 24th/25th was
satisfactory, 10,200 personnel being embarked.
Unfortunately, at Nauplia, ULSTER PRINCE
ounded across the fairway, thus denying the
se -of the wharves to destroyers on succeeding
ights. ULSTER PRINCE’s quota of troops
taken off by PHOEBE. This embarka-
tigbn was greatly assisted by ten caiques under

e command of Lieut.’ Commander Carr,

.N.R., and again on the night 26th/27th.

2. H.M. King George and some members

of the Greek Government left Athens for Crete

7 in a flying boat, This was not announced until
some days later.*

. 23. A large Greek yacht, the HELLAS,
arrived unexpectedly in Piraeus harbour, re-
porting that she could steam 18 knots and take
1,000 passengers. She was instructed to sail
after dark, loading to take place as late as
Possible. About 500 of the British community
(mostly Maltese and Cypriots) decided to leave
in’ this ship and walking cases: from an
Australian hospital were sent on board. About
1900 the HELLAS was dive bombed in the har-
bour and hit by two bombs, which set fire to
the ship and jetty alongside. Colonel Renton,
‘who was on board at the time, considers that
~ four to five hundred: people must have lost their

lives and he believes the only gangway to the

shore was destroyed. There were no hoses

working on board at all and none from the
, jetty until nearly an hour afterwards. :

24. One W/T set and one set of cypher books
were sent in a lorry in the charge of a cypher
“\officer to establish 1 itself at new HO. near Myli
; © which we expected to move on Friday or
\--Saturday. Owing to the inexperience of the
W/T rating in charge the assistance of a skilled
R.A.F. operator or technical officer was re-
quested, and promised from Argos. This aero-
drome was, however, bombed and completely
disorganised this-day and no assistance was
forthcoming. This, and the fact that the set had
become damaged in tramsit over bad roads, re-
sulted in a failure of communications during the
night 24th/25th,. while H. Q1 were moving from
Athens to Myli.

25. Captain Clark-Hall, R.N. (D.S.T.O.
Greece) was directed by me to proceed to Kala-
mata to assist in the embarkation at that port.
He was fully in the picture as regards our plans,
so far as they were formed, and was an especi-
ally suitable officer as he recently had experience

} of embarking troops at Le Havre and other ports
in France where there were quays.

b Friday, 25th April. D.2 Day

26. At 1930 the Joint Planning Staff and I left
Athens bound for the new H.Q. with General
Wilson at Myli, in the Morea. This change in
H.Q. was made at the last possible moment to
maintain the advantage of good W/T communi-
cations at Athens as long as possible. A second
W/T set together with a signal and cypher’ staff
followed in a convoy of lorries and cars in charge
‘of my Signal Officer.

\. * Like many other Heads of States whose countries
were overrun by the enemy, the King of Greece deemed
it’ his duty to go where he could most effectively aid
‘the Allies in the prosecution of the war.

27. On our way, we stopped at P beach in the
Megara area and saw-the organisation behind the
beaches for the embarkation, the transports and
escort arriving just as we left.

Arrangements made appeared to be excellent.
We passed over the Corinth Canal at 0030
Friday, 26th April, the German parachute
troops arriving at dawn a few hours later.

28. During this day, ULSTER PRINCE, on
shore at Nauplia, was heavily bombed and
became a total loss.

29. On this night (25th/26th April), 5,700,
troops were embarked from the Megara area (P
beach) in spite of the losses of the transport $.S.-
PENNLAND on the way north, and of one of
the two L.C.T. which had arrived in this area.
Seven caiques under the command of Com-
mander Michell assisted. It is believed that
about 500, many of them wounded, were left on
shore after waiting four days near the beach.
This ‘was due to the facts that they were to be
embarked last, and that the L.C.7. fouled her
propeller with a wire on her last trip (the other
engine already being out of action). It is mot
yet known whether the wounded were taken off
from another beach, and to what extent the
caiques were able to assist.

Saturday, 26th April. D.3 Day

30, At 0530 we arrived at the new H.Q. near
Myli. These were established in an olive grove
in order to obtain cover from enemy dive-
bombers. This was very necessary, as for some
days the enemy had had complete air
superiority, and I believe I am correct in saying

’ that after 23rd April not one British plane left

the ground in Greece (mainland) in support of
our troops or ships. This is of course in no
way whatever intended. as a criticism of the
R.A.F., whose pilots, hopelessly outnumbered;
fought most gallantly to the end, but it is in-
tended to emphasise our complete inferiority -in in
the air at this time.

31. Besides myself and staff; Brigadier
Galloway and Group Captain Pelly, the fellow.
ing had arrived here during the night :—‘

General Sir H. Maitland Wilson, and staff.

Major-General T. G. G. Heywood, Head
of the British Military Mission and other mem-
bers of the Mission.

Rear Admiral C. E. Turtle, Naval Attaché,

Athens, and staff. .

Brigadier A. G. Mission Jones, ‘of the

British Military Missi ‘

Prince Peter of Greece.

The Greek Minister of the Interior.

Admiral Sakellarion (ex Minister of Navy,
_and ex Vice-Premier during the last days).
. Three other Greek Ministers or Members of

Household.

A destroyer had beet asked for to take this

off-from Myli at 2200, but no confirmation
had been received that she was arriving. A fly-
ing boat was also expected. at the same time as
the destroyer, but if the weather was at all bad,
she would not have been able to land, the- “bay
not being sheltered from the south. -, .

32. On arrival at Myli, every endeavour was
made to re-open communications which had
been broken during our move. ‘ Owing to con-
tinual presence of enemy, aircraft cverhead, it
was necessary to site all ‘sets under trees." This,
and the fact that H.Q. was in a valley, rendered
