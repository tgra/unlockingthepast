Constant naval and air patrols were maintained to meet this threat, and on 7th October, the Royal Navy struck a heavy blow at enemy shipping by intercepting a large enemy convoy off Stampalia and destroying four ammunition ships, six landing craft and some armed trawlers. The Royal Air Force, too, and the U.S.A.A.F, were very active and, in addition to carrying out anti-shipping reconnaissances, made repeated attacks upon the Greek mainland, Crete and Rhodes, and other strategical points occupied by the enemy, including Cos (which had now become an objective).",

The westward move to this area was made openly in daylight and when the division moved due north after dusk it was represented in the staging area by the measures I have already described.

This encounter delayed the retirement of our force, which was attacked in daylight in the Scarpanto Strait by J.U.88s and 87s, H.M.S. PENELOPE being hit by an unexploded bomb and her speed reduced to 23 knots. (The destruction of this convoy probably prevented the enemy from making an immediate assault on Leros.)",

The weather did not permit; rain was continuous and of extraordinary violence, paralysing any movement in the plains. In the higher ground on the left the effect was not so sefious and Io Indian Division was able to exploit its bridgehead over the Fiumicino and to capture on 7th October Monte Farneto. This started a series of manceuvres which were to characterize the next period: ground was gained on the left flank in order to turn from there the series of Tiver lines. It was natural that this policy should commend itself to General McCreery, for he had recently been operating with very small forces in these mountains. while commanding ro Corps, and had found them less of an obstacle to an advance than the continuous water lines of the deceptively attractive plains. The Germans were also surprised by our successes here and moved across 29 Panzer Grenadier Division to this sector from north of Route 9. It was not left there long, however, for on 14th October it began to transfer to the central front to meet Fifth Army's attack on Bologna. The result was that by the 16th both",
