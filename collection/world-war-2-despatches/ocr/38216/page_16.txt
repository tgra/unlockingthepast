GH.Q. Appreciation of the Situation—22nd
~ November, 1941.

-140. On 22nd November, 1941, G.H.Q.
issued their appreciation of the situation.
Briefly, this appreciation considered that any
further major action by Japan in the near
future would take place from South Indo-China
against Siam, rather than from North Indo-
China against the Burma road. G.H.Q. did
not, however, disregard the possibility of Japan
making a ‘‘ gambler’s throw ’’ against Malaya
or even against Singapore itself. G.H.Q.
concluded that the most likely operation
which would be called for on our part
in -the immediate future would be to
the set plan ‘‘ Matador,’’ namely an
advance by our land forces into South-East
Siam? A.H.Q. was accordingly instructed to
make all preliminary moves and to be ready
to support ‘‘ Matador ’’ at 72 hours’ notice,
and was informed that this support for
“* Matador ’’ was to take precedence over the
preparations then being made for an Inter-
national A'r Force to operate in South China.
A.H.Q. was also warned that the full recon-
naissance plan for detecting the approach of
a sea expedition against Melya might be
ordered later.

Further G.H.Q. Appreciation—28th November,
1941.

144. On 28th November, 1941, G.H. Q. in-
formed A.H.Q of a report received from Saigon
that the Japanese intended landing troops in
South Siam on rst December, 1941. G.H.Q.
stated that the Japanese had adequate forces
to carry out such a move but placed no great
credence in the report. They assumed that if
such a convoy did leave Saigon it would travel
at 15 knots or less and anchor off Nakwan or
between Singora and Patani‘on the S.E. coast
of Siam on the morning of either the. 30th
November or rst December. G.H.Q. ordered:
A.H.Q. to despatch air reconnaissances daily
with a view to locating this Force, but in view
of the danger that the Japanese might, by
holding out a bait, induce us to strike the first
blow and thus appear to be the aggressors, with
consequent loss of American sympathy, stated
that “a striking force will not be ordered to
attack the convoy if found’’. From this day
until 3rd December, reconnaissances proceeded
without event except that on the 3rd December
two large cargo boats were sighted.

145. On agth November, IQ4I, the notice
for Operation ‘‘ Matador ’’ was shortened by’
G.H Q. from 72 hours to 12 hours.

146. On ist December, 1941, G. H. Q.,
ordered the Command to be brought to ‘' No.,
2 degree of’ readiness *’. The promulgation of
this degree informed the Command that ‘‘ the
international situation was deteriorating ’” and.
brought it into a Position to operate at short.
notice. Inter alia it meant that the full air raid:
warning system was to be brought into being. N
