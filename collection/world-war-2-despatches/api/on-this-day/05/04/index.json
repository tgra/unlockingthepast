On the morning of the 6th the 9 Corps attack would start before dawn on a front of three thousand yards with 4 British Division right and 4 Indian Division left, supported by artillery concentrations from over four hundred guns, centrally controlled. The infantry were to begin by seizing a line north of the road through the small village of Frendj, about six thousand yards from the start line. 6 Armoured Division was to follow 4 British, and 7 Armoured 4 Indian. Their first bound was to the area of St. Cyprien, twelve miles further on and the same distance from Tunis, before the enemy could recover from the shock and occupy the perimeter defences. 5 Corps, which had 46 Division north of the river and x and 78 Divisions to the south, was to hold the corridor open and be prepared to support 9 Corps. XIX Corps was to launch an attack against Gebel Zaghouan on 4th May; on the same day the New Zealanders on Eighth Army's left would mount local attacks south of Saouaf to assist  the French and pin down the enemy on their front. II Corps was to continueVits successful advance towards Bizerta. a"

The enemy did not reinforce the area which I had selected for my point of main effort but left its defence to I5 Panzer Division, now in a very weak state. By contrast he retained both ro and 21 Panzer Divisions in the Kourzia area, opposite my i Armoured Division. Shortly before the attack began a battalion from go Light Division was brought round from Eighth Army front to St. Cypren but on 4th May, on the other hand, the enemy removed two battalions of heavy anti-tank guns from the Massicault area to the area north-east of the Kourzia marshes. It was gratifying to realise that we had been so successful in obtaining surprise and that the enemy had split his armour, leaving the stronger part ms it away to the south of our point of main effort"

I had hoped that Bardufoss would be ready by the 15th May, in which case Carriers with the necessary aircraft would have left England on the 11th May but on the 4th May I had to report that the snow was causing insuperable delays. Concerning the preparation and use of Bardufoss, comsiderable tact was necessary in dealing with the Norwegians, as they firmly wished to keep it under their control. The acceptance of Norwegian pilots and other air personnel for training in England did much to bring a convenient working arrangement into force."

Even more remarkable results were obtained by an attack on an ammunition dump at Chateaudun carried out on the same night. Eight Mosquitoes of R.A.F. Bomber Command attacked with approximately 13 tons of bombs. The bombs were dropped very accurately and caused sympathetic detonation throughout the dump. In the resulting explosion, the entire west rn wing of the depot, containing 90 buildings, was completely destroyed."

During the night of Sunday, 3rd May /Monday, 4th May, a set of 0.7 knots in a direction of 0go  was experienced. It was decided to hold the convoy back sufficiently for DEVONSHIRE to be within reach of position AA at 8 knots. During the forenoon of Monday, 4th May, convoy Y was manoeuvred on courses at right angles to the line of advance in order to achieve the necessary delay, but in so doing the screen became considerably disorganised."

Beyond this the ridge narrows and is devoid of cover, all approaches being commanded by machineguns from Bald Hill, and other prominent features. The maps had given no indication of the exceeding steepness and narrowness of the tidge beyond Elephant, Further advance in daylight was impossible. At o4r5 hours on 5th May, the attack was resumed and Middle Hill was captured. Between Middle Hill and Little Alagi the ridge again narrows to a razorback about 150 yds. wide, wired, flanked by precipices and under machine-gun fire. I Worcesters reached, and at one place went through, the wire, but became pinned and could not move in daylight. Middle Hill was consolidated and the Worcesters were withdrawn to this area on the night 5/6th May. 2oth Indian Infantry Brigade was now definitely checked."

On 4th May xst Gold Coast Regiment supported by artillery attacked two prominent hills which were strongly held by the enemy. A.F.V.s were sent up an old Abyssinian track to support the flank attack by 2nd Gold Coast R giment but could make little progress. Later in the afternoon 2nd Gold Coast Regiment came in.on the enemy's left rear and by 5th May had cut the toad behind the position. The enemy however still held his main positions and it was not until roth May that he was finally driven from them on the two hills. In capturing this very formidable position the determination shown by the Gold Coast troops sustained the fighting teputation which they had gained in the first phase of the campaign."

Opportunity was taken to exercise the simultaneous sailing from the Isle of Wight area of the three forces based there and also to try out the arrangements whereby A.N.C.X.F.{ would assume control of all operations in  the Channel. So far as the naval assault forces were concerned the exercises were satisfactory, but a freshening southwesterly wind in the afternoon of the first day caused the full programme to be curtailed to avoid damage to landing craft. Enemy reaction to   Fabius   was negligible, being confined to an aircraft attack on a destroyer in one of the covering forces. That it was not greater, and indeed that our naval preparations proceeded with so little interruption, must be largely attributed to the very high degree of air superiority achieved in the months before D day. .Enemy air reconnaissance was slight and infrequent."
