parts of the offensive organisation as the 6 in.
director tower. A large number of casualties
on EXETER’S bridge were caused by splinters
from the hit on ‘‘ B’’ turret ricochetting off
the roof of the bridge. Immediate steps should
be taken to pad the under surface of bridge
roofs.

95. The rz in. shells that fell short made a
black splash and in the vicinity of bursts a
black dust like soot was found.

96. The enemy 6 in. fire was ragged and in-
effective and caused little, if any, anxiety.

97. There is some evidence that GRAF
SPEE fired time-fuzed H.E. possibly from her
high angle guns,

Aircraft.

98. The flying off of AJAX’S aircraft with
“X” and “ Y’’ torrets firing on a forward
bearing while the aircraft was waiting was a
gallant and most resolute effort. The handling
of both AJAX and her aircraft during subse-
quent recoveries was also very well carried out.
During the past two months I have been most
impressed with the rough weather capabilities
of the Seafox type of aircraft.

99. EXETER’S Walrus aircraft had been re-
fuelled for the dawn phase, and it was un-
fortunate that both were hit by splinters before
either could be flown off. It was extremely
fortunate that the petrol which was being
sprayed all over the after part of the ship did
not cause any fires. This danger must always
be present when an unexpected encounter
occurs. Again it emphasizes the necessity for
emptying the aircraft of petrol should a night
encounter be likely and for the ability to be
able to fuel and defuel quickly.

roo. Another point that comes out is the
need for speeding up the catapulting process.

tor. The aircraft, once up, though extremely
valuable at times, was not entirely successful.
toz. GRAF SPEE’S aircraft was out of
action before the battle and did not take part.

SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 JUNE, 1047

Increased Protection.

103. There must always be a tendency for
a cruiser to desire increased protection and
most of the claims must, generally speaking,
be resisted. Nevertheless, there are portions of
the control and of the offensive armament that
I feel very strongly should be protected against
splinters.

(a) The killing or wounding of nearly the
whole of EXETER’S bridge personnel is one
example. The bullet-proof plating, backed
up by the instrument plate was more or less
successful in keeping out most of the splinters.
It should, however, be made thicker and, as
mentioned before, the underside of the bridge
roof should be padded to prevent splinters
ticochetting off it. It was this latter factor
that was the main cause of the casualties.

(0) The hitting of ACHILLES director
control tower was most unfortunate, and I
consider that, particularly in those ships with
only one director tower it should be made
splinter proof and also that the leads to it
should be in a protected tube.

(ce) The After Conning Position. This

. position was used throughout most of the
action in EXETER, but its communications
failed, and Captain Bell had to con the ship
through a chain of messengers. In AJAX
castfalties from splinters occurred in this
position, though it appears they were down-
wards from a hit on the main-topmast.
consider that the after conning position
should be protected and more attention paid
to the sécurity of its communications.

(ad) Other exposed personnel liable to
attack from splinters. I consider that the
experience of this action shows that some
protection should be given to torpedo tubes’
crews, H.A. guns’ crews and 0.5 in. machine
guns’ crews.
