SUPPLEMENT to THe LONDON GAZETTE, 16 OCTOBER, 1947

both to ensure gaining contact with the enemy
and to avoid any possibility of SHEFFIELD
being mistaken for the target. SHEFFIELD
was instructed to home the striking force by
D/F.

33. The aircraft approached SHEFFIELD at
1955 below the clouds and then climbed to a
height of 6,000 feet. The weather conditions at
this time appeared to be ideal for a synchronised
torpedo attack, cloud 7/10ths from 2,000 to
5,000 feet. During the climb contact was lost
with SHEFFIELD but regained at 2035 when
a bearing and distance (110° 12 miles) of
BISMARCK was passed by SHEFFIELD by
V/S. The force took departure for the target
in sub flights in line astern at 2040. On nearing
the enemy a thick bank of cloud with base
about 700 feet and top between 6,000 and
10,000 feet was encountered and the force
became split up. At 2047, when it was
calculated that the enemy would be in a suit-
able position for an attack down wind from
astern, No. x sub flight dived through the
cloud, but on reaching the base the enemy was
seen four miles down wind to the eastward.
Position for an attack on the port beam was
gained by approaching just in the clouds, and
the final dive to attack was made at 2055. One
aircraft from No. 3 sub flight followed closely
and also attacked from the port beam. This
aircraft observed a hit on BISMARCK about
two-thirds of her length from forward. All four
aircraft came under intense'and accurate fire
from the first moment of sighting until out of
range.

34. No. 2 sub flight, having climbed to
9,000 feet in cloud, dived down on a bearing
obtained by A.S.V. and two aircraft attacked
from the starboard beam under intense fire.
The third aircraft having lost touch with his
sub flight in the clouds returned to SHEFFIELD
for a range and bearing on the target. Having
obtained this he pressed home a lone and deter-
mined attack from the port bow in face of very
heavy opposition, and his crew saw the torpedo
strike BISMARCK amidships port side.

35. No. 4 sub flight followed No. 3 sub flight
into the cloud and became iced up at 6,600
feet. After seven minutes the aircraft dived
and found a clear patch at 2,000 feet.
BISMARCK was sighted almost at once
engaging No. 2 sub flight to starboard. All four
aircraft circled astern of the target and attacked
simultaneously from port coming under heavy
fire. One aircraft was hit many times and both
pilot and air gunner were wounded, the
observer being uninjured. 175 holes were
counted in this aircraft which had to be written
off as one of the longerons had been cut.

36. No. 5 sub flight of two aircraft lost contact
with the remainder and with each other in the
cloud. Having started to ice up at 7,000 feet
they came down and when still in cloud at
3,500 feet one was engaged by A.A. fire. On
coming out of the cloud this pilot saw the enemy
ahead of him and down wind so retired into the
cloud, being engaged continuously while gaining
a more favourable position. He eventually
came in low on the BISMARCK'’s starboard
bow and dropped just outside 1,000 yards. The
other aircraft of this sub flight made three
attempts to come in but was so heavily engaged’

on each appearance that he finally jettisoned
his torpedo and returned to ARK ROYAL.

37. No. 6 sub flight followed into the cloud
and when at 6,300 feet turned 40- degrees to
port and climbed clear at 7,450 feet, waited for
about 15 minutes and returned-to SHEFFIELD
for another range and bearing of the enemy.
These two aircraft then searched at sea level
and attacked on the starboard beam. Intense
fire prevented close approach and one dropped
at about 4,000 yards while the other returned to
the carrier and jettisoned before landing on.

38. The striking force ‘attack took much
longer than had been anticipated (2055 to 2125)
owing to bad weather conditions around
PISMARES who appeared to be under a cold
ront.

39. At 2040 a signal was received from Com-
mander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, giving his posi-
tion, course and speed at 1800 as 49° 48’ N.
17° 33’ W., 100°, 22 knots, with RODNEY
in company. He also stated that unless the
enemy’s speed was reduced he would have to
return in KING GEORGE V at midnight to
refuel, leaving RODNEY to continue the chase,
He recommended that RENOWN should re-
main with ARK ROYAL,

40. During and after the torpedo attack on
BISMARCK shadowing aircratt reported fre-
quent alterations of course and that she was
making smoke. ‘On receipt of these reports
RENOWN and ARK ROYAL altered course as
requisite to maintain a position some 4o miles
distant from the enemy in order that fying
operations could not be unexpectedly ham-
pered. It appeared possible that BISMARCK
was endeavouring to shake off shadowers before
dark; on the other hand she might have suf-
fered damage to shafts or steering gear as a
result of the torpedo attacks.

41. Owing to the time taken to deliver the
T/B attack insufficient light remained to carry
out another attack before dark. Aircraft could
have flown off but in the failing light location
of the target would have been difficult, friend
might have been mistaken for foe and certainly
many of the aircraft would have failed to regain
the carrier. It was therefore decided to main-
tain shadowing aircraft as long as possible and
concentrate on preparing all remaining Sword:
fish for a strong striking force at dawn.

42. Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, re-
quested that aircraft might give the destroyers
a visual link with the enemy and ARK ROYAL
was instructed to comply. The two shadowing
aircraft were ordered to remain in touch as long
as possible and establish this link before retur-
ing. _ They left the BISMARCK at 2230 and,

_ after making a detour in heavy rain, located

the destroyers. By this time, however, they
were not certain of their own position and were
unable to assist the destroyers, These two air-
craft were D/Fd back to ARK ROYAL, landing
on at 2320 when it was practically dark.

43. At 2220 ARK ROYAL reported that one
torpedo had definitely hit BISMARCK amid-
ships, and Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet,
was informed accordingly at 2225. Later, in-
formation was received from ARK .ROYAL
that a second hit had most probably been ob-
tained aft, and Commander-in-Chief was again
informed at 2240. “
