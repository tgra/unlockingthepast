THE FINAL STAGES OF THE. NAVAL WAR IN NORTH-WEST
EUROPE.

The following despatch was submitted to the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on the
4th December, 1945, by Admiral Sir
HAROLD M. BURROUGH, K.C.B.,
K.B.E., D.S.O., British Naval Commander-
in-Chief, Germany. :

British Naval Commander-in-Chief, Germany,

» cfo Admiralty.
4th December, 1945.

Be pleased to lay before Their Lordships the
enclosed copy of my report to the Supreme
Commander, Allied Expeditionary Force, on
the Final Stages of the Naval War in North-
West Europe.

2. “As explained in my covering letter to the

Supreme Commander, the aim of this report
is to supplement the detailed information and
statistics In the War Diaries and thus to pro-
vide a continuous narrative which is brief, but
at the same time contains sufficient detail and
references to facilitate research into any particu-
lar period or episode.
’ 3. Reports of proceedings were rendered at
the time in respect of most of the episodes de-
scribed im the narrative of this period, but no
separate report has been rentlered on the naval
arrangements for the occupation of Germany.

4. I would bring to Their Lordships’ notice,
the co-operation and assistance received from
the Commanders-in-Chief, The Nore, Ports-
mouth and Plymouth, in regard to the forma-
tion of the Naval Parties destined for Germany
which were thus able to move to their destina-
tions with far less delay than had been thought
possible. The lion’s share of the credit for this
must go to the Commander-in-Chief, The Nore,
Admiral of the Fleet Sir John C. Tovey, G.C.B.,
K.B.E., D.S.0O., in whose Command the Parties

for the most vital ports were formed, and who
throughout, by his personal interest in the
progress of the planning, had done everything
possible to make matters go smoothly.

5. The co-operation and assistance received
from the Personnel Departments of the
Admiralty and from Plans Division (Q), were
also notable.

(Signed) H. M. Burrovues,
Admiral.

Tre Finat STAGES OF THE NAVAL WaR
in Norts-West Europe.

Office of Allied Naval Commander-in-Chief,
Expeditionary Force.
13th July, 1945.

I have the honour to submit the enclosed
report, outlining the activities of the Allied
Naval Forces under my command from the
time of the crossing of the Rhine, to the 13th
July, 1945, when your period of command as
Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary
Force, was terminated.

2. The aim of this report is.to supplement
the information in the War Diaries, which were
tendered periodically from D Day onwards, by
a narrative which is of sufficient brevity that
a busy man might find time to read it, but '
which mentions all important events so that
the historian may find clues for more detailed
Tesearch.

3. This was a period of widespread and
historical activity for all: the Sea, Land and
Air Forces under, your command. The naval
role in these crowning achievements was
primarily to ensure the maintenance of the
Armies and Air Forces in the field by protecting
