SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

its capture of the Giogo pass to press down
into the valley of the Santerno, On aist
September, 85 Infantry Division captured
Firenzuola, and, pressing on north, stormed
the strong position of Monte la Fine, west of
the Imola road. On its right Il Corps had
put in, on the 2zst, its last fresh division, 88
Infantry, with the task of clearing the east
side-of the Imola road. The 88th pressed
on over desperately difficult country and on
the 27th seized Monte La Battaglia, a great
mountain mass dominating the Senio and San-
terno valleys on either hand and only ten miles
from Imola and the Emilian plain, The enemy
now reacted with great vigour and began a
series of most violent counter-attacks with ele-
ments of four divisions; these and the increas-
ing difficulties of our communications brought
a halt to our advance on Imola. 13 Corps
during this time had had the task of protecting
II Corps’ right; it had still the same three
divisions forward with which it had fought its
way up from the Amo valley. Its sector of
operations was dictated by the road-net and
its main efforts must be down the roads to
Faenza and Forli. On 24th September it
captured Marradi on the former and San
Benedetto on the latter. Meanwhile the left
of II Corps had also been making good pro-
gress where 91 and 34 Divisions were
advancing up the direct routes from Florence
to Bologna. On the 21st the fate of the strong
Futa’ Pass positions was sealed by the capture
of Monte Gazzarro (or Guzzaso) on its eastern
flank and by the 28th Route 65 was clear as
far as the northem end of the Radicosa Pass,
the second main pass on the Florence-Bolo
toad. On the Prato-Bologna road 34 Divisicn
ie ba level midnigh a a change of corps
undaries at midnight 28th. mber,
they were relieved by the Sout Ate when
just short of Castiglione dei Pepoli. Between
them and the coast the task of IV Corps was
to follow up the enemy; this had brought us
by the 28th to a line some five miles north of
Pistoia and running from there over the moun-
tains north of Lucca to the coastal plain about
three miles short of Massa where the western end
of’ the ‘‘ Gothic * line was secured by strong
defences anchored on the sea. Viareggio was
entered on r6th September by a British con-
verted anti-aircraft battery of ‘‘ Task Force
45°’. 6 Regimental Combat Team of the
Brazilian Expeditionary Force took over a
sector of the line on 16th September. This was
the first contingent of an Allied South American
state to see action in this war. While it was
gaining battle experience it played a valuable
réle in holding an important part of the
defensive front.
_ The “Gothic” line was now completely
turned at its eastern end and pierced over a
wide front in the centre. By the end of Sept-
ember the enemy had decided: to abandon such
of the prepared positions as still remained in
his hands except for a small sector in the ex-
treme west. In thus depriving the enemy of the
permanent defences on which he had worked
so long the Allied Armies in Italy had scored
a great success, won at a great price, but it
was difficult to exploit. The furthest advance
had been made, as was intended, by the Eighth
Army, which had advanced some thirty miles
in twenty-six days. In a letter to me summing
up the results of the action to date, written on

21st September, General Leese said he con-
sidered the fighting to have been as bitter as
at Alamein and Cassino. The German artillery
fire was very heavy and well-directed and the
many counter-attacks were made in considerable
strength; one village changed hands ten times.
Eighth Army claimed to have “ severely
mauled eleven German divisions and taken
over eight thousand prisoners. The cost was over
fourteen thousand casualties, of which over
seven thousand in British infantry units, and
two hundred and ten tanks lost. The tanks were
easily replaceable, but the men were not and
I was forced to take very unwelcome measures
to keep up the strength of formations. x British
Armoured Division, which had played a distin-
guished part in so many battles in Africa, was
to be disbanded in less than three months after
its arrival in Italy. A brigade of 56 Division was
be reduced to a cadre basis. Finally, all United
Kingdom infantry battalions were to be re- -
organised at once on the basis of three rifle
companies.* Yet, although the price had been
heavy, no one in Eighth Army doubted that a
real victory had been gained, for it was con-
fidently expected that, after breaking into the
flat country of the Romagna, we should be able
to exploit rapidly to the Po. It was not long,
however, before, as the Eighth Army historian
puts it, ‘‘ the tactical implications of the local
agricultural methods were realized ’’ and the
continuous water lines were found to be more
serious obstacles than the mountains.

Not only the Eighth Army replacement situa-
tion but the general manpower situation of the
Allied Armies in Italy was such as to give rise
fo anxiety. I explained the main features to
the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on azst
September. After the loss of seven divisions
to the invasion of Southern France the
promised reinforcements to Italy, after deduct-
ing other subsequent decreases, had only
amounted to one and a half divisions, including
78 Division, which would not be available until
the first week in October. On that date, there-
fore, the net loss would be five and a half
divisions. The enemy, on the other hand, had
continued to reinforce Italy. Since May Kessel-
ring had lost to other fronts three of his
original twenty-three German divisions and
had disbanded one other. In return he had
received from elsewhere ten divisions and three
divisions’ worth of extra replacements; one of
the new arrivals had now been likewise dis-
banded which left him with twenty-eight Ger-
man divisions all told.{ To this should be added
two Italian divisions which were at least useful
for internal security duties. Even without
counting the Italians the net German gains were
five divisions, or eight if the three “‘ shadow ”’

*TI had received 13,000 infantry replacements from
the United Kingdom in April 1944 and was told that
I should have no more. Realizing that this quota
would not last beyond the end of July I set on foot a
plan for creating more reinforcements from theatre
resources. By disbanding Light Anti-Aircraft and some

17,000
reinforcements, 9,000 of which went to infantry units.
In August I converted a further 5,000 gunners into
infantry but even this was insufficient to make up for
our losses in the ‘' Gothic ”’ line battles. .

¢ 232 and 237 Infantry Divisions bad now arrived
and 15 Panzer Grenadier Divisions ;
the former went, in the first place, to Liguria and
the latter to Istria. It will be remembered that
August and September, the period when this reinforce-
ment of Italy was set in train, were months of very
severe crisis on the Western Front.
