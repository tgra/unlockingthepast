value of offensive movement at the start of the
war and the possibility of thereby upsetting the
Japanese plans were fully realised, but had to
be weighed against the fact that we should be
leaving prepared ground with which the troops
were familiar, and that, unless we forestalled the
enemy, the fighting would be in the nature of
an encounter battle, quite possibly against
superior numbers. Further, the attitude of the
Siamese was uncertain, and questions of secrecy
precluded any attempt to get prior agreement
from Bangkok. Orders were issued that, should
Matador be ordered, any opposition from the
Siamese was to be overcome at once, but we
could never be certain in advance how much
delay might be caused to our movements by
obstacles, destruction of bridges or active re-
sistance. A margin of time was necessary.

A total of thirty officers, two or three at a
time, were sent over as visitors to the area in
plain clothes in order to collect information,
especially on the topography of the country, and
to have some individuals familiar with it.

The preparations were completed before
the Autumn of 1941 as far as could be fore-
seen, including maps, arrangements for the dis-
tribution of rice to the population, the collec-
tion of a quantity of Siamese money, and writ-
ing, ready for translation and printing,
pamphlets of three varieties to suit the different
attitudes which miglit be adopted by the
Siamese Government. For reasons of secrecy,
knowledge of the plans was confined to a mini-
mum number of individuals, and for the same
Teason certain steps could {not be taken in
advance. For instance, it was considered
dangerous to translate or print the pamphlets
before the operation was ordered.

51. Up to the 5th December, Matador was not
to be carried out without reference to the War
Cabinet, but on that date a telegram was sent
to the effect that I could order it without refer-
ence to London in either of the following contin-
gencies : — ,

(a) If I had information that the Japanese
expedition was advancing with the apparent
intention of landing on the Kra Isthmus; or

(b) If the Japanese violated any other part
of Thailand (Siam).

A few days earlier it had been impressed on
me that carrying out Matador if the Japanese
intended to make a landing in Southern Siam
would almost certainly mean war with Japan,
and in view of this I considered it my duty to
be scrupulously careful in acting on the tele-
gram of the 5th December.

Aerodrome Policy.

52. The number and location of aerodromes in
Malaya was based on the principle of relying
mainly on air power for defence. This also
applied, though in a somewhat smaller degree
to Burma.

It meant, first having a sufficient number of
aerodromes to make use of the mobility of air-
craft for concentrating a large proportion of our
squadrons in any given area; and, secondly,
choosing sites as far forward as practicable so
as to enable us to reach out the maximum dis-
tance both for reconnaissance and for offen-
sive operations. This was particularly import-
ant in the case of attacks on Japanese convoys
in order to ensure having sufficient time to carry
out more than one attack before they reached
our coast.

SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 22 JANUARY, 1948

The total number of aerodromes prepared was.
based on the figure of 336 Initial Equipment
aircraft, and since this figure was never reached.
we had in some areas more.aerodromes than.
we were able to use, the surplus being a liability
rather than an asset. The forecasts of develop-
ment of our air stfength were admittedly uncer--
tain, but in view of the long time taken to con-
struct an aerodrome in Malaya we could not
afford to wait until we knew definitely that more
aircraft were coming. The Army dispositions.
were largely influenced by the necessity for
protecting Royal Air Force aerodromes. As
events turned out, owing to the weakness of
the Royal Air Force at the time war started,
the defence of Malaya devolved largely upon
the Army, which meant that sites for aero-
dromes were not always the most suitable for
operations as they were actually carried out.
But it was impossible to have foreseen this, since
no one could have known in advance when the
Japanese would start the war.

In the autumn of ro4r, orders were issued.
that four of the aerodromes in Malaya and two
in Burma were to be extended so as to be suit-
able for the operation of heavy bombers up to
the Boeing Fortress type. This meant runways
of 2,000 yards with a surface sufficiently strong
to bear the weight of these aircraft fully loaded.

Sufficient attention was not always given to
the tactical siting of aerodromes from the point
of view of their defence. There was rather a
tendency at one time to site them solely with
reference to their suitability for flying opera-
tions; and in one or two cases they were located
too near the coast where they were a definite
danger so long as the Japanese had command
of the sea. This, however, was corrected, and
it was laid down that no aerodrome was to be
selected or planned except in conjunction with
the staff officer of the Army organisation con-
cerned, a principle also applied to the siting of
‘buildings and aircraft pens. The buildings on
some of the original aerodromes in Malaya had
been laid out entirely on a peace basis, for
they were not dispersed and were in straight
lines; this was noticeably the case at Alor Star.

53. We learned a lesson from the Dutch as
regards the siting of aerodromes. In Borneo,
the communications of which were undeveloped,
they worked on the principle of locating aero-
dromes 25 to 50 miles from the coast in jungle
country with only one line of access, generally
a road, but sometimes a river. This, of course,
considerably simplified the problem of defence
against overland attacks. It was practicable
only to a limited extent in Malaya, but it was
laid down that any future aerodromes required
in Sarawak and other parts of British Borneo
would be sited on this principle.

Aircraft Warning System.

54. There was no air observation system in
Malaya when I arrived, and its organisation en-
tailed a large amount of work. The respon-
sibility was at first placed upon the G.O.C.
and was later transferred to the A.O.C. So:ne
R.D.F. sets were received during 1941, and
before war broke out an air observation system.
was working well as regards Southern Malaya
and Singapore; it was not good up North,
partly owing to the lack of depth from the
frontier and partly because we had not suffi-
cient R.D.F. sets to install any in the North.
Communications were difficult the whole time,
