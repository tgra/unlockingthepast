SUPPLEMENT 10 Taz LONDON GAZETTE, 4 SEPTEMBER, 1946

The main weight of the attack was. to be
developed by 8 and 30 Corps on a narrow front.
30 Corps was to wheel South-West, initially to
the line Villers Bocage—Aunay-sur-Odon, while
8 Corps, in a wider sweep on its right, swung
down to Bény Bocage and on'the Vire—
Tinchebray—Condé triangle.

The attack started on 30 Corps front at
0600 hours 30th July.

The initial attack was supported by heavy
and medium bombers which carried out their
-attacks in spite of low cloud and bad weather.

Progress on the 8 Corps flank proved easier
than on 30 Corps front. By 31st July 8 Corps
had secured crossings over the River Soulevre
and 30 Corps had cleared Cahagnes. Heavy
fighting continued though progress was slow
in both 8 and 30 Corps owing to enemy counter
attacks and the great difficulty of the country.
During the first days of August 2 Canadian
Corps mounted three attacks, east of the Orne
as part of the general programme of maintain-
ing pressure in that area.

By 6th’ August the area Laval-Mayenne-
Domfront had been reached by the Americans.
On the following day First Canadian Army,
which had now extended its front to include
the Caen sector, was to begin a series of major

‘attacks astride the Caen-Falaise road, which
had so long been the fundamental aim of our
* policy on the Eastern flank.

I was still not clear what the enemy intended
to do. I did not know if the enemy would
* stand and be defeated between the Seine and
the Loire, or whether hé would endeavour to
withdraw his forces behind the Seine. There
was no evidence to show on what line he was
intending to reform his front; it was evident
from the British and Canadian troops in close
contact with the Germans east, south-east and
south of Caen, that he was definitely holding
his ground in this sector; he was evidently
trying to pivot on the Caen area.

On 6th August I issued orders for the ad-
vance to the Seine.

I instructed First Canadian Army to make
every effort to reach Falaise itself in the forth-
coming attack; in the subsequent advance to
the Seine the main Canadian axis was to be the
road Lisieux-Rouen. On its right I intended
Second. British Army to advance with its right
directed on Argentan and Laigle, whence it was
to reach the Seine below Nantes. Twelfth
United States Army Group was to approach
the Seine on a wide front with its main weight
on the right flank, which was to swing up to-
wards Paris.

Between 7th and 11th August it became clear
. that the enemy had decided to fight the battle
of France on our side of the Seine. On the 7th
a major counter attack, employing up to six
armoured divisions, was launched on Hitler’s
orders against the American forces in the area
of Mortain.. The brunt of it fell on 30 United
States Infantry Division which held the on-
slaught sufficiently long to enable two American
divisions who were moving south between
Avranches and Mortain to be switched to the
danger area. The counter attack was designed
to cut off the forces operating south of
Avranches by a drive to the sea. In the face
of this counter-attack the Americans, assisted
by the full weight of the tactical air forces,
stood firm. . : ;

I ordered the right flank of the Twelfth U.S.
Army Group to swing Noth towards Argentan,
and intensified the British and Canadian thrusts
southwards to the capture of Falaise.

First Canadian Army was ready to launch
its thrust southwards in the direction of Falaise
on the night of 7th August. The object was to
break the enemy defences astride the Caen-
Falaise road, and to exploit as far as Falaise.

The attack was to take place under cover of
darkness after a preliminary action by heavy
bombers; the infantry was to be transported
through the enemy’s zone of defensive fire and
forward defended localities in heavy armoured
carriers. At first light on 8 August the infantry
debussed in their correct areas after a four
miles drive within the enemy lines, and pro-
ceeded to deal with their immediate objective.
The first phase of the operation had been
successful.

While VII United States Corps and 8 British
Corps were held op in their respective sectors,
the right wing ‘of Twelfth United States Army
Group proceeded with its planned operations.
On 7th August XV Corps continued to make
progress’ and on the following day entered
Le Mans.

In Brittany, Third United States Army units
were engaged in heavy fighting at the
approaches to St. Malo, Brest and Lorient.

My plan was to make a wide enveloping
movement from the southern American flank up
to the Seine about Paris, and at the same time
to drive the centre and northern sectors of
the Allied line straight for the river. In view
of the Mortain counter attack, I decided to
attempt concurrently a shorter envelopment
with the object of bottling up the bulk of the
German forces deployed between Falaise and
Mortain. It was obvious that if it was pos-
sible to ‘bring off both these movements the
enemy in Normandy would be virtually
annihilated. .

On 8th August I ordered Twelfth United
States Army Group to swing its right flank due
north on Alencon at full strength and with all
speed. At the same time I urged.all possible
speed on First Canadian and Second British
Armies in the movements which were converg-
ing on Falaise.

By 12th August, on Second Army Front
heavy fighting was in progress on the hi;
ground three miles south-east of Vire, and at
the same timé leading troops were only a few
miles short of Condé. East of the River Orne
the bridgehead was extended to the south-east,
and also to the north-east to link up with
elements of 2 Canadian Division who had
crossed the River Laize.

After four days’ fighting, on 12th August
reconnaissance reports clearly showed a general
trend of enemy movement to the east from .
the Mortain area through the corridor between
fees and Argentan and on towards the Seine

erries.

The Allied Air Forces were pounding the
enemy in the pocket but the problem of com-
pleting the encirclement was no easy one; the

ermans realised that their existence depended
on holding open the corridor, and bitter fight-
ing ensued as a result of our attempts to frus-
trate them. On the north side of the corridor
it must be recalled that the enemy had long
been in possession of the vital ground north of
