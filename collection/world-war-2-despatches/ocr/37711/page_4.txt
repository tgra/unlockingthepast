were in a state of defence and had been pro-
vided with extensive obstacles and which would
require speedy clearance by our assaulting
troops. The system of water lines, inundations
and marshes behind the Carentan estuary was
extensive and there were few available routes
crossing these barriers; the seizure of these
routes intact was of the utmost importance.

The hinterland behind the beaches generally
favoured defensive tactics and was on the whole
unsuitable for the deployment of armoured
forces.

Apart from the open rolling plain to the
south-east of Caen, the area was covered to a
depth of'up to 40 miles inland by ‘‘ ”
—pasture land divided by unusually high
hedges, banks and ditches into many small
fields and meadows. In such conditions,
observation was extremely limited, and move-
ment off the road defiles was very restricted:
not only for wheeled transport, but often for
tanks. On the other hand it was ideal infantry
country; there was excellent concealment for
snipers and patrols, while defensive positions
dug into the banks were well protected from
danks and artillery,

The Normandy highlands ran from south-east
to north-west across the assualt frontage, at a
depth of up to 25 miles inland. The country
was broken and irregular in parts, with steep
hills and narrow valleys. The dominating
feature of the northern ridge was Mont Pingon,
some 18 miles south-west of Caen. "
Preliminary Operations.

In the broad strategic sense, preparations for
the assault of north-west Europe ‘began at sea
and in the air many months before D Day.
Winning the Battle of the Atlantic was essential
to ensure the passage of the vast volume of
personnel and stores from America and Canada
to the battle front. The strategic air offensive
against Germany had a vital effect on the war
by strangling the whole economic structure of
the country,

An essential preliminary to the assault was
the reduction of the German Air Force to the
degree required to ensure mastery in the air
over our seaborne forces in the Channel, and
over the beaches on the assault coast. The
next army requirement was the interdiction of
rail and road communications, with the object
of delaying the movement of enemy troops and
supplies to the battle area. It was desirous also
to mislead the enemy about the sector selected
for the assault, and, lastly, to pve the way
for our actual landing operation by pre-D Day
air attacks against coast defences and instal-
lations. Other preliminary air tasks of direct
importance to the army were the flying of
‘reconnaissance missions over a wide area, and
the prevention of enemy reconnaissance over
-our centres of concentration and embarkation.

So admirably were these commitments
carried out by the Air Forces that we were
afforded immunity from enemy air recon-
‘naissance during the vital period, a factor of
first importance in the design for achieving
‘tactical surprise in our assault operation; more-
over, there were only one or two attacks by
‘the German Air Force on the assault forces
during the sea passage or at any time on the
‘beaches during D Day.

The interdiction of rail communications was
‘effected as a result of a detailed plan for
<destroying the servicing and repair facilities

which were essential for the operation of rail-
ways in northern and western France, the Low
Countries and western Germany. In full opera-
tion by D-60, the programme brought attacks
closer to the NEPTUNE area as time grew
shorter, and the result was a shortage of loco-
motives and stock, repair facilities, and coal
over a wide area, while 74 bridges and tunnels
on routes leading to the battle area were im-
passable on D Day. Reports on 7 June
showed that all railway bridges over the Seine
between Paris and the sea were impassable,
and also one of those on the lower section of
the Loire. Road bridges were also attacked
with most successful results; the 13 bridges
between Paris and the Channel, and the five
main road bridges between Orléans and Nantes,
were either destroyed or damaged.

Attacks prior to D Day on coast defence
batteries in the NEPTUNE area were worked
into an overall plan of action against the whole
length of the assault coast, in order to mislead
the enemy about our intentions. These opera-
tions retarded the construction of overhead
cover for major batteries covering the Baie
de la Seine, and at the same. time served to
increase the enemy’s fears that it was intending
to assault in the Pas de Calais: astride Cap
Gris Nez. This was a matter of first import-
ance in our plans.

Preliminary naval operations included sweeps
against enemy U-boats, R-boats and E~boats,
and minelaying designed to afford protection
to the sea passage across the Channel.

The Assault.

My plan of assault, as approved by the
Supreme Commander, provided for simultane-
ous landings by eight equivalent brigades—of
which were British and’ two were
Canadian brigades, and three were American
combat teams. With the assaulting brigades,
two battalions of U.S. Rangers and portions of
two British Commando Brigades took part.
The Americans assaulted on the right flank as
they would ultimately require direct entry of
personnel and stores from the Atlantic.

Airborne forces were used on both flanks.
On the right, 82 and ror U.S. Airborne Divi-
sions dropped at the base of the Cotentin Penin-
sula to assist in capturing the beaches and
isolating Cherbourg. 6 British Airborne Divi-
sion was given the task of seizing the crossings
over the Caen Canal and of operating on our
extreme left.

First United States Army was to assault
astride the Carentan estuary with one regi-
mental combat team between Varreville and
the estuary (Utah beach), and two regimental
combat teams between Vierville and Colleville
(Omaha beach). The initial tasks were to
capture Cherbourg as quickly as possible, and
to develop operations southwards towards
St. Lé in conformity with the advance of
Second British Army.

Second British Army assault was to be de-
livered with five brigades between Asnelles and
Ouistreham (Gold, Juno and Sword beaches),
with the intial tasks of developing the bridge-
head south of the line St. and south-
east of Caen, in order to secure airfield sites
and +o protect the eastern flank of First United -
States Army while the latter was capturing
