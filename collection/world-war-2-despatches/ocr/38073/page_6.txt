"6. At 1600, as an intercept had shown that
the force might have been reported by enemy
aircraft, course was altered to 320 degs.* and
at 1700 back to 290 degs.

7. At 1705, the force was sighted by
6 JU.52s escorted by one ME.1r0 on passage
from Libya to Crete, by whom the force was
reported. At 1745 course was altered to 270
degs. and at 1900 to 320 degs. and at 2000 to
285 degs. and thence by evasive steering, which
avoided crossing the last Teported mean line
of advance to position ‘‘ N ’’

8, At 1900 BEAUFORT closed the convoy
from astern having arrived from Tobruk.

g. A speed of 12 knots was made good
during the period 0930 on 21st March to 0800
on 22nd March.

Io. Fighters were present from 0740 to 1715.

11. The force passed 3 miles south of position
““N’’ at 0600 on 23rd March, steering 290
degs. to make contact with H.M. Ships
PENELOPE and LEGION

12. H.M. Ships PENELOPE (Captain A. D.
Nicholl, D.S.O., R.N.) and LEGION were
sighted at 0742 bearing 343 degs., and at 0750
course was altered to 250 degs. in view ‘of
P.36’s report of 3 destroyers and heavy ships
south of Taranto.

. 13. Shadowing by enemy aircraft commenced
at 0935 at which time the first torpedo-bombing
attack commenced. Raids continued from this
time.

14. Own fighters were present from 0810 to
goo.

15. Two groups of enemy aircraft failed to
locate the convoy and were searching far it
30 or 40 miles astern.

16. No zig-zag was carried out by the convoy
after 0650 as it was considered essential to
make the best speed. The escort carried out
independent’ zig-zags.

17. At 0g20 course was altered to 270 degs.
to make more westing, and at 1220 to 250 degs.
to make the probable enemy surface contact as
late as possible.

18. At 1332 a JU.88 dropped 4 red flares .

ahead of the convoy—a probable indication that
enemy surface forces were in the vicinity—
though it was not thought that they should
make contact before 1630 or 1700.

1g. At 1410 EURYALUS reported smoke
bearing 353 degs. This was not seen from
CLEOPATRA. A further signal at 1417 said
report was uncertain.

20. At 1230 Organisation No. 4* was
assumed as it was decided that the convoy
would not turn back but proceed to Malta even
if enemy surface forces made contact.
Destroyers had been ordered to raise steam for

Full Speed at 1400 (they had been at $ hour’s
notice for Full Speed).

A signal was made ordering Divisions to form
up on a northerly course in the event of a
contact being made.

PuaseE I.
ar. Reports
: 1427 ‘‘4 suspicious vessels bearing 040
degs.’’ received from EURYALUS.
1427 ‘“‘r unknown bearing oro degs. 12
miles ’’ received from LEGION,

1429 Signal ‘‘ZLG”’ transmitted from
CLEOPATRA (C.S.15).

1432 ‘‘ 4 unknown bearing o15 degs. 15
miles '’ received from LEGION.

1434 ‘‘3 battleships bearing oo degs. 12

miles ’’ transmitted from CLEOPATRA
(C.S.15).
z506 “Enemy previously reported as

battleships now believed to be cruisers ’
transmitted from C.S.15.

22. As soon as the enemy were,reported the
signal ‘‘ ZLG ’’ was made and caeried out
exactly as detailed in the operation orders.

The convoy turned away from the enemy to
aro degs. while all Divisional Leaders led out
to the northward to concentrate by divisions.

During this phase of the action, LEGION
joined the Fourteenth Destroyer Flotilla with
the First Division at 1507 and remained with
them for the rest of the day.

23. As soon as divisions were clear of the
convoy to the northward, an easterly smoke-
laying course was shaped—about 1435. The
enemy opened fire at this time and the first
splashes were seen well short about 1436.
Enemy disposition

24. The enemy ate believed to have con-
sisted of one eight-inch and three six-inch
cruisers disposed abeam about 2 miles apart
on a course of 200 degrees.

They turned beam on on a southeasterly
course about 1436 and away about 1442 and
then to the northwest, finally retiring on
approximate course o10 degs. about 1501.

25. CLEOPATRA led the Fourth Division
towards the enemy at 1444 and the Rear Ad-
miral Commanding, Fifteenth Cruiser Squad-
ron’s signal ‘‘ Turn towards the enemy ’’ was
made at 1445.

26. CLEOPATRA and EURYALUS engaged
one cruiser from 1456 to 1509 when the enemy
passed out of range. The remaining divisions
were fouled by smoke which was made con-
tinuously -by all ships from 1433 until 1516.
At 1507 a signal was made to Mediterranean
Fleet in company ‘‘ Enemy’s course oro degs.”’

27. One enemy cruiser turned to the west-
northwestward about 1509 and engaged the
Fourth Division from 1511 to 1515, straddling
several times even after the division had re-
tired into smoke. This was probably due to
aircraft spotting. A few salvos were fired at
this ship from 151r to 1513 and she turned
away at the same time as CLEOPATRA at
I515- ‘

At 1535 the Rear Admiral Commanding, Fif-
teenth Cruiser Squadron, reported to the Com
mander-in-Chief: ‘‘ Enemy driven off”.

28. Course was then shaped 235 degs. and
Guides of Divisions disposed on a line of
bearing 3x0 degs.—130 degs. 14 miles apart
