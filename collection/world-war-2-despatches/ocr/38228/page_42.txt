steamers and proceeded upstream for Sittaung.
The Headquarters 17 Division, 7 Armoured
Brigade, the embarkation and administrative
staff from’Shwegyin and the animal transport
were ferried across to Kalewa, which was at
this time held by the 63 Infantry Brigade.

75. The Transport Problem. By'the oth
May, staging camps on the route to Tamu had
been established at Kalewa, Imbaung,
Yezagyo, Khampat and Witok and the Army
and Corps Troops were steadily marching from
camp to camp as were the thousands of refugees
which were now across the Chindwin.

-- Transport was the great problem. Fortunately
the: Commander 4 Corps who was now in
command in Assam was able to place at my
disposal a G.P.T. company which proved of
inestimable value. I must also mention here
the excellent work done by the 7 Armoured
Brigade, whose high morale and great fighting
capacity I have frequently stressed. During
the withdrawal it was necessary to take from the
7 Armoured Brigade nearly all their vehicles for
use in the general pool both east and west of
the Chindwin, and after their tanks and
remaining vehicles had been abandoned at
Shwegyin, this Brigade continued to find
drivers not only for the vehicles brought across
the Chindwin but also to supplement the
drivers of G.P.T. companies working north
and south of Tamu. Six to seven hundred men
were employed in this way. No praise is too
high for the work done by this formation.

76. Final Stages of the Withdrawal While
the withdrawal of the main body had been in
progress the 2 Burma Brigade was still moving
up the Myittha Valley and on the 4th May
orders had been issued by wireless for it to
reach Kalemyo by the r4th May. The G.P.T.
company -placed at my disposal by the Com-
mander of 4 Corps enabled this move to be
accelerated and the Brigade was moved north
by M.T. from Manipur River, crossing on the
13th May.

97. The withdrawal now continued without
incident. Tactically, the principal anxiety of
the Commander rz Burcorps was that the
enemy, moving up the Chindwin, which was
parallel to the road Kalemyo-Tamu, might cut
in and get astride his line of withdrawal. Even
a small enemy force could have imposed a
serious delay at this stage. Fortunately this
threat did’ not develop.

78. On the r1th May, Lieut.-General N. M. S.
Irwin, Commanding 4 Corps came to see me
at my Headquarters near Tamu. I had already
been informed that my army would withdraw
through his covering force on the Lokchao
River north of Tamu. I discussed with General
Irwin his plans for the movement of my force
tothe Imphal area, which had received the
approval of the Commander-in-Chief in India.

‘79: On the 14th May, Headquarters 1
Burcorps moved to Tamu and the next day I
moved my Headquarters out of Burma to
Kangpokpi, thirty miles north of Imphal. All
troops of the Burma Army arriving in India
now came under command of 4 Corps,

The withdrawal of 1 Burcorps, which was
skilfully conducted, proceeded according to
plan and by the 17th May all formations were
successfully concentrated in the Tamu area.

At 1800 hours on the 20th May I placed the
rear guard of x Burcorps under command of
4 Corps and my task came to an end.

Part VII—AbDMINISTRATION

80. I have already mentioned the
administrative situation as it was affected by
the fall of Rangoon. The back loading of sup-
plies and stores to Central and Upper Burma
had been put in hand by General Hutton in
January, and as a result reserves were available
in the Mandalay area when Rangoon was lost.
In the final stages of the evacuation, however,
supplies and stores were, in view of the
Japanese threat to the Rangoon-Mandalay rail-
way, back loaded up the Irrawaddy Valley.
The results of back loading on this line with the
railway ending at Prome were twofold: —

_ (a) A large number of locomotives and a
good deal of rolling stock were inevitably
lost.

(b) Supplies and stores had to be trans-
ferred to ships and flats on the Irrawaddy
and considerable stocks were accumulated in
the Prome area.

81. Administrative Appreciation. At the end
of March a review of the stock situation in
Burma was prepared by my administrative
staff. The conclusions reached in this review
were :—

(a) Supplies. The stocks of imported sup-
plies together with present stocks plus future
purchases of indigenous supplies were suffi-
cient to feed the army for six months from
1st April. There was, however, the
important proviso that the estimate must be
reduced if:—

(i) Sources. of indigenous supplies could
not be held. ‘

(ii) There was a further loss of stocks
through enemy action.

The importance of this proviso was soon
demonstrated. | Large quantities of supplies
were lost when the enemy captured Prome and
there were further losses in the bombing and
subsequent fires in Mandalay.

On the Toungoo front, the withdrawal to the
north of that town surrendered to the Japanese
some of the best rice growing areas in Burma.
it will be seen that no great reliance could
be placed on future purchases of indigenous
supplies. The collection of these supplies
became more and more difficult as the civil
organisation disintegrated under enemy air
attack.

(b) Petrol and Oil. Excellent work had
been done by the administrative staff and the
oilfield engineers in initiating the production
of spirit and the manufacture of drums.
Stocks held amounted to 1,000,000 gallons
of petrol and 89,000 gallons of lubricants.
By the 28th March production was at the rate
of 1,100,000 gallons of spirit per month which
was likely to rise to 1,600,000 gallons by the
16th April and 2,000,000 gallons by the first
week in May. Requirements were estimated
at 1,300,000 gallons a month. Provided the
oilfields could be held the petrol and oil
situation was satisfactory.

(c) Medical. There were sufficient stocks
for six months except in the case of a few
items which could be flown in.
