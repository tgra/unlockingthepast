Horsed transport and pack mule companies
were formed for use in Cyria, Cyprus and
Eritrea.

“Major-General C. le B. Goldney continued to
perform the duties of Director of Supplies and
‘Transport throughout the period, and I greatly
appreciated his unfailing and steadfast support.

Local Production.—In order to effect further
savings in shipping space, local production was
stimulated still further. Three and a half
million anti-tank mines, forty self-propelled 200-
ton landing craft and thirty roo-ton lighters
were among the numerous articles constructed
in the Middle East. Expenditure on account of
Ordnance supplies alone rose from {400,000
to £800,000 Egyptian.

Salvage.—The salvage organisation, which
had developed enormously by November 1941
as a result of intense propaganda and the in-
culeation throughout the Command of the need
for economy, continued to grow and to extend
its activities. Seven salvage depots were operat-
ing in Egypt, six in Syria and Palestine, five in
Eritrea and one at Khartoum. These depots
were staffed largely by local civilians, super-
vised by a few British personnel. - :

Among the salvage shipped to the United

Kingdom, India and elsewhere, were 5,000 tons
of scrap steel, 1,000 tons of tyres and rubber,
and 380 tons of brass. Over 30,000 tyres,
1,750,000 bottles, mainly for distilled water for
motor vehicles, 865 tons of camouflage material,
and 32,000 forty-gallon drums were made ser-
viceable and reissued, besides thousands of fons
of re-manufactured metals and other materials.
’ For the operations in Cyrenaica special
salvage officers and units were attached to the
Eighth Army. Salvage depots were established
as the troops went forward; and, although col-
lection could not keep pace with the advance,
much material was salved. Amongst the equip-
ment collected and sent back to the base were
164 British and 330 enemy guns, over 15,000
rifles, more than a million petrol tins, 3,000
tons of ammunition and 1,200 tons of scrap
metal.

In view of.the poor design of our own petrol
containers, a special effort was: made to salve
as many as possible of the very efficient German
petrol and water containers. At Bengasi over
two million of them were discovered, but only
a few could be removed before the enemy made
his counterstroke. -

Printing and Stationery.—The Army Printing
and Stationery Service assumed responsibility
for supplying the Royal Navy-and the Royal
Air Force, and also for providing newsprint
fog military and semi-military purposes. The
base depot at Suez was enlarged-to handle five
hundred tonsa month, © :

The General Headquarters Printing Press was
greatly expanded, the number of machines
being increased: from thirty to sixty-two, while
the output was trebled. - The importance of an
efficient and adequate printing service to the
Army cannot be over-estimated. :

Postal Services—Under Colonel W. R.
Roberts, Deputy Director, the Army Postal
Service continued to serve the troops most satis-
factorily and to deal efficiently with an ever-
increasing volume of business in spite of con-
siderable transportation difficulties. . .

The airgraph service was further developed
and the number of letters despatched and re-
ceived weekly by this system increased from
about three hundred thousand in November

Ig41 to just over one million in August 1942.
Articles of all classes posted weekly in British
Army Post Offices in the Command during May
¥942 averaged a million and three-quarters.

Ordnance Services.—A chronic shortage‘ of
base ordnance workshop units was experienced,
and as a result it was some time before the
accumulation of tanks in need of repair could
be cleared. Moreover, every tank imported
from overseas had to be modified for the desert.
Workshop accommodation was __ increased,
nevertheless, chiefly by impressing civilians and
civilian firms. This enabled methods of work-
ing to be improved, and repairs and overhauls
are on a mass producton rather than on an
individual basis. Since November 1941 the
number of s and vehicles overhauled in
workshops was doubled. Nearly 40,000
vehicles and 5,000 guns were overhauled and
15,000 vehicles and 5,000 guns modified.

The recovery. organisation was improved by
every means that could be: devised subject
always to the shortage of recovery vehicles.
In the campaign of November-December 1941
recovery fell far-short of the standard achieved
by the Germans, partly because there were
very few recovery vehicles and partly because
the organisation itself was defective. By June
1942 we had received more recovery vehicles
and the organisation had been thoroughly re-
vised with the result that recovery from the
battlefield of Gazala was at least as good as
if not better than the German.

(Major-General W.-W. Richards continued-to
inspire and direct the work of the Ordnance
Services with energy, foresight and determina-
tion and it is largely due to him that they
reached.so high a standard of efficiency.

Signals.—The signal organisation continued
to operate with the utmost efficiency through-
out the period and the service was further de-
veloped. A serious shortage of personnel as
well as equipment continued to be experienced;
and it- was due to: the ingenuity and efficiency
of Major-General W.-R. C. Penney, my Signal
Officer-in-Chief, and his staff-that operations
and administration did not suffer as a result
of these shortcomings. To meet the shortage
of signal personnel, it was necessary to con-
vert two Yeomanry regiments into signal units.
The regiments concerned accepted this decision
most loyally, and rapidly became efficient in
their new role...

‘Medical Services.—The medical services con-
tinued to function with great efficiency under
the able and energetic: direction of Major-
General P. S. Tomlinson; my Director of
Medical Services. :

Experience in operations in Libya showed
that casualty clearing stations should have their
own transport and be fully mobile. It was
also clear that all-mobile medical units should
have their own means of wireless communica-
tion. Mobile surgical teams were formed and
attached to main dressing stations and casualty
clearing stations. These teams worked on the
battlefield and proved of inestimable value, as
did mobile blood transfusion units. A small
number of air ambulances was available, and
it is essential that more should be provided to
enable serious cases to be evacuated rapidly
and smoothly. . . .
