Forces in Europe to the Allied Expeditionary

Lieutenant-General W. B. Smith on behalf of
the Supreme Commander, General Suslaparoff
on behalf of the Russians and General Sevez
on behalf of the provisional Government of

Chief signed the orders to the German Navy.

38. In Berlin on the 8th May, soon after
midnight, Field-Marshal Keitel, Grand Admiral
Friedeberg and General Stumph, the plenipo-
tentiaries of the German High Command,
signed the unconditional surrender of all the

Nations. The Allied Naval Commander-in-
Chief was present at the signature which was

39. The orders for the surrender of the
German Fleet were contained in ‘‘ Eclipse ’”
Memo, No. 1 originally issued in July, 1944,
and revised and brought up to date since.
‘‘ Eclipse’? Memo. No. 1 contained the
Supreme Commander’s orders to the German
armed forces for the conduct of their surrender
when it came, and besides instructions in
general terms contained specialised orders to
the German Navy and Air Force. The naval
section gave detailed instructions as to the
conduct of the German Fleet after surrender
and its initial provisions may be summarised
as follows :—

(a) The immediate despatch of a respon-
sible German Flag Officer to A.N.C.X.F.
with details of all minefields in North-West
European waters, of the location of all de-
partments and branches of the German
Admiralty (Ober Kommando der Kriegs-
marine) and details of locations of all ser-
vice warships down to and including Elbing
Class torpedo boats as well as minesweepers
and Sperrbrethers. This Flag Officer was to
bring with him a Communications Officer
able to explain all communications matters
including particulars of the codes and cyphers
in current use in the Germany Navy.

(b) The despatch of responsible officers to
the Commanders-in-Chief, The Nore and
Rosyth, with charts of all minefields and
other navigational information on the North
Sea. Certain other German naval officers
were also to be detailed for specialised duties
with British naval authorities.

(c) Much more detailed information on the
current state of the German Navy was to
be supplied by the German High Command
to A.N.C.X.F. within 14 days of the surren-
der.

40. Orders for the surrender of the German
U-Boat fleet were issued by the Admiralty and
the planning and the co-ordination of the opera-
tions necessary to receive the surrender of the
U-Boats were the responsibility of the Com-
mander-in-Chief, Western Approaches.

4x. When the surrender occurred the naval
special orders (which embodied the basic special
orders which had been agreed between the
British, United States, Soviet and French Naval
Authorities) were issued to the German
Admiralty as they stood, and in addition the
Admiralty issued orders by signal to German
submarines at sea giving them instructions on

how to proceed to surrender. One small ad-
justment to the naval special orders had to be
made to include German naval garrisons in
the Mediterranean, which was outside the
Supreme Commander’s sphere of responsibility.
As the orders to Ober Kommando der
Wehrmacht in respect of all three services were
not actually issued and as the naval special
orders only dealt with matters of naval import,
no instructions were in fact issued to the
German Admiralty (O.K.M.) on such general
matters as orders for prisoners-of-war, German
responsibility for maintenance of armed forces
and so on.

Use of German Codes and Cyphers.

42. On the roth May S.H.A.E.F. (Forward)
gave instructions to O.K.W.* that no codes
or cyphers were to be used except in the case
of signals to units of the German Fleet, when
codes could be used until 2359 on 11th May.
It was then realised that the German naval
authorities could not issue instructions in plain
language to their U-Boats in the Far Eastern
waters to comply with the surrender terms be-
cause the U-Boats might not believe the authen-
ticity of the message and the Japanese would
probably prevent their leaving. Accordingly
instructions were given that codes were to be
used for this special purpose of giving orders
to U-Boats in Far Eastern waters.

Compliance with naval special orders.

43. The German authorities complied with
naval special orders as well as circumstances
permitted and O.K.W. broadcast an order
against scuttling on the roth May. ' The naval
representatives arrived at the Headquarters of
British naval authorities in England as in-
structed and in such numbers that both the
Commanders-in-Chief concerned asked that the
duplicate parties for which provision had been
made should not be sent. ‘

44. The naval representatives detailed to pro-
ceed to the Headquarters of A.N.C.X.F. arrived
at Rheims p.m. on the roth May and were sent
under escort to A.N.C.X.F.’s Headquarters.
This delegation consisted of Vice-Admiral Ruge,
Rear-Admiral Godt (Submarines) with Com-
mander Koltzer as communications officer.
These officers’ proved most co-operative and
gave all the information required by the naval
special orders except certain hydrographical
information which could only be produced by
the various sub-commands and certain informa-
tion about mines on the western seaboard of
the Atlantic. These three German officers left
A.N.C.X.F.’s Headquarters a.m. gn the z4th
May with instructions to provide further infor-
mation; these instructions were complied with
to the best of their ability.

Control of O.K.W. and O.K.M.

45. On the oth May A.N.C.X.F. nominated
Captain G. O. Maund, D.S.O., R.N., and °
Commander H. C. C. Ainslie, D.S.C.,
R.N.Z.N., as the naval representatives on
General Rook’s mission to O.K.W. These offi-
cers left for Flensburg by air on the 12th May.

46. Captain Sir John M. Alleyne, D.S.O.,
O.B.E., R.N., was the senior naval represen-
tative on the O.K.M. ministerial control party,
and he left Versailles for Flensburg on the 14th
May. On the 15th May A.N.C.X.F. placed
Captain Alleyne in charge of O.K.M.
