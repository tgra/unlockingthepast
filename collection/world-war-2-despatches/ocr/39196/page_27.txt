SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

of men and stocks of essential equipment in
India has decreased. A more fluid and
economical base organisation should be pos-
sible as the war progresses.

192. Energetic action has been taken, now
that the pipe line is secure, to reduce the reserve
holdings of aircraft and equipment which clog
the machinery of supply and absorb so much
of the Command resources in manpower and
Storage space in India. An extensive re-
organisation to undertake more maintenance
in the field is contemplated, and, it is hoped,
will do much to avoid the bottlenecks to which
centralised maintenance is prone. Such a
reorganisation is only possible if the scales
of ground equipment, hand tools and other
servicing facilities are adequate and fully main-
tained. For an Air Force working in the field
a generous scale of equipment is essential, and
the lack of it was largely responsible for the
uneconomical base maintenance organisation
which events forced upon South East Asia in
its early stages. The saving in man-hours that
results from a generous scale of ‘ground equip-
ment is vast. This should always be taken
into account in campaigns in tropical countries
where sickness and lack of communications
militate against units possessing their full
establishment.

IV. Administration.

193. The standard of unit administration in
the operational areas was not high. With
formations spread over wide areas, and
deficiencies in ground officers also in the
majority of vital trades, notably among clerical
and signals personnel, much of this has been
inevitable. Nevertheless a very real need
exists for the indoctrination of service per-
sonnel in overseas theatres of war with the
principles of self-reliance and better improvisa-
tion.

194, The principles of mobility and self-help

have only resulted from the perception of
those on the spot to train personnel in the

1991

rudiments of active campaigning. In so doing
they have made the best use of local resources
to achieve that standard of morale and well-
being which are the prerequisite of good dis-
cipline. The posting of a squadron com-
mander from a well-established bomber base
at home to an overseas appointment with no
preliminary training in his changed circum-
Stances cannot but have an adverse effect upon
the well-being of the Unit. The setting-up of
Junior Commanders’ Courses within the
theatre is the best immediate remedy, but the
problems of accommodation, and the time
absent from units, rendered it little more than
a palliative in this theatre.

V. Air Transport.

195. Finally, the Air Forces, having given a
new-found mobility to land warfare, must also
take advantage of it. ‘When assessing bids
for air transport and air supply, the highest
priority should be given to the rapid movement
of spares, personnel, and indeed whole R.A.F.
units, in order to keep the force working at
maximum efficiency. It is bad economy to
keep the 15 serviceable ont of 20 available air-
craft supplying the ground forces when the
diversion of one aeroplane to collect A.O.G.*
spares would raise the serviceability rate to 18.
If full advantage is taken of air transport, the
striking radius of the Air Force can be still
further extended, and the application of air
power to any situation made more rapid and
more decisive than hitherto.
