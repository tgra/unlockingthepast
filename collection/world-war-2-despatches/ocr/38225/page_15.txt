SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON. GAZETTE, 4 MARCH, 1948

Approach to objective. «

13. H.M.S, INDOMITABLE joined Flag on
3rd May and contact was made between Con-
voys Y and Z, the latter slowing down and
increasing zig-zag so as to remain in rear.

14. Approval having been received from
S.0.F., the object of the expedition was
announced to all officers and men, maps were
issued and Assault Commanders gave lectures
outlining the intended plan.

‘All officers of landing craft received special
instruction to enable them to recognise their
respective beaches. This included the study
of maps, models, panorama sketches and photo-
graphs which had been prepared for the
purpose.

1g. Convoys Y and Z formed into groups
p-m, 4th May and the approach was made
in accordance with the pre-arranged orders.

16. The strong Westerly set which had been
expected between positions AA and ZB did
not materialise Visibility was good and con-
tact was made with H.M.S. LIGHTNING,
anchored off Nosi Fati, as expected. The final
approach was carried out as ordered, groups
anchoring approximately Io -minutes earlier
than planned.

17. Slight inconvenience was caused by the
fact that the first dan had been laid too close
to Nosi Fati. Warning of this however was
received from LAFOREY and ships left this
dan on their starboard hand. Remaining dans
were laid accurately and were easy to pick up;
the successful danning of this channel was a first.
class bit of work and largely contributed to
the result.

18 The successful execution of this
approach, which resulted from long and careful
planning tends to obscure the great difficulties
which were overcome. An extract from a
Memoire Militaire captured ‘from Windsor
Castle battery reads: ‘‘ Tir de nuit n’est pas
envisagé, l’accés de la Baie étant considéré
comme impossible de nuit.”

The Assault.

19. The assault proceeded according to plan,
zero being at 0430 on Tuesday, 5th May (D.z).
WINCHESTER CASTLE’s (Captain Sebastian
Francis Newdigate, Master) (No. 5 Commando
and 2 East Lancs. Regt.), KEREN’s (1st
R.S.F.) and KARANJA’s (2 R.W.F.) flotillas
left their ships at 0230, 0227 and 0319 for
Red, Green and ‘White Beaches respectively.
Complete surprise was effected in spite of the
explosion of at least one mine, and No. 7
battery (Red Beach), White and Green land-
ings were carried out without loss. Landing
craft navigation was as good as that of their
parent ships and all made accurate beachings.

In accordance with the tactical plan, Blue
Beach was then assaulted and encountered
machine-gun fire, but was carried.

20. On receipt of the success signal from
No. § Commando, KEREN, KARANJA,
WINCHESTER, CASTLE, SOBIESKI and
BACHAQUERO were ordered to anchor in the
main anchorage off Ambararata Bay. WIN-
CHESTER CASTLE and BACHAQUERO led
whilst remainder loaded their second flight.

A signal reporting mines near position HH
at the end of the main anchorage had not
been received in KEREN, but DEVONSHIRE,

1603

who had got it and who was then anchored
East .of. Nosi Hara, promptly and properly
ordered both ships to stop. The departure
of the remaining ships was therefore delayet
by me, until further minesweeping had been
carried out. :

2i. Up to this time surprise had been
achieved and by 0620 about 2,300 of our troops
were ashore. On the other hand, tht tum
round for landing craft was very long, and as
LAFOREY, LIGHTNING and ROYAL
‘ULSTERMAN were anchored in or near a
minefield, I ordered them to remain at anchor.

My joint Assault Commander, Brigadier
F. W. Festing and his Command Post landed
at o710 at White Beach.

22. Reports of successful advance and taking
of prisoners began to come in. At 0750
KEREN led Group IV to the main anchorage
where minesweeping had just been completed,
followed by the remainder of the assault force.
About this time, the S.E. wind had increased
to about force 8* and raised a sea of such
size that in any other circumstances I would
have ordered boats to be hoisted. Ships
dropped second anchors.

The handling and loading of craft under
these circumstances was exemplary. None
were put out of action, and disembarkation
continued at full speed.

23. Sweeping continued and at 1138 I regret
to report that H.M.S. AURICULA struck a
mine close to position HH (without loss of life),
and remained anchored by her sweep. No
action could be taken without prejudice to
the operation and risk to the other ships and
sweepers, and as she had ceased to sink she
was left where she was, her back being broken.

‘By this time, minesweepers were 50 per cent.
out of action, 35 mines had been swept and
sweepers had done splendidly.

24. White Beach, opposite main anchorage,
then became unsuitable after half tide so Blue
was developed. This involved a 2 mile further
turn round for landing craft, but with the risk
of yet more sweeper casualties I ordered sweep-
ing to cease and accepted the longer turn round
in order to preserve the minesweepers for
sweeping the Fleet into Diego Suarez harbour.

3125. The landing continued at full pressure,

-two or three machine-gun. attacks being made

on the beaches during the day by enemy fighter
aircraft, Fleet Air Arm fighter patrols how-
ever provided effective protection and with the
initial air blow on the aerodrome, no attacks
were made on the transports. Landing opera-
tions were suspended during the period from
sunset to moonrise, to avoid damage to craft.

26. About 1354 an enemy post on Windsor
Castle became a nuisance and a little later was
engaged by LAFOREY. Shortly after, signals
of surrender and a white flag were observed
and fire was ceased. The following morning
LAFOREY and LIGHTNING engaged this
post which was found to be empty on our
troops taking possession.

27. The Hospital Ship ATLANTIS arrived
in the afternoon, being led by a corvette
through the swept channel to her anchorage
close West of the main anchorage.
