to 18 knots and the third 18 to 15 knots, Force
‘‘H” maintaining an intercepting position to
the eastward throughout.

26th May. .

6. During the night the north-westerly wind
and sea increased, and speed had to be reduced
to 23 knots at 2x15, to 21 knots at 2340, to
Ig knots at 0020 and finally to 17 knots at
orr2.

7. In consequence of this reduction of speed,
which the BISMARCK with a fellowing sea
would not have suffered, course was altered to
000° at 0300/26 to reach the best position for
flying off the search.

8. The latest intelligence regarding the
German: battle: cruisers was contained in a re-
connaissance report that they were’ still at Brest
at 1515/23. This lack of information caused
me ‘some anxiety as I could not entirely dis-
count the possibility that one or both battle-
cruisers might have put to sea to support
BISMARCK. With this possibility in view a
security patrol was flown off at 0716 to search
to the west and northward before assuming
A/S duties.

g. It had been intended that the first search
should cover the area bounded by 47° 30’ N.
21° 30’.W., 49° 00’ N. 23° 40’ W., 52° 25’ N.
20° oo’ W., 51° 40’ N. 17° oo’ W., but owing
to the head seas experienced during the night
the area for the search, measuring some 280
miles by 120 miles was transferred 35 miles
to the south-east.

to. Ten Swordfish were flown off at 0835
‘from position 48° 26’ N. 19° 13’ W. Two
cross-over patrols by Catalinas, arranged by the
Admiralty, lay along thé western edge of
ARK ROYAL’s reconnaissance. Weather
conditions at this time were wind from
320° force 7, sea rough, sky overcast, visibility
Io-12 miles. It had been hoped to increase the
density of the search by the use of Fulmars,
but weather conditions rendered this impractic-
able. ARK ROYAL’s round down was rising
and falling 56 feet at times, as measured by
sextant: The handling of the aircraft on the
flight deck was always difficult and several slid
bodily across the deck which was wet with
spray.

rr. At og30 the A/S patrol was landed on;
no relief was flown off in order that every
available aircraft should be available for a
torpedo striking force. Whilst the search was
in progress Force ‘‘ H ’’ proceeded at 15 knots
on a course of or5° to reach .a position to
windward so that the operation of aircraft
would not be impeded by subsequent altera-
tions of course of the BISMARCK should the
latter be located.

Iz. At 1030 a Catalina (Duty Z) made a
report of ‘‘ 1 BS 240° 5 miles steering 150 from
position KRGP 3313 "’. This report, received at
1050, placed the enemy 285° 112 miles from
RENOWN. An amplifying report five minutes
later gave the enemy’s speed as 20 knots. I
instructed ARK ROYAL to fly off two
shadowers fitted with long range tanks to gain
touch, as I feared the Catalina’s ‘position might
be somewhat inaccurate in view of the weather
conditions and the distance from her base.
As the reconnaissance .aircraft ‘had already

4861

reached the limit of their search I decided not
to recallsthem by wireless, but informed ARK
ROYAL that I would continue the present
course and: speed until they had returned when

-a full scale striking force was to be prepared.

33. At 1114 the Catalina reported that her
hull had been holed by shrapnel and requested
instructions. I asked ARK ROYAL how many
aircraft would be required to ensure gaining
contact; she replied 6 but proposed to fly off
the two aircraft fitted with long range tanks
at once to carry out a square search,

14. At this time (1125) the Catalina lost
touch and I instructed ARK ROYAL to
send at least 4 aircraft, Before these could
be flown off one of ARK ROYAL/’s aircraft
reported in touch (at 1114) but also reported
the enemy as a cruiser and gave the position
of the enemy as 77 miles to the west of Force
“HH”, Tihis was some 25 miles further to
the eastward than the Catalina’s report but
was considered to be a more accurate position
in view of the shorter time, interval between
departure and sighting. Seven minutes later a
second aircraft of the reconnaissance gained
touch and reported that the enemy was a battle-
ship. The aircraft on track 305° was the first
to sight followed by the aircraft on track 285°.
There were five more aircraft to the northward
of these two and three more to the southward.
These aircraft were on their way back to the
ARK ROYAL when touch was first gained. The
long range shadowers were flown off at noon
and the majority of the reconnaissance landed
on. Force ‘ H” was then manoeuvred to the
south-east on a course 140° at 24 knots, my
intention ‘being to maintain the weather gage
for flying operations, to avoid loss of bearing
on BISMARCK, and to keep within about’50
miles of the enemy to facilitate the launching
of T/B attacks. Shoitd it be desirable for
RENOWN to attack unsupported it was my
intention to do so from up wind and astern
with the object of causing him to turn and thus
slow up his retreat, and also to enable full use
to be made of smoke.

15. The two shadowers were relieved as -
necessary throughout the day. Touch was
maintained «continuously and excellent reports
transmitted until the shadowers were finally
recalled at 2230.

16. Orders were received from Admiralty at
1145 that RENOWN was not to become
engaged with BISMARCK unless the latter was
already theavily engaged by either KING
GEORGE V or RODNEY.

17. The Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet,
reported his position at ro50 as 51” 37’ N.
20° 42’ W., closing the ship reported by the
Catalina, and requested Admiralty confirmation
that the report did,not refer'to RODNEY.
This was confirmed by Admiralty.

18, At 1208 the Catalina reported 4 UN* 050°
to miles steering 140° from position KRG7
4731. It was assumed that these were four
of the five destroyers which had just parted
from Convoy W.S.8B, and who were now some
50 miles W.N.W. of the BISMARCK.
