44. The Naval Officer-in-Charge, Suda, is much to be complimented on the celerity with which this convoy was handled and sailed.

The various ships bringing in over 5,000 men:

from Greece did not arrive at Suda till 0730 onwards and the redistribution of these troops

into transports and fuelling of destroyers, as-

well as the embarkation of a further 5,000 men from the shore was a most complicated task in the three hours available, and fully occupied all transport available.

45. Uncompleted Evacuations. Ther  . were still several uncompleted evacuations at this time.

(a) Kalamata. 1 requested your instructions regarding this place as it appeared likely that only small numbers could be collected. On teceipt of your 0945/29th* I detailed ISIS,

. HERO and KIMBERLEY to leave Suda at

1700 and proceed to Kalamata, leaving not later than 0300/3o0th, returning to Suda. They embarked 16 officers and 17 other ranks.

The same ships again visited the Kalamata area on the might 30th April/zst May and collected. the following:  

ISIS 2 officers and 60 troops, HERO  +. 5 Officers and 56 troops, KIMBERLEY 16 officers and 63 troops,

  a total of 202. They reported that any chance

of further embarkation was slender as the Germans were mopping up.

() Milo and Nio (fos). The Naval Officer-inCharge, Suda had reported 2,000 British and Greek troops in Milo, probably mostly Greeks. I later heard that there were 600 British troops at Nio and I detailed HAVOCK and HOTSPUR to visit this island during the night 2gth/3oth and, if necessary, to go on to Milo if further information was received regarding that place.

. At 1126/29th I received the Naval Officerin-Charge, Suda's signal ro44/zgth giving Admiralty footnote :-  .

  in this signal the Commander int Chief's th ris oh should be made fat hghh 29th/3oth.

further information re Milos. It stated that

. there were approximately 3,500 British troops on the nd and

that those on Nio had cape by motor caique, also that magnetic mines had probably been laid. I therefore cancelled my original instructions to HOTSPUR and HAVOCK and told Naval Officer-inCharge, Suda to endeavour to obtain more in-

"formation and use his discretion as to carrying

out the operation.

HOTSPUR and HAVOCK visited Milo on the night 30th April/1st May and evacuated 700 British and Palestinian trong, leaving none. :

(c) Syra. Colonel Macky and 50 Anzacs

} were reported to be at Syra bo opportunity

did not offer for bringing (@ Leonidton. Colonel Smith-Dorrien and

--a party of 20 British, formerly at Leonidion

(para. 38 above), were now known to be at Kyparissi, possibly moving by boat to Monemvasia, _

(e) Lieutenant Commander Willmot, who had been the beachmaster at Raphtis throughout the operation, had asked, through the Commanding Officer, H.M.S. KIMBERLEY, to be fetchedfrom Port Livadhi, Serpho Island (Seriptos), whither he thad presumably gone with his L.C.T.

There were insufficient ships available to collect these small parties whilst there were still large numbers at the beaches on the mainland. I was informed that, Greek money had been issued to the  troops and they had been instructed in theevent of their not being picked up, to endeavour to make their way by caique through the islands of th  Aegean by night to Turkey or Crete. There was, however, no certainty that a party reported at an island . would be there at a later time.

46. Passage to Alexandria. I had instructed PERTH to rendezvous with me at 1400 on 29th off Suda, I sailed from Suda at 1300, 29th April, in accordance with my 1059/29th and proceeded to act as cover for the convoy withAJAX, PERTH, PHOEBE, HASTY, NUBIAN and HEREWARD in company. During a.m. 2gth April, NUBIAN had suffered a near miss and was damaged.

47. During the night of 29th/30th April, whilst passing through the Kaso .Straits, the convoy was attacked by E-boats and possibly torpedo boats from 2315 till 0300. Some torpedoes were fired but no damage was caused to the convoy. Own destroyers chased the enemy off several times.

48. At 0630/30th April, the First Battle Squadron and FORMIDABLE took over close escort of the convoy and I proceeded with AJAX, HASTY and HEREWARD in company to Alexandria in advance of the convoy, leaving PERTH, PHOEBE and NUBIAN to reinforce the Battle Squadron.
