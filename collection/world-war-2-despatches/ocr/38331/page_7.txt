« casualties and delayed progress.

SUPPLEMENT to THz LONDON GAZETTE, 23 JUNE, 1948

both H.M.S. PRINCESS BEATRIX and
H.M.S. QUEEN EMMA had re-embarked all
their troops and were ready to sail.

Inter-communications.

14. Owing to ihe excellence of the fren
munication arrangements made by Lieut.
Marshall G. C. Warmington, Bart., R.N.,
H.M S. SOMALI, it was possible to obtain 4
all times a most clear and_ accurate picture of the
progress of the operations on shore.

The personnel for the various signal detach-
ments were all drawn. from the Home Fleet.
They were faced with the task of operating wire-
less sets to which they were not accustomed,
and with but little time to practise with them.

The ease with which they overcame this diffi-
culty and the speed and accuracy with which
the many signals were passed says much for
their individual skill and for the instruction and
traimng they were given by the ‘naval officer
to whom I have referred above.

State of the light at the time of the landings.

15 The original intention was to make four
simultaneous landings at 0630 hrs. but, after

further examination of the meteorological data,.

it was considered that such early landings would
force the A.L.C.s and M.L.C:s* to make their
difficult approaches in conditions of what may
be termed “‘ dangerous ’”’ darkness.

The time of landing was ‘therefore put back
to 0645 hrs.

In the event the morning of March 4th was
exceptionally clear and calm. There was no
fog, no sea mist, no rain or snow and what
breeze there was iblew from a.favourable though
unusual quartér.

Thus the landing craft approached the shore
under rather better light conditions than were
required or were desirable.

However, it is difficult to see how such rare
conditions can be legislated for except by
abandoning the idea of making the landings
simultaneously and allowing instead a 30 or 45
minutes period during any part of which they
may take place.

[he obvious danger of such a procedure is
that the defences at the point where the earliest
landing is made may be given time to warn
other points at which landings are attempted 10
or 20 minutes later.

Effect of low temperatures.

16 Even during the short passage between
H.M.S QUEEN ‘EMMA, H.M.S. PRINCESS
BEATRIX and the various ports, it was found
that weapons had a distinct tendency to freeze
up and become hard to operate.

Should such low temperatures be anticipated
again in the future, some special arrangements
would have to be made to guard against this
danger.

Opposition.

17. At no point on shore was any opposition

encountered, though some of the enemy person-
nel, notably those at the air station outside
Svolvaer who were armed with a machine-gun
and other weapons, might well have inflicted

known, the only shots fired by the enemy were
the three or four rounds aimed at H.M.S:
SOMALI by the armed trawler KREBS. No
casualties were incurred by our troops.

Recepiion by the inhabitants.

18. The reports received from the Military
Commanders at each port show that in every
case our troops were given a welcome, the
genuine enthusiasm of which cannot be
doubted.

Although it must have been abundantly clear
that the demohtions which were being carried

through would inevitably have sad effects on the

livelihood of many, there always seemed to be
the over-riding realisation that they were well
worth aiding and abetting so long as they were
also the means of returding and interfering
with production urgently required by the
enemy.

In many instances, the gifts distributed ‘by
our troops were at once matched by presents
given to them by the inhabitants. In short,
they were welcomed by a people whose natural
viriity and inherent soundness of character
had ridden safely over the many insidious
dangers which must follow from months of
enemy occupation.

Military action at the four ports.
19. The following were the Senior Military
Officers at each port:— .
At Stamsund—Major J. F. Durnford-
Slater, R.A.
At Hlenhingsvaer—Captain A. S. Ronald,
K.R.R.C. -
At Svolvaer—Lieut. Colonel D. S. Lister,
MC., The Buffs. ‘
At Brettesnes—Major M. E Kerr, The
Rifle Brigade.
20. The characteristics which "seem to stand

out from the operations as a whole are the

excellent and frequent reports rendered by the
senior officers at each port; the speed with
which the’detachments carried out their allotted
duties, and the initiative shown by junior com-
manders in seeking for and carrying through
useful and important tasks in addition to those
specifically mentioned in the operation orders.

.I would particularly bring to your notice
Lieut.-Colonel D. S. Lister, M.C., The Buffs,
who was in command of the operations at
Svolvaer and ‘Brettesnes and Major J. F. Durn-
ford-Slater, Royal Artillery, who commanded
the troops at Stamsund and Henningsvaer.

az. Lieutenant H. M.: Turner, Royal
Engineers, and his section of No. 55 Field
Company Royal Enginers accomplished ex-
cellent work and carried out their tasks in a
most skilled and competent manner.

22. Consolidated results of the operation are
given in the Annexure

Assistance rendered by the Norwegian troops.

23. It is not too much to say that the opera-
tions on shore could not have been carried
through within the time limits laid down in
the Operation Orders or with the ease or good
relations and understanding that existed had
it- not been for the enthusiastic help and co-
operation of the Norwegian detachment com-
manded by Captain Martin Linge.

This officer never spared himself for: one
moment either during the preparatory period
or during the raid itself.

His “enthusiasm and personality were infec-
tious and it is hoped that his most valuable
services and those of his detachment may be

‘ brought to the notice of the Norwegian

authorities.
