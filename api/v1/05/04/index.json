On the morning of the 6th the 9 Corps attack would start before dawn on a front of three thousand yards with 4 British Division right and 4 Indian Division left, supported by artillery concentra- tions from over four hundred guns, centrally controlled. The infantry were to begin by seizing a line north of the road through the small village of Frendj, about six thousand yards from the start line. 6 Armoured Division was to follow 4 British, and 7 Armoured 4 Indian.

Bomber Command attacked in force the tank depot at Mailly-leCamp. 1,924 tons . of bombs were dropped and assessment photo- graphs show the whole target to have been severely damaged. In the mechanical trans- port section and barracks, 34 out of 47 build- ings were totally destroyed. Even more re- markable results were obtained by an attack on an ammunition dump at Chateaudun carried out on the same night. Eight Mosquitoes of R.A.F. Bomber Command attacked with approximately 13 tons of bombs. The bombs were dropped very accurately and caused sympathetic detonation throughout the dump. In the resulting explosion, the entire west\u00e9rn wing of the depot, containing 90 buildings, was completely destroyed."

In spite of all these . difficulties the attack was begun on 3rd May when the znd Gold Coast Regiment made a wide flanking march cutting their way through the belts of thick forest with their pangas. On 4th May xst Gold Coast Regiment supported by artillery attacked two prominent hills which were strongly held by the enemy. A.F.V.s were sent up an old Abyssinian track to support the flank attack by 2nd Gold Coast R\u00e9giment but could make little progress. Later in the after- noon 2nd Gold Coast Regiment came in.on the enemy\u2019s left rear and by 5th May had cut the toad behind the position. The enemy however still held his main positions and it was not until roth May that he was finally driven from them on the two hills. In capturing this very formidable position the determination shown by the Gold Coast troops sustained the fighting teputation which they had gained in the first phase of the campaign."

Opportunity was taken to exercise the simultaneous sailing from the Isle of Wight area of the three forces based there and also to try out the arrangements whereby A.N.C.X.F.{ would assume control of all operations in \u2018the Channel. So far as the naval assault forces were concerned the exer- cises were satisfactory, but a freshening south- westerly wind in the afternoon of the first day caused the full programme to be curtailed to avoid damage to landing craft. Enemy reac- tion to \u2018\u2018 Fabius \u2019\u2019 was negligible, being con- fined to an aircraft attack on a destroyer in one of the covering forces. That it was not greater, and indeed that our naval preparations proceeded with so little interruption, must be largely attributed to the very high degree of air superiority achieved in the months before D day. .Enemy air reconnaissance was slight and infrequent."
