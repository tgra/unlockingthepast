SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 SEPTEMBER, 1946

Part II.—THe BAarrive.

122. The Battle may be'said to have divided
itself broadly into 4 Phases: First, the attack
on convoys and Coastal objectives, such as
Ports, Coastal Aerodromes and Radio Location

, Stations. Second, the attack of Inland Fighter
Aerodromes. Third, the attack on London.
And fourth, the Fighter-Bomber stage, where
the target was of importance quite subsidiary
to the main object of drawing our Fighters into
the air and engaging them in circumstances as
disadvantageous to us as possible. These
phases indicated only general tendencies; they
overlapped and were not mutually exclusive.

123. It has been estimated that the Germans
sent over, on an average throughout the Battle,
four Fighters to..each Bomber or Fighter-
Bomber, but any such estimate must be very
rough.

124. I must emphasise, throughout, the
extreme versatility of the German methods both
in the timing and direction of their attacks, and
in the tactical formations and methods
employed. .

125. They enjoyed the great advantage of
having a wide front from which attacks could
be delivered. First a blow would be delivered
from Calais, perhaps against London; then after
a_carefully-timed interval, when 11 Group
Fighters might be expected to, be at the end of
their petrol endurance, a heavy attack would
be made on Southampton and Portland. Other
attacks, after being built up to formidable
dimensions, would prove to be only feints, and
the Bombers would turn away before reaching
coast of England, only to return again in half
an hour, when the Fighters, sent up to intercept
them, were landing.

126. Time-honoured methods of escort were
at first employed. A strong Fighter formation
would fly a mile or so behind and above the
Bombers. When the Germans found that our
Fighters could deliver a well-timed attack on the
Bombers before the Fighters could intervene,
or when our Fighters attacked from ahead or
below, each move was met by a counter-move
on the part of the Germans, so that, in Septem-
ber, Fighter escorts were flying inside the
Bomber formation, others were below, and a
series of Fighters stretched upwards to 30,000
feet or more. ,

127. One Squadron Leader described his im-
pressions of the appearance of one of these
raids; he said it was like looking up the escala-
tor at Piccadilly Circus. -

128. I must pay a very sincere tribute to the
Air Officer Commanding No. 11 Group, Air
Vice-Marshal K. R. Park, C.B., M.C., D.F.C.,
for the way in which he adjusted his tactics and
interception methods to meet each new develop-
ment as it occurred.

12g. Tactical control was, as has already
been stated, devolved to the Groups; but
tactical methods were normally laid down by
Command Headquarters. During periods of
intense fighting, however, there was no time for
consultation, and Air Vice-Marshal Park acted
from day to day on his own initiative. We
discussed matters as opportunity offered.

130. He has reported on the tactical aspects
of the Battle in two very interesting documents,
poe are, however, too long to reproduce

ere. '

131. A close liaison was kept between Nos.
to and rr and 12 Groups. It sometimes hap-
pened that, in the heaviest attacks, practically
all rz Group Fighters would be in the air.
11 Group would then ask 12 Group to send a
formation from Duxford to patrol over the
aerodromes immediately East of London so that
these might not be attacked when defenceless.

132. Mutual help was also arranged between
Nos. to and’11 Groups. When Portsmouth
was attacked, for instance, No. 10 would help
No. 11 Group, and vice versa when the attack
was on Portland or some Convoy to thé West
of the Isle of Wight.

133. The amount of poysical damage done.
to Convoys during the first phase was not ex-
cessive. About five ships (I think) were
actually ‘sunk by ‘bombing, others were
damaged, and Convoys were scattered on
occasion. It was, of course, much easier to
protect the Convoys if. they kept as close as
possible to.the English Coast, but one Convoy
at least was routed so as to pass close to
Cherhourg, and suffered accordingly. Later,
it was arranged that Convoys should traverse
the most dangerous and exposed stretches by
night, and Convoys steaming in daylight either
had direct protection by Fighter escorts, or else
hax] escorts at ‘‘ Readiness ’’ prepared to leave
the ground directly danger threatened.

.134. Three of the Radio Location Stations
in the South of England suffered rather severe
damage and casualties. No Station was per-
manently put out of action, and the worst
damage was repaired in about a month, though
the Station was working at reduced efficiency
in about half that time. The operating per-
sonnel, and particularly the women, behaved
with great courage under threat of attack and
actual bombardment.

135. As regards aerodromes, Manston was
the worst sufferer at this stage. It, Hawkinge
and Lympne were the three advanced grounds
on which we relied for filling up tanks when
a Maximum range was required for operations
over France. They were so heavily attacked
with bombs and machine guns that they were
temporarily abandoned. This is not to say
that they could not have been used if the
need had been urgent, but, for interception
at or about our own coastline, aerodromes and
satellites farther inland were quite effective.

136. Heavy damage was done to buildings,
but these were mostly non-essential, because
aircraft were kept dispersed in the open, and
the number of men and women employed was
not large in comparison with the number at
3 Station which was the Headquarters of a

ector.

137. Works personnel, permanent and tem-
porary, and detachments of Royal Engineers
were employed in filling up the craters on the
aerodromes. Experience at this stage showed
that neither the personnel nor the material pro-
vided were adequate to effect repairs with the
necessary speed, and the strength and mobility
of the repair parties was increased. Stocks
of ‘‘ hard-core ’”’ rubble had been collected at
Fighter aerodromes before the war.

138. It may be convenient here to continue
the subject of damage to Fighter Stations other
than those attacked in the first Phase.

139. Casualties to personnel were slight, ex-
cept in cases where a diréct hit was made on
