            "description": "GAZETTE, 1o JULY, 1946 3535 by five battalions of the enemy and although severely counter-attacked, and on one occasion nearly driven off, a grip was maintained on the ‘hill for 48 hours. A note-worthy incident of the fighting on this hill was the gallant bayonet charge by a party of Sappers and Miners led by an Indian Officer in aid of a hard-pressed party of 3/14 Punjabs. On the morning of 31st January, 2 Camerons attacked and stormed the rocky ridge known as Gibraltar. On this being secured, x Royal Fusiliers, supported by “IT” tanks, launched a successful attack against the enemy positions in the plain between Laquatat and M. Cochen. 2 Camerons exploited along the lower slopes west of M. Cochen, knocking-out enemy medium tanks with anti-tank rifles as they advanced. Shortly before mid-day three ‘“I’ tanks and the carriers of 2 Camerons carried out a raid along the west side of M. Cochen towards the main road. In this area they: encountered enemy medium and light tanks and troops which were probably the enemy’s counter-attacking force waiting in this area. Five medium and five light tanks were destroyed and large numbers of enemy troops, both Italian and Native, were killed. At 1430 hours 3/1 Punjabs, supported by two ‘I’ tanks, passed through 1 Royal Fusiliers and secured some low hills just to the south-east of Agordat. These were captured just before nightfall, and the enemy’s main L. of C. was cut. Artillery O.Ps. on M. Cochen had reported during the afternoon that they could see the enemy withdrawing from the Laquatat feature into the town, and the R.A.F. reported large bodies of enemy streaming through. the gorge north of M. Cochen. Two ‘I tanks under command of a SecondLieutenant were sent into the gorge after dark in an attempt to create a panic. Next morning Agordat town was occupied by 5th Indian Infantry Brigade, and although the enemy and native population had indulged in a night of looting, destruction of property was not unduly great. A large quantity of war material and guns fell into our hands. A proportion of the enemy infantry escaped by rail and over the hills to the north of the main road,",

The text of the Agreement which was to achieve this object was prepared by the Political Branch, East Africa Command, after many discussions with the Emperor, and was the subject of two visits to London by the then Chief Political Officer, Major-General Sir Philip Mitchell, K.C.M.G., M.C. As the result of these discussions the Agreement in its final form was presented by Sir Philip Mitchell to the Emperor in December, 1941. The Emperor raised a number of minor points but eventually accepted the text with only unimportant modifications and the Agreement, and its accompanying Military Convention, were signed with due formality on 31st January, 1942.",

I pointed out that such an arrangement would enable us to concentrate all our own forces for the defence of Rangoon, and to refute any accusations by the Chinese that we were unwilling to accept the assistance offered.",

            "description": "The first attack north of Cassino, between 24th and 31st January, had had limited success. 34 United States Division, in hard fighting, secured a bridgehead over the Rapido about two miles north of the town and, pressing up into the hills beyond the river, captured two outlying spurs and the village of Cairo. To their north the French, supported by an American Regimental Combat Team, captured Colle Belvedere and pushed further into the mountains towards Terelle. II Corps was now in a position to swing the direction of its attack from west to south. 36 Division, still weak from its losses in the Rapido crossing, was brought in to guard the western flank by holding Monte Castelione, captured by 34 Division on 1st February, and the 34th began attacking on the 2nd along the ridge from Colle Majola on to the rear of Monastery Hill. Hopes were high and General Clark signalled me on that day: “‘ Present indications are that the Cassino heights will be captured very soon’’. He asked for a directive on the employment of the New Zealand Division.",

            "description": "General Clark, who had set up an Advanced Command Post at Anzio, replied that the main attack could not be launched, for various reasons, before 30th January. The results of the attack were disappointing. 3 Division failed to capture Cisterna and suffered heavy losses, particularly among the Ranger battalions which were under command. 1 Division reached the railway embankment at Campoleone, a difficult obstacle, but was unable to advance beyond it, leaving itself in a dangerous salient protruding into the enumy lines. On 31st January I again visited Anzio by destroyer, returning on 2nd February. It was clear to me that until we had captured Cisterna and Campoleone it would be impossible to undertake any important offensive operations. I therefore ordered a renewed attack on Cisterna in full strength with a properly prepared Corps plan and all possible concentration of artillery and air attacks. Next my plan was to gain ground on the left of i Division, clear wp our centre and organise our communications so as to be able to mount a solid offensive to cut Route 6.",
