On 24th September the watershed was gained after a stiff fight for the Mandrioli Pass, for which the enemy put up a strong defence. After this heavy tains prevented further operations until 30th September; the division and the armoured brigade under command were transferred to the Adriatic sector and replaced by 1 Guards Brigade Group and2 Anti-Aircraft Brigade from Fifth Army for use as infantry. With these forces, reinforced  by three dismounted armoured car regiments and three independent infantry battalions, it was impossible to force the pace.
