SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 OCTOBER, 1951

It was also agreed that as the air force would
necessarily play the predominant role in trans-
Adriatic operations, the co-ordinator should be
the Air Force Commander.

64. In a directive dated 7th June 1944 from
the Air Commander-in-Chief, M.A.A.F., a new
composite group was formed known as Balkan
Air Force. The operational units of Balkan
Air Force consisted on an average of twenty-
two squadrons excluding those employed on
special supply operations. They operated fifteen
types of aircraft, flown by air-crew of eight
different nationalities (British, South African,
Ttalian, Greek, Jugoslav, and for the supply
dropping operations, American, Polish and
Russian). It will be seen how “‘ international ”’
were the responsibilities of the A.O.C., B.A.F.
as an Air Commander.

65. The responsibilities of A.O.C. B.A.F.*
as co-ordinator of trans-Adriatic operations were
contained in a directive from the Supreme
Allied Commander which became effective on
the 15th June 1944. In this directive it was
laid down that, apart from the air units coming
under his direct command, the A.O.C. B.A.F.
wag also responsible for co-ordinating the plan-
ning and execution of trans-Adriatic operations
by all the three services. The land forces affected
were known as Land Forces Adriatic (L.F.A.),
while the naval forces concerned were those
under the command of Flag Officer, Taranto
and Liaison with the Italians (F.O.T.A.L.I.).
Other formations whose activities the A.O.C.
B.A.F. was required to co-ordinate were:—

(a) No. 37 Military Mission (known as the
Maclean Mission) which was attached to the
Headquarters of Marshal Tito in Jugoslavia.

(b) Force 399, which was responsible for
Military Missions in Albania and Hungary
and, in a liaison capacity, for missions and
special operations in Greece.

(c) Headquarters Special Operations
(Mediterranean)—abbreviated title S.O.(M).—
which was responsible for the co-ordination
and general supervision of special operations
throughout the Mediterranean.

66. It was, however, implicit in the directive
that while the Air Officer Commanding Balkan
Air Force was responsible for the co-ordination
of trans-Adriatic operations, the Naval and
Army Commanders were ultimately responsible
to .their respective service Commanders-in-
Chief for the day-to-day conduct of operations.

67. The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean,
had always been of the opinion that it was
unnecessary to associate the Flag Officer,
Taranto and Liaison with the Italians
(F.0.T.A.L.1.) so closely with the other two
service commanders as to necessitate moving his
Headquarters from Taranto to Bari. From the
point of view of naval strategy, too, it was desir-
able that his Headquarters should remain at
Taranto. He was accordingly represented at
Balkan Air Force Headquarters by a Naval
Liaison Officer who filled the position more
of an additional Chief of Staff than an actual
Liaison Officer. ‘

68. Located in the same building at Bari was
the Rear Headquarters of the Maclean Mission.
Force 399 was located partly in the R.A.F.
building and partly elsewhere in Bari.

* A.V.M. Elliot was succeeded by A.V.M. Mills on
r3th February, 1945.

69. There was therefore set up in one building
in Bari what amounted to a miniature G.H.Q.
Major issues of policy were discussed at periodic
conferences between the three commanders at
which their political advisers and representa-
tives of 37 Military Mission and Force 399 were
present as required. Day-to-day inter-service
discussions also took place at a morning War
Room Conference and subsequently between
operations and intelligence of the three
services at a conference presided over by the
Senior Air Staff Officer, B.A.F.

70. In order to deal with the various political
problems which are inevitably produced by war
in the Balkans, representatives in Bari of the
British Resident Minister, Central Mediter-
ranean, and of the U.S. Political Adviser,
A.F.H.Q., were made the Political Advisers of
the A.O.C. Balkan Air Force, and he presided
over a Policy Committee which, besides the
other two service Commanders, included his
Political Advisers and the representatives of the
Maclean Mission, Force 399 and H.Q., S.O. (M).

71. As part of the machinery of inter-service
co-ordination and to effect the necessary liaison
between the three services, the offices of the
political representatives and the various
“* special ’’ forces, an Inter-Service Secretariat
was added to the staff of A.O.C., B.A.F.

72. Joint Planning and Joint Intelligence
Staffs were also set up and the Intelligence
Staff was given the task of providing Balkan
intelligence on a wide scale to meet not only
the requirements of B.A.F. and L.F.A. but for
Force 399 and S.O. (M). A small joint Public
Relations Office was also set up.

73. There was a Combined Signals organisa-
tion and a Chief Signals Officer (Army) B.A.F.
was appointed who was responsible to the Air
Officer Commanding in his capacity as co-
ordinator of Balkan operations. Necessarily he
worked in the closest touch with the Chief
Signals Officer (Air) who was responsible for
B.A.F. Signals.

74. The joint organisation worked well. Inter-
service contacts were maintained all day and
every day and the close relations which were
established with the political and special forces
represented in Bari were of the utmost value
in handling the various politico-military prob-
lems of the Balkan war. So close was this
day-to-day contact that in fact it was found
possible to discontinue the meetings of the Com-
mittee which had been set up to deal with
Special Operations matters.

75. Another feature of the joint organisation
was that a system of inter-service command
responsible to B.A.F., F.O.T.A.L.1. and L.F.A,
was established on the island of Vis and sub-
sequently on the mainland at Zadar, which be-
came known as C.0.Z.A. (Combined Opera-
tions Zadar).

76. It was made clear in the A.O.C.’s direc-
tive that the primary object of trans-
Adriatic operations was ‘‘to contain and
destroy as many enemy forces as possible in
the Balkans.’”’ From the Allied resources at
that time employed against the Germans it was

- Rot to be expected there would be much to

spare for operations in the Balkans. Moreover,
it was the policy of the U.S. Chiefs of Staff
that U.S. forces, apart from some special service
units, should not be employed in an operational

role in the Balkans.
