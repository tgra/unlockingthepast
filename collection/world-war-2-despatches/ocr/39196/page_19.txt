SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

with the ground forces, From the beginning
of September onwards, a considerable measure
of decentralisation in the planning and conduct
of operations was introduced, with the purpose
of giving squadron commanders more latitude
in the allotment of sorties.

129. With the return of fair-weather con-
ditions in October, the effort of the photo-
graphic reconnaissance squadrons rose to its
former level, and during this month the daily
average of sorties represented over a third of
the total aircraft available in the whole force.

The methodical cover of enemy airfields, com-'

munications and other targets was resumed,
survey photographs being supplied as required
by Headquarters Air Command, and Head-
quarters Allied Land Forces, South East Asia.
In proportion with the increased flying, the
photographic work of the photo sections of the
P.R. Force was expanded, nearly 354,000
prints being produced during January, 1945,
the peak month. Technical photographic
developments included the introduction of the
moving film camera on operational sorties, and
the fitting into Mosquito aircraft of forward
facing oblique cameras. The latter were first
used on 14th February, when a set of stereo-
scopic pairs covering the Burma-Siam railway
was thereby secured.

130. An exceptionally valuable photographic
Teconnaissance of the Burma rice areas was
carried out by Squadron Leader C. Fox during
1944. The results shown by an analysis of
the pictures were subsequently checked up on
the ground, and were found to be correct
within 5 per cent.

131. The main hindrances to the operations
of the P.R. Force continued, even in the
campaigning season, to be factors inseparable
from flying in the tropics rather than the oppo-
sition of the enemy, which remained slighter
than was usual in other theatres of war.
Successful cover of the waterfront at Akyab,
for instance, was secured in November, 1944,
by two Spitfires flying at from 50 to 200 feet,
at neither of which a shot was fired. But
the lengthening range of Mosquito sorties
month by month bore witness to the mastery
of climate and terrain. Jt was in December,
1944, that the first cover of Puket Island was
obtained, in the course of a flight involving
a round trip of 2,100 miles, which marked the
furthest penetration to be made in this area.
This record was, however, eclipsed by another
aircraft which in January flew 2,431 air miles
in eight hours and 20 minutes to cover
Moulmein and the railway from Bangkok to
Phnom Penh. Finally on 22nd March a
Mosquito XVI broke the long distance record
for this type of aircraft in any theatre of war
with a flight of 2,493 air miles in eight hours
forty-five minutes, covering the Bangkok-
Singapore railway to a point south of the
Malayan frontier. It was thus that the
Mosquito made amends for the structural
defect which had seriously curtailed its use
during November and December, 1944.

132. The work of the P.R. Force was co-
ordinated at one end with the short-range
photography of the tactical reconnaissance
squadrons, while at the other end, long dis-
tance survey work over Malaya was undertaken
by the Superfortresses of XXth Bomber
Comniand, US.A.AF The P.R. Force was

responsible, for instance, for all the workaday
survey and mapping required by the Fourteenth
Army. As the Officer Commanding, No. 11
Indian Air Survey Liaison Section, R.E.,
reported in February, 1945, 684 Squadron,
R.A-F. alone had achieved, in twelve months,
three-quarters of the basic cover for the whole
campaign and 1/30,000 cover for maps, photo-
maps and artillery block plots over the battle
lines from Dimapur nearly to Rangoon and
Moulmein. The work of photographic recon-
naissance in general in this theatre has, of
course, been of all the greater importance owing
to the comparatively meagre intelligence avail-
able from ground sources ; for air force pur-
poses alone it provided an indispensable factor
in the maintenance of Allied air superiority by
providing speedy evidence of the location of
enemy aircraft, while the work of the Strategic
Air Force would have been unprofitable with-
out the coverage of targets it furnished.

Part EIGHT.

GENERAL RECONNAISSANCE.

133. As the period under review opened, a
deal of uncertainty existed as to whether the
Indian Ocean U-boat warfare would be inten-
sified by the arrival of long-range German
U-boats. Such a possibility was not im-
probable, and had the contemplated threat
materialised then, all Reconnaissance
air power in this theatre would have been
harnessed under the co-ordinating and super-
vising control of IOGROPS.*

134. The period from June to August wit-
nessed a decided increase in enemy U-boat
warfare, although at no time can it be said
that the threat reached alarming proportions.
During these three months the enemy (operat-
ing with considerable wariness) sank thirteen
ships of the medium-sized merchant vessel
class, and, in turn, suffered the loss of one
submarine as a result of a combined attack by
aircraft and Naval Force 66.

135. In July, a concentration of enemy units
in and around the shipping lanes to the east
of the Maldives—resulting in the loss of five
ships—portended a possible menace. In this
connection it is worthy of comment that
Catalina aircraft employed on rescue searches
co-operated in the location and eventual rescue
of 244 survivors.

136. Having regard to the amount of ship-
ping in the Indian Ocean, and the fact that
during August there were possibly five German
units operating in these waters, the enemy’s
achievements might be considered singularly
paltry. This is a tribute to the constant vigi-
lance of General Reconnaissance aircraft in
the flying of anti-U-boat sweeps and patrols.
Such a policy might not have produced many
sightings and kills—a consideration of the
immense expanses of ocean to be guarded will
clearly show the difficulty of locating enemy
units—but it kept U-boats submerged and out
of range of our shipping.

137. With September came a falling-off in
U-boat operations, and this was continued
during October and November, A slight in-
