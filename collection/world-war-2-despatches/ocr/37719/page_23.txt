(b) A considerable number of enemy aircraft

were claimed as Probably Destroyed and -

Damaged.

(c) The total amount of H.A.A. expended
was 75,000 rounds.

(a) The total amount of Bofors ammunition
expended was 9,417 rounds.

8. Ground Defence

Preparations were made by all A.A. defences
to assume a secondary ground defence réle;
Bofors were provided with A/T ammunition,
and sited to cover approaches to aerodromes,
V.Ps., &c. Certain 3.7 inch guns suitably sited
were given an anti-ship réle, and preparations
were made for barrages to be put on certain
beaches. Under the immediate threat of in-
vasion in May 1940, mobile columns of A.A.
troops were formed, but these troops reverted
to their A.A. réle before the Battle of Britain
began.

g. Lessons Learnt.

(a) The outstanding lesson learnt from this
intensive air attack was undoubtedly the sound-
ness and suitability of the organisation and
arrangements of the control and direction of
the anti-aircraft defences. These measures de-
vised in peace time and perfected during the
earlier and quieter period of hostilities, stood
the severe test with amazing resilience and
adaptability. No major alterations in the
system were indicated or, indeed, were made
subsequent to these operations.* The way in
which the activities of the anti-aircraft linked
in and were capable of co-ordination with the
major partners in the venture—R.A.F. Fighter
Command, No. 11 Fighter Group, and sector
commands—is perhaps worthy of special note.

*This statement applies only to the higher
organisation, and must not be taken to mean that
no improvements were made in the control and
direction of A.A. gunnery.

(0) Other lessons learnt are by comparison
of minor import. Chief among them was the
great vulnerability of aircraft if caught by
accurate H.A.A. fire when in close formation.
A good instance of this occurred in an action
on the 8th September, when a geschwader of
15 Do. 17s, flying in formation at 15,000 feet,
approached a gun site South of River Thames.
The opening salvo from the four 3.7-inch guns
brought down the three leading aircraft, the
remaining machines turning back in disorder,
scattering their bombs on the countryside in
their flight to the coast. -

The value of H.A.A, fire as a means of
breaking up bomber squadrons to enable them
to be more easily dealt with by our fighters was
demonstrated on numerous occasions in the
Thames Estuary. :

The importance of A.A. shell bursts as a
“‘ pointer ’’ to fighters, even though ‘the guns
cannot themselves effectively engage the
enemy, was also frequently demonstrated.

(c) A somewhat negative lesson was the in-
ability of A.A. guns, however well served, to
completely deny an area to penetration by
determined air attack. Evidence, however,
was overwhelming that accurate fire, apart from
causing casualties, did impair the enemy’s aim,
and thus avoid, or at least mitigate, the damage
to precise targets.

(d) A rather unexpected result was the high
proportion (about 0 per cent.) of planes
brought down by A.A.L.M.G. fire. It is doubt-
ful, however, whether with the increased
armour now cartied by enemy aircraft thi)
lesson still obtains. .

(e) The value of training in recognition was
repeatedly emphasised throughout these opera-
tions. Fortunately, very few instances of
friendly aircraft being engaged occurred. Apart
from the accuracy of the information as to
movement of aircraft furnished to gun sites,
this was no doubt due to a reasonable standard
in recognition having been attained.

It was, and still is, continually brought home
to the A.A. gunner that, before all else, he
must not engage a friendly aircraft. With this
thought firmly impressed on the G.P.O., some
instances of late engagement or failure to engage
perforce occurred. In some cases, had the
standard of training been higher, to enable the
earlier recognition of a machine as ‘hostile
beyond reasonable doubt,’’ the number of
machines destroyed would have been increased.
