SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 4 MARCH, . 1948

were no sighs of the .crew. ‘Tihis convinced
me that the ship had been partially abandoned,
probably as a-result of INDOMITABLE’s air
attack, and fire was ceased.

*; 34. At 0857 intercepted F.0.0.2’s signal to
PAKENHAM: urgently requiring bombarding
ship. LIGHTNING was detailed and pro-
ceeded to a position close to Red Beach at
0926, opening fire at 0953.

35. AS soon as the shoot at the sloop
D’ENTRECASTEAUX had been completed,
LAFOREY proceeded inshore to bombard to
support LIGHTNING, being ready at 1026, 3
cables from the shore off Red Beach.

36. At 1033 F.0.0.2 indicated the bombard-
ing areas, reported position of own troops and
suggested air spotting.

37. From map references own troops appeared

very close, and at 1101 LAFOREY opened fire’

with single-gun salvos to see if F.0.0.2 could
observe fall of shot. 7 rounds were fired but
none seen. LIGHTNING was also in action
until 1055 when F‘O.C Force ‘‘ F’’ ’s signal
1044 ordering her to cease fire was received.

38. At 1124 I asked F.0.0.2 whether I could
go on, and told him that the last series had been
fired 1500 yards North of own troops. At 1130
F.0.0.@ informed me that it was impossible
for own troops to approach certain areas owing
to strong points of enemy batteries and machine-
gun posts. LAFOREY continued bombard-
ing but no fall of shot was reported and it was
obvious that F.0.0.2 could not see fhe fire but
that own troops were not being endangered
while the enemy lines of communication were
being attacked. During this period 3 series of
five 2-gun salvos at 2 minute intervals firing 30
in all were carried out. Fire was checked at
1208.

39. At 1159 F.O.0.2 asked for duplication
by LIGHTNING and was informed that 6-gun
salvos could be fired and duplicated, and that
either series could be repeated, or rapid unseen
fire for effect could be commenced. F.O0.0.2
asked for a repetition of the series and this re-
quest confirmed that own troops were all right.
LAFOREY continued with 2-gun salvos until
1221 when LIGHTNING was ready to fire
broadsides of 4 to 6 guns at target. LAFOREY
then increased to 4- to 6-gun salvos at target.
38 rounds were fired by LAFOREY with
‘LIGHTNING joining in until 1233 when fire
was checked.

40. None of this fire was observed by
F.0,0.2 but it has since been learnt that it
proved most helpful to a company of the 2nd
Battalion South Lancashire Regiment who had
infiltrated behind the enemy’s lines and seized
the wireless station, being practically sur-
rounded. This was extremely fortunate.

41. In the meantime I had asked ILLUS-
TRIOUS for a spotting aircraft, and had sent
my B L.O.* and: one officer to Windsor Castle
0.P. to see if they could distinguish the posi-
tion of the enemy batteries in action against
own troops. At 1327 touch was lost with
F.0.0.2 who informed me that he was changing
his battery.

42. Windsor Castle O.P. was manned at 1330
and the observer reported that the battle area

1601

was obscured by smoke. 8 single rounds were
fired at a safe range but accurate observation
was impossible from this position.

43. At 1440 touch was obtained with the spot-
ting aircraft from ILLUSTRIOUS but no tar-
get could be identified for some time, but at
1527 the aircraft ordered ‘“ Open Fire,’’ and
one round was fired, reported as 100 yards over.

44. At 1530 9 bombing aircraft were seen going
in to attack, and the spotting aircraft was in-
formed that fire would not be continued until
this was completed.

45. At 1618, after the bombers had retired,
the spotting aircraft called for fire on a gun bat-
tery. This was engaged from 1618 to 1705,
firing 58 rounds from A and B turrets, when a
signal was received from F.O.0.2 relayed by
PAKENHAM, to “‘ stop firing—moving.” This
had been transmitted at 1637. The spotting air-
craft was then told to return to the carrier.
Spotting had been carried out most efficiently
with excellent communication.

46. This aircraft had originally been asked for
at 1034, and, while it is fully, realised that four
hours was not a long time under the circum-
stances, had a spotting aircraft been kept avail-
able for destroyers the Army could have been
helped more effectively much earlier.

47. Anchor was weighed at o210/7th and
LAFOREY proceeded through the minefield to
hunt for a submarine reported by GENISTA
as ordered by F.O.C. Force ‘‘ F ”’ and Captain
(D), 12th Destroyer Flotilla.

48. At 0537 while off Nosi Hara received
an aircraft’s signal passed by Captain (D), rath
D.F.—“ Survivors of submarine struggling in
the water.’’ There was some difficulty in estab-
lishing the position in which the submarine had
been sunk, and when it was seen that PAKEN-
HAM and one corvette were closing the right
spot LAFOREY returned to the anchorage to
provide A.A. protection. £

49. LAFOREY proceeded for A/S patrol off
the main entrance at 1800, closing JASMINE
aground on Nosi Fati shoal at 2z00; finding
she had got off, A/S patrol was resumed until
0500/ 8th.

50. LAFOREY then escorted the fast convoy
frém the anchorage to Diego Suarez, entering
harbour at 1500.

51. The bearing and enthusiasm of the Ship’s
Company over a long period of Action Sta-
tions was most satisfactory, and the fact that
only one misfire (in Director) was experienced
in a total of 297 rounds fired proved that the
material of the ship had been maintained in first
class condition. In general, all departments
carried out arduous duties without a hitch. In
particular, I would mention the Engine-room
Department who met the constant calls on the
engines in very trying conditions of heat most
efficiently.

- 52. I should like to stress the very useful
work and fine co-operation carried out by
Captain B. Clark, the Royal Artillery, the
Bombardment Liaison Officer attached to
LAFOREY. |
