23. Aw Operations on the North West
Frontier.

Modern high speed aircraft were used on the
North West Frontier of India for the first time.
There were however, no tasks of any import-
ance to carry out.

North West Frontier operations are now
purely an Indian Air Force commitment, and
the Frontier area has served as a useful training
ground for ity squadreuns. Intelligence and-
photographic facilities have been developed,
the Kohat runway extended, and organisation
undertaken to modernise ‘what has hitherto
been a most backward area from the point of
view of the air forces.

24. Balloon Barrages.

Subject to weather conditions, balloons were
flown continuously at Calcutta for the protec-
tion of the Docks area and Howrah Bridge,
also at Jamshedpur to defend the Tata Iron
and Steel Works, and at Colombo to protect
the harbour artd dock installations and certain
parts of the city. The barrage at Trincoraalee;
originally intended for the protection of the oil
tanks and consisting of some seventeen balloons
only, was extended to include in its scope the
whole Naval anchorage at Trincomalee—China
Bay. Additional commitments undertaken in
November included the defence of the harbour
and docks at Chittagong, and balloon protec-
tion for merchant shipping and Fleet auxiliaries.

Subsidiary operations have included the fly-
ing of balloons at 1,000 feet on patrol ships
which go out daily at dawn to guide friendly
submarines into harbour, Captains df these
submarines speak highly of the assistance in
locating the patrol ship provided by the flying
of these balloons. Submarines are frequently
well off course, and time is saved and danger
averted by this method of homing. Moreover,
balloons have been flown for anti-aircraft cali-
bration, radar calibration and meteorological
purposes.

In no cases have the areas provided with
balloon protection been subjected to low level
air attacks. During the monsoon period one
new squadron and nine ancillary units were
formed,

25. Air Sea Rescue.

Owing to the shortage of Air Sea Rescue air-
craft and marine craft, few units had been
«brought into operation as yet, and the import-
ant work of rescuing the survivors of ship-
wrecked vessels or “‘ ditched”’ aircraft had
devolved on operational squadrons. Twenty-one
incidents were recorded, ten of which occurred
in the Bay of Bengal, two in the Arabian Sea
and eight off Ceylon, involving in all one
hundred and eleven persons, of whom sixty-
nine were rescued. The credit for most of this
work is due to General Reconnaissance Squad-
rons, but one of the Chittagong Air Sea Rescue
units, in its first operational sortie, succeeded in
rescuing three out of five members of a Welling-
ton. On a further occasion Lindholme dinghy
gear, which has now been distributed, was
successfully dropped to a distressed U.S.A.A.F.
aircrew.

26. Estimates of Results,

The decision to operate during the monsoon
season lias been more than justified by the
results achieved. -

SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 APRIL, 1948

Attacks on shipping by the U.S.A.A.F. and
on the port of Rangoon by both U.S.A.A.F.
and R.A.F. aircraft more or less prohibited the
use of this port to the enemy. Similarly,
Akyab was consistently bombed.

The new Burma Siam railway was under
construction during the period by the enemy
(who used prisoners of war labour for it under
conditions of bestial cruelty) and has since been
completed. This probably eluminated the port
of Rangoon as a link in the enemy line of com-
munication, and reduced its importance as a
target for our bombers, At the same time it
remained to be seen how far this new railway
was itself vulnerable to air attack, in spite of the
enemy’s duplication of bridges and other
measures to preserve it from interruption.

An estimate of the damage to transportation
facilities can be gathered from the following
table of claims for the period made by the
Bengal Air Command : —

Sampans destroyed 160
Sampans damaged 2,624
Power driven water craft and

barges destroyed ... si 12
Power driven water craft an é

barges damaged ave 193
Locomotives destroyed os 9
Locomotives damaged 143
Rolling stock destroyed 27
Rolling stock damaged 464
M.T. destroyed si 5‘ 42
M.T. damaged 28 ‘ 142

Much of the material enumerated above cannot
easily be renewed.

As regards casualties inflicted on the enemy,
intelligence reports showed that attacks from
the air had great effect. In Arakan where
most of such attacks were made, enemy losses
were conservatively put at 500 killed and many
more wounded from June to September.

Our losses during the period under review
were thirty-one aircraft, including four de-
stroyed on the ground at the beginning of
November.

27. Morale of Air Personnel.

The strain of maintaining a continuous effort
and carrying out operations.in very trying heat
and humidity undoubtedly had its effect at times
on the morale of the men. This was remedied
by maintaining a high standard of training,
with the result that the fighting spirit of all was
high when the period ended. .

I cannot commend too highly the manner in
which the men of. ground organisations carried
out their duties during very bad monsoon condi-
tions. If any are to be singled out, I would
mention the maintenance personnel who never
failed to keep the serviceability of operational
aircraft at a high standard, and I would also
pay particular tribute to the ranks employed at
radar units and wireless observer posts. Many
of these detachments were completely isolated
for long periods, and had to be maintained by
air alone.

INFORMATION OF THE ENEMY.

28. Enemy~Situation in Burma on the 15th
November, 1943.

Throughout the monsoon Burma was held by
the Japanese with four divisions. By the 15th
November a fifth Japanese division had arrived
in ‘Burma, and the dispositions of Japanese
forces in the country were believed to be:
