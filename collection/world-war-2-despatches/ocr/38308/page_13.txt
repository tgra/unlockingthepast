SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 2 JUNE, 1948

2. On the other hand, attacks on. airfields
and dispersed aircraft are difficult and costly;
. the management of a group of airfields which
are daily attacked from dawn to dusk do not
display their wares. The bombers are exposed
to flak concentrated in the area of attack
throughout their bombing runs, whilst Ramrod
sweeps are faced with dummy or unservice-
able aircraft dispersed in revetments and other
conspicuous places in centres of flak, whilst
those serviceable are well camouflaged or con-
<ealed in woods.

The Japanese largely use smokeless, trace-
less and flashless ammunition; aircraft do not
know they are being fired at until they are
hit.

It has been a disability that cluster or frag-
mentation and incendiary bombs have not been
available, as these would appear to be the type
of missile required to destroy aircraft dispersed
in the manner stated.

' 3. Fighter Direction. Whilst. the. number of
- aircraft shot down by the fighters is small, it
represents, I think, a high proportion of those
available for. this treatment. Fighter direc-
tion, under the control and inspiration of
Acting Commander E. D. G. Lewin, D.S.O.,
D.S.C., Royal Navy, making use of ex-
perienced teams in H.M. Ships INDOMITABLE
and VICTORIOUS, has been of the highest
order; the Staff Fighter Direction Officer, Fifth
Fleet, Lieutenant-Commander H. A. Rowe,
United States Navy, loaned for the operation,
informs me that it has been as good as or
better than the Fifth Fleet standard.

4. Hellcats: The operational efficiency’ of
No. Wing, trained and led by Acting
Lieutenant-Commander (A) T. W. Harrington,
R.N., has, throughout the whole course of the
operation, been remarkable. Flying by day in
all weathers and sometimes by night, I can
recollect but one barrier crash, whilst their
break-up from the landing circuit and speed
of landing-on has been exceptional; whilst not
so fast in the air as Corsairs, their tactical
eminence has enabled them to account for their
full share of what enemy aircraft have been
‘available.

5. Corsairs. The ‘Corsair Squadrons have
done all that was asked of.them and more, but
they have not the same proved all-weather pro-
positions for landing-on purposes as have Hell-
cats, and it is a grave disability that it is
dangerous to Jand on unless their long-range
tanks have been dropped or emptied. Nor
can they be used for night flying.

In leading their squadrons: the work of
Temporary Acting Lieutenant-Commander (A)
A. M. Tritton, R.N.V.R., No. 1830 Squadron,
H.M.S. ILLUSTRIOUS, and. Temporary
Acting Lieutenant-Commander: (A) C. *C.
:Tomkinson, R.N.V.R. (since killed), No. 1836
‘Squadron, H.M.S. MICTORIOUS: has been
outstanding.

6. Seafires. The Seafires have been used for
CAP over the Fleet. Owing to their short
endurarice they have not been suitable for
accompanying offensive strikes to the Tange at
which these operations have been carried out.

” 9.. Fireflies. Ut had been ‘intended ‘to use
Fireflies against enemy coastets and. coastal

3301

vessels, but these have been painfully few;
thus with the exception of occasional rocket
sorties against particular targets; such as radar
stations and junks, it has ‘been necessary to
relegate them to escort duties with Lifeguard
submarines and Dumbo aircraft, and to flying
Jack patrols. On the only occasion on which
the chance of air combat presented itself, they
lost no time at all; four Sonias out of five to ~
the guns of two Fireflies.

"Acting Major V. B. G. Cheesman, DS.O.,
M.B.E., D.S.C., R.M., continues to lead this
Squadron with distinction and address.

. 8. Avengers. Avengers have been employed
throughout as bombers arid have executed this
task with success; their losses to flak have been
relatively high; this I attribute firstly to the
determination of their leaders in coming
through cloud, which has frequently been, at
2,000 feet, to discharge their load, and secondly
to the invisibility of’ the enemy flak. Four
hundred tons of high explosive bombs have
been unloaded on énemy airfields and installa-
tions.

The service of Agting Lieutenant-Commander
(A) D. R. Foster, R.N.V.R., M.S.
VICTORIOUS, No. 849 Squadron, has been
outstanding.

9. Air Group Leaders. The duties have been
carried out by Commander N. S. Luard, D.S.C.,
R.N., H.M.S. INDOMITABLE, and ‘Acting
Lioutenant-Colonel R. C. Hay, D.S.C., R.M.,
H.M.S. VICTORIOUS, ‘in an able manner,
particularly by the latter, and the appointments
are, I think, justified. It has been their primary
task to so direct the strike and fighter leaders
that their offensive effort is aimed at the most -
profitable sections of the ordered target areas;
and to redirect their effort if, for any reason,
an alternative target of better value has been
presented; it has been their secondary, duty: to
make a reconnaissance each morning of the air-
fields and report the position of dispersed air-
craft, advising me whether fighters should be
‘sent to strafe or not.

10. Air attack on the Fleet. On those occa-
sions on which hostile aircraft have penetrated
the fighter defences of the Fleet’ the sky has
been in general overcast, whilst there has been
a longstop CAP essentially maintained over
the Fleet under the cloud base.

There has never been a group at which to
fire,. not more in fact than-a single aircraft;
thus there has been little opportunity to use
heavy artillery: gunfire has ‘been in the main
restricted to flak, and, as this is little deterred
by alterations of course, and because the time

between the enemy descending through me. ,

cloud base and his arrival onboard is small,
has been my practice, unless necessary is
operate aircraft, to keep the Fleet almost con-
tinuously under rudder during such attacks.
The U.S. Fleet, I understand, do the same.

Ir. Operation of . ‘Aircraft under impending
attack. In ‘face of the near certainty that if
a hostile aircraft. gets through it will hit a
carrier, it has been a nice matter to decide on
the chances of interception: if assessed. as
unfavourable, the choice has to be made
between accepting the Fleet ‘on a steady course
in wind. while aircraft on deck with full tanks
