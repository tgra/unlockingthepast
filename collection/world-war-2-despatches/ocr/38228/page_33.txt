SUPPLEMENT to tut LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948

defence of the area was based on the two
brigade groups in Allanmyo and Prome, the
temainder of the force being mobile and pre-
pared to act offensively. On the Irrawaddy
the detachment of the Royal Marines, which
had covered the demolitions at Syriam, found
the crews for a river patrol.

24. Operations resulting m the Loss of
Toungoo. On the Toungoo front the concen-
tration of the Chinese Fifth Army was seriously
delayed ‘by the movement of the rear echelons
of the Chinese Sixth Army and also by the
disintegration of the railway system which was
begining to set in as a result of enemy bomb-
ing On the 24th March, the situation on this
front was as follows:—(For Chinese Order of
Battle see Appendix “‘ A’’).

All Imperial units had been withdrawn north
of Toungoo en route to the Irrawaddy front.
The 200 Division was entrenched in and around

Toungoo with the divisional cavalry unit hold-,

ing the river line to the south. The Fifth Army
Troops were in Pyawbwe with certain units for-
ward under command of the 200 Division. The
other divisions of the Fifth Army were:—
22 Division with leading regiment arnving
at Pymmana, rear formation at Lashio.
96 Division approaching the frontier.

On the 24th March, the Japanese made a
surprise attack on the aerodrome north of
Toungoo thus cutting off the 200 Division.
The rear echelon of the 1 Burma Division, in-
cluding the 23 Mountain Battery and Frontier
Force Columns 1 and 4, were involved in thé
fighting for the aerodrome and put up a stout
resistance. By the evening of the 26th March
the whole of the Chinese 22 Division had been
concentrated in the area Pyinmana-Yedashe
and the leading troops of the 96 Division were
approaching Pyinmana. On 28th March the
22 Division attacked south from Yedashe with
the object of relieving the 200 Division at
Toungoo but made little headway, and on the
1st April the 200 Division cut its way out from
Toungoo, where it had been besieged for over
a week, and passed through into reserve at
Yezin, north of Pyinmana.

‘a5. The Japanese establish Aw Superiority.
The air situation was, as has been previously
mentioned, adversely affected by the loss of the
Rangoon aerodrome. At this time there were in
Burma only the following aerodromes fit for
operational use :—

Magwe, Akyab, Lashio, and Loiwing (in

China).

There were also the following landing grounds
‘suitable only as A.L.Gs. or for fighters :—

Namsan, Heho, Mandalay, Meiktila,

Piawbwe and Shwebo.

Toungoo aerodrome had by this time been
rendered untenable by enemy bombing raids.

None of the above, with the exception of
Loiwing, had an efficient warning system. This
was partly due to lack of essential equipment
and W/T personnel and partly to hills which
acted as a screen to the approach of hostile
aircraft.

So far as the air was concerned, the opera-
tional advantages were now with the enemy and
this was soon demonstrated in the severe
reverse which was sustained by the R.A.F. at
Magwe on the 21st and 22nd March when a
large number of aircraft, both. fighters and
bombers, were destroyed on the ground. This

Cc

reverse forced the R.A.F. and the A:V.G. to
withdraw from Magwe to Loiwing, 400 miles
further north, and this reduced very much the
effectiveness of the air force.

The supply of aircraft now became the ruling
factor in the air situation in Burma. In view
of the limited amount of aircraft available at
this time, that is to say the end of March and
the beginning of April, for the defence of India
and Ceylon, it was decided that all R.A.F. units
should be withdrawn from Burma, where it
was uneconomical to retain aircraft in opera-
tional conditions which rendered high losses
inevitable. However, an R.A.F. organisation
known as ‘‘ Burwing ’’ was retained at Lashio
and Loiwing and aircraft were flown over from
India from time to time; but very little could
be achieved in the circumstances prevailing.

That the decision to withdraw the R.A.F.
to India was right there can be no doubt, but
this decision left the Japanese with almost
undisputed command of the air and this had a
serious effect on the civil population and the
working of the utility services and a somewhat
lesser effect on the morale of the troops.

26. Effect of Bombing on Public Utihty
Services. At the end of March and the
beginning of April, the Japanese commenced to
make heavy bombing raids on centres of com-
munication in Centra] and Upper Burma, raids
being made on such places as Prome, Meiktila,
Mandalay, Thazi, Pyinmana, Maymyo, Lashio
and Taunggyi.

Except for the damage to house property,
the material effect of these raids was not very
great but the moral effect amongst the civil
population was enormous. After a heavy raid
on a town, the life of that community came
practically to a standstill, the population mov-
ing into the jungle. From the military aspect,
the effect on the working of the public utility
services was most serious. Many railway
employees and J.W.T. workers in the employ-
ment of the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company left
their jobs. The Police force disintegrated, the
power supply broke down and the Post and
Telegraph service, to whom a tribute should be
paid for the manner in which a large number
of personnel stuck to their jobs, was affected
to a lesser degree.

The effect of bombing on public utility
workers was accentuated by the presence of
their families, many of whom had not at this
time been evacuated and it is a point for con-
sideration in the future, that all workers in
services on which military operations depend
do better, when they know that their families
have been removed to a place of safety.

Part III].—TuHe BATTLE FOR THE OILFIELDS.

. 27. Operations South of Prome On the 26th
March the Japanese commenced to operate
against the positions held by 1 Burcorps in the
Irrawaddy valley. Prome was bombed on the
26th March and three quarters of the town was
burnt. On the 27th March four to five thousand
Japanese and Burmese were reported to be on
the west bank of the Irrawaddy opposite
Tonbo. On the same day, at the réquest of the
Generalissimo, I despatched from Chungking a
telegram ordering offensive operations on the
Irrawaddy front in order to relieve pressure: on
the Chinese Fifth Army, which at this time was
heavily engaged. On the 28th March the
Japanese advance guard on the east of the
