_They were ‘materially helped in their task by;
“the admirable ‘discipline and ‘spirit among the
troops they: émbarked.

4A notable: feature of the operation was thi
ot: and , , enterprising . patormance of
_-merchant séamen in the troopshi ans who had /to
take their ships into unlighted and difficllt
‘anchorages, in many: cases without adequate
’ charts.’ ‘A’high proportion of Dutch ships were
included and were particularly noticeable e
their efficient and seamanlike perforniance. ;

5. It was most fortunate that the Glen ships*
with their landing. craft were present in the
Mediterranean. These ships, their landing craft
and the tank landing craft, although playing
their’ réle, in the reverse of that for which they
_ Were intended, proved invaluable and un-
“ doubtedly made: it possible to embark many
more troops thant would otherwise have been

. the case.

6. This melancholy operation coming as it
did on top ‘of the prolonged operation of trans-
porting the troops-into Greece, threw a very
severe strain on both men and material of the
Mediterranean Fleet: a strain which was most
nobly shouldered in the facé of heavy air attack
--which usually had to be met without fighter
protection of any sort.

7..The operation was’ throughout a * mosf
anxious one; performed, as it was, with no cover, ri
from enemy surface interference. The ‘urgent,
need for destroyers for the-actual evacuation
precluded the provision of screens to enable the
sorely needed battleship covér to be provided.
Had our ‘enemy shown more enterprise the
results might have been:very different.

I have the honour to forward herewith my
report on the evacuation of the British forces
from Greece, covering the period 17th April to
30th: April, 1941, with the following remarks.

Situation in Piraeus, and Control of Local

Shipping.

2. On arrival in Greece, I found Piraeus fail-
ing to function as a harbour.on account of the
‘great destruction caused by the explosion of
an ammunition ship, with the resultant fires in
the harbour on 7th April and continual mining
or, bombing since that date. Moreover, the
Greek authorities, through whom the British
naval authorities had been working for the con-
‘trol of shipping, berthing, supplies*for ships and
so'on, hdd been. prevented ‘by the’ destruction
and disorganisation caused by the explosion
from, attending at their posts setept in one or
