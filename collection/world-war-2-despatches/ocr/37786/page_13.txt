SUPPLEMENT to THz LONDON GAZETTE, 13 NOVEMBER, 1946

commitment, but it was successfully accom-
plished largely because most of the force had
been withdrawn to the Delta for the purpose.
Although the undertaking involved great
quantities of equipment and large formations,
most of the difficulties came from changes in
the operational plan and from the wide area
- from which the assault was mounted.

3132. Having launched Eastern Task Force,
Middle East Command then had to implement
its maintenance plans. It had been decided as
a general principle that the commands in which
formations were mounted would be responsible
for the maintenance of these formations for the
first four convoys, that is to say, convoys
arriving in the first four weeks after the
landing. Then Middle East would be
responsible for all British forces in Sicily for
the first seven weeks. After that date, main-
fenance of the forces in Sicily, other than
United States Army troops, was to be based
on the principle that such items as were con-
sidered to be Eastern Group Supply (of
Eastern origin) were to be shipped from Middle
East and items of Western Group Supply from
the United Kingdom or United States.

133. This system of maintenance was carried
out as planned. Middle East received detailed
loading programmes from Eighth Army for the
first four convoys. Then, until Allied Force
Headquarters assumed administrative control,
Middle East received demands direct from
Eighth Army, provided Eastern Group supplies
and certain items of ‘Western Group Supply,
and laid off to the ‘War Office the remaining
demands, mainly for Western Group ‘supplies,
which it had been agreed would be shipped
from the West.

134. From rath August, 15 Army Group,
under Allied: Force Headquarters, took over
both operational ‘and administrative control in
Sicily and so Allied Force Headquarters
assumed administrative control of all forces
in Sicily; thereafter the total demands ceased
to be placed direct on Middle East, who now
received from Allied Force Headquarters de-
mands for Eastern Group supplies and from the
War Office instructions to provide those items
of Western Group supply which could not be
provided from the United Kingdom or from the
United States. In addition, demands for urgent
requirements of controlled stores were made
direct on Middle East by Allied Force Head-
quarters, . .

135. In all, from June to October a total of
230,000 tons and 19,500 vehicles were loaded
for despatch to Sicily. Stocks of ammunition
had been built up throughout the early part
of 1943 and, therefore, little difficulty was ex-
perienced in providing the 30,000 tons exported
for this operation; a certain amount of ammuni-
tion was earmarked in Tripoli for calling for-
ward if necessary. :

"+136. The provision ‘of supplies presented no
serious problems. Forty-eight hour mess-tin
rations, provided as landing rations, were
loaded in bulk and issued to each man prior
to disembarkation. |The mess-tin and com-
posite rations proved very successful for an
operation of this nature. The ‘force was main-
tained on composite rations for the first three
weeks, after which the change-over to Middle
East Field Service hard-scale ration was made
possible by the gradual building up ‘of rations

in the first three convoys. By the end of six
weeks, stock on the ground represented seven
days for 235,000 men, whilst reserves had been
established at Malta and Tripoli.

137. Planning for the requirements of petrol
and oil was based to a great extent on previous
operational consumption in the desert and
proved to be an over-estimate, as the line of
communication was much shorter and the losses
en route and on loading were much less than
had been anticipated. A reserve dump of
6,000 tons was built up at Tripoli; this was not
required and was eventually used for normal
maintenance. In addition, Middle East pro-
vided facilities for bulk oil supply for the
Royal Navy at Benghazi and at Tripoli.

138. Ordnance stores, of which some 90,000
items were issued from 4 and 5 Base Ordnance
Depots, needed special precautions for packing
and shipping; special packing cases were
designed and manufactured in the Middle East,
limited in weight to one-man lifts. Engineer
base depots also were heavily employed in
packing and shipping stores for the operation.
In all, 20,000 tons of engineer‘stores and about
500 items of heavy plant were shipped to Sicily
from Middle East stocks. 5

tively accomplished, both during the assault,
the subsequent period of maintenance through
beachheads, and later when the ports of
Augusta and Syracuse were in operation. The
success was due to two main factors—our low
losses at sea (thanks to the Royal Navy and
the Royal Air Force) and the care and fore-
thought which had been put into the prepara-

tions during the previous five months.

140. In. addition to maintaining its quota
of the Eastern Task Force with supplies and
equipment, Middle East had to provide rein-
forcements, to handle rear signals and postal
traffic and to réceive casualties.

141. Pools of reinforcements were, therefore,
built up in the Delta, Tripoli and the Sousse
and Sfax areas from Middle East resources, in
addition to personnel provided by British North
African Force. No. x Advanced Second
Echelon was established at Malta to sérve both
Middle East Forces and British North African
Force. Advanced Second Echelon reported
battle casualties direct to the United Kingdom
and maintained reinforcement officers at Tripoli,
Sousse and Philippeville. In close contact with
these reinforcement officers and with Advanced
Second Echelon, Libya, it was responsible for
the supply of reinforcements to Sicily. It also
served as a clearing-house for the supply of the
necessary information to Second Echelon,
Middle East Forces, and Second Echelon,
British North African Force.

142. Middle East also supplied a base head-
quarters for Sicily. This was supplied from
Tripolitania Base ‘and Lines of Communication
Headquarters, which went to Sicily almost
en bloc, the Base Headquartérs’ duties in
Tripolitania being taken over by Headquarters,
Tripolitania District, from 16th July.

+143. Whilst these arrangements were made
for reinforcements, the provision of cashier and
postal services caused some difficulty. In addi-
tion to providing and equipping cashiers to pro-
ceed with the force, arrangements had to be
