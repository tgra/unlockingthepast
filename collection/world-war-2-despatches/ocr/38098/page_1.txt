SINKING OF THE GERMAN BATTLESHIP
‘BISMARCK ON 277TH MAY, 1941.

The following Despatch was submitied to the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on the
5th July, 1941, by Admiral Sir JOHN C.
TOVEY, K.C.B., D.S.0., Commander-in-
Chief, Home Fleet. .

Home Fleet,
. 5th July, 1941.

Be pleased to lay befcre the Lords Commis-
sioners of the Admiralty the following despatch
covering the operations leading to the sinking
of the German battleship BISMARCK on
Tuesday, 27th May, 1941. All times are zone
minus 2.

First Reports of Enemy.

2. In the second week of May an unusual
amount of German air reconnaissance between
Jan Mayen Island and Greenland was noticed.
It seemed possible that the object of this recon-
naissance was to locate the ice-limits either
with a view to an attack on Jan Mayen Island,
or to assist some ship to break in or out of
the North Sea, through the Denmark Strait.
On x4th May, accordingly, I asked the Flag
Officer-in-Charge, Iceland, for a report of the
ice conditions round Jan Mayen Island. The
report showed that the approach was possible
only from between south and south-west, with
ice blocking all other directions. Reports of
troop movements in Norway, a false alarm of
an air invasion of Iceland and an air reconnais-
sance of Scapa Flow all continued to direct my
attention towards the Denmark Strait; and on
18th May I instructed SUFFOLK, who was cn
patrol, to keep a special watch on the passage
in both directions close to the ice. The Rear-
Admiral Commanding, First Cruiser Squadron,

in H.M.S. NORFOLK, sailed from Hvalfiord ”

the next day and relieved SUFFOLK, who
returned to- Hvalfiord to refuel.

3. Early on 21st May a report was received
of rr merchant vessels and. 2 heavily-screened
large warships northbound in the Kattegat the
day before. Water in the day the warships
were located at Bergen and identified from air

photographs as one Bismarck class battleship

and one Hipper class cruiser. There were in-
dications that these two were contemplating a
raid on the ocean trade routes (Admiralty
message 1828 / 21st May) though, if this were so,
it seemed unlikely that they would stop at a
place so convenient for air reconnaissance as
Bergen. Two other pointers were a report (un-
reliable) of a U-boat, north of Iceland, and an
attack by a German aircraft on Thorshaven
W/T station,

4. The following dispositions were made:—

(2) HOOD (Captain Ralph Kerr, C.B.E.),
flying the flag of Vice-Admiral Lancelot E.
Holland, C.B., Vice-Admiral Commanding,
Battle Cruiser Squadron, and PRINCE, OF
WALES (Captain John C. Leach, M.V.O.),
screened by ELECTRA (Commander Cecil
W. May), ANTHONY (Lieutenant-Com-
mander John M. Hodges), ECHO
(Lieutenant-Commander Cecil H. de B.
Newby), ICARUS (Lieutenant-Commander
Colin D. Maud, D.S.C.), ACHATES
(Lieutenant-Commander Viscount Jocelyn),
and ANTELOPE (Lieutenant-Commander -
Roger B. N. Hicks, D.S.O.),. were sailed from
Scapa to Hvalfiord.

(6) BIRMINGHAM (Captain Alexander
C. G. Madden) and MANCHESTER
(Captain Herbert A. Packer), on patrol in
the Iceland-Faeroes passage, were ordered
to fuel at Skaalefjord and resume patrol.

(c) SUFFOLK (Captain Robert M. Ellis).
who had just arrived at Hvalfiord after being
relieved by NORFOLK (Captain Alfred J. L.
Phillips), flying the flag of “Rear-Admiral
William F. Wake-Walker, C.B., O.B-E.,
Rear-Admiral Commanding, First Cruiser
