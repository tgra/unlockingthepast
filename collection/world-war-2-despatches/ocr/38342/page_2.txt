Rehearsal.

6. The Naval Force, with the exception of
ONSLOW and CHIDDINGFOLD, assembled
at Scapa Flow by 15th December, when em-
barkation of the Military was completed. A
programme of rehearsals followed.

7. The Force proceeded from Scapa at 2z15/
24th December arriving at Sullom Voe at
1330/25th December. Heavy weather was
encountered on passage and on arrival both
PRINCE CHARLES and PRINCE LEO-
POLD discovered and reported various defects
mcluding compartments forward flooded to a
depth of about fourteen feet. ‘

8. In order to allow time to make PRINCE
CHARLES and PRINCE LEOPOLD as sea-
worthy as possible, and in view of the latest
meteorological reports it was decided at 1615
to postpone the operation for 24 hours.

g. All ships had topped up with fuel and
all repairs had been completed by 1400/ 26th
December. The weather forecast was far more
promising and it was therefore decided to sail
the Force at 1600 that day to carry out Opera-
tion ‘‘ Archery ’’ at dawn, 27th December,
IQ4I.

The Naval Approach.

ro, The passage across the North Sea com-
menced in bad weather but, as anticipated, the
weather rapidly improved as the Force pro-
ceeded to the eastward and conditions were
perfect on arrival off the Norwegian coast.

11. Position by the landfall, which was

made exactly as planned, was confirmed on-

sighting the mark submarine TUNA in the
position ordered. She was passed at 0739, one
minute late on planned time.

SUPPLEMENT to tae LONDON GAZETTE, 5 JULY, 1048

12. The Force entered Vaagsfiord* on time
apparently unobserved and it seems possible
that the look-out post at Hovdenoes was not .
manned. KENYA moved over to the southern
side of the fiord while CHIDDINGFOLD led
PRINCE CHARLES and PRINCE LEO-
POLD to the bay south of MHollevik as
planned. ONSLOW closed on KENYA’s star-
board quarter and OFFA closed astern of
KENYA. ORIBI remained near the entrance
of the fiord to cover the Force from the west.

The Bombardment.

13. Hampden aircraft} timed their arrival in
the area perfectly, keeping all the attention well
up-fiord and drawing the fire of four or five
light A.A. guns.

14. At 0842 PRINCE CHARLES made the
signal indicating that Assault Landing Craft
were formed up and moving ahead. KENYA
was moving ahead slowly and at 0848, just
before’ the line of fire opened, star-shell were
fired to burst over Maaloy Island. These were
bursting and illuminating the point of aim on
the island when, half a minute later, the line
of fire opened and the bombardment com-
menced, ONSLOW and OFFA joining in as
soon as clear.

15. The battery on Rugsundo which had
already been bombed by Hampden aircraft
opened fire on KENYA at 0856. It was erra-
tic and the rate of fire low, but nevertheless
proved a great nuisance throughout our stay.
The guns were thought to be smaller than
5.1-inch and were more probably about 4.7-
inch. On bursting, the shell gave off a purple
smoke.

16. At 08573 the ‘‘ cease bombardment ”
signal was made by the Military in the Assault
Landing Craft now rapidly approaching their
objectives. The Naval bombardment of
Maaloy Island thus came to an end and from
reports received from the Military who landed
on the island, there is no doubt whatsoever
that it had been completely successful.

17. At 0858 KENYA, having changed over
to full charges, opened fire on Rugsundo.
After'2} minutes the enemy guns were silenced.
The smoke bombs, dropped by the Hampdens
near Rugsundo,' were by now effective and
gave cover to our ships in the fiord.

Smoke Laying by Atreraft.. _

18. At 08584 on a signal from KENYA, seven
Hampden aircraft, showing great skill and dash,
came in at very low altitudes to drop their
smoke bombs. These were placed with great
precision on Maaloy Island, and as a result the
landing there was unopposed. The bombs were
dropped on a front of approximately 250 yards,
and as there was practically no wind, gave a
screen of ideal density in which visibility was
some 15—20 yards.

1g. The smoke bombs dropped at the landing
place in South Vaagso were only 50 yards out
of the desired position, but one of them most
unfortunately struck a landing craft setting it
alight and causing some 20 casualties from
burns,
