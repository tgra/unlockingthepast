            "description": "15. Early in the new year, I visited Cairo in order to discuss the question of reinforcement which was then under revision. Operations in the Western Desert were being brought to a successful conclusion and it was hoped that, by the time the weather conditions had im- proved in Greece so as to allow occupation of more aerodromes, it would be hg to spare additional squadrons from the Middle East Command. The reinforcement plan envisaged a total force in Greece of fourteen squadrons and I intimated that I would be prepared to start accepting the additional squadrons by r5th January. \u00abIt was hoped that the whole programme would be complete by 15th April. In planning the reinforcement programme, I again endeavoured to get permission to use the aerodromes in the Salonika area, some of which had remained generally serviceable throughout the winter and could be occupied forthwith. The Germans, however, had commenced their infiltration into Roumania, and the Greek Government were particularly anxious to avoid giving them any idea that we had any hostile intentions in Macedonia which could be directed only against German interests."

Zarzis and Gabes proved to be of little value and Sousse was, in fact, not used for Eighth Army maintenance. But Sfax, which was occupied on roth April, was of considerable value. Although the channel was partially blocked, it could be used by light-draught vessels and on 15th April, 1,300 tons were discharged at this port. Ocean- going ships were loaded in the Delta for Sfax and sailed for Tripoli where they were lightened to meet the draught restriction of Sfax and were then called forward, together with such local tonnage as was available. Although limited by a shortage of powered harbour-craft (which was a limiting factor at Tripoli also), , this system enabled a total of over 40,000 tons ~ to be discharged at Sfax by the end of the campaign, an average of over 1,300 tons a day. This, together with the discharge at Tripoli, gave a daily average discharge of stores and supplies from Middle East of over 5,000 tons including bulk petrol."

On the evening of 15th April General Carton de Wiart, with a junior staff officer, arrived at Namsos in a flying boat to confer with the naval landing parties who had already established a footing there. The flying boat and the destroyer \u2018\u2018Somali\u2019\u2019 lying in the Namsen Fiord were repeatedly attacked by German aircraft with bombs and machine- gun fire, and Generai Carton de Wiart\u2019s staff officer was wounded. Meanwhile 146th Infantry Brigade had been ordered, while at sea, to go to Namsos instead of Narvik, but it was evident that the landing of these troops direct from transports was not a feasible operation at Namsos, and that they would have to be transferred to destroyers at Lillesjone and then taken to Namsos on two successive days."

The pre- Tequisite that the whole of the North African coastline should be cleared of the enemy meant that the battle in Tunisia took first priority and, until that was concluded, it would be im- possible to know what resources would be available for the invasion of Sicily. The question of the date to be aimed at was also affected. It was calculated at Casablanca that the Tunisian campaign would be completed by Ist May and the target date for Sicily was provisionally fixed at the favourable moon period in July. The Combined Chiefs of Staff subsequently directed that an attempt should be made to advance this date to the corres- ponding period in June. This proved impos- sible, owing to the need for adequate training for the assaulting divisions and the prepara- tion of the necessary administrative basis for the operation, and on 15th April the Combined Chiefs of Staff agreed that roth July should be the target date."

            "description": "150. The formation of South-East Asia Command resulted in extensive developments in organisation, and a whole hierarchy of Headquarters has been called into being. Headquarters, Supreme Allied Commander, South-East Asia, moved from Delhi to Kandy in March, 1944. It was not possible to move my Headquarters to Kandy at this time, as the expansion and development of my Com- mand necessitated maintaining the closest contact with G.H.Q. India, and so it was necessary to form an Advanced Headquarters, A.C.S.E.A., consisting of a Planning and Liaison Staff, to accompany H.Q. S.A.C.S.E.A. in its move to Kandy. Air Headquarters, India, was set up as an autonomous unit to control operations on the North-West Frontier and assume responsibility for the LAF., directly responsible under its own A.O.C. to C.-in-C. India. Eastern Air Command was established to co-ordinate air operations on the Burmese frontier. Its Headquarters moved on 15th April to Calcutta in order to maintain closer touch with its subordinate units\u2014the Strategic Air Force, Third Tactical Air Force, Troop Carrier Command and Photographic Reconnaissance Force. Thus administrative control of American units also gravitated to Calcutta, since this remained the responsibility of Major-General G. E. Stratemeyer in his other capacity, that of Commanding-General of the U.S.A.A-F, in the India-Burma Sector of the China-Burma-India Theatre."

            "description": "\"Administrative difficulties were considerable. The road Metemma-Gondar is only a dry- weather track, and becomes impassable by wheels during the rains. It is seriously inter- rupted some 25 miles east of Gallabat by the unbridged Gandwa River. Movement by M.T. off the road in the Chelga area is not practic- able. The country had been burnt. There was not sufficient grass for camels, nor could they have been used in the steep hills in that area. Mules and horses belonging to the Composite Battalion were below strength and in poor con- dition as a result of previous strenuous cam- paigning. Rain began to fall by 15th April."

The remainder of 5th Division was left in France, but in War Office reserve, and was accordingly relieved in 3rd Corps by 42nd Division. Reports of enemy intentions to invade Holland and Belgium were received from different sources and at different times, and between the 11th and 2and April certain troops were placed under short notice to move. Intensi- fied air reconnaissance was ordered in the zone allotted to the Air Component which included part of the Ruhr and the area to the west of it, but apart from small bridging activity no positive results were observed."

The booty taken included a useful haul of 1,500 gallons of petrol and 3,500 gallons of oil. \"Surprise was complete ; for some days afterwards, enemy convoys, routed via Taungdwingyi, continued to be welcomed by 20 Indian Division, 32 Brigade was followed by 80 Brigade, which entered Natmauk, 28 miles north-north-west of Taungdwingyi, on the 15th April. Both Brigades then continued their rapid advance westwards to the Irrawaddy. 32 Brigade reached the river at Myingun, nine miles south- east of Magwe, on the 19th without opposition. On the same day, 80 Brigade occupied Magwe after slight opposition from astonished Japanese administrative units. \u2018We thus controlled the Irrawaddy at two points 22 and 33 miles south of Yenangyaung respectively. Considerable equipment was captured in Magwe and, once more, unsuspecting convoys entering the town were captured."

In the case of Akyab, however, this was acceler- ated to the 15th April; and the\u2019 first tanker discharged on the 21st, just in time for the intensive air supply effort to support Four- teenth Army in the last critical stage of their advance. Nevertheless, the situation gave cause for anxiety. Squadrons were greatly exceeding the rates of maximum effort, which resulted in abnormal consumption of petrol, oil and lubri- cants. Although the actual consumption was far in excess of estimate, our petrol stocks just held out. Aero engine lubricants were flown in from Chittagong and even from Western Bengal, and the emergency was met."
