            "title": "Masterful Deception: 30 Corps Implements Elaborate Camouflage Tactics Ahead of October Battle",
            "description": "To conceal -the reinforcement of 30 Corps careful calculations were made to determine what the area would look hike from the air immediately before the battle; the same picture was then reproduced by ist October by disposing transport in the areas which would be occupied on 23rd October. Dummy lorries were erected in the areas which would be occupied by the artillery regiments so that the guns and limbers could be moved in by night and concealed under the dummies. The additional dumps were elaborately camouflaged, for.which purpose the hummocky area near El Imayid station was well adapted. The new tracks could-not be concealed, and they were the most revealing indications of our purpose. The only solution which offered itself was to delay until the last the completion of those parts of them which would be most sigmficant to the enemy. In the 13 Corps sector the intended concentrations of artillery were first represented by dummy guns which were later replaced by teal guns Most elaborate measures were taken to conceal the movement of ro Corps. The two assembly areas were filled by about 6th October with approximately two thousand vehicles in each with over seven hundred dummy vehicles to be placed over the tanks of the three armoured brigades. The Corps moved from its training area to two staging areas on I9th October; these moves were carned out openly as training moves. From the staging areas to the assembly areas the moves were made largely by night and all tanks and guns moved entirely by night. As units moved out of the staging areas they were replaced by dummy tanks, some mobile and some static, dummy guns and transport and by over two thousand real motor vehicles.",

The expected gale did not materialise until the 6th October, Even so, at the slow speed at which X.10 had to be towed, STUBBORN could not have arrived at Lerwick by that time. The loss of X.r0, after all she had done and all the efforts to bring her safely home, is very much regretted however.",

            "description": "The first phase of this plan was already practically completed when I wrote and, after the pause, we proceeded with the second phase. -Fifth Army had a hard struggle for the passes leading down into the plain of Naples but by 28th September ro Corps was through and the King’s Dragoon Guards entered the great city at 0930 hours on 1st October. Eighth Army's principal objective, Foggia and its airfields, had fallen four days before on the 27th. On Doth fronts the pursuit went on, but it was slower now. On 6th October Fifth Army stood along the line of the Volturno River and realised that it would have to force a crossing against strong resistance; Eighth Army had also left behind the early days of rapid advance across the open country of Apulia and the line ran clear across Italy through the mountains from Termoli to Benevento and Capua and down to the Tyrrhenian at Castel Volturno. My _plan had been based on the German intention to withdraw to the Pisa-Rimini line and that intention had now been revoked on the highest authority; but before proceeding to discuss the effect of this new situation I must pause to describe the problems of administration which now faced us.",

Its frontage was very extensive for its small strength but the enemy also was weak in this sector. On 24th September the watershed was gained after a stiff fight for the Mandrioli Pass, for which the enemy put up a strong defence. After this heavy tains prevented further operations until 30th September; the division and the armoured brigade under command were transferred to the Adriatic sector and replaced by 1 Guards Brigade Group and2 Anti-Aircraft Brigade from Fifth Army for use as infantry. With these forces, reinforced ‘by three dismounted armoured car regiments and three independent infantry battalions, it was impossible to force the pace. The enemy, however, continued to withdraw and by 6th October 10 Corps had gained a position astride Route 71 on the upper teaches of the Savio, not much more than fifteen miles from Cesena.",

The attack increased in intensity on oth October when 88 Division, now completely relieved by 13 Corps, attacked simultaneously with 85 Division to the east of Route 65 and with 91 Division on the axis of the road itself. The enemy was now reinforcing fast.* 65 Division had already been brought round from the western sector and put in in a narrow sector on the Bologna road and, on the r3th, 44 Division, which had been taken out for a rest, was re-committed. The troops were encouraged by a personal order from Hitler, read out to ail ranks on 6th October, that the Apennine position was to be held at all costs. On the r4th Vietinghoff decided to run risks in his vital left sector and began to bring across 29 Panzer Grenadier Division from the front opposite Eighth Army. In spite of this our advance continued. On the 12th 85 Division captured Monte delle Formiche, a two thousand foot peak to the east of the main road and level",
