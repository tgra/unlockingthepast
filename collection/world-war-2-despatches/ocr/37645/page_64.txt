at once. This I was most anxious to accom-
plish at the earliest possible moment, both to
hasten the structure of an Ethiopian State
which might eventually stand on its own legs,
and to get the fullest use out of the patriot
movement in conjunction with my forces which
were still engaged with the enemy, thus com-
pensating to a small degree for the loss of troops
and equipment being sent up to Middle East.

It_was, however, quite impossible to allow
the Emperor back until I had settled the various
internal security questions in Addis Abeba and
disarmed the Italians, I had some difficulty
with the Emperor on this question, and he
appeared distrustful of our future intentions
towards him. I was, however, in a position
to let him in on 5th May on which day he
ceremoniously entered the city on the anniver-
sary of the entry by the Italians exactly five
years before. In view of the complete disarm-
ing of the city there were no major incidents.
Considerable credit was due to Brigadier M. S.
Lush, M.C., the D.C.P.0., who was in charge
of the civil administration, for this happy result.

83. Meanwhile political officers were being
sent to the main centres and were engaged in
administering the country as far as possible
through the local Ethiopian officials and chiefs.
The Duke of Harrar, Prince Mackonnen,
arrived in Harrar to be the Governor of that
Province.

84. The political situation at that time as far
as E.A. Force was concerned was that I was
Military Governor of [Italian Somaliland,
British Somaliland, and those parts of
Abyssinia in which my troops were in occupa-
tion, as far north as Dessie and the Gojjam.
D.C.P.Os, were functioning under my orders in
Italian Somaliland at Mogadiscio, and as already
stated in Addis Abeba for Abyssinia. British
Somaliland was placed under a separate Military
Governor, Brigadier A. Chater, C.B.,
D.S.O., O.B.E., under my general direction. In
order to avoid for the moment any difficulties
with the Somalis in connection with the
Emperor’s return, Italian Somaliland as de-
limited by the Italians, and not in accordance
with the old boundary, was kept under the
D.C.P.O. in Mogadiscio, or in other words, the
whole of the area including the Ogaden and
southwards from it, was kept under the
D.C.P.O. Italian Somaliland, and this area was
known as Southern Somalia.

85. At this period considerable trouble was
still being given over most of the occupied area
by the many armed deserters from the Italian
Army who had formed themselves into
marauding bands. It was clear that my main
object was the defeat of the Italian forces,
and therefore I was quite unable to provide the
large number of troops which would have been
required in the vast area under my control, to
establish law and order with efficiency and
despatch. I explained to my political officers
that they would have to do the best they
could with the few garrison battalions I could
spare and what they could raise in the way of
gendarmerie and police from local resources,
and that I quite appreciated I would have to
accept a degree of lawlessness until such time
as I could spare troops to enforce the law. I
have to thank them for the loyal way in which
they accepted this position, and the efficiency
with which they established a considerable
degree of law and order with the assistance of
the small military resources available.

86. The general question of military political
control in E.A. Force was, however, most un-
satisfactory. Owing to operations it was neces-
sary for me to have my Headquarters in Harrar.
Under these conditions I was separated from
my three administrators in Addis Abeba,
Mogadiscio and Hargeisa, by many hundreds
of miles. I had no political staff myself. The
D.C.P.Os. dealt direct with the Chief Political
Officer, Middle East, who had meantime left
Cairo and had opened his Headquarters in
Nairobi. All political action was presented to
me as a fait accompli, and hence though I was
responsible, I had no means of exerting
authority, of knowing what was going on or
even of laying down the policy for the'area for
which I was responsible. For instance,
although I was the authority for confirmation
of death sentences I had no independent legal
adviser. Again, I eventually found that the
militarily most important offence of concealing
arms was being dealt with by the death sen-
tence in one area, and mere internment in
another; I had no machinery by which I could
ascertain the details of the administration, or to
see that a general policy was being applied
throughout.

The situation was considerably eased by the
move back of my Advanced H.Q. to Nairobi on
18th June, a move which was made possible
by the fact that by the above date military
operations in the Galla Sidamo had been
reduced to a scale which enabled them to be
undertaken wholly by the Commander of rrth
(A) Division.

It was, however, recognised that the normal
O.E.T.A. organisation could not apply over the
large area for which I was responsible, and a
scheme is now in hand by which I will be
relieved of all purely civil administrative
responsibilities,

Evacuation,

87. It had always been my view, and indeed,
that of my political advisers, that before any
form of Ethiopian control was permitted in
Abyssinia it would be necessary to evacuate all
Italians, lock, stock and barrel. I exp)
this view to the C.-in-C. with the suggestion
that by far the best solution would be repatria-
tion to Italy if it could possibly be arranged.

As soon as it was possible to arrive at some
estimate of the numbers involved and the
accommodation and transport facilities avail-
able, the problem was examined in detail. The
numbers of civilians to be evacuated were esti-
mated at 55,000 though to this figure some
70,000 prisoners of war had to be added.
‘Women and children were estimated at 12,000
and 7,000 respectively. It was immediately
apparent that total evacuation, even if ship-
ping were available, must bea very long
process, probably extending over at least six
months. It would, moreover, entail the com-
plete stoppage of all essential services in
Abyssinia and the many technical institutions
and factories introduced by the Italians and
entirely supervised by them. I felt, therefore,
that I was forced to revise my previous views
on the subject of evacuation, and was confirmed
in this opinion by the remarkable restraint
shown by the Ethiopians up to that time from
avenging themselves against the Italians. I
decided, therefore, that evacuation should be
started as soon as possible, but should be
carried out by categories in the following order,
