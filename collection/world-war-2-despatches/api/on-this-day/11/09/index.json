On the 9th November, I issued orders for the formation of a command and staff for the lines of communication, to centralise the lines  of communication under a separate  Commander and thus relieve the Commander, Fourteenth Army, and Commander, 15 Indian Corps, of responsibilities for their rear areas. The new Line of Communication Command was to comprise the existing 202 and 404 Lines of Communication Areas and the Fort Hertz Area. The rear boundaries of. Fourteenth Army and 15 Indian Corps were to be adjusted as the progress of operations dictated, in order to relieve the forward Commander of administrative responsibilities."
