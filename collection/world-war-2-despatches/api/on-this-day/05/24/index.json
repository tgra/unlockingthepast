The Chiefs of Staff added that it was essential that the Commanders-in-Chief should  concert measures for clearing up the situation  without delay. In so doing the Fleet and t Royal Air Force were to accept whatever risk : was entailed in preventing any considerable enemy reinforcement reaching Crete.

In the Tripoli area, units and formations were supplied from three signal parks and an advanced ordnance depot, and in the Delta direct from base ordnance depots. Owing to the fact that the ship conveying certain of the special combined operations  signal stores from the United Kingdom broke down, many of them did not arrive until the expedition was due to sail. This involved a considerable amount of improvisation. As a consequence none of the special stores were issued until 24th May, one week before the last day on which units could accept delivery, which severely handicapped the training of operators in these new types of equipment. A certain amount of difficulty was also caused by the arrival of battle  batteries in unserviceable condition. Fortunately a second consignment arrived, which eased the situation.",
