’ THE ASSAULT PHASE OF THE
NORMANDY LANDINGS.

The following Despatch was submitted to the
Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary
Force on the 16th October, 1944, by Admiral
Sir Bertram H. Ramsay, K.C.B., M.V.O.,

- Allied Naval Commander-n-Chief, Ex-

- peditionary Force.

Office of Allied Naval Commander-in-Chief,
. Expeditionary Force,
London, S.W.t1.

: 16th October, 1944.
Sir,
' JT have the honour to forward my report of
the opening phase of Operation ‘‘ Neptune,”
the period covered being from my appoint-
ment as Allied Naval Commander, Expedition-
ary Force, on 25th October, 1943, to the with-
drawal of the Naval Task Force Commanders
on 3rd July, 1944. The report is lengthy owing
to the need to caver, if only superticially, the
very many different aspects of what is acknow-
Jedged to be’ the greatest amphibious opera-
tion in history. Because the report is'so bulky,
I have decided to write this covering letter
in a form which will enable those who wish
to do so to obtain a bird’s eye view of the
operation ‘as-a whole, including the preparatory
period and the build-up,’ without going into
detail.

2.. Because, in the event, the movements of
over 5,000 ships and craft.proceeded smoothly,
and to plan, and because, despite bad weather,
the Allied armies and air forces were landed
and reinforced, if not quite as quickly as the
optimum planning figure, at least more quickly
than the enemy reinforced his forces by land,
it may now appear that the size and com-
plexity: of the: naval problem was somewhat
exaggerated. This was not the case. That

the operation proceeded smoothly and accord-
ing to plan was the result of the hard work
and foresight of the many thousands concerned
in its preparation and of the determination and
courage of the tens of thousands in the Allied
navies and merchant fleets who carried out
their orders in accordance with the very highest

_ traditions of the sea.

Magnitude of the Operation and need for Close
ontrol.

3. From the outset of detailed planning it
was clear that success would be largely de-
pendent upon the ability to exercise close and
Continuous control of the thousands of shipsand
craft taking part. This overall control would
have to embrace.control of loading of all types
of shipping and craft, control of convoy sail-
ing, control of tugs, and control of ship re-
pairs. Without it time would inevitably be
Jost and the best use could not be made of the
great resources given to the operation to estab-
lish our forces ashore and then to reinforce
them as quickly as possible. As other services
and authorities besides the navy were inti-
mately concerned with many of the problems
connected with the rapid reinforcement of the
Expeditionary Force, it was found necessary
during planning to set up new organisations to
control various aspects of the operation during
the vital first few weeks in which the tempo
of the initial assaults -had to be maintained at
the highest pitch, TURCO, BUCO, COREP
and COTUG* accordingly came into being and
were instrumental in the success achieved.

4. Because the assaults were .to be carried
out on a narrow front and because British and
