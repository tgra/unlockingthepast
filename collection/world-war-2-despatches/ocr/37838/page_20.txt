Protection of the Cross-Channel movement.

199. The task of assisting the naval forces to
protect the passage of the assault armies from
surface and U-boat attack, was undertaken
chiefly by R.A.F. Coastal Command though
aircraft of A.E.A.F. assisted in this task. I
deal with these operations in more detail in
paragraph 387 et seq. Here I need only men-
tion that on D-Day and D + 1, aircraft of
R.A.F. Coastal Command flew 353 sorties or
anti-shipping and anti-U-boat patrols. A line
of patrols was provided at either end of the
Channel. The air protection thus afforded
contributed much to the safety of the Allied
shipping from both surface and underwater
attack by enemy naval forces.

200. Fifteen squadrons of fighters were
allotted the task of protecting the shipping
lanes. These squadrons flew 2,015 sorties dur-
ing the course of D-Day and D + 1, the cover
being maintained at six squadron strength

204. As R.A.F. Bomber Command left the
assault area, United States Eighth Air Force
heavy bombers took over the bombardment
role. In the thirty minutes immediately pre-
ceding the touch-down hour, 1,365 heavy
bombers attacked selected areas in the coastal
defences, dropping 2,796 tons of bombs. The
Tesult of these operations added to the previous
air bombardment and combined with the naval

shelling, neutralised wholly or in large part~

almost all of the shore batteries and the oppo-
sition to the landings was very much less than
was expected.

205. Medium, light and fighter bombers then
took a hand in the attacks on the enemy
defensive system by attacking artillery positions
further inland and other targets in the coastal
defences. The immense scale of this effort may
be gauged from the statistics which appear
after para. 233.

206. The heavy bombers of the United States
Eighth Air Force operated again later in the
day, and although cloud interfered with bomb-
ing about midday, necessitating the recall of
some missions, a further 1,746 tons of bombs
were dropped. In all, the Eighth Air Force
flew 2,627 heavy bombers and 1 1347 escort and
offensive fighter sorties during the day.

207. Spotiing for Naval Gunfire. The naval
bombardment took place according to plan.
In this bombardment, aircraft of A.E.A.F.
played an important role. The Fleet Air Arm
had stated early on in the planning that it
would be unable to find from its own resources
enough aircraft to provide for spotting for the
gunfire of all the capital ships it was planned

throughout this period. Owing to the lack of
enemy reaction, I was able later to reduce this
cover to a two squadron force.

2or. For convenience of presentation, I have
set out the full plan for the employment of
fighter forces during the assault and post-
assault phasé in the next section. (See para-
graph 308 et seq.)

Neutralisation of Coastal and Beach Defences.

202. The task of neutralising as many of the
coastal defence positions as possible during the
crucial period of the assault was shared by
naval and air bombardment. The air bombard-
ment plan called for attacks to commence just
before dawn on D-Day.

203. R.A.F. Bomber Command commenced
the bombardment with attacks on the following
ten selected heavy coastal batteries in the
assault area: —

I24 698

1x6 468

1,136 5,853 tons

to use. Accordingly, despite the unfortunate
diversion of effort from air resources that were
far from inexhaustible, I had agreed that two
squadrons of Spitfires from A.D.G.B. and two
wings (each of three squadrons) of Mustangs
from R.A.F. Second Tactical Air Force should
be trained for this task. At various times,
therefore, well before D-Day, these squadrons
had been trained with No. 3 Naval Fighter
Wing.

208. The result was that on D-Day and sub-
sequently, we were just able to meet the heavy
calls for spotting for naval gunfire that were
made on us. On D-Day, no less than 394
sorties were flown on this task,- of which ‘cs
were flown by five sqtiadrons of A.E.A.F
Each of the two Spitfire squadrons, No. 26
Squadron and No. 33 Squadron made 76 sorties
in the course of the day. In all, during the
period of consolidation in the beach-head, that
is from 6th June to rgth June, a total of 1,318
sorties on naval gunnery spotting were flown.
Of this total, aircraft of A.E.A.F. flew 940.
Five aircraft of A.E.A.F. were destroyed on
these operations during this period.

209. It may be pointed out here that further
calls were made on these same A.E.A.F.
squadrons at later stages in the campaign. The
gunfire of the capital ships bombarding the
isolated German garrisons in the fortresses of
Cherbourg in late June, and of St. Malo and
Brest in late August, was spotted for by these
squadrons. On these duties a ‘further 124
sorties were flown apart from those flown by
aircraft of Fleet Air Arm.
