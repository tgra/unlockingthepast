SUPPLEMENT to tuzE LONDON GAZETTE, 14 AUGUST, 10946

54. The situation in Iranian Kurdistan had
not improved and on 10th October it became
necessary to maintain a strong mobile detach-
ment at Senna for the purpose of stabilising the
situation by frequent patrolling.

55. Work continued on the construction of
fortress areas in North Iraq and in Persia
throughout the winter, all available labour,
engineer resources and troops being employed.
The 6th Indian Division (less one Brigade)
remained in Iran and the whole of the 8th
Indian Division and two Brigades of the roth
Indian Division worked on defences in Iraq.
One Brigade each of the 6th and roth Indian
Divisions were employed on protective duties
base area, on the lines of
communication Basra-Baghdad and Baghdad-
Habbaniya-Rutbah, and in Kirkuk and on the
oil pipe line. The znd Indian Armoured
Brigade Group trained in North Iraq after con-
centrating there in November,

In spite of exceptionally severe winter condi-
tions very good progress was made on defensive
works.

At the same time work continued steadily
on:—

(i) development of the main base area, at
Basra-Shaiba and advanced bases near
Baghdad, and at Kirkuk and Ahwaz (Iran);

(ii) construction of aerodromes - and
satellites in North Iraq and in Iran;

(iii) improvement of road, rail and river
communications in Iraq and Iran;

(iv) developments of Um Qasr and Bandar
Shahpur (Persian Gulf) Ports; .

(v) construction of telegraph communica-
tions systems in Iraq and Iran.

56. At the end of October plans were put in
hand to receive in Iraq two British Divisions
and up to eight Squadrons of aircraft, for
later despatch to the Caucasus. Though no
definite decision had been reached regarding
the despatch of these forces, 5oth Division was

4101

ordered to move from the Middle East to Iraq
as soon as possible. This Division (less one
Brigade Group which had been retained by
Middle East Command) began to arrive in Iraq
on 14th November, and was concentrated in
the Kirkuk area by 8th December.

57. On 15th November, 1941, a new direc-
tive cancelling that issued on 29th July was
issued to Lt.-General Quinan. It gave de-
tails of the reinforcements he might expect to
receive up to June, 1942, and instructed him
that his primary task was the defence of Iraq
and Iran against the enemy advance from
Anatolia or from the Caucasus. In the de-
fence of Iraq he was to act throughout in
the closest co-operation with the Commander
Ninth Army (Palestine and Transjordan).

He was to be prepared also for the following
possible operations:—

(i) Operations in Anatolia in co-operation
with troops of Middle East Command and
possibly the Turkish Army.

(ii) Co-operation with the Russian Army
in the defence of the Caucasus or North
Tran.

He was to prepare to maintain ten Divisions
and thirty Squadrons Royal Air Force in Iraq
and up to six Divisions in Iran. In addition
to developing road, rail and river communica-
tions as necessary to ensure maintenance -of
these forces, he was to ensure the maximum
possible delivery of supplies to Russia.

58. In view of changes in the general situa-
tion, orders were received on 3rd January,
1942, for the soth Division to return to the
Middle East Command and the move com-
menced from Kirkuk on 12th January, 1942.

59. With effect from rath January, 1942,
operational control of Iraq and Iran passed
from the India Command to the Middle East
Command.
