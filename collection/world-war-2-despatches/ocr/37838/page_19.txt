SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 JANUARY, 1047

184. The sorties of Coastal Command included
are only those on anti-shipping and anti-U-boat
patrols in the Bay of Biscay and Channel areas
and off the Dutch coast. The weight of depth
charges, bombs, etc., dropped and casualties
or claims arising from these sorties are not

included.
(c) The Assault
Decision to make the Assault

185. After consultations with the Com-
manders-in-Chief of the three services, during
May, you had fixed the date of the Assault for
5th June. The decision as to date had to be
taken in good time to permit of the completion
of final preparations. Some of the ships in
the invasion Armada, for example, had to sail
a week before the time planned for the assault.

186. As the date approached, the weather
forecasts pointed to very serious deterioration
in conditions for D-Day. On 3rd June, you
summoned a conference at your Advanced
Headquarters at Portsmouth to consider the

. weather situation, This conference included
yourself, the Deputy Supreme Commander, Air
Chief Marshal Sir A. W. Tedder, G.C.B., your
Chief of Staff Lieutenant General W. B. Smith,

“Admiral Sir Bertram H, Ramsay, K.C.B.,
K.B.E., M.V.O., and his Chief of Staff, General
Sir Bernard L. Montgomery, K.C.B., D.S.O.,
and his Chief of Staff, and the Heads of the
Naval, Army and Air Meteorological Services.
I attended this conference with my Senior Air
Staff Officer, Air Vice-Marshal H. E.
Wigglesworth, C.B., C.B.E., D.S.C.

187. The first meeting took place at 2100
hours on 3rd June. It lasted until after mid-
night, when you decided to postpone any de-
cision until the meteorological staffs could collect
later reports.

188. The second meeting took place at o400
hours on 4th June, and in the light of weather
forecasts then available, you decided to post-
pone the time of the assault for 24 hours,
primarily on the grounds that the air forces
would be unable to provide adequate support
for the crossing and assault operations, and
could not undertake the airborne tasks.

189. The meeting reassembled at 2100
hours on 4th June, and after considerable de-
Viberation a decision was again deferred to
enable the meteorological staffs to study Jater
data.

190. The final meeting took place at 0430
hours in the morning of 5th June. Weather
conditions forecast for the following day were
still far from satisfactory and from the air
point of view, below the planned acceptable
minimum.

1g. Nevertheless, taking into account the
fact that the adverse weather conditions im-
posed an equal handicap on the enemy air

“the air forces in support of the assault.

55

forces, I considered, and I gave this as my
opinion, that the Allied air effort possible would
provide a reasonable measure of air protection
and support and that airborne operations would
be’ practicable.

192. After considering also the weather con-
ditions as affecting the land and sea operations,
you made the decision that the assault was to
take place on the first high tide in the morning
of the 6th of June and that the airborne forces
were to be flown over and dropped in their
allotted zones before dawn of that day.

The Assault is made

193. The assault was on a five divisional
front on the east side of the Cherbourg Penin-
sula immediately north of the Carentan Estuary
and the River Orne.

194. The First United States Army landed
between Varreville and Colleville-sur-Mer; 1
R.C.T.* landed ‘between Varreville and the
Carentan Estuary, 2 R.C.T. between the
Carentan Estuary and Colleville-sur-Mer. The
Second British Army with five brigades, landed
between Asnelles and Ouistreham. These sea-
borne forces were supported on their flanks by
two airborne forces, two United States Airborne
Divisions being dropped and landed in the area
of St. Mere Eglise, and a British Airborne Divi-
sion in the area between the Rivers Orne and
Dives. The mapt facing shows the landing
beaches and the positions gained in the first
three weeks of the assault.

195. The first airborne forces landed before
dawn on 6th June and the landing barges and
craft coming in on the first tide, touched down
at 0630 hours. Follow-up forces were landed
with the second tide, and in the evening, addi-
tional airborne forces were flown in.

196. There was no.enemy opposition to the
original passage of the assault or airborne forces.
This fact is all the more remarkable when it
is remembered that many of the ships had,
of necessity, been at sea for periods of some
days.

197. I have set out in Section (b) of Part
II at paragraph 35, the tasks sagertasen by

‘or
