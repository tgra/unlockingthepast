No: damage or casualties were sustained in
either -of these two attacks, apart from that
caused to the radar arrays.

Meanwhile the fires in H.M.S. FORMID-
ABLE were soon under control, and by 1254 the
-ship was capable of 24 knots. It was estimated
that one barrier would be in action by 1600,
and that the flight deck hole would be patched
by then. . .

. At 1215 it became necessary to tum into the
wind and. land on fighters, although enemy
aircraft were known to be still in the vicinity.
Aircraft from H.M.S. FORMIDABLE were
landed on the other carriers,

‘At 1220 a Jill* was shot down by fighters
from H.M<S. INDOMITABLE and half an

-hour later a Val met the same fate by Seafires
from H.M.S. INDEFATIGABLE. By'1420 the
Bombarding Force was being manoeuvred close
tothe Carrier Force, and the Fleet reformed in
Cruising Disposition at 1450. :

As the strike programme planned for the day
had been completed, and as considerable re-
organisation was necessary with the flight deck
of H.M.S. FORMIDABLE out of action, the

Fleet commenced withdrawing to the south’

eastward. By 1700 H.M.S. FORMIDABLE
* was able to receive 13 of her Corsairs—a fine
Tecovery. - ’
At about 1515 Corsairs from H.M.S.
VICTORIOUS intercepted and shot down a
.Judy to the northward. ;
_ Although at various times during the after-
noon there. were enemy aircraft in the vicinity,
it was not until 1720 that the development of
another attack became evident. This was how-
ever broken up’ very satisfactorily by our
fighters. At 172z a Judy, believed to be the
Gestapo of the Group, was shot down from
24,000 feet to the eastward by fighters. A few
minutes later  Seafires from H.M.S.

INDEFATIGABLE intercepted 4 Zekes to the.
southward and shot down 3 before the other ©

escaped to the northward.

At 173@ a Hellcat returning for an emergency -

landing was fired on by H.M.S. FORMID-
ABLE and hit. The aircraft crashed but the
pilot was ‘rescued unhurt by H.M.S.
UNDAUNTED.

At 1820 Corsairs from H.M.S. VICTORIOUS
were sent fo intercept a bogey.to the north-
ward. They found and shot down the Zeke.

’ At 1945 CTF 57 assumed tactical command.
A total of 14 enemy aircraft, all airborne, were
destroyed during the day, 11 by fighters, 2
. shot down by gunfire including one which
bounded off the deck of H.M.S. INDOMI-
TABLE, and 1 originally damaged by gunfire
but which completed its suicide dive on H.M.S.
‘FORMIDABLE. Several small vessels around
-the islands-were damaged. Our losses totalled

Runways on Miyako and Ishigaki .were -well
bombed again, and all of them left unservice-
able by the end of the day. A GAP was main-
tained over each island. ‘

Three operational aircraft were found on the
ground and destroyed, and a petrol dump was

hoped that the previous day’s bombardment
‘was responsible for this at least temporary
change for the airmen. —

The American Dumbo rescue aircraft was
again maintained by CTF 5z between the Fleet
and the target from 0830 till 1700.

A high snooper was detected at about 0730
and a long chase of 300 miles followed. This
eventually finished at 0920 when .Corsairs of
H.M.S. FORMIDABLE, but operating from
H.M:S. VICTORIOUS, splashed, the Zeke 80
