ahead to Antwerp together with certain harbour
crait, and these were assembled with the per-
sonnel of the Parties in an ex-Belgian Cavalry
Camp at Burg Leopold. The diary of the
movements of these Parties shows how these
Parties despite their late formation did, with
the unstinted help of the Army, reach their
destinations soon enough to take timely control
of the situations in their ports.

27. The actual surrender of the North Ger-
man Ports began on 26th April when a Naval
Officer of 30 Advance Unit (the naval unit
specially formed tor the collection of intel-
ligence) reached the Bremen City Hall at 1030
and accepted the surrender of the city from the
acting Bergermeister, U.S. Naval Task Force
126 designated for this port was already on the
Continent and the Commander of this force
(Rear-Admiral A. G. Robinson, U.S.N.), made
a preliminary reconnaissance on the 27th April.
He found that there was no apparent damage
to docks, quays and other harbour installations
but that warehouses were totally destroyed and
prisoners-of-war stated that many mines had
been sown in the enclosed basins and the ad-
jacent river. The capacity of the port’ was re-
stricted to some extent by sunken ships and in
fact no war or merchant ships were found
afloat.

28. On the 3rd May the Hamburg garrison
surrendered unconditionally, and Commodore
H. T. England, D.S.O., who had gone forward
with. the occupying Army forces entered the
port as Commodore-in-Charge. He found the
attitude of the port officials cowed but co-
operative. The Port Party for Hamburg was
not far behind and entered the port two days
later. :

29. The 5th May saw the surrender of all
German Forces in Germany, Holland and Den-
mark, including the garrisons of Heligoland
and Frisian Islands, and with the cessation of
offensive operations all the remaining Naval

. Parties were able to move into their respec-
tive ports to establish control and_ initiate
measures for the disarmament of the German
Navy.

30. The two British Flag Officers, who were
to be in command of the naval-forces occupy-
ing the ports in the British zone of North Ger-
many, were then moving in to set up their
Headquarters. These Flag Officers were: —

Rear-Admiral H. T. Baillie-Grohman,

C.B., D.S.O., O.B.E., whose title then was

Flag Officer, Kiel. His command included

the naval forces in the area eastward of the

Elbe to the Russian border, and his title was

later altered to Flag Officer, Schleswig-Hol-

stein. He set up his Headquarters first at

Kiel and later at Plén so as to be within easy

reach of 8th Corps Headquarters,

Rear-Admiral G. C. Muirhead-Gould,

D.S.C., whose title then was Flag Officer,

Wilhelmshaven. This was changed Jater to

Flag Officer, Western Germany, to indicate

better the scope of his command, which in-

cluded all naval forces in the British zone
west of the Elbe, and Hamburg. His Head-
quarters were first established at Seng-
warden near Wilhelmshaven and later moved
to Buxtehude about 20 miles from Hamburg.

31. These two Flag Officers with the staffs
and Naval Parties under theit commands lived
through some adventurous and difficult times

and the stories of their early days given in their
reports of proceedings make interesting and
instructive reading.

32. Admiral Baillie-Grohman reports ,that
VE Day was anything but a public holiday for
himself and his staff, for on that day, besides
interviews with German senior officers, he had
to cope with 4,000 troops who landed at.
Eckernforde from landing craft unaware that
the War was over and full of enthusiasm for
continuing it. The influx of refugee ships from
the Baltic was a constant source of anxiety to
him at the time.

33. Admiral Muirhead-Gould landed at
Heligoland and accepted its surrender on the
tith May. He found the island devastated by
bombing and almost uninhabitable, but left a
British Naval Party on the island under the
command of a Lieutenant-Commander, who
on the next day found himself compelled to
place the German Senior Naval Officer under
arrest for his obstructive conduct, ~

show of naval strength in Copenhagen and on
the 9th May, the cruisers BIRMINGHAM and
