(@) I emphasised that I must know not later than  Wednesday,  a3rd April, if  with-  drawal was to cornmence on 28th  April or not, due to the fact that four days  notice was

requir d: before  the necessary shipping could - be made available in Greek waters. (e) The A.O.C._ dfew attention to the pre-

. Seton: state to which: his Aghtet strength was

being reduced.

(f) It was decided    eat no preliminary evacuation should take place; both from the  point of view of secrecy and because it was

-z2. News was received that the Adolf .Hitler Division had reached Yannina the previous evening, and that the Greek Army in the

Epirus had capitulated  without informing the.

Greek Government and without reference to General Papagos, and consequently without warning: to the British in Athens.. As. the left of the Anzac Corps was now under the German threat from the direction of Messolonghion and had insofficient troops to meet it, and as, moreover, there-appeared to be a possibility: that the Italians and Germans might try a landing at or near Patras which  would  threaten the  whole left rear, General Wilson decided that evacuaBat mime Beets at the bee  possible moment.  accor requeste: asa preliminary  step, certain, akigping to be held in readiness in  Suda Bay in case of emergericy. . .1.13. Brigadier Hewer flew, to Cairo .where a meeting was held at G.H.Q., M. E., to decide ways and means of putting the, military and naval outline plans into effect. | - , 14. In the evening I was. called, to General :Wilson's house for a conference, and after dark General Wilson; :  Brigadier Galloway,and I

motored to the vicinity of Thebes, and had a

conference with General Sir: Thomas . Blamey. Details of the retirement were decided upon and it was agreed that the evacuation should be  commenced at the  earliest possible date, which was likely to be the night of 24th/ 25th April.

15. Today .a Naval Signal Office was  stab-

. lished at Combined H.Q. with direct telephone

 lines to Botannikos  W/T -  station and to a  stdnd-by: W/T station: on  the roof of-a house  about a: quarter mile: away from  G.H.Q.  Owing to language difficulti's it was necessary  to senda P.O: Tel graphist and  a Signalman to man the telephone line in Botannikos w/T  station. The Signalman |  had a,lamp in case  the telephone should'be put out of-action. The :W/T.,station on the roof: maintained communication on 465 kce/s-with Suda Bay. |

Suda Bay, so that a preliminary evacuation f ' might be possible if required on the night of 23rd/24th April. It was learnt later, however, that. the Glen ships were not due to arrive at Suda until 2300 on. 23rd April, and

so would not be available until 24th asth:

17. A fresh outline  programme was the made  out and signalled in my 1429/22. This programmie was subsequently altered owing to the fact that the G.O.C. decided it was in}- practicable, due to the unexpectedly rapi advance of the German forces, to embark the rearguard;  who were likely to  be in contact with the enemy, from the,Megara area, and that it would be necessary to withdraw these troops across the Corinth Canal and embark them from positions in the Morea. As will be seen later,  this plan had again to be altered owing to the attack on the Corinth Canal by German parachute troops at - daylight  on Saturday, 26th, April.

The early

return from the .beaches would give oy

chance of the ships clearing the coast withow being spotted, and would give them more tim to reach the area within support of the fighters

.from Crete by daylight or as soon as possible

afterwards. There would be no such support ? from Greece whatsoever from 24th April onwards. I decided to accept the disadvantage

of reducing the time the ships were at the b aches in order to give  this possible extra security,.and as.events turned out it appears this was, justified. The only. transport to leave teally late, the SLAMAT, was  bombed and sunk and was the only ship to become a total loss after loading. Moreover, no beaches were bombed during embarkation.

The fact that they had no w/t was a great Henle at this time, as well as decreasing their. chances of survival on the. Greek coast.
