            "date": "10th February",
            "description": "35. The long range penetration brigade which was making its way across the Chindwin overland towards Katha received its first airborne suppiies on 10th February, and its maintenance thereafter became a continuous commitment. The remaining two brigades were landed on two strips improvised in the jungle during the nights of S5th/6th and 10th/11th March, and a fourth and fifth brigade were flown into another landing ground during the nights of 24th/25th March and 5th/6th April. The successful accomplishment of the air side of this operation was shared directly by the First Air Commando Unit and by the British and American Transport squadrons which  participated, although the whole operation was only made possible by the high degree of air superiority gained by the tactical air forces in the preceding months."
