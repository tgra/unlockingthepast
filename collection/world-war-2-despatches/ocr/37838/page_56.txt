SHAEF Command Post, moved to the Ports-
mouth area. The operations staff at AEAF had
still perforce, to remain at Stanmore and
Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary
Force Main together with AEAF planners, who
formed part of the combined planning staff of
Supreme Headquarters, continued to work at
Bushy Park. Later, a further echelon of
Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary
Force Main, i.e., Forward SHAEF, which in-
cluded the operations staff and planners of
Supreme Headquarters with its AEAF com-
plement moved also to the Portsmouth area.
This arrangement obviously simplified the co-
ordination of Army and Naval operations and
plans at the Commanders-in-Chief level, but
my own difficulties were proportionally aggra-
vated as a result of these moves of Main Head-
quarters.

546. Only when the various Headquarters
were set up at Julouville in Normandy, did the
co-ordination of operations and planning become
smooth and easy, although the value derived
from all the principals being so closely related
geographically was unfortunately to some extent
negatived by lack of adequate communications
between Main Headquarters and Operational
Commands.

547. In my view one of the major lessons
learned from ‘‘ Overlord ’’ is that the staffs of
the Supreme Commander and of the Air, Naval
and Land Commanders-in-Chief if created,
should be located very close together during
both the planning and the execution stages,

and this principle should be held to be
inviolate; in order to achieve this the Services
must be prepared to make sacrifices.

548. The communication aspect is all im-
portant and particularly must communication
facilities be adequate for the conduct of air
operations which will almost invariably have to
commence weeks and possibly months before
those of Land and possibly Naval operations.
The latter factor is, I suggest, one which must
have the fullest possible consideration when
determining the location of the Headquarters of
the Commanders-in-Chief. Even at the lower
Staff levels it is essential for sound planning and
development of operations that the staffs of the
three Services should be within easy transporta-
tion distance of each other, and I will go so far
as to recommend within walking distance of
each other. ;

549. Finally, on the more tactical plane, it
is essential to have in the field an operational
co-ordinating organisation, similar to A.E.A.F.
Advanced Headquarters (which was fully
mobile), which can keep in touch at one end
and at the same time with army headquarters
and headquarters of air formations in the for-
ward areas and with the main operational air
headquarters in rear, Particularly is this re-
quired for the planning of operations in which
heavy bombers are used in a tactical role. Only
in this way can the bomber forces involved be
adjusted smoothly to such alterations in the plan
as may be dictated, often at very short notice,
by changes in weather and/or in the ground
situation, .
