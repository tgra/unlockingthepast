            "description": "27. The main offensive was launched on the 19th January, and, despite strong opposition, our preliminary operations against the enemy’s outposts were very successful. The original plan had included a sea landing by 2 British Division further south down the Mayu Peninsula. As we did not wish to drive the Japanese into the toe of the Peninsula until 2 British Division had effected a firm lodgement, our attack on the main enemy positions was deferred to synchronize with the sea landing, the date of which could not be put forward as it was governed by the state of the tide and moon. Unfortunately, the craft required for the amphibious operation were taken away and, therefore, this “right hook” had to be cancelled. Thus our je ctteneiy tae been held up to no ose. By the ebruary, home the stack on Razabil had achieved a measure of success, but the main position stili held out. Progress elsewhere had been steady, but slow.",

(These had been held back in Gedaref area for reasons of secrecy and deception.) Gazelle was ordered to be prepared to operate east of Sabdarat. Reliable information revealed that the enemy now intended to evacuate the Walkait (Tsegede) garrison. There were only mule-tracks from this area to Gondar and the L. of C. was to Tessenei. From this it was reasonable to suppose that these forces would retire on Barentu covered for the first part of their move by Umm Hagar garrison. This was confirmed next day by the Manager of the Italian Cotton Scheme south of Tessenei who gave himself up at the Butana Bridge and stated that the enemy intended to retire to the hills “‘ on account of the superiority of our tanks.’’ The date of the attack on Kassala was fixed for 19th January.",
