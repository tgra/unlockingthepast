In the meantime, following the engage- ment with the enemy at Habbaniya on 6th May, there was little land fighting until roth May, when our troops, in company with the mechan- ised force from . Palestine, occupied Fallujah after nearly a whole day\u2019s fighting. During this operation an air-borne detachment was landed in rear of the enemy position. Mean- while, the Royal Air Force operating from Habbaniya, had been busily engaged attack- ing Iraqi aerodromes and other military objec- tives, with such success that by 8th May the Iraqi Air Forces had been practically eliminated. On 12th May, German aircraft were first re- ported in Iraq, and after that date encounters took place almost daily between our aircraft and German M.E.110\u2019s, casualties being sus- tained by both sides. On 29th May, Italian aircraft were also in action neat Baghdad,"

I commented in a report to General Eisenhower that night that the Navy and Air Forces would interfere with this programme, which in any event depended on the enemy holding a firm bridgehead in Cape Bon, and reminded him of Mr. Churchill\u2019s words in August, 1940: \u201c* We are waiting, so are the fishes \u2019\u2019. In fact no effort of this sort was made, for the enemy\u2019s plans of defence had been completely disrupted. The divided forces were not given a moment\u2019s pause to recover. As soon as the situation in Tunis was under control 9 Corps split its forces according to the pre-arranged plan and pro- ceded to mop up, to left and right. On the left 7 Armoured Division was direcfed north- wards up the Bizerta road towards Protville and the Medjerda; simultaneously 1 United States Armoured Division was moving towards the same area, north of the Protville marshes, from Mateiir. The troops entrapped in this pocket consisted of the Manteuffel Division, 15 Panzer and 334 Infantry Divisions. They"

On 8th May I instructed General Bethouart to clear up the Gratangen-Bjerkvik area and to establish artillery on the Oijord peninsula, He was then to explore the possibility of moving through the mountains against the strong Ger- man concentration in the Hundalen area East of Narvik.

Commander of the Sudan and patriot forces, decided to attack wherever possible, and proceeded to do so. These attacks were con- tinued on the 19th and on the zoth, when the Italians were seen to be withdrawing. Once more a general advance of the patriot forces was ordered. A running fight ensued, the patriots fighting with great courage and inflict- ing heavy casualties on the enemy."

On the north end of Castle Hill a white flag was displayed \u2018but when 6/13 Frontier Force Rifles advanced to take over the position, they were greeted by a shower of bombs and suffered severely, A thick mist then came down on the hill-tops, under cover of which the Italians were able to assemble for a counter-attack. This was successful and Castle Hill was re- captured by the enemy. Owing to the need for achieving surprise and complicated by the mist, our artillery had not ranged on Castle Ridge and could not consequently give effective support to 6/13 Frontier Force Rifles."

The programme of reliefs, in particular the move of ro Indian Division from the Middle East, was taking a little longer than was expected and we now estimated that it should be possible to complete all preparations by 3rd to 5th May. I had originally calculated that, in order to give the best support to the western invasion, our attack should precede it by fifteen to twenty-one days; I was unaware at the time of the date chosen for OVERLORD but I was given to understand that a date for our attack in early May would suit General Eisenhower. It would also suit well with the phases of the moon. For the sake of troop movements at night it is always most useful to have a good moon and it would be full on 8th May. I eventually decided on a tentative D-day of roth May. :"
