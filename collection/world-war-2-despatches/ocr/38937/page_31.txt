SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

The first plan for SHINGLE was approved
on 25th Rpemtoers The operation wa to be
timed to coincide with the arrival of the main
body of Fifth Army on the general line Capi-
strello-Ferentino-Priverno and was to be in the
strength of one infantry division,* reinforced by
some armour and anti-aircraft arti . It was
intended to make contact with the main body
within seven days. We were to retain the
necessary landing craft until 15th January but
we now thought it unlikely that we should be
within supporting distance until at least roth
January. By 18th December it was clear that
even this date could not be met and General
Clark signalled to me ‘‘ reluctantly ’’ recom-
mending the cancellation of the operation on
the grounds that the arbitrary date ‘set for the
surrender of landing craft made it impossible to
mount the attack under the conditions necessary
for success. I signalled this decision to General
Eisenhower on the 2Ist but informed him that
I was still studying the problem in the hope
of being able to prepare a modification of the
original plan for a later date.

I fully shared General Clark’s reluctance to

see ourselves forced back on a strategy of -

frontal assault in the present unfavourable con-
ditions, There was now no hope that Fifth
Army could arrive within supporting distance
of a landing at Anzio within the proposed time;
no advantage would be gained by a landing
nearer to the present front under the abrupt
southern slopes of the Aurunci; I therefore
began to consider the possibility of making the
SHINGLE force much stronger, strong enough
to hold its ground by itself, for a longer time
than We had previously considered. I put up
this proposal, which virtually amounted to a
new plan, at a Commanders-in-Chief confer-
ence in Tunis on 25th December. The Cairo
conference had just broken up and it had there
been decided that General Eisenhower should
take over the command of the invasion of
North-west Europe, to be succeeded in the
Mediterranean by General Wilson. Both were
present at the conference, as was also the Prime
Minister who was passing through on his way
back from Cairo to London. I proposed we
should assault with two divisions reinforced by
some armour. The conference decided that, by
a readjustment of the programme for the re-
pair and refitting of landing craft in England, it
would be possible for sufficient to remain in
the Mediterranean long enough to carry out
the assault without diminishing the numbers
available for the imvasion of North-west
Europe.{ We also had a lucky windfall in the
arrival of fifteen Landing Ships, Tank on their
way home from the Indian Ocean where a
proposed operation for which they were ear-
marked had been cancelled. It was decided,
therefore, that all preparations should be made
for carrying out SHINGLE with two assault
divisions on or about 2oth January. The ob-
jective, as before, was to be the Alban Hills.

It was now necessary to press on rapidly
with the planning of the new assault. - The
composition of the force caused some discus-
sion as it would be difficult to compose a homo-
geneous Corps quickly enough. I decided, in

*3 United States Division was nominated.on 13
December.

{¢ At that time the target date for the invasion was
in May and it was agreed that this readjustment would
not affect that date.

agreement with General Clark, to use the VI
United States Corps Headquarters, General
Lucas commanding, which was then out of the
line, with 1 British Division, plus some Com-
mandos and armour, and 3 United States Divi-
sion, also supported by American armour, para-
chutists and Rapgers. 1 Division had just
arrived in Italy and was not yet committed,
3 Division had already been engaged on
planning SHINGLE and was the obvious
choice. I should like to mention, in this con-
nection, a typically understanding signal I re-
ceived from General Eisenhower, almost the
last he sent me before leaving the Mediterra-
nean. ‘' The disadvantages of employing a
mixed Corps,’’ he said, ‘‘ are of course as ob-
vious to you as to me. I have wondered
whether or not you may have been infiuenced
by either of the following factors: that you
felt it undesirable, because of the risks in-
volved, to hazard a Corps of two American
divisions when you as a British officer have
the deciding responsibility or that you may have
thought it undesirable from a political view-
point for a Corps of two British divisions to
be given the opportunity for the direct capture
of Rome. In my opinion neither of these fac-
tors should be allowed to outweigh the military
advantages of launching your assault by any
troops you believe best fitted and most avail-
able. In giving these views I merely wish to
remove any political difficulties that may occur
to you in order that you can launch the best
military operation that can be laid on in the
time available.”’ I replied that the composition
of the Corps was based solely on the best for-
mations available in the time: ‘‘ the political
aspect is of no consequence but I do think
the sharing of risks and hazards together is of
importance.”’

Orders for the operation were issued on 2nd
January. The objective was defined as to cut
the enemy communications and threaten the
rear of the German XIV Corps. In the last
paragraph Fifth Army was ordered to make
“as strong a thrust as possible towards Cas-
sino and Frosinone shortly before the assault
landing to draw in enemy reserves which might
be employed against the landing forces and then
to create a breach in his front through which
every opportunity will be taken to link up
rapidly with the seaborne operation.’’ For this
ro Corps was being reinforced by 5 British
Infantry Division. This was the second division
I had taken from Eighth Army, for 1 Division
had been originally intended for it, and I was
shorily afterwards to take three more. The
Adriatic sector was now of secondary import-
ance to the western sector. The intention was
to launch successive attacks by the three Corps
on the main front: the French Expeditionary
Corps on 12th January against the high ground
north of Cassino, II Corps on the 15th to
capture Monte Porchia and Monte Trocchio
and reach the Rapido river and 10 Corps on
the 17th to cross the lower Garigliano in the
Minturno area and attack northwards up the
Ausente river valley towards San Giorgio a
Liri. Finally, II Corps, with its left and right
thus protected, would on 2oth January force
the Rapido in the area of Sant’ Angelo and
exploit rapidly, supported by armour, west-
wards and north-westwards. Two days later
VI Corps was to land at Anzio and threaten
