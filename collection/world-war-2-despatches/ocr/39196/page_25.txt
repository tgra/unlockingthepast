largely dissipated in a desperate struggle to
keep the units of the maintenance organisation
abreast of the operational flying units. That
this was achieved speaks volumes for the‘tena-
city, skill and loyalty of the maintenance
personnel.

(ID) Internal Air Lines.

177. The growth of air routes during the past
year is best illustrated by the following
figures :—

Freight Mail

May, 1944 2,103 166,313 Ibs. 99,435 Ibs.
April, 1945 11,514 1,579,119 Ibs. 777,944 Ibs.

(178. This rapid increase was attributable to
a greater intensity of operations, and better
planning followed somewhat tardily by a
growth of resources. At the beginning of the
campaign, one squadron (No. 353) shouldered
the whole burden while still largely equipped
with Hudsons. In July, 1944, No. 52 Squad-
ron was formed, and by flying 19,000 hours
without an accident, speedily gained an excel-
lent reputation for its high standard of operat-
ing and freedom from accidents over routes
that include the hazardous flight over the Hump
to China. In April, 1945, a flight of No. 232
Squadron, equipped with Liberator C-87 air-
craft, began to operate on the Jonger routes,
forming the most recent addition to a force
the strength of which has grown to two and a
half squadrons.

179. Parallel action to build up a ground
organisation to handle greater traffic and more
complex problems was necessary. To this end,
static transport wings have been established at
Delhi, Karachi and Calcutta; that at Delhi
was intended eventually to move to Rangoon.
Located at nodal points on the trunk routes,
these wings also gave advice on all matters
affecting air transport and ferrying to the group
in whose area they were located. When their
establishments were fully implemented, 229
Group Headquarters was relieved of a great
deal of day to day work in administering some
sixty units spread over India.

180. Even now, internal air communications
within the theatre are not adequate. This fact
cannot be fully realised by anyone who has not
appreciated the vastness of India from a rail-
way carriage or travelled over roads on which
the twentieth century has barely left its mark.
Moreover, in a sub-continent whose urban
centres are so distant from one another, it is
often necessary to plan an operation eight
hundred miles from its mounting base, while
the allocation of resources may be effected from
another centre which may be fifteen hundred
miles from the controlling headquarters.
Furthermore, the major base for the prosecu-
tion of a campaign in southern Burma, Malaya
or Java, is still India, and the need for swift
communication between base and combat area
is another continually growing commitment for
squadrons who serve an area ranging from
Karachi to Kunming and from Peshawar to
Ceylon.

181. At times, local operational tasks have
made the diversion of aircraft from internal
routes to air supply a tempting solution to a
pressing problem. This temptation has always
béen resisted, and it is a first principle that the

vital arteries of South-East Asia Command
shall remain open. The mobility of the staffs,
the despatch of urgent freight, close contact
with the battle areas, and the building up of
India as a base, must always be a prime con-
sideration when assessing priorities for air
transport resources in this theatre. Not only
is the work of all three services dependent upon
speedy communication over long distances ; it
is on the air routes that the Air Force can
Teap a dividend from the transport aircraft
which are so frequently operated for the benefit
of others. The R.A.F. should also use the speed
and flexibility of its transport squadrons to
improve the efficiency of its own organisation.

182. Air Command has derived great benefit
from the Transport Groups allotted to this
theatre, which has made possible a closer study
of transport problems and a more effective
supervision of this specialised type of flying.
The improvement in operating standards is well
illustrated by the accident rate. In October,
1943, there were 49 accidents per 10,000 hours
of transport and ferry flights. By April, 1945,
the rate had been reduced to 9 per 10,000
hours. Such an improvement reflects the
greatest credit on all concerned and demon-
strates the close co-operation which has been
achieved: between South-East Asia and Trans-
port Command. .

(IV) The R.A.F. Regiment.

183. Until mid-1944 the strength of' the
R.A.F. Regiment was deployed to the extent
of rather more than two-thirds in machine gun
anti-aircraft units, and the remainder in field
squadrons designed for an infantry role. Events
then forced a fundamental revision of the part
for which the R.A.F. Regiment in South East
Asia was cast. It had become apparent that
advanced airfields, radar sites and other air
force installations would not necessarily be
guarded if their locations did not happen to
fit into the tactical schemes adopted by the
local army formations, and that unless the air
forces were to withdraw everything to a safe
distance behind the front lines they would
themselves have to provide the necessary de-
fence force. For this purpose the R.AF. Regi-
ment during the later months of 1944 was
expanded and re-organised into ten wing head-
quarters, twenty field squadrons, three
armoured (holding) squadrons and ten anti-
aircraft squadrons, so as to provide tactical
defence for air force units as required. The
balance of functions in the Regiment as
between air and ground defence was thus com-
pletely reversed.

184. The wisdom of this re-organisation was
abundantly proved in the course of the 1944-45
campaign. As has already been explained, the
essence of the tactics by which the re-conquest
of Burma was achieved lay in the rapid ad-
vance of mechanised units thrusting through or
around enemy positions, the strength of which
had been weakened by air bombardment. The
fighter bombers which provided the backbone
of the latter, and also the fighters required for
air defence, could only operate effectively from
airfields close behind the advanced army units.
The supplies on whose delivery the mainten-
ance of the Army’s advance depended were
