3300

Friday, 31st May.

48. The Admiralty informed the Vice Admiral
that the policy of H.M. Government was that
both British and French troops be given an
equal opportunity of being evacuated in British
ships and boats.

49. Personnel ships had been sailed the pre-
vious evening and throughout the night of the
3oth/ 31st to provide for a continuous flow into
Dunkirk harbour, But at 0320 the S.N.O.
reported that once again the majority of these
personnel ships had failed to enter the harbour
during the dark hours. MALCOLM, however,
left Dunkirk with 1,200 troops at 0300, during
heavy shelling, on relief by IVANHOE.
$.N.O. Dunkirk, however, continued to call for
more ships. ‘No more destroyers were avail-
able and there were no means of accelerating
the arrival of the vessels despatched there. By
0700 the Vice Admiral had no news of the fate
of the personnel ships that had sailed the pre-
vious evening and during the night. None of
these ships had reached the U.K. to unload,
and it appeared probable that these ships
may ave concentrated in the narrow
waters close to Dunkirk, inviting a repetition
of the heavy air attacks with consequent
damage and loss to transports which had
occurred on the two previous occasions when
personnel vessels, together with other ships,
had been concentrated in large numbers in the
approaches to Dunkirk,

At this time there were no less than nine
personnel vessels and three hospital carriers
known to be on the round trip U.K.—Dunkirk
and back and one other personnel vessel had
been ordered to sail during the night, but her
whereabouts was unknown. In addition, three
other personnel vessels were under orders to
sail between ogoo and 1030. Pending the
return of the ships en passage, and while the
coal-burners were being rebunkered, the further
sailing of personnel vessels was in suspense.

Note :—Owing to the casualties to personnel vessels

at this stage, coal burning cross channel
steamers had to be used for some of the
trips and short endurance necessitated
coaling between trips which could not be
done in the vicinity of Dover, thus
preventing a quick turn round,

50. During the night a considerable amount
of enemy minelaying activity by air was re-
ported. Shelling was heavy during the evening
and night, and operations were greatly ham-
pered. Nevertheless, with the cessation of
shelling at about 0300, very good progress was
made and by full dawn the beaches were very
nearly clear of troops. At 0530 attacks on
Dunkirk Harbour and the beach from Dunkirk
to Bray developed more strength and the bom-
bardment of Dunkirk continued. Neverthe-
less, the S.N.O. reported that the embarkation
there was proceeding satisfactorily but stressed
the need for more ships and constant fighter
protection, At this time French troops
to appear at Dunkirk Pier and on the beaches,
and were embarked with the British troops.

5x. At o600 VIMY sighted submarine off the
N.W. Goodwins and commenced to hunt.

52. The arrivals at the home ports indicated
that in spite of the frequent requests for more
ships and more boats received from the various
authorities on the French coast, the rate of
evacuation was steadily increasing and would
permit, all being well, of implementing the

SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 17 JULY, 1947

final evacuation plan during the night of
31/5-1/6. Accordingly, instructions were
issued for the special tows to leave Ramsgate
at 1300/31 for Dunkirk via Route X, and the
Commander-in-Chief, Nore and Flag Officer in
Charge, Harwich, were requested to provide
all available M.T.B.s to escort this convoy
for as much of the outward passage as possible,
which was timed to commence from Ramsgate
at 1300/31. Speed of advance—5 knots. A
party of Naval officers had been assembled at
Dover to embark in these tows and had been
given detailed instructions on the plan. Two
M.A/S, boats and two M.T.B.s in the Dover
Command were ordered to accompany the boat
convoy and subsequently embark the Com-
mander-in-Chief, B.E.F. and Staff off the
beaches.

53. Shortly after sunrise an on-shore wind
arose and boat work became difficult, many
whalers capsizing and the prospects of com-
pleting the evacuation to plan began to be less
favourable. The following extract from the
report of Captain Howson, S.N.O. on the
beaches illustrates conditions at Bray at this
time:

‘* At 0400 there was a very considerable
number of destroyers, paddlers, trawlers,
skoots, etc., off Bray, and embarkation was
proceeding satisfactorily, but a lop had
already started. There were about 10 motor
yachts which had arrived from England.
These craft drew 6-7 feet and were
unable to get close in to any of the beaches.
During the forenoon, considerable towing
of empty craft towards the beach was carried
out, and only about two boats were allowed
to get adrift and ultimately ground. With
‘the falling tide, however, a number of boats
were seen to ground and remain ashore until
the tide rose in the afternoon, These in-
cluded an A.L.C.* motor boat and a life-
boat. Other power boats broke down. Never-
theless, the embarkation, much hindered by
the lop, proceeded satisfactorily. © As further
destroyers and sloops arrived, they were
directed to lower their motor boats and
whalers as this had not already been done;
these boats were quite invaluable. About
noon, the lop began to subside and with
the rising tide conditions for embarkation
very greatly improved, more boats were
sent in and more boats floated off and matters
were proceeding very well, when the gun at
La Panne started to shell the beaches and
foreshore with great accuracy. A certain
number of light craft were sunk. The A.L.C.
broke down and was towed away by a
steamer. MOSQUITO, destroyers and sloops
proceeded westward clear of the firing.”’

54. Rear-Admiral Wake-Walker was able to
make a survey of the general conditions of the
beaches, and at 1130 the Vice-Admiral received
a signal from him stating that the majority of
the pulling boats were broached to and without
crews, conditions on the beaches being very bad
owing to a freshening shore wind, only small
numbers being embarked. Under present condi-
tions any large-scale embarkation from beach
impracticable. Motor boats could not get close
in. He considered only hope of embarking any
number was at Dunkirk, and further stated he
