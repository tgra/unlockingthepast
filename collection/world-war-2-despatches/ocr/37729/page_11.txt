SUPPLEMENT ‘to tae LONDON GAZETTE, 19 SEPTEMBER, 1946

Hurricanes to 6. These and 14 Gladiators
of Nos. 80 and 112 Squadrons were flown to
Crete on 23rd April to defend Suda Bay against
enemy air attack and to take part with No. 30
Squadron in providing cover for sea édnvoys
engaged in the evacuation. Sunderlands
started to evacuate R.A.F. personnel on roth
April, when they flew a 30 Squadron party to
Crete. The previous day they had also carried
King Peter of Yugoslavia and other important
political personages to Egypt, having taken
them off from Kotor (Yugoslavia) on 17th
April. Sunderlands continued the evacuation
of essential personnel in stages from Greece
to Crete, thence to Egypt. The King of Greece
and members of the Greek Royal Family were
included among other important passengers
flown to Crete in Sunderlands on 22nd and
23rd April.

46. On 23rd April the Sunderlands were
reinforced by two B.O.A.C, Flying Boats
which operated between Crete and Egypt and
rendered valuable service. These efforts were
further augmented on the same day by
Bombays of No. 216 Squadron which took two
parties from Eleusis to Bagush, and the fol-
lowing day by Lodestars of No. 267 Squadron
which carried three parties from Argos to
Bagush. Enemy air attacks rendered Eleusis
and Menidi aerodromes unusable after 23rd
April, and Argos was similarly out of action
from 24th April. The Bombays and Lodestars
thereafter continted to carry personnel from
Crete to Egypt. The last Sunderland loads
to leave Scaramanga were taken off on 24th
April and included Lieutenant-General Sir T.
Blamey, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., and Air Vice-
Marshal J. H. D’Albiac,' D.S.O., and their
respective staffs.

On aqth April 1 700 RAF, mnnel
were at Argos awaiting evacuation by sea but
by the next day the majority of these had
moved to Kalamata and Gytheon, Aree
Sunderland loads being taken off from thi
former, and one from the latter and flown to
Crete. Subsequently all personnel remaining
there were evacuated by sea, many of them
crossing in small boats to Kythera whence they
were later taken off in destroyers. Further
Sunderland evacuations from Greece, were
made from Nauplia (Morea), transporting
Prince Paul of Greece, the Greek Prime
Minister and other important passengers in-
cluding General Sir, Maitland Wilson and
Generals Mackay and Rankin.

Meanwhile flying boats of Nos. 228 and 230
Squadrons and landplanes continued the
evacuation from Crete to Egypt, the last flight
being made by a Sunderland on and May.
The total number of personnel evacuated by
air from Greece to. Crete was over 600, and
from Crete and Greece to Egypt 870. Two
Sunderlands were lost in these operations, one
of which crashed while alighting by night at
Kalamata, and the other was destroyed by
enemy air action at Scaramanga.

47. The main evacuation from Greece of
British and Imperial Forces was effected be-
tween 24th and 30th April in convoys of H.M.
Ships and other vessels. All available aircraft
operated in support to protect the convoys
against the heavy enemy air attacks to which
they were constantly subjected, and which

* were causing heavy losses. The forces avail-
able in Crete were 14 fighter Blenheims of

4683

No. 30 Squadron, g fighter Blenheims of No.
203 Squadron (recently sent to Crete from
Egypt to take part in this operation) and the
remaining 6 Hurricanes and 14 Gladiators of
Nos. 33, 80 and 112 Squadrons. At this stage,
however, only 6 of the 14 Gladiators were
serviceable,

Blenheims usually operating in patrols of
six aircraft provided such cover for convoys as
was possible in the vicinity of the mainland
of Greece, while Hurricanes and Gladiators
provided patrols over convoys approaching
Crete and during their disembarkation at Suda
Bay. At the same time, Sunderlands provided
Tonian and Mediterranean reconnaissances to
guard against possible raids on our convoys by
units of the Italian Navy. F

During the six months’ campaign in Greece
our Squadrons contended throughout with
numerically superior enemy air forces, emerging
in the end with much credit although sadly
depleted in strength. Our total aircraft losses
amounted to 209, of which 82 had to be des-
troyed and abandoned by our own forces
during the withdrawal and subsequent evacua-
tion. Many of the latter had been damaged
during enemy attacks on our aerodromes and
in normal circumstances might have been re-
paired. Our total losses of aircraft, missing
and in combat with the enemy were 72.

As a comparison, the losses inflicted on the
enemy totalled 259 aircraft destroyed and 99
probably destroyed, with several others
damaged. Of these, 231 were destroyed and
94 probably destroyed i in combat with our air-

Our personnel losses in Greece acne), to
148 killed and missing and 15 taken prisoner.
Of the total, 130 were aircrews. Such losses
cannot be considered unduly heavy, bearing
in mind the difficulties of the campaign and
the hazards of the subsequent evacuation.

48. I cannot speak too highly of the work of
Air Vice-Marshal J. H. D’Albiac, D.S.O., who
commanded the British Air Force in Greece
during the whole six months’ campaign. His
initiative, his personality and tact in dealings
with the Greek High Command, enabled him,
right up to the end, to obtain the maximum
tesults in support of the Greeks from the small
force at his disposal.

Of those under his Command, the most out-
standing for their valuable services were :—

Group Captain A. H. Willets, Senior Air
Staff Officer during the whole period.

Wing Commander P. B. Coote, who com-
manded -the Western Wing (The Albanian
Front) and himself took part in many of the
fighter patrols and bombing raids of his
Squadrons, from the last of which he is missing.

Wing Commander J. R. Gordon-Finlayson,
D.S.O., D.F.C., commanding No. 21r
Squadron, and later the Eastern Wing. A fine
leader and an inspiration to his Squadron,
with which he had completed over one hundred
raids.

Squadron Leader E. G. Jones, D.F.C.,
commanding No. 80 (F) Squadron; his leader-
ship maintained the high morale and efficiency
of this Squadron whose six months’ record in
Greece, mostly in Gladiators, was quite
remarkable.
