The enemy were now trapped by the three-pronged advance of 71 Brigade due south from Sane, 4 Brigade south and east from the Yanbauk Chaung, and 36 Brigade north and north-west, after its landing in the south. They were being driven towards Ramree town, in the south-east corner of the island, whence their escape was cut off by the Naval blockade under the orders of Captain E. W. Bush, R.N. On the 8th February, 71 Brigade had reached the hills north of Ramree. There they were heavily engaged, though a patrol which entered the town itself that afternoon was informed that it had been evacuated. The enemy were, however, unable to stop our tanks and, by the 9th, they were driven from their positions overlooking the town\u2014the Japanese defence, determined as it had been, had failed, but they made a final effort to break the sea blockade and extricate their garrison. On the evening of the 11th February, they launched an air attack on our two destroyers, which were guarding the sea approaches. Under cover of this diversion, forty powered craft left Taung- up to rescue their troops in Ramree. The"
