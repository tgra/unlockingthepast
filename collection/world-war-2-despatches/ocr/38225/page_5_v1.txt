44. The first indication that the unexpected was about to happen came at 2129 when ANTHONY's signal timed 2115 was received reporting she had accomplished her task successfully. This was a fine achievement brilliantly carried out, and, in my opinion, was the principal and direct cause of the enemy's collapse. The attack by 17th and 2gth Brigades commenced at 2030 hours, A success signal from the town showed that the Marines had landed. 17th Brigade secured their objective which was about  1800 yards beyond the main enemy position at 2300 hours and fired their success signals. The two-battalions of the 29th Brigade were then ordered forward and pushed right through to the main town of Antsirane with little or no opposition and reached the main harbour. The Commando were unable to find boats so could not assist.

45. I had decided that RAMILLIES and screen would not join the carriers during the night D.2/D 3 as the latter were carrying out night flying operations to support the attack on Antsirane.

D.3.

At 0313/D.3 I received a message from the General telling me he would like all available air and ship support at ogoo when the 2gth Brigade would assault Oranjia Peninsula From this, it was obvious that the night attack had succeeded. I therefore proceeded with RAMILLIES and screen to jom DEVONSHIRE and HERMIONE to the Eastward of the Oranjia Peninsula at daylight in readiness to bombard.

At 0400 a situation report was received confirming the capture of Antsirane.

46. During the night a report was received that GENISTA had attacked a contact to the North-West of Nosi Hara and about 700 signals were received from ILLUSTRIOUS aircraft that she had sunk a submarine.  This subsequently proved to be LE HEROS from whom Survivors were picked mR in position 32? 03  S. 49  E. _. '

47.  At 0723, Headquarters za Forte asked me to postpone bombardment until rooo. I instructed RAMILLIES, DEVONSHIRE, HERMIONE and LIGHTNING accordingly, and detailed their respective targets.

At 0945 Headquarters 121 Force gave me some details of the intended assault including the furthest -on position of our troops at 1200. The main assault would not commence till noon, but I was asked to commence a preliminary bombardment as soon as_ possible after rooo unless I heard that the ultimatum had been accepted.

At 0950 I was asked to postpone the bombardment until 1030 and at roof I was asked to postpone action until further orders as chances of surrender appeared good.

48. I was tired of these delays which were kecptng the Fleet steaming up and down in dangerous waters, consequently I informed the General that I mtended to commence a 15 minutes  bombatdment to encourage the enemy io surrender,

At 1040 RAMILLIES, HERMIONE and LIGHTNING commenced a bombardment of Oranjia Peninsula, but   Cease Fire   was ordered 10 minutes later on recipt of a message from Headquarters 121 Force that Oranjia

Peninsula had surrendered.

49. DEVONSHIRE, PANTHER = and ACTIVE were then detached to screen the carriers. ~ z4th M/S Flotilla swept the channel, entered. the Bay and search d the harbour.

On receipt of signal that no mines had been found, RAMILLIES, HERMIONE, LIGHTNING and PALADIN proceeded into Diego: Suarez Bay, anchoring at 1730.

50. The slow convoy sailed from Courrier Bay at 1600/D.3 and the fast convoy at 0500/D.4.

Da.

- Both convoys ecitered harbour on D.4 and anchored in Scotch Bay.

51. INDOMITABLE and screen also entered harbour on D.4, INDOMITABLE being attacked off the entrance by a submarine which was afterwards destroyed by ACTIVE. Her destruction was subsequently confirmed by a Vichy report, which gave her name as the MONGE. . '
