the recapture of Berbera on 16th March. This
was speedily followed by the reoccupation of the
whole colony. The use of the port of Berbera
and the road from thence to Harrar enabled
General Cunningham greatly to shorten his line
of communications. *

20. The success of General Cunningham’s
operations involved us in some very difficult
administrative and political problems, the
administration of the conquered territory, the
security and feeding of the very large Italian
civilian population in Addis Ababa and its
vicinity, and the question of French Somali-
land with the port of Jibuti and the railway
from there to Addis Ababa.

I had begun preparations for the administra-
tion of enemy-occupied territory in Italian East
Africa as early as December 1940 and a nucleus
organisation was in existence at the time the
occupation began. So rapidly, however, did
the advance proceed, especially in the south,
that it was almost impossible for administration
to keep pace. In the circumstances it reflects
the greatest credit on Sir Philip Mitchell,
Brigadier Lush, Brigadier the Hon. F. R. Rodd
and others that so much was accomplished and
that there was no general breakdown of admin-
istration or of law and order.

21. The problem of the large Italian civilian
populations in Asmara, capital of Eritrea, in
Addis Ababa and elsewhere gave me anxiety
both with respect to their safety and to the food
problem. In the end our apprehensions were,
however, largely relieved, the behaviour of the
native population towards their former con-
querors was in general tolerant and no revenge
was sought, while the problem of food supply
was of less difficulty than had been expected.

22. In connection with the feeding and pos-
sible evacuation of the population of Addis
Ababa the position of the port at Jibuti and the
railway was obviously of considerable import-
ance. From the point of view of military
administration the obvious policy was to come
to an arrangement with the Vichy authorities
for the use of the port and railway under cer-
tain terms in exchange for relaxation of the
blockade to French Somaliland. It would prob-
ably have been possible to come to a-satisfac-
tory agreement and I proposed to open negotia-
tions with the Governor of French Somaliland.
The Free French were, however, anxious for
political reasons to bring French Somaliland
over to the Free French movement and were
confident that this could be done by propa-
ganda and by strict maintenance of the block-
ade. H.M.G. decided that the Free French
policy should be adopted. The problem re-
mained unsettled up to the time that I left the
Middle East; the Free French authorities failed
to win over the colony to their movement and
the blockade failed to have the effect of reduc-
ing its resistance.

23. After the occupation of Addis Ababa on
6th April, General Cunningham wished to
employ his forces to the west and south-west in
order to reduce the enemy centre at Gimma and
to secure his line of communication in the
Lakes area. I was, however, anxious 10 get as
quickly as possible the South African division
and a large quantity of transport to Egypt and
ordered him to advance north to secure the
main road from Addis Ababa to Asmara so that
troops and transport from South Abyssinia

could reach Egypt by embarkation at Massawa
or Port Sudan or by the Nile Valley route. The
Ist South African Brigade Group accordingly
left Addis Ababa on 13th April and after cap-
turing Dessie reached Amba Alagi on 8th May.
The combined attack of the South Africans and
the Sudan forces from the north resulted in the
surrender of Amba Alagi on 17th May. The
Duc D’Aosta, the Viceroy of Italian East
Africa, surrendered at this place.

24. After the fall of Amba Alagi, the remain-
ing centres of enemy resistance were in the Galla-
Sidamo area in the south-west and in the
Gondar area in the north-west. Some brilliant
operations by the African divisions, assisted
by a Belgian force from the Sudan, resulted in
the complete liquidation of all Italian resistance
in the south-west of Abyssinia, while the Italian
outposts of the Gondar area were also cleared.
The Gondar area itself was allowed to remain
for the present as it could have no further
influence on operations and I was anxious to
transfer troops back to the main theatre in
Egypt as rapidly as possible. The 4th Indian
Division had begun to return to Egypt imme-
diately after the fall of Keren and the 5th
Indian Division followed after the fall of Amba
Alagi.

25. During the operations by regular troops
in the south and in the north, the west centre
of Abyssinia was being cleared by some daring
operations of Colonel Wingate’s small regular
force of Sudanese troops and bands of Abys-
sinian patriots assisted by British officers and
N.C.Os. The Emperor, with Brigadier Sand-
ford, followed the operations of these troops,
and the Emperor made a formal entry into his
capital of Addis Ababa on. 5th May.

26. The conquest of Italian East Africa had
been accomplished in four months, from the
end of January to the beginning of June. In
this period a force of approximately 220,000
men had been practically destroyed with the
whole of its equipment and an area of nearly a
million square miles had been occupied. Some
of the chief features of this remarkable cam-
paign were the storming by British and Indian
troops of the formidable mountain barriers at
Keren and Amba Alagi, the boldness and skill
with which the operations from East Africa
were pressed over a distance of about 2,000
miles from the base, and the very skilful
guerilla fighting in Western Abyssinia.

The ultimate pattern of the conquest was
a pincer movement on the largest scale,
through Eritrea and Somaliland converging on
Amba Alagi, combined with a direct thrust
through Western Abyssinia by the patriot
forces. It looks Teutonic in conception and
execution; but, as explained above, this
result was not foreseen in the original plan
but arose gradually through the development
of events. It was in fact an improvisation
after the British fashion of war rather than a
set piece in the German manner.

27. As will be seen from the above, General
Platt and General Cunningham acted on
broad general instructions from me and I made
no attempt to control their operations in detail.
Success was due mainly to their boldness and
skill in execution, the quality of their subor-
dinate commanders and to the dash and endur-
ance of the troops. Both South African and
can troops greatly distinguished them-
selves.
