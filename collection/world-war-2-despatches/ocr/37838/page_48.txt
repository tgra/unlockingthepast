aircraft is inevitably detrimental to these opera-
tions. I therefore consider that in any future
campaign the airfield construction programme
‘should envisage the immediate provision of at
least one air transport landing strip per army
and that these landing strips should be con-
structed so as to be ‘capable of handling a
minimum of 50-60 aircraft per hour,

452. In order to minimise the influence of
the weather factor, consideration should also
be given to the launching of air supply missions
from forward airfields in close liaison with and,
where necessary, under the local tactical air
command.

Employment of Balloons in the Assault Phase.

453- I have already referred to the reasons
for using balloons for protection of the beaches
during the assault phase and to the results
achieved by their use. Here I think it proper
to mention the reasons for the final choice of the
Mk. VI (V.L.A.) balloon and also some of the
difficulties experienced during the planning
stages.

454. Mk. VI (V.L.A.) balloons flying
normally at an operational height of 2,000 feet,
were chosen for this work for the following
reasons : —

(i) The extreme lightness of the ancillary
equipment and the practicability of using a
light hand winch which could be carried
ashore by crews.

(ii) The economy in operatiag personnel
only two airmen were reyuired for each
balloon.

(ii) No extra initial lift was required as the
balloons were transported flying.

(iv) The possibility of transporting replace-
ment balloons unmanned flying from L.C.T.
and L.S.T.

(v) The comparatively simall hydrogen
reunions for maintenance and re-intila-

ion,

455. During the planning stage it was realised
there would be some difficulty in the employ-
ment of the balloons during the passage of the
original assault forces. It was essential that
balloons should not be brought in so early or at
such a height as to give any premature warning
on the enemy’s Radar system. Inter-Service
agreement was made, permitting balloons to go
into the beach-head flying at 100 feet, not less
than seven miles behind the assault. This
height is the worst possible at which to fly a
balioon owing to its inclination to dive on
encountering erratic air currents near the
ground. It was decided, however, after experi-
ments on exercises that this restriction was
acceptable, and in the event, no undue casual-
ties resulted.

456. A further problem solved in the pre-
paratory phase was the manner of transporta-
tion of the planned number sf 240 balloons
for the British area and 145 for the American
area. As the Navy proposed to carry balloons
for their own protection on one-thirc of the
L.C.T, and all of the L.S.T.. it was necessary
to devise a method of flying two balloons from
each L.S.T. in order to have available the
planned number in the »each-heads. After
several experiments, this was accomplished,

457. To provide the necessary number of
inflated balloons for each craft, to maintain
them during the marshalling period and during
any possible period of postponement, and to

replace casualties during that time, required a
large number of small vessels and extensive
shore servicing and hydrogen organisations at
all appropriate ports. These were comparatively
easily provided in England from the resources
of R.A.F. Balloon Command and_ the
Admiralty Shore Servicing Section, but it should
be remembered that such facilities, if not fortui-
tously available as in this case, have io be
arranged.

Provision of Maps.

458. The design, production and supply of
maps for use by the air forces under my Com-
mand was the responsibility jointly of the War
De ent, Washington, and the War Office, .
London. Shortly after the outbreak of hostili-
ties, the Geographical Section, General Staff,
(later the Directorate of Military Survey). War
Office, attached an officer to each of the
principal Royal Air Force Commands, to study
their requirements and to ensure adequate
production and distribution of air maps. This
practice was adopted for the Allied Expedition-
ary Air Force, a Deputy Assistant Director of
Survey (British) being appointed as Chief Map
Officer. Later, an officer of the Corps of Engin-
eers, United States Army was also assigned to
the Map Section.

459. Upwards of 120,000,000 maps were pre-
pared for Operation ‘‘ Neptune ’’, of which a
large proportion was used by the air forces.
They embraced small and medium scale *‘ Air ’’
maps, maps for use in co-operation with ground
forces, and an astonishing number of special
maps for planning purposes, which were widely
distributed to Staff Officers, mainly of the
Operations and Intelligence Branches. Equally
important “for successful planning was the
knowledge that special maps would be avail-
able for particular operations, e.g., topograph-
ical lattice maps for use in craft fitted with’
special Radar navigational devices and dropping.
zone maps for use by pilots towing gliders.

460. Headquarters, A.E.A.F. had its own
drafting section and reproduction facilities were
readily accorded to it by both United States
and British armies. Thus, special maps
required to illustrate plans, Operation Orders
and Staff Memoranda could be made available,
often in a matter of hours.

461. When all the Allied Air Forces were
based in the United Kingdom, the normal
British channels of supply were used, but once
overseas, other methods had necessarily to be
devised, and the supply of maps to Commands
and sub-formations differed slightly as between
United States and British forces.

462. Arrangements were made whereby
Royal Air Force Commands should draw maps
from the British armies to which they were
affiliated, and in accordance with normal
United States practice, formations of the Ninth
U.S.A.A.F. obtained their maps under arrange-
ments made by the Office of the Chief Engineer,
ETOUSA. This provided for the establishment
of a Ninth U.S.A.A.F. Map Depot, with an
Assistant Deputy Engineer in charge, whose
duty it was to supply all elements of that force.
Events were to prove that although both
systems worked well, modifications to improve
the service were necessary from time to time,
and on this matter I have made comments in
later paragraphs. .

463. During the initial phase of operations on
the Continent, the Director of Survey, 21 Army
