 * Phase 4.

The capture of the ports and airfields outlined in Phase 3.

 * Phase 5. The reduction of the island. 

The naval, ground and air commanders were nominated as follows: Eastern Task Force, Vice-Admiral B. H. Ramsay; Western Task Force, Vice-Admiral H. K. Hewi:t; Seventh Army, Lieutenant-General George S. Patton Junior, Eighth Army, General Sir Bernard Montgomery, North-west African Tactical Air Forces, Air Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham, Seventh Army Air Force, Colonel Lawrence P. Hickey, U.S A A F., Eighth Army (Desert Air Force), Air Vice Marshal H. Broadhurst.

The Army tasks were defined as follows: (a) Enghth Army. (1) The assault between Syracuse and Pozzallo, supported by such parachute

troops as could be lifted m one third of the available transport aircraft. i

(u) Capture of the port of Syracuse and the airfield at Pachino.

(ui) Establish itself on the general line Syracuse Pozzallo Ragusa and gain touch with Seventh Army.

Qv) The rapid capture of the ports of Augusta and Catania and the Gerbiai group of airfields.

(b) Seventh Army.

(i) The assault between Cape Scaramia and Licata, supported by such parachute troops as could be lifted in two thirds of the available transport aircraft.

(ii) Capture of the port of Licata and the airfields of Ponte Olivo, Biscar: and Comiso.

(ii) Establish itself so as to gain contact with Eighth Army at Ragusa and protect the airfields and port in (11) above.

(iv) Subsequently to prevent enemy reserves moving eastwards against the left flank of Eighth Army

Future tasks for the Armies were only sketched out at this stage but I indicated that my intention for the first phase was to establish the group of Armies across the south-eastern corner of the island on a line from Catania to Licata with a view to final operations for the reduction of the island It was not practicable to plan further ahead for the present but I was clear in my own mind how I wanted to develop operations after the firm base had been established. The next thing to do was to split the island in half, and the first stage would be to  seize and hold the irregular rectangle of roads in the centre round Caltanissetta and Enna This would by ttself seriously hamper all enemy east-west communications From there I should be able to press on to Nicosia, which would leave only the north coast road open to the enemy, and then to the coast near San Stefano. I could probably only maintain a small force at San Stefano but if it could hold firm the interruption of communications would be complete

On 21st May my headquarters issued Operation Instruction No 2 which gave fulter details of the forces to be userl and the conduct of



operations in the first two phases, the Preparatory Measures and the Assault. Eighth Army were allotted two Corps Headquarters, six infantry divisions, one infantry brigade and one airborne division.* Seventh Army had one Corps Headquarters, four infantry divisions, one armoured division and one airborne division.t One infantry division in each Army was designat d as reserve, not to be used without reference to me, and a further infantry division of those allotted to Eighth Army was designated as a reinforcing division, only to be moved from North Africa if need should arise. In the event it was not needed and became available, therefore, for the landings at Salerno.

Eighth Army's plan called for a simultaneous assault by both Corps. On the right 13 Corps was to land on a three brigade front, with 5 Division right and the 50th left, over the beaches from Cape Murro di Porco, south of Syracuse, to just south of Noto. Commandos were to land on Cape Murro di Porco to capture the coast defence guns there and a brigade of 1 Airbome Division was to be landed in gliders to capture the bridge over the River Anapo south of Syracuse, and also, by a landing in the western suburbs, to assist in the capture of the town 5 Division, when ashore, was to move north and capture Syracuse and Augusta while 50 Division secured Avola and protected the left flank. Subsequently the Corps was to move north and capture Catania, being relieved in its orginal area by 30 Corps. 30 Corps was to assault on the left of 13 Corps with 231 Infantry Brigade on the mght at Marzamemi, on the east of the peninsula of Cape Passero, 51 Division, four battalions up, astride the tip of the peninsula and r Canadian Division, two brigades up, on the west side. A Special Service Brigade of two Royal Marine Commandos was to land on the Canadians  left The first task of the Corps was to seize the aurfield at Pachino, which had been ploughed up by the enemy, and restore its serviceability at the earliest possible moment. It was then to seize the line of the road from Noto to Ispica (also known as Spaccaforno) and thereafter relieve 50 Division of 13 Corps at Avola In the second phase the Corps  objective was the high ground in the area Palazzolo Ragusa, and at the latter place the Canadians were to make contact with the Americans.

Seventh Army's assaults were divided between two forces, I] Corps on the right and 3 Infantry Division, reinforced, on the left. II Corps consisted of 45 Infantry Division on the right and 1 Infantry Division, less one Regimental Combat Team, on the left together with Rangers and a tank battalion. The Corps task was to land in the Gulf of Gela, from Cape Scaramia to Gela town, and capture the airfields at Ponte Olivo, Comiso and Biscari, subsequently to make contact with Eighth Army in the area of Ragusa. Parachutists of 505 Regimental Combat Team were to be dropped on the mght of (D minus 1/D-day about four miles inland and six miles east of Gela to capture the high ground and road
