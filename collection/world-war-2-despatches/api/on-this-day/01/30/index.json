One American Regimental Combat Team of 1 Infantry Division was under command of 78 Division, south of Medjez. The line in this sector ran from the coast due north of Jefna south through Sidi Nsir station, then south-east to cover Medjez and then due south through Goubellat and Bou Arada. In the next sector to the south the French XIX Corps held the Eastern Dorsale as far south as Pichon. The northern part of this front was held by the Algerian Division with 1 Guards and 36 Infantry Brigades under command. The southern part of the Corps sector was entrusted to r United States Infantry Division, less one Regimental Combat Team, and an Armoured Combat Command of 1 Armoured Division. A British Army Group, Royal Artillery, supported XIX Corps throughout the campaign. From south of a line from Thala to Pichon the United States II Corps commanded the area of the plain between the two Dorsale Tanges, supported by the French Constantine Division and part of a British Armoured Car Regiment. The American forces consisted of I Armoured Division, less one Combat Command but plus one Regimental Combat Team from 1 Infantry Division, and a Ranger Battalion. JI Corps held in general the line of the Eastern Dorsale with the important exception of the Faid pass. On 30th January the Germans had attacked this pass with a force which included over sixty tanks and overwhelmed the small French garrison before the American armour could come to its assistance. They then dug in firmly and resisted all attempts to dislodge them; an action on 2nd February was costly in American tanks and II Corps decided to pull back to Sidi Bou Zid and observe the Faid area from",

The results of the attack were disappointing. 3 Division failed to capture Cisterna and suffered heavy losses, particularly among the Ranger battalions which were under command. 1 Division reached the railway embankment at Campoleone, a difficult obstacle, but was unable to advance beyond it, leaving itself in a dangerous salient protruding into the enumy lines. On 31st January I again visited Anzio by destroyer, returning on 2nd February. It was clear to me that until we had captured Cisterna and Campoleone it would be impossible to undertake any important offensive operations. I therefore ordered a renewed attack on Cisterna in full strength with a properly prepared Corps plan and all possible concentration of artillery and air attacks. Next my plan was to gain ground on the left of i Division, clear wp our centre and organise our communications so as to be able to mount a solid offensive to cut Route 6.",

I had therefore ordered General Leese on 30th January to despatch 4 Indian Division, which had newly arrived in the country, to come under command of General Freyberg in an ad hoc New Zealand Corps. 4 Indian Division had had the longest experience in actual operations of any Allied formation and had recently been doing some training in mountain operations.t I told General Leese:  * I fully realise that this will put out of court any possibility of offensive operations by you  . On 3rd peutuary I put the New Zealand Corps under command of Fifth Army, from Army Group reserve. I still felt the need for a formation under my hand to influence the battle and therefore signalled Eighth Army on the 4th to be prepared to release 78 Division within seven to ten days. General Leese was naturally very perturbed at this proposal to take away a fifth division; not only would it render any offensive action quite impracticable and upset the system for reliefs of tired formations but he feared that it might even lead to a loss of security on his front. This, however, was a tisk which I was prepared to take; the Adriatic sector was now unimportant to either side; both were gathering their maximum strength for the decisive battle under the snows of Monte Cairo and among the canals of the Pontine Marshes.",

From the 30th January until the 15th February, when the 17th Division took up a line on the Bilin River, all available bombers were employed in direct Army support with the maximum number of fighters it was practicable to spare each day. Bombing operations took the form of support to our hard pressed detachments. Attacks were made on river craft on the River Salween and off Moulmein with both bombers and fighters. The fighter effort available was employed in attempting to intercept at this great distance from its base the enemy raids on our forward positions, and providing security for our bombing operations During this period river craft, batteries, enemy concentrations, troops, landing stages, railway stations and barracks and stores were attacked. A total weight of 70,136 lbs. of bombs were dropped on these objectives, with successful results. Most of the bombing was carried out from a low altitude and, in consequence, the results could be seen, provided objectives were not in the jungle. The raids were carried out on such places as Kado, Martaban, Pa an,",

The Generalissimo very kindly gave me an interview on this day at which he promised to maintain 1 Squadron of the A.V.G in the defence of Rangoon as long as this was possible. It is a matter of great regret to the R.A F. that towards the end of the campaign in Burma it was impracticable on account of shortage of aircraft and the effect of the air battle for the R.A.F. to give adequate support to the Chinese Armies deployed in Burma.",

It had not been expected that the Marines would be able to clear the whole island and they were to be relieved after landing by 36 Brigade (26 Indian Division) ; but this actually proved to be unnecessary. The other tasks allotted to 36 Brigade were to capture the small island of Sagu Kyun, south of Ramree, which it accomplished on 30th January under cover of the fire of NORMAN and RAIDER, who silenced enemy guns, and then to assault the southern end of Ramree itself, and exploit northwards.",
