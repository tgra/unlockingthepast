The operational units of Balkan Air Force consisted on an average of twentytwo squadrons excluding those employed on special supply operations. They operated fifteen types of aircraft, flown by air-crew of eight different nationalities (British, South African, Ttalian, Greek, Jugoslav, and for the supply dropping operations, American, Polish and Russian).

This was a much smaller force than I considered necessary, also I disliked using the Free French since J knew that this would be likely to stiffen the resistance of the French in Syria, but I had no other troops I could make available. I was instructed by the Chiefs of Staff to advance into Syria as soon as the above force was reasonably prepared. I reported that 7th June.was the earliest date by which the operation could start, actually it began on 8th June."

This astonishing feat   cannot be explained by any single factor and must be attributed in part to all of the following: -the miscalculations of the enemy; the high degree of air superiority attained by our Air  Forces, which, drastically reduced theenemy's air reconnaissance; the bad weather which caused the enemy to withdraw his EBoat patrols to Cherbourg; and finally the radio counter-measures employed by our forces, which, coupled with the diversions against the . Pas de Calais and -Cap d Antifer, -left, the enemy in doubt as to the points at which we would land even when he had become aware that the invasion was in progress. Although the unfavourable weather caused difficulties and damage to craft off the beaches later, the advantages gained by surprise were so striking that your decision to go on despite the weather was amply justified. A postponement of one more day, e.g. till 7th June, would,.in the event, have proved disastrous owing to the conditions of sea off the beaches. The problems arising out of a postponement of 12 to 14 days to the next suitable period are too appalling even to contemplate."

            "description": "On these orders the pursuit was pressed rapidly. The main difference was that 13 Corps was no longer directed on the TerniRieti area but farther afield; this meant that the South Africans were no longer to turn eastwards to cross the Tiber to seize Narni as originally planned, but to press on to Orvieto. Here again a difficult question of routeing was involved since both they and II Corps were in danger of arriving simultaneously at Viterbo. I decided to give precedence to the armour and II Corps was halted in place until the South Africans were through. Meanwhile VI Corps made rapid progress up the coast in spite of the arrival of two fresh German divisions. On the gth it captured Tarquinia and a task force from 1 Armoured Division, operating on the inland flank, cut into II Corps  territory to capture the Viterbo airfield. On the rrth, however, VI Corps was relieved by IV Corps and moved to Naples, coming under command of Seventh Army for operation ANVIL. II ad pushed forward with 85 and up the axis of Route 2 and consolidated the position between VI and 13 Corps. It was relieved by the French on oth June. On the oth Eighth Amy had also carried out a regrouping; the Tiber was now to be the boundary between 13 and 10 Corps, with the latter commanding all the troops formerly in 13 Corps east of the river. The final result was to give 13 Corps 78 and 6 South African Divisions, with 4 Division in reserve, and 10 Corps 6 British Armoured and 8 Indian Infantry Divisions, with 10 Indian as reserve. The Canadians were grounded south of Rome. The Polish Corps, which had passed to Army Group reserve on 26th May after the capture of Piedimonte, assumed command of the Adriatic sector from 5 Corps on 17th June, remaining under direct command of my headquarters until 29th June when it passed to Eighth Army.

            "date": "7th June",
            "description": "My tactical plans for the pursuit north of Rome envisaged two main lines of advance: along the west coast for Fifth Army and up the axis of the Tiber, both east and west of the river, for Eighth Army. Fifth Army's first objective was the port of Civitavecchia, which was now vital for our maintenance; Eighth Army was directed on the area of Terni and Rieti, the capture of which would disrupt any German plans for forming a continuous front across the peninsula and would threaten with envelopment the left wing of Tenth Amny. From the point of view of terrain the former task was rather the easier, for the country is of an open, rolling nature while the route up the Tiber, though not difficult by comparison with the country between Naples and Rome, offered many opportunities for delaying actions, especially on the east bank of the river. Enemy opposition was also much weaker on our left, for most of Kesselring's divisions had withdrawn northward east of the Tiber and, having rashly destroyed all the bridges from Rome as far as Todi, sixty miles to the north, were having great difficulty in getting across to the west to come to the support of the weaker forces retreating up the west coast. VI Corps therefore set the pace, with 34 Division on the coast and the 36th inland, both supported by armour from 1 Armoured Division. At 1030 hours on 7th June elements of 34 Division entered Civitavecchia, The speedy capture of this port, the most important between Naples and Leghorn, was a considerable gain and, although the Germans had carried out extensive demolitions, particularly fine efforts by the port reconstruction companies made it usable earlier than had been expected. The first Landing Ship, Tank berthed on 12th June and Liberty ships began unloading in the roads on the 14th. ."
