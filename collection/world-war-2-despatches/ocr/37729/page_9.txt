Mr. Eden (Foreign Secretary), General Sir
John Dill (C.1.G.S.), General Sir Archibald
Wavell (C.-in-C. M.E.), Captain Dick, R.N.
(representing C.-in-C. Mediterranean) and
myself, the decision was taken to despatch
British Troops at the earliest opportunity to
‘form on the Aliakmon line to the West of
Salonika,

It followed, of course, that an increased air
commitment would be involved both in sup-
port of the British Army on this new front
and also for air protection of the ships trans-
porting men to Greece. Nevertheless, since the
Greeks had decided to oppose a German in-
vasion of Macedonia there was clearly no
alternative to giving them the maximum assist-
ance possible. Moreover, though German air
and land forces had arrived in Tripoli these
might well have been to prevent our further
advance, and there was no reason on that par-
ticular date to suspect the imminent preparation
of a counter-offensive in Libya. It is true,
however, that such a threat developed almost
immediately after the Greek commitment had
been accepted.

40. The landing of British Troops in the
Athens area during March proceeded with little
or no interference from the air; German in-
filtration into Bulgaria continued but their air
activity was limited to occasional recon-
naissances over Macedonia. By the rst April
it was evident that the German invasion of
Greece through the Balkans was imminent.
Consequently, with the prospect of fighting the
war on two fronts, two air formations were
created, viz. Eastern ‘Wing and Western Wing.
H.Q. Eastern Wing was at Tsaritsani, in close
touch with G.H.Q. British Forces and con-

* trolled Nos. 11 and r13 (B) Squadrons (Blen-
heims), No. 33 (F) Squadron (Hurricanes) and
No. 208 (A.C.) Squadron (Hurricanes and
Lysanders). The role of this force was to pro-

vide direct support for the British and Greek °

Armies against the prospective German attack
from the North. H.Q. Western Wing was at
Yannina and controlled No. 112 (F) Squadron
(Gladiators) and No. 21x (B) Squadron (Blen-
heims), the role of this formation being to
support the Greeks on the Albanian Front.
The remainder of the squadrons in Greece, viz.
No. 30 (F/B) Squadron (Blenheim Fighters),
No. 80 (F) Squadron (Hurricanes and Gladia-
tors) and No. 84 (B) Squadron (Blenheims),
together with detachments of Nos. 37 and 38
(B) Squadrons (Wellingtons), were at aero-
dromes in the Athens area directly under the
control of H.Q., B.A.F., Greece.’ No. 815
Squadron Fleet Air Arm was based on
Paramythia and No. 805 Squadron Fleet Air
Arm on Maleme (Crete). :

4x. Germany declared war on Greece and
Yugo-Slavia on the 5th April, r9q4r, and
launched her attack at dawn the following day,
crossing the Greek frontier into Macedonia by
four routes, with the main thrust along the
Struma Valley. Simultaneously they advanced
Westwards into Yugo-Slavia along the Strumica
Valley in the South, from Dragoman to Nis
in the North, and by other intermediate routes.
The Greeks resisted strongly at Rupel, tem-
porarily checking the German advance through
the Struma Valley, but despite this opposition
. the Germans succeeded in penetrating Thrace
and Macedonia and occupied Salonika on the
8th April.

Throughout the German advance the primaty
task of our Squadrons was to attack his
A.F.V’s.,, M.T. columns, troops and lines of
communication on the Macedonian and Yugo-
Slavian Frontiers. Practically the whole of
our air effort was directed to this end, Welling-
tons making night attacks, Blenheims operating
both by night and day, with fighters constantly
in support maintaining offensive patrols, making
low flying machine-gun attacks on the enemy,
and escorting our bombers by day. The first
encounter with the German air force on this
front took place on 6th April. A patrol of 12
of No. 33 Squadron Hurricanes engaged 30
Me.109’s and shot down 5 of them without
loss to themselves. During the night of 6th/7th
April, 6 Wellingtons of No. 37 Squadron
successfully bombed the railway station and
marshalling yards at Sofia. From 7th to gth
April, as the Germans advanced in strength,
Blenheims of Nos. 11, 84 and 113 Squadrons
made heavy and effective attacks on large
columns of their M.T., A.F.V’s. and troops
near Petrich in Bulgaria, on the Strumica-Lake
Doiran Road in Yugo-Slavia and at Axiopolis
and Polykastron in Macedonia.

42. By this time the German armoured forces,
supported by dive-bombers, advancing ‘West-
wards from Bitolj, had overwhelmed the Yugo-
Slav Army and had succeeded in joining y
with the Italians in Albania. They then ad-
vanced Southward from Bitolj to Florina,
threatening to isolate the Greeks in Albania
from our own forces further East. The Greeks
were thus compelled to withdraw from the
Northern front of Albania, while our Armoured
Brigade and an Australian Infantry Brigade
were moved Westwards to close the Florina
Gap, where they were joined by a Greek cavalry
division from the Koritza area. On xoth April,
as the enemy continued his Westward thrust
into Yugo-Slavia, Blenheims attacked enemy
M.T. columns and A.F.V’s. on the Prilep-
Bitolj road inflicting heavy damage on them.
During the night of r1th/12th April, Welling-
tons followed up this effort with further attacks
on the enemy at Prilep and Kilkis.

Meanwhile, our forces holding the Florina
Gap had been hotly attacked by the Germans
on oth April and compelled, after a strong
resistance, to withdraw on 11th April. By the
evening of 12th April, our front had been formed
roughly on a line extending from the coast near
Mount Olympus, along the Aliakmon River
to Servia, thence N.W. towards the Albanian
lakes. Continued bombing and machine-gun
attacks by Blenheims and Hurricanes contri-
buted to the delay of the enemy’s advance
during the critical periods in which our troops
were falling back on new positions. These
operations were inevitably accompanied by con-
siderable losses and in one raid on the 13th
April, for example, a complete formation of
6 Blenheims of No. 21z Squadron was destroyed
by Me.109’s. Wellingtons continued to attack
more distant objectives. On the night of
13th/z4th April a force of 10 Wellingtons from
Nos. 37 and 38 Squadrons made a
further effective attack on the railway goods
yard at Sofia, destroying a large number of
trucks containing explosives. At the same time -
other Wellingtons bombed and machine-gunned
M.T. convoys at Yannitsa and Gorna Djumaya.
In operations on the following night Wellingtons
destroyed the bridge over the Vardar River
at Veles and Blenheims dropped bombs on
