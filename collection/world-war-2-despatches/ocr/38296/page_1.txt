THE BATTLE OF CRETE

The following Despatch was submitted to the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on
4th August, 1941, by Admiral Sir Andrew B.
Cunningham, G.C.B., D.S.0., Commander-
in-Chief, Mediterranean.

. Mediterranean,
4th August, 1941.

Be pleased to lay before Their "Lordships,

attached reports of naval operations in
defence of Crete between 15th May and 27th
May, 1941. Reports on the evacuation. of troops
from Crete will be forwarded later.

2. The object of the operations ‘was the pre-
vention of enemy seaborne landings on the
coast of Crete.” It was known that airborne
invasion of the island was impending; but it
appeared almost inconceivable that airborne
invasion alone could succeed against forewarned
troops, that seaborne support was inevitable
and that the destruction of troop convoys would
win the day. .

‘3. The Navy succeeded in its object but paid
a heavy price for this achievemient. The fleet

‘was operating within easy range of enemy air

bases and beyond the reach of any protection
from our own air force. The fleet fighters of
H.M.S. FORMIDABLE were reduced to only
four as a result of casualties and unservice-
ability arising from the recent operation
‘* Tiger.”’* It was, therefore, useless to send
H.M.S. FORMIDABLE to assist.

* Footnote: Operation ‘‘ Tiger '’ was the passage
of naval reinforcements and a convoy containing
urgent military stores through the Mediterranean,
covered by Force H as far as the Sicilian Narrows
and thence by the Mediterranean Fleet to Alexandria.
Tt took place between the 4th and oth May, 1941.

So, without air support of any sort, the fleet
had to be exposed to a scale of air attack which
is believed to have exceeded anything of the

4. The air attack on Crete started on the 20th
May, 1941. The sweeps of the Light Forces on
the night 2oth/2zst and during daylight 21st
were uneventful except for heavy air attacks
and the unlucky loss of H.M.S. JUNO (see
paragraphs 14 to 20).¢ As far as the Navy was
concerned, the real Battle of Crete began on
the night of 21st/22nd May, with the success-
ful encounter of Force D with an enemy convoy
(see paragraph 23). This encounter was. skil-
fully and thoroughly exploited, was a heavy
blow to the Germans and an encouragement for
our hard pressed troops in Crete.

*Footnate : Air Ministry comment: The R.A.F.
in the Middle East had suffered severe losses during
the Greek campaign and in Cyrenaica, and fighter
strength was so reduced as to be barely sufficient for
the defence of the Middle East base itself. The
strength of the bomber force was scarcely better. In
the face of pressing commitments it had only been
possible to spare resources for the construction of
two airfields in Crete and these were but moderately
equipped. From these airfields, before the loss of
Greece, it had been possible to operate a handful of
R.A.F, and F.A.A. fighters for the occasional pro-
tection of shipping, but now confronted with the
German Air Force operating in overwhelming num-
bers from ample bases in Greece and the adjoining
islands, and.in view of the dangerous depletion of
Middle East air forces as a whole, decision reluctantly
had to be taken that the maintenance of fighter
forces in Crete merely invited destruction and could
not be justified. With this view, the Commanders-
in-Chief in the Middle East were in agreement.

Though every possible effort was made by aircraft

ased in Africa and in Malta to attack enemy air-
fields they could make little impression on the over-
whelming strength of the G.A.F. Shore based fighter

cover to our ships operating to the north of Crete

‘was clearly out of the question.
