SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 SEPTEMBER, 1946

233. We relied on daytime interception
methods, and on the Searchlights to illuminate
and hold the Bombers. If they were capable
of doing this, all would be well, since the dis-
tance at which an illuminated Bomber can be
seen by night is comparable with the range of
visibility by daylight.

234. The first night attack worthy of the
name was made early in June and the results
were encouraging. Aircraft were well picked
up and held by the Searchlights and 6 were
shot down. The attack was, however, made at
comparatively low altitudes (8,000-12,000 ft.)
and the Germans, profiting by this lesson, re-
sorted thereafter to greater heights at which the
Searchlights were practically ineffective. In
close consultation with myself, General Pile tried
every conceivable method of operation, but
without material success.

235. About this time Radio Location instru-
ments were fitted in Blenheims and it became
necessary to develop at high pressure a system
of operation which should enable Night Fighters
to make interceptions even against unilluminated
targets.

236. The difficulty of this task Will be realised -

when it is considered that it became necessary
to put the Fighter within one or two hundred
yards of the Enemy, and on the same course,,
instead of the four or five miles which were
adequate against an illuminated target.

237. It may be asked why the Searchlights
were so comparatively impotent when they had
afforded an accessory to successful defence at
.the end of the last war. The answer lies partly
in the height factor already discussed, and partly
in the greatly increased speed of the Bomber,
which was about three times that obtaining in
1914. The sound locator, on which Search-
lights mainly relied at this time, naturally regis-
tered the apparent position of the source of
sound and lagged behind the target to the ex-
tent of the time taken by sound to travel from
the target to the Sound Locator. When the
speed of the target is low it is comparatively
easy to allow for this lag, but at the speeds
of modern bombers the angular distance which
must be allowed for in searching is so great that
the Searchlights were generally defeated.

238. The first thing which appeared obvious
to me was that a ‘‘ sound Plot ’”’ track trans-
mitted from the Observer Corps with a variable
and unpredictable ‘‘lag’’ was good enough
only for Air Raid Warning purposes and was
much too inaccurate to be of use for controlled
interception at night: height indications also
were little better than guesswork. The Radio
Location apparatus (known as A.I.) fitted in
twin-engined fighters had a maximum range of
2 or 3 miles, but it was limited by the height at
which the Fighter was flying. If, for instance,
the Fighter was flying at 10,000 feet, ground
echoes were reflected from all ranges greater
than this, and an aircraft echo from 10,500 feet
would be indistinguishable among the ground
echoes.

239. The minimum range of the A.I. was also
testricted at this time to about 1,000 feet. Below

this digtaiice the aircraft echo was swamped by °

instrumental disturbance. Continuous and in-
tensive development work was in progress to
minimise these limitations,

240. No Radio Location apparatus was avail-
able at this time for inland tracking, and I
turned for help to the Army, which had
developed for use with guns a Radio Location
apparatus known as the G.L. Set. Within a
limited range (about 40,000 feet) this set could
give very accurate position plots, and, more-
over, could read height to within plus or minus
1,000 feet at average ranges.

241. Although these sets were few in number
and were urgently required for their original
purpose of gun control, General ‘Pile realised
the urgency of our need and made available
about Io sets for an experiment in the Kenley
Sector on the usual line of approach of London
Raiders, which commonly made their landfall
near Beachy Head. :

242. The G.L. sets were installed at Search-
light Posts, and direct telephone communica-
tion was arranged with the Kenley Sector
Operations Room. Here a large blackboard
was installed, and the G.L. plots were shown at
intervals of about 30 seconds and with a greater
accuracy in height than had before been possi-
ble by any means. :

243. The track of-the pursuing fighter was
determined by means of the R/T Direction
Finding Stations. \

244. Major A, B. Russell, O.B.E., T.A.R.O.,
co-operated in the development of this system
in the Kenley Sector. His practical knowledge
and tireless enthusiasm were of the greatest
value.

245. Promising results were obtained almost
from the first and numerous instances occurred
where echoes were obtained on the A.I. sets in
the aircraft. Practical results were, however, .
disappointing, partly because the AL
apparatus proved to be unexpectedly capricious
in azimuth, and partly because the Blenheim
was slower than many of the German Bombers
and was deficient in fire-power. Many
Germans escaped after an initial A.I. ‘‘ pick-
up ’’ and even after visual contact had been
effected. ;

246. The A.I. apparatus was then fitted into
the Beaufighters, which were just beginning to
appear in Service. The machines and their
engines suffered from “‘ teething trouble ’’ to
an unusual degree, and the adaption of A.I.
to a new type was accompanied by certain
difficulties. In addition, they were operating

' from a ‘wet aerodrome at Redhill, and the

development of delicate electrical apparatus,
combined with a new type of aircraft and
engine, with rudimentary maintenance facilities,
was a matter of the greatest difficulty. In nine
cases out of ten something would go wrong with
the aeroplane or with the A.I. set or with the
R/T Direction Finding apparatus or with the
Communication system before an interception
could be madé. No. 219 Squadron, under
Squadron Leader J, H. Little, were engaged in
this work and operated with great energy and
enthusiasm under extremely adverse and diffi-
cult conditions.

247. It would, of course, have been desirable
to carry out all this development work by day
when faults would have been much more easily
detected and remedied, but the low rate of
Aircraft Serviceability precluded Day-and-
Night work, and London was being bombed
almost every night, so that I could not afford to
neglect the chance of getting practical results.
