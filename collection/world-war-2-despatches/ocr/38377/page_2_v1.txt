Nevertheless, it is a potent new factor in Mediterranean war and will undoubtedly deny us that free access to the waters immediately surrounding Malta and Sicily which we have previously enjoyed, until our own air forces have been built-up to a scale adequate to meet it.

7. The dive bombing attacks on the 3rd Cruiser Squadron on the afternoon of 11th January resulting in the loss of SOUTHAMPTON were a complete surprise, delivered at a time when the ships concerned believed themselves to have drawn clear of the threat of

air attack, and when officers and men were -

doubtless. relaxing their vigilance to some extent after a*very strenuous four days.

This damaging attack served to emphasise the importance of including an R.D.F. ship* in detached units whenever possible.

8. The remarks of the Commanding Officer, H.M.S. JAGUAR are of considerable interest, in particular his practice of firing 4.7-1nch barrage over the stern of a ship attacked by dive bombers. The idea is now under development in the Mediterranean Fleet with a view to the destroyer screen putting an   umbrella barrage   over the fleet.

9 Force Xf  had originally put to sea to take part in the offensive operations intended in Operation M.C.6, which had to be abandoned It was most unfortunate that persistent bad weather prevented the RearAdmiral, 1st Battle Squadront from delivering any of the attacks which he intended, and which would have been a most useful counter to the undoubted set back which the fleet as a whole had received.

io. It is satisfactory to record that Convoy  Excess ? whose safe passage had been the main object-'of the operation, reached its destination safely.

It was intended to continue at sea in the Central Mediterranean after the passage of the convoy and to conduct a further operation (M.C.6), which was to have consisted of offensive operations against shipping on the Italian coasts.

2. Operation M.C.6 was brought into force by the Commander-in-Chief's message 1039 /9th January, byg the offensive operations in the Central Mediterranean had to be cancelled after the damage to ILLUSTRIOUS described in
