This question has been dealt with in some
detail because it vitally affected the campaign.
Instead of Indian battalions stiffening, as was
hoped; the Burma Rifles, the effect was exactly
the opposite However, as more than half the
forces available consisted of Burma Rifles there
was no alternative to making use of them even
after their lack of training began to be dis-
closed.

The possible failure of the attenuated ser-
vices behind the Army, especially M.T., was a
source of constant anxiety. As regards equip-
ment and transport the situation was equally
serious and no units had their full scale and
some, such as signal units and A.A. batteries,
had practically none. The force, such as it
was, was quite unprepared for war. Reserves
were of course practically nil.

5. Levies. As regards levies or guerrillas,
efforts had already been made to start an
organisation in the Shan States. This was now
extended to the Karen country of North
Tenasserim. Although started very late in the
day it was undoubtedly of value in providing
a foundation for larger scale operations in the
future, a deterrent to Japanese infiltration of
the hills in that area and a valuable threat to
the so-called free Burmese of the plains below.

6. Burma Frontier Force. There was also the
Burma Frontier Force of the equivalent of six
battalons which had only just been taken over
by the Army from the Civil Administration,
but the Inspector-General remained: responsible
for the administration of the force. It con-
sisted for the most part of good Indian per-
sonnel but was numerically weak in officers and
neither its organisation nor its training really
fitted it to take part in active operations agains!
a firsi-class enemy.

7. British and Indian Troops. The te-
mainder of the troops available consisted of
two British battalions, two Indian infantry
brigades and one Mountain Regiment.

8. Enemy Forces. Very little was knowa
about the enemy owing both to the lack of
intelligence and of aircraft for reconnaissance.
The thick jungle country rendered air or even
ground reconnaissance very unproductive. lt
was known, however, that there were three or
four Japanese divisions available in Thailand
of which at least two could probably be macle
available for operations against Burma, In
view of the weak state of our forces and the
approach of the monsoon there appeared to be
every reason why the Japanese should invade
Burma as early as possible.

g. Appreciation. A full appreciation of the
defence problem of Burma was completed by
me on roth January. It formed the basis of
policy throughout the period of my command.
I should like here to refer to the valuable help
and assistance given me throughout my tenure
of command by my B.G.S., Brig. H. L.
Davies, whose judgment and military know-
ledge proved invaluable in dealing with a most
difficult situation.

ro. Bombing of Rangoon. On the 23rd
December and again on the 25th December just
before I arrived, Rangoon was bombed by a
large force of enemy aircraft. These attacks
were directed against the dock area and in the
neighbourhood of the power station. Extensive
damage was caused by fires among the crowded
wooden houses and huts in the bombed area

SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948

and civilian casualties due mainly to anti-
personnel bombs were very heavy indeed,
amounting to approximately 1,700-2,000 people
killed. Very little damage of a military nature
occurred and the only damage to the docks was
the destruction of one transit shed.

1x. Effects of Bombing. The bombing had,
however, a very serious repercussion as ser-
vants, menials, all subordinate employees, and
coolies including the dock labourers,, at once
commenced to leave the town. As there were
many ships loaded with military stores for the
Army and with Lease and Lend stores for China
waiting discharge, the results were serious.

Practically all Government offices, shops,
markets, hospitals etc., lost almost the whole of
their subordinate staffs as also did the Ordnance,
Military Works, Transportation services, etc.
For a time there was in some cases great
difficulty in obtaining and preparing food as
almost all servants, cooks, etc., had also de-
parted. . .

Rangoon town was not raided again; there-
after the enemy directed all his efforts against
the aerodrome at Mingaladon and _ that
neighbourhood. As a result of this policy
labour gradually regained confidence and a use-
ful proportion returned to work. o.

Taken as a whole, however, the situation
was never restored. Military units for essential
work became available only on a very limited
scale and the working of all transportation,
works, labour, etc., for services was most pre-
carious throughout the period prior to the fall of
Rangoon.

12. The organisation of the A.R.P. services
in Burma was carried out by Mr. de Graff
Hunter who did most excellent work in spite
of great difficulties in securing suitable person-
nel. This organisation, like others based on
locally recruited personnel, soon showed a
tendency to disintegrate in face of attack.

13. Fighter Successes During the first two
air raids over Rangoon the R.A.F. and A.V.G.
fighters were most successful and not less than
61 enemy first-line bombers and fighters were
claimed as destroyed on these two days. A
further large number were shot down during
subsequent raids.

It is significant to note that on no occasion
were the oil installations in the Rangoon area
attacked and later we were able to remove with
confidence for use elsewhere a proportion of
the A.A. artillery detailed for the defence of
Syriam,

14. Observer Corps. I should here hke to
draw attention to the fact that until the Central
Telephone Exchange in Rangoon closed down
on the 28th February no enemy air raid reached
the Rangoon area without warning passed by
the Observer Corps posts. Until Tenasserim
was lost the average period of warning was
forty minutes but this of course gradually de-
creased as the enemy closed in on Rangoon.

In all'cases the Observer Posts were manned
by local inhabitants who passed the warning
by pre-arranged: codes over the Posts and Tele-
graphs or Railway systems, the average time
taken to pass a warning message being about
two minutes. The success of the system de-
pended on the wholehearted support of the
Posts and Telegraphs officials and in particular
thanks are due to Mr. Nesbitt-Hawes the
D.G., P. and T., who devised the communica-
tion system and who until the last was always
