given in my Despatch as Supreme Allied Com-
mander, forwarded to the Combined Chiefs of
Staff. Before proceeding, however, to my con-
cluding evaluation of the Italian campaign it
will be as well to complete the picture of the
over-running of Italy from Cape Passero to
the Brenner by giving in broad outline the
events which led up to the final capitulation.
It is unnecessary to be detailed, for the stage
oad been set by the events of the winter and
the action proceeded according to the plans
laid down then. The problem was to disrupt
the enemy’s defences in the of the Po
by attacks at two separate points, to surround
as much as possible of the forces disposed
between the two points of rupture and to ex-
ploit with the utmost speed to the Po both
in order to forestall any attempt to reorganize
the defences of the river line and to cut off
and destroy the maximum number of enemy
south of the river. There were two axes on
which to operate, each of them capable of
serving for the advance of an army: Route 12
(Modena-Ostiglia-Verona) for Fifth Army and
Route 16 (Ferrara-Rovigo-Padua) for Eighth
Army. On the former route the problem for
Fifth Army was to break out of the mountains
where they had been locked up since the pre-
vious winter; once in the plains their advance
would go with the grain of the country. The
obstacles facing Eighth Army were, as in the
Previous winter, a series of water barziers,
especially the fortified lines of the rivers Senio,
Santerno, Sillaro and Idice. Above all the
toad to Ferrara was narrowed to a heavily
defended defile by extensive artificial flooding
in the area of the town of Argenta. This
defile, known to us as the Argenta Gap, loomed
large in aon appreciations; in order to
advance rapidly to the nec crossing sites
on the Po we aust either force it or outfiank
it and the latter looked the more difficult, and
certainly the more time-wasting, of the two
possible courses. North of the Po the enemy
had constructed defence lines based on the
rivers Adige, Tagliamente and Isonzo, and
behind them was the final line of the Alps. I
was less concerned with these, as if we were
successful in our battle south of the Po the
enemy would have no troops left to man them.

It will be seen that the Germans had made
most elaborate preparations for a protracted
defence in Italy and it may well be asked why,
when the Thousand Year Reich was clearly
crumbling to ruin nine hundred and eighty-
eight years short of its proposed span, great
masses of slave labourers should still be toiling
to throw up defences in the plains of Venetia.
The answer must probably be connected with
the Nazi plan for a ‘‘ National Redoubt ’’.
For the sake of the example for the future, and
because the armies were still firm in the hand
of a man who was determined never to
surrender, it was still necessary to plan as if
there were some hope left. The only prospect
which. appeared to offer any chance for pro-
tracting resistance was to abandon the defence
of the open country of North Germany and
concentrate on holding for as long as possible
the mountains of the south in the area of Tyrol,
Salzburg and Western Carinthia. It was
questionable how long, if at all,. this fortress
could be held and there must have been many
commanders who doubted but, such as it was,
this represented the only future plan which

could be contemplated. To carry it out the
forces fighting in Italy were absolutely essential;
they represented the only large coherent body
of men left in the spring of 1945. They were in
a position to withdraw straight into the
southern face of the redoubt; they might, more-
over, retain for at least a time the food-pro-
ducing and industrial areas of Northern Italy.
Undoubtedly if they had been able to with-
draw across the Po in good order they would
have given a very good account of themselves
in the defence of the Alps; it was more than
ever necessary, therefore, to ensure their
destruction south of the river.

The armies facing us were still strong* well-
equipped and in good heart. Four divisions,
by no means the best, had been transferred to
the Eastern front between January and March
to balance the transference of the Canadian
Corps and 5 British Division from my command
but General von Vietinghoff, who succeeded
Field-Marshal Kesselring on 23rd March, on
the latter’s transfer to the Western front, com-
manded on that date a force of twenty-three -
German and four Italian (German-equipped)
divisions. t Furthermore, by contrast with other
fronts, the divisions which faced us in Italy
were real divisions and not the scratch baitle-
groups which usurped the name elsewhere. Re-
inforcements had continued to arrive and a
vigorous comb-out of rear areas and a con-
siderable reduction in all but essential services
had maintained fighting strength. The para-
chutists, for example, were particularly strong
—1 and 4 Parachute Divisions went into action
with sixteen thousand and nearly fourteen
thousand men respectively—and so were the
mobile divisions; in fact the average strength
for German divisions was eleven thousand five
hundred, slightly over the standard war estab-
lishment strength for infantry divisions at that
period of the war.t The troops were well
rested and had spent the period of the lull in
intensive training. Morale ‘was astonishingly
good. In spite of the desperate situation of
German arms in the homeland itself the Ger-
mans in Italy continued to show the same
resolute spirit of resistance and dash in coun-
ter-attack which had distinguished them
hitherto. It was not until they had been driven
against the Po, and had lost all their heavy
weapons in the vain attempt to cross it, that
any large-scale surrenders were recorded.§ To

¢ On roth April XCVII Corps in north-eastern Italy,
with two divisions, was transferred to the Commander-
in-Chief South-east. There were also in Italy various
foreign levies, a Cossack division, 29 S.S. Grenadier
Division (Italian troops with German officers) and other
Italian formations to a strength of 126,000.

§ This was a disheartening result for the large
organization engaged in propaganda and ‘‘ Psycholo-
gical Warfare ’’ to the German troops. In general
the verdict must be that this had no military effect
whatsoever; the enemy continued to resist beyond
the limits of what could have been thought possible.
Such deserters as gave themselves up during the
campaign were naturally claimed as successes of our

- psychological warfare but it would be difficult to prove

that they would’ not have deserted in any case, espe-
cially as the great majority of them were persons of
non-German origin, forcibly conscripted. There will
always be deserters in a war fought in such unpleasant
conditions; the surprising thing is that their numbers
were so entirely insignificant.
