            "date": "25th May",
            "description": "The capture of Elba, early plans for which I have already mentioned, took place about this time. I originally wanted this operation to be Jaunched if possible before the spring offensive opened but it had been postponed to a date between 2oth and 25th May. On 16th May I was informed that it had been further postponed till mid-June. This removed almost all the value of the operation as by that time our troops, advancing overland, would be almost level with the island and on rath June I asked whether the forces earmarked for Elba could not rather be used for a landing on the  mainland in support of Fifth Army. However, this was considered unacceptable as the French would not consent to the use in Italy of  g Colonial Infantry Division, which they wanted to keep for the landings in France. The operation therefore went in as planned in the early morning of 17th June; the occupation of the island was complete by the afternoon of the roth. Steps were taken to emplace medium guns in the north-eastern corner of the island to command Piombino but the town fell on 25th June without the necessity for their use."
