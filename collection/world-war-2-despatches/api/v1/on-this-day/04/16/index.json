The total sorties flown by the Tactical mediums during  April against railway communications amounted to 1,374 in the course of which 2,688 tons of bombs were dropped. Seventy-seven per cent. of these sorties were flown against Brenner line targets. Results of the interdiction policy during April."

It was now apparent to me that I had not enough troops to carry out my first intention of both advancing on Gimma and, by pressure from both divisions advancing north and south, clearing the enemy out of the area of the Great Lakes south of Addis Abeba. I considered that of the two objectives, if only one were to be carried out, the latter was the more important. The troops at Sciasciamanna were a constant threat to my L. of C. at Moggio and Adama, and it would be a great advantage to me also to have a through road via Neghelli from Kenya. I therefore ordered 11th (A) Division to concentrate on attacking Sciasciamanna, and rath (A) Division to advance on Dalle and Hula. For this latter purpose I relieved the Commander and two battalions of 24th G.C. Brigade, who- were restoring order in Italian Somaliland, by garrison battalions, and on 16th April sent them to 12th (A) Division."

While this portion of the enemy was being subjected to successful air strikes which caused them heavy casualties, an armoured column operating west of the road and railway crossed the Sinthe Chaung and broke into Shwemyo itself, which it completely cleared the same day (16th April). Meanwhile the engineers, though harassed by enemy artillery fire from the Shwemyo Bluff, bridged the Sinthe north of Shwemyo and bulldozed a by-pass over difficult ground. This enabled 161 Brigade Group to outflank the Japanese positions north of the town, and harbour south of it for the night 16th-17th. In their efforts to establish a bridgehead across the Sinthe Chaung the next day, however, this Brigade was held up."
