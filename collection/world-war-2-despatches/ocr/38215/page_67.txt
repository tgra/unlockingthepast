SUPPLEMENT To tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

447. Medical.—Accommodation for all hos-
pitals withdrawn from the mainland had with
difficulty been found in the Singapore Town
area, where there was naturally much con-
gestion. The Alexandra Miltary Hospital
remained the main hospital for British troops,
as did the Tyersall Park Hospital in the Tanglin
area for Indian troops. The Australian Base
Hospital evacuated from Malacca was accom-
modated in a school on the northern outskirts of
Singapore Town. Temporary hospitals were
formed at Changi, in St. Patrick’s School, in
the lower part of the Cathay building and, later
on, on the lower floors of the Secretariat and of
the Municipal Offices, at the Singapore Club
and at the Cricket Club.

There were good reserves of medical stores
at Tanglin.

As regards the Civil Medical Services, the
Main Civil Hospital and a number of other
hospitals in the Singapore area were still in full
use.

448. Ordnance.—The Main Army Ordnance
Depot was at Alexandra, with large Sub-Depots
at Nee Soon and in the Singapore Town area.
That of the Royal Air Force was at Seletar.

449. Naval Stores.—At the Naval Base were
held large quantities of stores of all descriptions
for the use of the Royal Navy.

450. Docks.—As a result of the Japanese
air raids on the Singapore Docks, labour
difficulties, similar to those which had been
experienced elsewhere, developed towards the
end of January. The Asiatic labourers, who
were in the regular employ of the Singapore
Harbour Board and most of whom occupied
quarters adjoining the Docks, disappeared as
the air raids became more intense, with the
result that ships bringing military stores had to
be unloaded by military personnel.

SECTION XLVIJ.—APPRECIATION OF THE
SITUATION, 31ST JANUARY, 1942.

451. Object —As the Naval Base was now
under observed artillery and small arms fire
and within close range of enemy aircraft to
which we could offer only limited opposition,
we had clearly failed to achieve our object
of protecting that base. From now onward our
object was to hold Singapore.

452. Naval—Qn the sea the Japanese
retained complete control of the waters east of
Malaya. With Borneo in their hands it was
probable also that their naval forces would
rapidly extend their control westwards and
south-westwards towards South Sumatra.

On the west coast of Malaya no Japanese
warships had yet penetrated to the Straits of
Malacca but their coastal craft could move with
impunity under cover of their aircraft. | In
addition to captured coastal craft it was now
clear that the Japanese had succeeded in trans-
feiring to the west coast some of their’ own
landing craft.

453. Air.—tIn the air the Japanese enjoyed
almost complete supremacy, the only Air
Forces we had available in Malaya at this stage
being the one squadron of Hurricane Fighters
and a small number of Buffaloes.

All the aerodromes, except that at Kallang,
were under observed artillery fire’ and some
of them were under small arms fire. be

454. Army.—It was estimated that the
Japanese could probably déploy three divisions

against Singapore Island, i.e., the Guards and
5 Division, or their replacements, from the
west coast and one division from the east coast.
These, if up to strength, would give a total
of about 60,000 men. Behind these it was
reasonable to expect that they had local reserves
in Malaya and they also probably still had a-
General Reserve in Indo-China or elsewhere
of one or two divisions. It was estimated,

‘therefore, that they probably had available for

operations against Singapore a total strength
of seven or eight divisions. They were known
in addition to have tank units and a formation
of air-borne troops.

As regards our own strength, I have no
official figures available now, but I believe it,
to have been in the neighbourhood of 85,000,
ie., the equivalent of four weak divisions with
a large number of Base and other admini-
strative troops. Included in this figure were
units of non-combatant Corps, i.e., the Royal
Army Medical Corps and the Pioneer and
Labour Units, and men for whom no arms
could be provided. Probably about 70,000
of the total were armed and equipped. A large
number of these were very inadequately
trained. Some of the reinforcements indeed
were so untrained that it had been deemed
unwise to draft them to units and they
remained in the Reinforcement Camps.

We hoped to get reinforcements totalling
about 2,500 early in February. ‘

455. As regards equipment, the enemy had
complete superiority in tanks as we still only
had a few obsolescent light tanks available.
We were, however, reasonably well equipped
with anti-tank guns and still had a good num-
ber of Bren gun carriers and armoured cars.
Our coast artillery was strong and our field
artillery was equal if not superior to that of
the enemy though our ammunition reserve was
limited. The Japanese had a good infantry
gun and their troops were well trained in the
use of the mortar which was a’ better weapon
than our own. We had two fully equipped
machine-gun battalions, but few units even
approached establishment in light automatics,
mortars or Thompson sub-machine guns owing
to heavy losses in the fighting on the mainland.
There were comparatively few anti-tank rifles.

456. Topography.—The comparative narrow-
ness of the western channel of the Johore
Straits and the fact that the main west coast
land communications led to that front made
it appear probable that the main Japanese
attack would develop from the west. There
was also the possibility of an approach via the
Malacca Straits to the south-west sector of
Singapore Island. Another possible avenue of
approach which could not be neglected was
from Kota Tinggi via the River Johore leading
to Tékong Island and the Changi area.

Should the enemy succeed in getting a foot-
ing on Singapore Island, the offensive and in-
filtration tacticswhich he would certainly
adopt would be favoured by the lack of ground
observation.

457. Communications —The Japanese land
communications were now very long and
vulnerable and exposed to the harassing tactics
of the various parties which had been left
behind on the mainland for that purpose. Many
bridges had been destroyed. On the other
hand By making use of the sea and by landing
troops and material at Mersing or at one of
