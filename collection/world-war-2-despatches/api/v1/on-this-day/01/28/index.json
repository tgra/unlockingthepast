            "date": "28th January",
            "description": "On the 28th January it became clear that the enemy's next objective was Bengasi. The 7th Indian Infantry Brigade was on its way to attack the force above the escarpment, which had now turned north and was heading for El Abiar, when two columns, each said to contain a considerable number of enemy tanks, were observed moving northwards along the coast towards Solluch. The 7th Indian Infantry Brigade was obliged to turn and deal with these columns and to abandon the attempt to attack the force moving on El Abiar, which captured Regima about noon. General Tuker then obtained permission to evacuate Bengasi, as the 1st Armoured Division was already committed in the opposite direction and would not be able to intervene."
