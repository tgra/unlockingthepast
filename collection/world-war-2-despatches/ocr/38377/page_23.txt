SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 AUGUST, 1948

Two Fulmars arrived over the convoy at
0615, followed at 0700 by 6 Beaufighters, and
subsequently Hurricanes. Fighter direction was
carried out by EDINBURGH and the co-
operation of the fighters left nothing to be
desired.

131. At o800 a report that no enemy surface
forces were to northward or southward of the
convoy’s track was received from, the Vice-

y Admiral, Malta. The Rear-Admiral Com-
manding, 1oth Cruiser Squadron consequently
detached KENYA, SHEFFIELD, EURALYUS
and HERMIONE to proceed ahead to Malta
to fuel. The four cruisers were sighted from
Gozo at 0845 and entered Grand Harbour at
1130 with guards and bands paraded. They
were accorded a great welcome by the people

‘of Malta.

. | 132. The whole convoy, with the exception
‘of IMPERIAL STAR, entered harbour un-
damaged early in the afternoon of 28th
September (D.4).

~ Movements of Force A from Dusk ath

September (D.3) to p.m. 28th September
(D.4).

133. After landing on all aircraft (vide para-
graph 86), Force A proceeded to the westward
at 14 knots, this being NELSON’s best speed
at the time. LEGION reported an A/S contact
at ooro/28 (D.4), but this was not confirmed.

134. In view of the low speed of NELSON
I did not consider that action to afford close
support of the ships of M.G.2 was justified,
since this would have involved an unacceptable
reduction in the destroyer screen then available.
I wished also to convey the impression that a
general withdrawal of forces to the westward
was in progress and would be continued.

135. ARK ROYAL flew off x A/S patrol
and 3 fighters at 0725. The latter carried out
a search to a depth of 4o miles astern, but
nothing was sighted. At o812 an enemy

shadower was sighted, but escaped into cloud.

. 136. An enemy report made by an R.AF.
aircraft received at 0958 indicated that-2 enemy
battleships, 5 cruisers and 13 destroyers were
jo miles, 105° from Cagliari at 0940, steer-
ing 195°. These ships, which were not in a
Position to menace the convoy, manceuvred in
this area throughout the day.

137. NELSON sighted a Cant 506 very low
down at 1025, and fighters were vectored. After
a chase to the south-east he was shot down 55
miles from the fleet and only 200 yards from
the Algerian shore, near Cape de Fer. This
was a fine example of fighter control and relent-
less pursuit which reflects the greatest credit
on those concerned. Although there were no
survivors from the Cant, the occurrence may
have been witnessed by occupants of the light-
house at Cape de Fer, a small house in the
vicinity and from a small vessel also in the
vicinity.

138. Shadowers were again reported at 1640,
and yet again an hour later, but due to a
failure of ARK ROYAL’s R/T transmitter, it
was not possible to vector fighters in time to
intercept. An enemy report made by Italian
aircraft was intercepted at 1720.

bow a® 1942, in position 37°, 30’ N., 3° 45° E.
She reported ‘“’ definitely submanne ”” and
carried out two attacks with no apparent result.
LEGION closed to co-operate but ‘did not
gain contact. Both ships left the area at 2012
to rejoin the screen. .

140. Speed was reduced to 12 knots at 2010
to reduce the strain on bulkheads and decks
in the wake of flooded compartments in NEL-
SON. At this time NELSON was approxi:
mately 8 feet down by the bows, and it was
estimated that 3,500 tons of water had entered
the ship.

14r. At 2100, Group 2 of Force A, consist-
ing of PRINCE OF WALES (Vice-Admiral,
2nd-in-Command, Home Fleet), RODNEY,
ARK ROYAL and 6 destroyers were detached
to proceed to the eastward and rendezvous with
Force X a.m. on D.5. Group I, consisting of
NELSON and 3 destroyers, continued towards
Gibraltar.

142. By keeping the battleships concentrated
until dark, I hoped to have concealed damage
to NELSON, and that consequently enemy
surface vessels would keep clear while Force X
made the passage westward from Malta.

Submarine Attacks on Force A, a.m. 29th
September (D.5).

143. At 0555, in position 37° 30’ N., 06° 25’
E., PRINCE OF WALES obtained an R.D.F.
surface echo ahead, and an emergency turn
of 40° to port together to 050° was carried out
at o609. Three minutes after the turn,
GURKHA (in position A, Screening Diagram
No. 6) sighted a torpedo track approaching from
an approximate bearing of 330°, and at a speed
estimated at 4o knots. It was too late to alter
course to. “avoid, and a second track followed
a few seconds ‘later; both appeared to pass
under the ship:

GURKHA turned to port in the direction
from which the torpedoes had approached, and
ISAAC SWEERS joined in hunting for the
submarine. No A/S contact was obtained and
no depth charges were dropped.

At 0622, ten minutes after the tracks had
been sighted, a double explosion was heard
and felt.

GURKHA and ISAAC SWEERS rejoined
the screen at 0700. Owing to the absence of
these ships from Gibraltar it has not yet been
possible to ascertain why no depth charges
were dropped, but this will be investigated on
their return.

144. GURKHA obtained an A/S contact,
classified as a mera bearing 102°, in
position 37° 26’ N., 07° 14’ E. at o8z0, two
hours after the previous attack. The contact
was nearly ahead and a, deliberate attack with
a 14-charge pattern was carried out at 0815.
Six minutes later a heavy underwater explosion
was heard and felt—this was similar to that felt
after the successful attack on a U-Boat’ next
day.

GURKHA was ordered by the Vice-Admiral
to rejoin the screen at 0841, and the hunt
was abandoned. No torpedo tracks were seen.
