78. The Buffalo had a disappointing per-
formance. It was heavy and underpowered
‘and had a slow rate of chmb. Maintenance
was heavy, which meant a low standard of
serviceability. Wastage during training was
hugh, and many of the aircraft in Squadrons
suffered from rough handling. The Buffalo had
‘no V.H.F. radio, and the maximum range of
R.T:/W.T. was 9 miles, being frequently less
when atmospherics were bad. Intercommuni-
cation between aircraft was unreliable,

79. There was one multi-seat fighter squadron
in the Command, No. 27, a might fighter
squadron equipped with Blenheim I’s.  Air-
craft were old and in poor condition and were
thus of limited value in a night-fighting role.
Its conversion into a bomber squadron, for
which personnel were available, came up for
consideration but could not be adopted oWing
to the need for retaining a night fighter unit.

Observer Corps.

80. In July, 1941, control of an existing
Observer Corps system was transferred from
the Army to A.H.Q. It had been organised
chiefly as part of the civil air raid warning
system, and needed a great deal of develop-
ment for use in an active air defence system.
The personnel were enthusiastic, but unfor-
tunately little time was available to train them
in their new duties. It was found impossible
to establish the necessary Observer Posts in the
jungle-clad mountainous country of Central
Malaya where there was, therefore, a serious
gap in the- warning system. Observer Corps
Operations Rooms were established at Kuala
Lumpur and Singapore, and were linked up to
the Dutch system in the Rhio Archipelago to
the South, but difficulty was experienced in
organising the whole through lack of existing
telephone communications in Malaya and to an
acute shortage of telephone material and equip-
ment.

Radar Stations.

81, The approved policy of priority for the
development of radar facilities was:—
(a) Singapore Island.
(b) The East Coast of Malaya.
(c) Penang and the West Coast-

‘All Stations were to look seaward with only
restricted overland cover behind, the hinter-
land being covered by the Observer Corps.

82. By December, 1941, four stations were
operating—Mersing, Tanah Merah Besar (in
East of Singapore Island), Bukit Chunang
(S-E. tip of Johore) and Tanjong Kupang
(S.W. tip of Johore). A further station, Kota
Tingi, in Johore was nearly ready and was
being accelerated partly to close the gap down
the central portion of Malaya, A sixth, at
Kota Bahru, the most northerly point om the
East Coast of Malaya, had been built but no
radar had yet been installed.

The general position was, therefore, that there
was fair cover for Singapore but little elsewhere.

Fighter Operations Room.

83. A Fighter Group Operations Room” in
Singapore was designed, constructed and occu-
pied by December—almost too late to do more
than break the ice of training its staff and

fighter squadrons in the intricate art of fighter
defence. It had an‘ operational staff only, no
administrative branches: it was in fact an
offshoot of the Air Staff of A.H.Q.

Fighter considerations in general.

84. Thus an Air Defence system had been
organised by the time war came, Whilst it
was by no means as efficient as it would have
been if the resources, time and equipment had
not been so short, yet it provided Singapore
with a scale of defensive effort which was
by no means insignificant. Great credit is due
to those who achieved this result with so short
a time for preparation, outstanding amongst
whom was the late Group Captain E. B.
Rice,

Bomber and G.R. Land-based Squadrons.

85. There were two light bomber and two
landplane G.R. squadrons in Malaya:—

No. 62 Squadron (Blenheim'I)—Alor Star,

No. 34 Squadron (Blenheim IV)—-Tengah.

No. 1 (R.A.A F.) Squadron (Hudson IT)
—Kota Bahru,

No. 8 (R.A.A.F.) Squadron (Hudson II)
—Sembawang.

These two types of squadron, Bomber and
G.R., are bracketed together because, owing
to the small size of the total force, specialisa-
tion was impracticable. Although the Hudson
squadrons were the main oversea reconnaissance
force, the Blenheims had also to be trained in
these duties: Similarly, both types of squadron
had to be trained in all types of bombing over
the sea and over the land, both by day and by
night,

86. From May, 1940, until the Spring of 1941
there had been severe flying restrictions’ im-
posed on Blenheim Squadrons owing to the lack
of spares in the Command. During this period,
flying hours were restricted to 5 hours monthly
per LE. aircraft. In Spring, 1941, selected
pilots had to be withdrawn from these squad-
tons to assist in the formation of the first two
fighter squadrons in Malaya.

87. Nos. 1 and 8 (G.R.) Squadrons R.A.A.F.
had reached a higher standard of training, but
it was necessary for the Australian Air Board
to withdraw crews as they became fully trained
and to replace them by untrained crews, the
former being required for the further expansion
of the R.A.A.F. in Australia.

There was, therefore, in both types of squad-
ron a wide variation between crews in the
degree of their training, and especially in their
efficiency in night flying, in which a high degree
of skill was desirable for operating through the
violent tropical thunderstorms which prevail
over Malaya at night during the monsoons,

Torpedo | Bomber Squadrons.

88, There were two Torpedo / Bomber Squad-
rons, Nos. 36 and 100, both based on Seletar,
the personnel of which were highly trained and
of long experience. But their aircraft, Vilde-
beestes, which had a speed of go knots and an
action radius of 180 miles, were obsolete. With
modern aircraft these-highly trained squadrons
would have been gavaluable, especially in the
first days of the war. But their approved re-
armament programme, with Beauforts, had
been delayed by technical complications in
production in Australia, In their training more
emphasis was placed on the torpedo than the
