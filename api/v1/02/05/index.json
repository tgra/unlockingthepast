Fighters from Singapore covered its final approach. The ‘‘ Empress of Asia’’ was attacked and set on fire, but that was the only loss incurred by reinforcing convoys, They escaped unscathed partly because of the protection they were given, but partly also because, it must be admitted, the Japanese made no very determined attacks against them. In contrast, many ships leaving Singapore during February: were heavily attacked and there were many losses amongst them.",

The Japanese bombers concentrated their attack on this station, and the landing area was soon so riddled with craters that only by constant and arduous labour was a landing stp 750 yards long maintained in operation. Even so, by 6th February our pilots experienced very great difficulty in avoiding craters when taking-off and landing.",

It was, however, the view of the Chief of the Air Staff that the bombing of objectives in France with the resources available for operation ‘‘ Circus ’’ could have no decisive military effect at this stage of the War, and that it would be a pity to spoil the chances of the fighters by making them conform to the requirements of a bomber force bent exclusively on inflicting material damage by bombing, and prepared to linger over the target area for that purpose. On his instructions, the Air OfficerCommanding-in-Chief, Bomber Command, and myself, held a conference at my Headquarters on r5th February,",

These operations differed’ from ‘‘ Circus ’’ operations inasmuch as the primary object was not to force enemy fighters to give battle, but to damage or destroy the target.

General Wingate originally estimated that about twelve weeks would be the maximum period which troops would be able to withstand the rigorous conditions under which they would be called upon to operate. His original plan, therefore, was (i) to march in 16 L.R.P. Brigade from Ledo, because the route was known to be practicable and this formation would be able to co-operate more closely with General Stilwell’s forces advancing in the same area, and (ii) later to fly in 77 and 111 L.R.P. Brigades, retaining the other brigades as a “second wave” which might, or might not, be used to operate during the monsoon, in relief of the three brigades sent in initially. This plan was later modified. however, as General Slim decided to fly in 14 and 3 (West African) Brigades early in April. On the 5th February 16 Brigade marched in from Ledo as planned, via Singkaling Hkamti, after a long march during which it had a few minor engagements, and began operations in the Indaw area in March. 23 L.R.P. Brigade was sent into Burma, but was subsequently employed by the Army Commander in the Naga Hills and Manipur area in co-operation with 33 Corps.",

There were additional reasons for this change. After the Yalta Conference, the Chiefs of Staff had sent the Supreme Allied Commander a new directive. This was not only influenced by the speed and success of our advance in Burma, and the opening of the Ledo/Burma Road, but also by the general quickening of the tempo of the American operations against Japan in the Pacific and in the Philippines. The new directive ordered South-East Asia Command to defeat the Japanese Army in Burma and capture Rangoon; thereafter to open the Straits of Malacca and to capture Singapore. After the Chiefs of Staffs’ promise to give us the necessary transport aircraft, on the 5th February I received a directive from the Supreme Allied Commander ordering me to “seoure the Ledo/Burma Road, capture Rangoon by ist June, 1945, and destroy the main Japanese forces in Burma excluding the Tenasserim.” In furtherance of the second half of his directive from the Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mountbatten decided to capture the island of Phuket, as an air base and a station for the assembly of naval landing craft, with a target date in June 1945. This proposal was put up to the Chiefs of Staff on the 26th February, and received their general approval on the 2nd March.",
