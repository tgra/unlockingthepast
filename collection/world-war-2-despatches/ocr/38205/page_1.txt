The Decision.

At the Casablanca conference in mid-

January, 1943, it was decided by the Prime
Minister and President Roosevelt, assisted by
the Combined Chiefs of Staff, that after Africa
had been finally cleared of the enemy the island
of Sicily should be assaulted and captured as
a base for operations against Southern Europe
and to open the Mediterranean to the shipping
of the United Nations. I attended the confer-
ence and was designated the Commander-in-
Chief of the group of Armies entrusted with the
operation. As I was also appointed to an
identical réle in command of the operations
then proceeding in Tunisia, in which I was soon
mvolved in the day to day conduct of an intri-
cate and difficult battle situation, it was not
possible for me to take direct control immedi-
ately of the planning of the operations. A
tentative outline plan had already been pro-
duced by the Joint Planning Staff in London,
supplemented at Casablanca, and this was
given, as a basis on which to work, to the
nucleus of my future Headquarters, known for
security purposes as “‘ Force 141,’’ which
assembled at Bouzarea, near Algiers, on 12th
February, 1943. This planning staff was headed
by Major-General C. H. Gairdner, as Chief of
Genera] Staff.* The operation was given the
code name HUSKY.

Although provision had thus been early made
for the planning of the operation it was none the

less surrounded with great difficulties. The pre-
Tequisite that the whole of the North African
coastline should be cleared of the enemy meant
that the battle in Tunisia took first priority
and, until that was concluded, it would be im-
possible to know what resources would be
available for the invasion of Sicily. The
question of the date to be aimed at was also
affected. It was calculated at Casablanca that
the Tunisian campaign would be completed by
Ist May and the target date for Sicily
was provisionally fixed at the favourable moon
period in July. The Combined Chiefs of Staff
subsequently directed that an attempt should
be made to advance this date to the corres-
ponding period in June. This proved impos-
sible, owing to the need for adequate training
for the assaulting divisions and the prepara-
tion of the necessary administrative basis for
the operation, and on 15th April the Combined
Chiefs of Staff agreed that roth July should be
the target date.

Elements of the Problem.

The problems to which the main attention
could be directed in the early stages of planning
were those presented by geography and logistics
and the probable scale of enemy resistance.
The island of Sicily has been compared to ‘‘a
jagged arrowhead with the broken point to the
west.’’ The total area is about ten thousand
square miles, the greatest measurement from
east to west is one hundred and fifty miles and
the length of the coastline is about six hundred
miles In the north-eastern corner Cape
Peloro is separated from the peninsula of
Calabria by the Straits of Messina, only two
miles at their narrowest. Cape Passero, the
south-eastern corner, scene of a British naval
victory in 1718, is about fifty-five miles due
north of the island of Malta and about four
hundred mules from Benghazi. At the western
end of the island Cape Boeo (also known as
Cape Lilibeo) is about ninety miles to the north-
east of Cape Bon in Tunisia. In the straits
between Tunisia and Sicily lies Pantelleria
