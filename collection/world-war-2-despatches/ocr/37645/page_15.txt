SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 10 JULY, 10946

was about 0630 hours. The sun rose straight
over the opposite ridge, shining down the
valley, blinding artillery O.Ps. and the attack-
ing troops. It was not until o7oo hours that
the sun was sufficiently high to see clearly
eastwards. The Italians ‘‘ stood to”’ at dawn
and usually went back behind the slopes for
breakfast shortly after. The artillery concen-
trations would make it hard for them to get
their men up again. Zero at 0700 hours would
allow the attacking troops to have breakfast
and start the day reasonably administered.
During the early hours of the morning 9th and
29th Indian Infantry Brigades had concentrated
behind the lower slopes of Cameron Ridge. The
assault on Fort Dologorodoc was to be carried
out by 2 Highland Light Infantry, which
was to approach its objective from a south-
westerly direction. This attack was not to go
in until M. Sanchil and Brigs Peak had been
secured. It was calculated that these hills
would be in our hands by ogoo hours. The
exact time of the attack depended on when the
artillery supporting 4th Indian Division could
be spared to support 5th Indian Division.
By 0945 hours the situation on the 4th Indian
Division front appeared to be sufficiently satis-
factory for the order tc be given to 5th Indian
Division to attack. At this. time it was not con-
firmed that Brigs Peak and M. Sanchil.-had
been captured, but progress appeared to ‘be
satisfactory, and there was every prospect that
both M. Sanchil and Brigs Peak would be
secured shortly. :

The attack of 2 Highland Light Infantry was
stopped within 200 yards of the starting line
by severe flank fire by machine-guns in enfilade,
located on the lower eastern slopes of M.
Sanchil. By 1300 hours it was clear that 2
Highland Light Infantry could make no further
progress from this direction, and it was decided
that they should be side-stepped to their right
to approach Fort Dologorodoc from the south
instead of the south-west. This new attack
was timed for 1530 hours.

Capture of Fort Dologorodoc.

The weather on 15th and 16th March was
extremely hot, with cloud and a heavy, oppres-
sive atmosphere. The heat and radiation from
the rocks for troops awaiting in the bottom of
the valley was very trying. The lack of success
of 2 Highland Light Infantry was as much
attributable to physical exhaustion as to enemy
action, although this was severe. It was also
clear that Fort Dologorodoc was far too big an
objective for one battalion. Commander gth
Indian Infantry Brigade planned to assault
Fort Dologorodoc at dusk from the south with
two battalions: right—3/1z2 Frontier Force
Regiment; left—3/5 Mahrattas. These two
attacks were successful in capturing two sub-
features of Fort Dologorodoc, known as Pimple
and Pinnacle, by midnight. Touch with these
two battalions was lost, but Commander gth
Indian Infantry Brigade ordered 2 West Yorks
on to the col between Pimple and Pinnacle
where they arrived shortly after midnight.
Before first light the eremy from the Fort itself
counter-attacked strongly, but met the whole
of the gth Indian Infantry Brigade in line. The
plan thad been for 2 West Yorks to go through
3/12 Frontier Force and 3/5 Mahrattas and
assault the Fort under cover of a timed
artillery programme. In the confusion of the

3542

counter-attack, communications broke down,
and it was impossible to stop the artillery con-
centration which came down on the Fort as
planned. This, in fact, was most fortunate, as
the enemy’s counter-attacking forces found
themselves between the small arms fire of 9th
Indian Infantry Brigade and the artillery fire
falling on their own fort behind. They broke
and were pursued into the Fort’ by gth Indian
Infantry Brigade, 2 West Yorks reaching ‘there
‘at o600 hours, immediately exploiting 800 yards
beyond.

Situation on 4th Indian Division Front.

By this time the true facts of the 4th Indian
Division right attack became clear. 2 Camerons
had reached their objectives but had suffered
such heavy casualties that they had not suffi-
cient remaining stréngth to clear the enemy off
M. Sanchil and Brigs Peak. The 1 Royal
Fusiliers, sent forward to reinforce 2 Camerons,
also reached the objective, but could not clear
the enemy off, end by nightfall, confused fight-
ing was still in progress. 1/6 Rajputana
Rifles secured the Hogs Back, losing 50 per
cent. of their strength, but succeeded in main-
taining their grip, and repulsing the enemy
counter-attacks with heavy loss. Two com-
panies 4/6 Rajputana Rifles were sent forward
to reinforce 1/6 Rajputana Rifles. 2/5
Mahratta Light Infantry gallantly carried Flat
Top Hill, and succeeded in consolidating, but
this battalion was alsc so reduced in numbers
that it could not exploit to Mole Hill. It was
decided that no useful purpose would now be
served in doing so. .

In the 4th Divisional left attack, 4/11 Sikhs
captured the left bump of M. Samanna, but
although making repeated attempts failed to
gain the centre bump, which was held by a
battalion of Alpini. On 16th March 4/6
Rajputana Rifles less two Companies attacked
Brigs Peak, but was unable to make any pro-
gress beyond that already achieved. Confused
fighting continued throughout the day, the
enemy, who consisted of Bersaglieri and the
Savoy Grenadiers, fighting determinedly, were
holding positions under the rocks which were
practically immune from shell fire. During the
evening, a report was received that Brigs Peak
was captured, and that only a few enemy re-
mained on M. Sanchil. On receipt of this
information, roth Indian Infantry Brigade,
which was being held as force reserve, was put
under command 4th Indian Division and sent
to Cameron Ridge in order to move over the
col separating M. Sanchil and Brigs Peak; and
exploit into the plain west of Keren. Unfor-
tunately this report was premature. ‘The lead-
ing battalions of this brigade were committed
during the night to attacks on M. Sanchil and
Brigs Peak. 3/18 Garhwal Rifles in particular
suffered heavy loss. The Commanding Officer
and all other British officers except one became
casualties. The enemy still held ground from
which he could direct effective machine-gun and
mortar fire against advancing troops.

Withdrawal from M. Sanchil and Brigs Peak.
By the evening ‘of 17th March it was clear
that the much reduced forward elements still on
M. Sanchil and Brigs Peak could not be main-
tained. They were suffering heavy casualties.
The intervention of the only remaining ba‘-
talion ‘of roth Indian Infantry Brigade, the
