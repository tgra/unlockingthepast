SUPPLEMENT to tue LONDON GAZETTE, 29 JANUARY, 1948

(6) or (c) seemed most probable in view of the
short distance across, the easy support by
artillery and mortars and the possible com-
bination with Wang Ching Wei factions and
others in the congested area of the town. The
number of derelict craft in the area of (a)
lessened the likelihood of attack there.

Any attack from the mainland might well be
in combination with an attack on the South
shore. My available reserves were: —

(a) 2 Royal Scots, after relief and move
from North East sector to the Wanchai Gap-
Futer Beds area, but temporanly unfit until
they could be thoroughly rested and re-
organised.

(1) Two companies 5/7 Rajput Regt.
North East sector. : .

(in) One company Winnipeg Grenadiers in
South West sector.

(iv) Two companies 2/14 Punjab Regt. in
‘North West sector.

(v) ‘'Z”’ Coy, 1 Middlesex Regt. includ-
ing one mobile machine gun platoon.

39. 4.A.—In the early afternoon 13th
December our A.A. guns brought down a large
seaplane which crashed into the sea about
3000 yards West of Lamma (confirmed later by
the Japanese).

40 During the day the enemy artillery fire
increased in intensity (up to 9-1n. calibre), one
g.2-in. gun at Mount Davis was knocked out
by a direct hit, and at dusk Belchers Fort was
heavily shelled and set on fire, Other serious
fires were started at West Point and Kennedy
Town.

Fifth columnists* had been active during the
day and a large number of army transport
drivers deserted, some of them taking their
lorriés with them. Police dealt with these in
due course The civilan population showed
signs of strain, and food queues in some districts
became disorderly The question of rice distri-
bution presented a grave problem in the over-
crowded quarters.

41. At 0200 hours 14th December great
anxiety was caused by the speed of the fires at
Belchers and Kennedy Town. The civil fire
brigades had been fighting the fires for many
hours and asked for military assistance. At
various times three parties were accordingly
sent but on each occasion were retumed with-
out any work having been performed on
‘demolitions (a detailed series of ‘‘ fire lanes ”’
had been worked out and calculations com-
pleted before the war broke out). On the
fourth occasion, however, some houses were
blown down, Fires were under control by mid-
day Elements of the civil population made
these disasters an occasion for disorderly con-
duct; fifth columnists became more active and
great care was necessary in checking telephone
calls. The civil police found difficulty i in main-
taining guards over vulnerable points, and
negotiated with the Chungking Government
secret societies for assistance.

‘42. Certain movements of enemy warships
were observed during the day (14th December),
steaming on far distant courses.

43. (a) There was a marked increase in the
intensity and accuracy of hostile shelling on the

14th December, Two 4.7-1n. guns at Belchers
had been hit and put out of action, and one
g.24in. at Mount Davis had its communications
cut for two hours, Also at Mount Davis, one
3-n. A.A. gun was hit and permanently dis-
abled, causing about 30 per cent. casualties to
the A.A. personnel. Many Chinese gunners
deserted as a result.

(b) Pak Sha ‘Wan Battery (Chinese volun-
teers) came in for particular attention, being
both shelled and mortared. Its Battery Com-
mand Post and all internal communications
were destroyed and the Battery Commander was
wounded and evacuated. The guns were re-
duced to independent autosight control. At
this juncture owing to an imperfectly conveyed
message and an error of judgment of the junior
officer left in acting command, the personnel
were given the option of going to Stanley. All
but two Chinese left; seventeen British and
Portuguese stayed. A few regular SBritish
gunners were later sent up as reinforcements.

(c) A very heavy concentration on Magazine
Gap cut eight main cables involving 195
circuits, severmg ‘communications between
Fortress Headquarters and all terminals to the
South of that Gap. Within zo hours the Royal
Corps of Signals, working magnificently, re-
stored all lines

44. Csuil Population —The civil police found
their hands more than full in maintaining order
in the city but had the situation generally under
control except in the A R.P. tunnels, where in
certain cases armed gangs of robbers were

operating. Pamphlets were dropped by the
Japanese
45. H.M.S. ‘Thracian’ carried out

an excellent operation during the night
(15/r6th December) making her way past
Green Island, across the Japanese front on the
Kowloon Peninsula, and then sinking two ferry
boats at anchor full of enemy troops one
thousand yards East of the Electric Power
Station, Kowloon. |

46. ‘By now the new organisation of the island
defences had been carried out viz.: division
into two brigade areas—East Infantry Brigade
(Brigadier Wallis) and West Infantry .Brigade
(Brigadier J. K. Lawson). The North-South
dividing line approximated closely to the former
dividing line between the easterly and westerly
island sectors. At the northern extremity, how-
ever, it was placed further East to increase the
front held by the 2/14 Punjab Regt. now con-
sidered a safer sector owing to the ‘‘ anti-boat
fence ’’ or boom which was in position from
Sheung Wan to Green Island, The continuation
towards Kellett Island had been prevented by
the desertion of Chinese crews and there had
been no opportunity of carrying the complete
scheme through, i.e , a third portion constructed
across to Kowloon Point.,

1 Middlesex Regt. ey given a ‘Shall but iin-
portant sector based” on Leighton Hill Ridge-
Causeway Bay area, No’préparations, however,
had been possible on the Ridge before hostilities,
except a little wiring and thrée shell-slits, as
the property was Government owned and
housed many Government officials who could
not be dispossessed or inconvenienced before
the ‘‘ precautionary period ’’ of the Defence
Scheme (which actually was never declared
owing to the rapid development of full war
conditions).
