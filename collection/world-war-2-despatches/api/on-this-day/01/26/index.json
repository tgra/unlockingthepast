            "description": "After talking the matter over, General Ritchie and I agreed that Rommel had almost certainly intended in the first place to make only a limited advance and was now skilfully exploiting an entirely unexpected success. There was time even now to arrest his advance and repel him. General Ritchie then took the 4th Indian Division under his direct command and countermanded the orders of the 13th Corps for a general withdrawal in the early hours of 26th January. After ways and means of taking the offensive had  been considered, it was decided that the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade from the west and the rst Armoured Division with the rith Indian Infantry Brigade from the north should converge on Msus where the main body of the enemy lay. It was reported that the and Armoured Brigade would not be ready to undertake the operation until late on the 28th or early on the 2gth. Until then the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade was to delay the enemy advance with mobile columns."

Repeated attempts made throughout the day to force the block and open the road were unsuccessful. Here again as elsewhere the exhaustion of the troops after several days and nights continuous operations in conditions to which they were not acclimatized told its tale. ug 12 the meantime, the Commander rz Indian Division had  organized a mechanized column, including armoured cars and carriers, at Benut and ordered it forward to the relief of the Batu Pahat Force. Many road blocks and ambushes were encountered and the column was broken up into small parties-each fighting on its own. Only one c&trier, that of  the column commander, eventually got through."

All available aircraft, including the torpedobombers, were used for daily East and West Coast reconnaissances, for reconnaissance of the roads behind the enemy lines and for attacks on enemy aerodromes and troop concentrations. These attacks, however, were so weak that comparatively little damage could be done. By the 26th January our Air Striking Force in Malaya had, as recorded in Section XXXVIII, to all intents and purposes ceased to exist. A few attacks were made late in January on enemy aerodromes by Blenheims from Sumatra and Flying Fortresses from Java, but they were not heavy enough to affect the scale of the Japanese air effort. ;"

At 0745 hours on the 26th January our air reconnaissances reported two transports and some smaller craft escorted by two cruisers and twelve destroyers closing the shore at Endau. This convoy was twice attacked during the day by Hudson, Albacores and Vickers Vildebeeste aircraft escorted by Hurricanes and Buffalos. Each time a large force of Japanese Navy Zero fighters operating from Kuantan was met and there was much air fighting. A minimum of 13 enemy fighters were destroyed while we lost 1 Vickers Vildebeeste, 2 Hurricanes and 1 Buffalo. Both enemy transports were hit, but the landing was not prevented. Our Air Striking Force in Malaya, even such as it was, had now vanished. On the night 26th/27th January H.M. Australian destroyer   Vampire   and H.M.S.   Thanet   were sent to sweep up the coast and attack the Japanese transports. Off Endau they fell in with and engaged three destroyers and a eruiser. The  Thanet ? was sunk and a Japanese destroyer severely damaged."

            "description": "roth Infantry Brigade and the mechanized column which had been sent from Aicota to cut off the Keru garrison, once 4th Indian Division had passed on towards Agordat, were collected about three miles south of Biscia. It could either be moved back through Aicota and thence east along the strada to assist 29th Indian Infantry Brigade advancing on Barentu from west; or, if a way could be found, directed south-east across country to cut the Barentu Agordat road. This would allow an attack to be developed against Barentu simuk taneously from north and west. The only available maps gave no clue. A route was found starting approximately two miles east of Biscia railway station, which, after running across country in a south-easterly direction, struck the Barentu Agordat road near Terchina, 25 kilos north of Barentu. During the period while this track was being made by the sappers, some of the transport of roth Indian Infantry Brigade was lent to 4th Indian Division to assist, 11th Indian Infantry Brigade forward towards Agordat. 11th Indian Infantry Brigade was directed to cut across the Agordat Barentu road south of Agordat as early as possible on 26th January."

The enemy force in the Walkait, finding that their line of retreat through Barentu was likely to be cut, were directed acrosscountry on to Tole. Up to this time there was no information that a road or track practicable for M.T. existed, leading eastwards from Barentu towards the escarpment at Arresa, and it was not until late in the action against Barentu that ground reconnaissance behind the enemy position discovered this route, by which the enemy eventually attempted to escape."
