After dumping had been finished, it was not possible to rely on the trans- port echelons being reorganised before the 11th November in readiness for the advance. Nor was it possible to complete the training of the 22nd Anmoured Brigade, which disembarked early in October, and that of the Armoured Corps. Headquarters before that date. At the Commanders\u2019-in-Chief Conference held on the 3rd October, therefore, 11th November was fixed as the date for the offensive to. begin. Unavoidable delays arose, however, in provid- ing the full quota of transport for the 1st South African Division, and Major-General Brink found it impossible to complete its training by that date. The opening of the offensive was finally deferred until 18th November"

            "description": "In the meantime two mobile columns, con- sisting of rz Hussars and the Royals, with supporting arms, under command of 7 Armoured Division, were directed on Msus across the desert. By the evening of 16th November they had reported Mechili clear and were operating within forty miles of Msus. Rain now began to fall again and it took the two columns twenty-four hours to struggle through sixty miles of waterlogged ground to the escarpment which \u2018the enemy rearguard was holding to cover the evacuation of Benghazi. On 18th November they engaged the rearguard at Sceleidima and Antelat, the two main passes in the escarpment, but were unable to force their way past. During the night the enemy withdrew and the advance of the two columns was again delayed by bad going. On the zoth xr Hussars entered Benghazi* and found the town and neighbour- hood clear of enemy, and it was not until mid- day of the 21st that the Royals made touch with the enemy rearguard again at Agedabia. The admunistrative position was now becoming easier and the vanguard of 22 Armoured Brigade, having raced across two hundred and sixty miles of desert, at once began to turn the enemy\u2019s flank. Thus threatened he lost no time in abandoning Agedabia. The road southwards was heavily mined and the advance was much impeded; but by 25th November patrols were in contact with the next enemy position at Agheila. The whole of Cyrenaica was now in our hands."

            "description": "The decision to make a dash for Tunis, though bold, was undoubtedly correct. The advance was pressed by land, sea and air; Bougie was occupied by 11th November, Bone on 12th November, by a British parachute battalion, and by 18th November our advanced forces were operating east of:Gebel Abiud on the coast road and B\u00e9ja on the inland road, about sixty miles from Bizerta and Tunis re- spectively. At both points we were in contact with German troops. These had begun to arrive, in the first place by air, on oth November, meeting no resistance from the French authorities in Tunisia. On 15th November a United States parachute battalion occupied Youks Les Bains and Tebessa, in south-eastern iAlgeria, and co-operated with the French detachments at Gafsa in southern Tunisia. Between 17th November and 25th December two main attempts were made to capture Tunis. The first succeeded in ad- vancing, on 28th November, as far as Djedeida, on the road between Tunis and Bizerta and only twelve miles from the former. At this point the enemy counter-attacked strongly with tanks and dive-bombers; the latter were able to operate from good airfieldss only a short distance in rear and our own air forces were ungble to give cover, since the rain had put all their temporary landing grounds out of action. Our forces on the inland road were therefore obliged to withdraw to Medjez el Bab. This town, as its name \u2018\u2018 the Ford of the Pass \u201d shows, is of great strategic importance. It lies"

The high ground dominating the Mignano Gap was to be captured in sections, first that to the south, and then that to the north; in Phase I, that is to say, Monte Camino, Monte La Difensa and Monte Maggiore were to be captured and in Phase II Monte Sammucro, combined with an attack westwards along the Colli\u2014Atina road; Phase III, the main advance into the Liri valley, was only to be initiated on Army orders after the completion of the first two phases. Of the three British and six United States divisions in Fifth Army at the beginning of the period, two, 7 Armoured and 82 Airborne, (less one Regimental Combat Team) were being withdrawn to the United Kingdom. 1 United States Armoured Division began arriving at Naples and x Special Service Force, six battalions of specially trained mixed American and Canadian troops, also came: under command.* 2 Moroccan Division was due to arrive in the first week of December. II Corps Headquarters arrived from Sicily in October and took over command of the centre of the line with 3 and 36 Divisions on 18th November; VI Corps now commanded on the extreme right with 34 and 45 Divisions. 1 Armoured Division remained in Army reserve; it was not expected that it would be used until the Liri valley was reached, when it would debouch through IT Corps. The Germans had also been reinforcing; 2g Panzer Grenadier Division came in from reserve and 44 Infantry Division, an Austrian formation, from Slovenia. 5 Mountain Division arrived from Russia in December."

Another Directive which I received about this time (18th November) informed me that the British Chiefs of Staff had ordered that the Cocos Islands, lying midway between Ceylon and Australia and some 1,500 miles from each, were to be developed early in 1945 as an air staging point for heavy aircraft in transit. I was called on to provide for the land defence of these islands, in consultation with the Naval and Air Commanders-in-Chief ; the target date given for the completion of the development of the islands being the Ist June, 1945."

In addition to Teconnoitring routes east of this place, 19 Indian Division was given the task of discover- ing whether the roads from Pinlebu southwards could be opened for a further overland advance. By this means, coupled with the operations of 33 Corps, the possibility of com- pleting Phase IL of Capital without airborne operations was to be investigated. The two leading brigades of 19 Indian Division began to cross the Chindwin at Sittaung and Thaung- dut in the third week of November and, by the end of the month, had occupied Nanbon and Paungbyin against minor opposition."
