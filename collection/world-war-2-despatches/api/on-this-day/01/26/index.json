There was time even now to arrest his advance and repel him. General Ritchie then took the 4th Indian Division under his direct command and countermanded the orders of the 13th Corps for a general withdrawal in the early hours of 26th January. After ways and means of taking the offensive had  been considered, it was decided that the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade from the west and the rst Armoured Division with the rith Indian Infantry Brigade from the north should converge on Msus where the main body of the enemy lay. It was reported that the and Armoured Brigade would not be ready to undertake the operation until late on the 28th or early on the 2gth. Until then the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade was to delay the enemy advance with mobile columns.",

These attacks, however, were so weak that comparatively little damage could be done.

A route was found starting approximately two miles east of Biscia railway station, which, after running across country in a south-easterly direction, struck the Barentu Agordat road near Terchina, 25 kilos north of Barentu.

It gave me an Army Group reserve under my hand, for the first time, with which to influence the battle; as the events of the following May were to show, operations in the Liri valley and from Anzio must be treated as an Army Group battle.

            "description": "had not got a sufficiency of transport aircraft. I continued to press the point, and finally, early in January, the Supreme Allied Commander sent his Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General F. A. M. (later Sir Frederick) Browning back to the United Kingdom to put the case personally before the Chiefs of Staff, and point out how great was the prize at stake. This had the desired effect, as on the 26th January, the Supreme Allied Commander received a signal saying that the transport aircraft would not only be made up but increased. Besides the two Combat Cargo squadrons which it had already been agreed would be returned from China by the Ist February, two R.A.F, Dakota squadrons would be made available, one being on loan, from ist March. In addition, it was proposed to raise the aircraft establishment of ali R.A.F. transport squadrons in the theatre. Thus, by March, our estimated essential requirencats in air-lift were going to be met in",

I found the situation better than I had expected and, after discussing the situation with the G.O.C. I reported to the Chiefs of Staff that I did not consider the situation immediately serious, provided that the reinforce_ment of Burma with land and air forces proceeded without delay, and that some naval force was provided to prevent a landing near Rangoon from the Tenasserim coast. I had already on roth January authorised General Hutton to accept any Chinese troops available. It may be remarked that those I -had originally accepted on 22nd December, the 93 and 49 Divisions, had not by this date yet reached Burma.",
