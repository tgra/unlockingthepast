materially improve until my Headquarters set
up again at Versailles, by which time an almost
static situation had again developed.

489. Signals facilities just adequate to service
a static headquarters and provide links with its
more stationary units cannot be adequate when
that headquarters and its units begin to move.
Because these moves must be carried out by
splitting into two parties, the facilities required
will be almost dowble those needed before. In
other words, equipment and operators will be
needed at two places instead of at one only.

490. This factor, which raises difficult prob-
lems of supply, training and administration for
the signals service, has none the less to be
reckoned with, and the problem it represents
solved, if proper direction of operations is to be
gelpiined in conditions of highly mobile war-

re.

491. Some mitigation of the task of signals
personnel in tackling these problems would
result if the moves of main headquarters par-
ticularly were delayed longer than has been the
practice in these operations, and certainly not
made until the communications are suitable for
operational needs. While it is important to keep
eperational headquarters close to the forward
units, this factor must be more carefully related
to the practicability of providing adequate sig-
nals facilities at the new location of the head-
quarters. Continuity of service is of overriding
importance in air and combined operations.

Part V.—SomME BRIEF REFLECTIONS ON THE
CAMPAIGN

492. The extensive air operations which are
the subject of this Despatch cannot be summed
up in a few paragraphs, nor, without entering
fields of controversy, is it possible to discuss all
the air lessons which have emerged during the
campaign. What can be done, ‘however, is to
state, and where useful, to discuss briefly, cer-
tain of the more prominent issues which can
be discerned in the pattern of air operations seen
as a whole. Experience gained in subsequent
operations in this and in other theatres may
confirm these impressions, or, on the other
hand, make their revision necessary.

Preparatory Air Operations

493. Events thoroughly justified our strategic
bombing policy and your insistence upon an
adequate preparatory period of air operations
for Operation ‘‘ Neptune.’’ As it turned out,
weather conditions allowed only a partial use
of our air forces in the weeks following the
assault, and had these preliminary operations
not ‘been started before D-Day the task of the
air forces of interfering effectively with the
enemy’s movement within and to the battle area
could not have been achieved in time to have
directly influenced the land operations in the
initlal phases. As it was, and in accordance
with the plan, the air had, by the day of the
assault, completely disorganised the enemy’s
dense and complex network of rail lines of
communications within France and Belgium.
This having virtually been accomplished by
D-Day, it was soon possible to seal off the
batile area through air action, and in this way
the area was prepared for the employment of
ground forces, with the enemy af a critical dis.
advantage. :

494. During the initial planning and prelimin-
ary operations some doubt—based on experi-
ence in other theatres—was expressed as ‘to the
efficacy of air action on bridges. Results of the
initial attacks in France soon proved that given
suitable technique, types of aircraft, and
weapons, bridges can successfully be destroyed
or rendered impassable, although the cost may
be a heavy one in aircraft and personnel due to
flak, and also in bombs expended. Weather
may, however, frequently preclude attacks as
and when planned. To have relied entirely upon
the destruction of bridges as the main method
of achieving the disorganisation of the enemy’s
communications system at the appropriate
moment in Operation ‘‘ Overlord,’’ would again
have proved unsound in the given conditions.
The attacks on bridges formed but an integral
part, albeit an important one, of the whole
plan of action against the movement organisa-
tion of the enemy.

Diversionary Operations

495. Our efforts to mislead the enemy proved
most effective, but their implementation, though
they provided excellent operational training for
orews, placed a great strain upon our air
resources. In general, for every target attacked
in the assault area, two had to be taken on
outside that zone. Although “‘ Crossbow ”’
operations were taken into account in the fram-
ing of the programme, the diversion of effort
from ‘‘ Pointblank,’’ nication targets,
and other objectives of diatepic importance,
was very considerable. On the other hand,
despite the fact that this great effort was
directed against targets having little direct
material effect on the achievement of the mili-
‘tary object of securing the initial bridgehead, it
is reasonable to deduce that these operations
must at least have been a factor influencing the
German High Command to dispose their re-
serves in the Pas de Calais area as a central
position against possible landings in that area
and/or any part of the long coastline from
Denmark to Brest. This was obviously most
advantageous to ourselves especially as our air
offensive against his communications rendered
movement of these reserves a lengthy and
hazardous operation, particularly over con-
siderable distances.

496. A high cost may have to be paid for
diversionary activities of this kind, if they are
to be realistic, and this fact must always be
borne in mind when estimating the strength
of the air forces required for combined
operations.

Inter-Service Fire Plan

497. The drawing up of the fire plan for the
assault phase was rightly regarded as an inter-
Service and inter-Allied responsibility.
Throughout such planning care must be taken
to ensure flexibility, and it must be accepted
by the Air Forces that it may not be possible
finally to fix the air tasks until a very short
time before D-Day—owing to such factors as
changes in information, changes in weather
conditions (including likely height of cloud
bases), the development of enemy beach
defences and gun positions and changes in
conditions of light for air and naval bombard.
ment and for fire by assault craft of various
types. Moreover, an alternative Fire Plan is
essential. There is a tendency oa the part of
the other Services to expect too much of the
