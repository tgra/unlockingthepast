            "description": "Before we could approach the task of throwing the enemy out of E] Agheila, however, we were obliged to wait for reserves to be accumulated and the administrative situation to improve, so that we might concentrate sufficient troops for this difficult undertaking. Until that time came, which I judged would be about the middle of February, we must content ourselves with leaving only light forces to watch the enemy. It seemed highly unlikely that he would be in a position to attack us before then, but the Eighth Army and the 13th Corps issued instructions against this contingency. On the 21st January the improbable occurred, and without warning the Axis forces began to advance.",

The attack was launched at 0530 hours on the 21st January, having been postponed for one day owing tosevere sandstorms. gth Australian Brigade followed the 16th through the gap at 0830 hours. The fire of our artillery was heavy and accurate, and the enemy opposition was not great. Both brigades were established on their objectives by twelve noon with small loss. Armoured carriers of the Divisional Cavalry Regiment reached a point on the edge of the escarpment 3,000 yatds above Tobruk early in the afternoon, but were compelled to withdraw owing to accurate fire from the enemy coast defence and anti-aircraft guns at Tobruk. Determined opposition was encountered about Palastrino, a point in the middle of the perimeter 9,000 yards South-West of Tobruk. Elsewhere successful exploitation carried the advance to the edge of the escarpment overlooking the town. And by nightfall the Western and South-Westem portion of the perimeter, amounting to about one-third of the whole, was in our hands,",

This brigade was moved to the Port Sudan-Gebeit area. The remaining parts of the force were due to arrive by sea on 7th, 14th and 21st January. The part moved by Nile Valley route, consisting of the 5th Indian Infantry Brigade Group and the Divisional Cavalry Regiment, plus otner nits, was due to arrive at Wadi Halfa over a period of five weeks from about 3oth December. For its success the attack needed a waning moon and gth February was provisionally fixed. It will therefore be ‘seen that there was very little time between the arrival of the last units of Force Emily and the attack. This was compensated for by the fact that the units of Force Emily were all seasoned troops and had had active service experience,",

It was difficult to get accurate estimates of what water was available, but, after consultation with the Royal Navy, it was considered feasible to direct a force of approximately one brigade group from Port Sudan via Suakin—Karora—Nakfa—Cub Cub and on to Keren from the north.",

Gazelle Force were charged irom the flank by a party of about sixty enemy cavalry. They pressed home their attack with gailantry, throwing bombs at our troops, and were only stopped 25 yards from the gun positions by the guns firing point-blank, and by fire from L.M.Gs., rifles, and even anti-tank rifles. An attack by an enemy battalion from Keru was repulsed by Skinner’s Horse. Throughout the day there was considerable enemy air activity though no great damage was done. Signal communication was very difficult, the wireless being variable owing to the proximity of the hills, atmospherics and distortion. By the evening, 3/14 Punjab and 32 Field Regiment had arrived at Sabdarat. 5th Infantry Brigade, less 4/6 Rajputana Rifles, all its carriers and much of its M.T., had arrived at Kassala and was there joined by a detachment of four “I ”’ tanks. 3/14 Punjab Regiment were unfortunate in being the only unit to suffer casualties from enemy air action, during the concentration period. The train in which they were travelling was bombed south of Derudeb, one British Officer and 23 O.Rs. were killed, two British Officers and 20 O.Rs. wounded.",

Initially, it was planned to lay mines during the hours of darkness in the shipping Janes of Northern Sumatra and Northern Malaya, and 160 Squadron (Liberators Mk.V.) underwent an intensive period of training in long range flying and the technique of minelaying to implement these plans. They commenced these operations on 21st January, 1945 and continued until 24th May—a period of 124 days during which 196 sorties were flown. After operational experience had been gained, the mining commitments were increased to include drops in the areas of Sonchkla, Chumborn, Port Swettenham and _ Singapore. Mine-laying operations were discontinued after 24th May, 1945, because the stage was then being finally set for Operation “ Zipper”, and to have continued mine-laying beyond that date might have had serious repercussions when Allied landings took place on the west coast of Malaya.",
