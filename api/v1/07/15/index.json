The principal engagement took place at Moyale, where a company of the King’s African Rifles held the small fort on the British side of the frontier for several: weeks against an Italian force which amounted to about a brigade. It was not until a second Italian brigade was brought up that it was decided to withdraw the Company, which was successfully done on 15th July, although the enemy had by this time practically surrounded the post.",

By the 15th July I was using a tofal of thirteen single-engined and nine twin-engined (Mosquito) squadrons against flying bombs. Six of the Mosquito squadrons alternated between this work and operations over the lodgment area, two of them doing bomber-suppért work as well. I found that, while some pilots took readily to the work of shooting down flying bombs, the majority preferred shooting down enemy aircraft over France. To instil enthusiasm for the novel and impersonal business of shooting at pilotless missiles, and ensure that pilots were not kept long enough at the task to make them stale, was not the least of my anxieties.",

At this meeting terms of surrender were discussed and settled. Our troops entered Debra Tabor on 3rd July and took over all important installations. The enemy garrison marched out on 6th July, and, after receiving the honours of war, laid down their arms. Patriots occupied the forts and native quarters. Prisoners captured were 2,400 Halians, 2,000 natives and a miscellaneous collection of M.T., sufficient to lift x,200 men. Six guns and a quantity of ammunition were also taken. The surrender of Debra Tabor was strange, considering the Italian Commander at Gondar intended to relieve this garrison on 15th July.",

This directive was still in force, but priority had now been shifted to the operation against Taranto, Nevertheless, the great prize of the capture of Naples still glittered; it would give us control of an area capable of maintaining any Allied force which could be placed in Italy in 1943, it would establish our armies well on the road to Rome and it would oblige the Germans to withdraw not only from Calabria but probably from Apulia as well. But if the required conditions were unfulfilled there were weighty arguments against an assault landing in so well defended an area; in particular the lack of air cover and the time which must elapse before our troops advancing from Calabria could make contact. We were likely to capture Cotrone, from which we could cover operations against Taranto, sooner than Scalea, the first place from which we could cover Naples; exploitation overland from Cotrone to Taranto would be much easier than from Scalea to Naples; for the present the priority of the Taranto operations must stand.",
