            "description": "is a centre of communications and the best operational base for the attack on the  Gothic \"  line. We planned, if possible, to capture the city by an outflanking movement on both sides of it, with our.main strength on the west. The Germans were making promises to treat it as an open city but by this they appeared to mean that, while using its communication facilities themselves, they expected us to refrain from doing so when we should capture it; at any rate they had concentrated large forces immediately south of the city. From Figline on the upper Arno to Montelupo west of the city four and a half divisions, strong in artillery and heavy tanks, now confronted 13 Corps, with three and a half divisions forward. The German formations included 4 Parachute, 29 Panzer Grenadier and part of 3 Panzer Grenadier Divisions. 13 Corps decided to concentrate the New Zealanders on a narrow front west of Route 2 and break through the   Paula  line by capturing the ridge of Pian  dei Cerri, which runs roughly east and west from the main road three miles south of Florence to the Arno opposite Signa, exploiting to the river west of Florence. East of the road the South Africans would make diversionary attacks and 4 Division would protect the Corps  right flank. The attack went in on 30th July and fierce fighting continued until the late evening of 2nd August, when the New Zealanders captured the crest of La Poggiona, at the eastern end of the enemy's ridge position. This was the turning point of the battle; the roads now led downhill into Florence and the enemy began to withdraw ack across the Arno. They fought a stiff rearguard action on the River Ema which crosses Route 2 some two miles south of the Arno and on the night of 3rd August disengaged again over the Arno."
