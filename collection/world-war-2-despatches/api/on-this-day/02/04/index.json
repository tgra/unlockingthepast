            "description": "deal of detailed planning was done to prepare for this but in the event the plan turned out to be unneccesary and was. cancelled on 4th February, 1945. The main reason was the failure to capture Bologna, which meant that we continued to keep the enemy in Italy still stretched to the maximum extent. A further reason was the withdrawal, in early 1945, of the whole of the Canadian Corps to join the Canadians on the Western front and the diversion to the West of 5 Division which was intended to return to my command from the Middle East. It is interesting to speculate on what the results might have been if the plan had been carried into effect. The terrain of Dalmatia is rugged and unpromising for operations and the maintenance of the force would have met serious difficulties. On the other hand the relatively weak and inexperienced German troops would probably have offered only an ineffectual resistance to six veteran divisions of Eighth Army, assisted by strongly reinforced Partisan formations, and an entry into Austria might have been possible before the general capitulation. But the conditions which would have rendered operations in Jugoslavia possible and profitable failed to eventuate; the Germans continued to hold their extended line in the mountains and it was neither necessary nor practical for us to open a new front on which to contain them.",

            "description": "20. During January the Spitfire squadrons: gained valuable experience in air fighting and tactics that was to stand them in good stead: in the greater battles to come. The enemy continued to send fighter sweeps over the Arakan, but Spitfires were able to inflict casualties upon them in the ratio of eight to one. By this time two squadrons of Spitfire VdIIs (Nos. 81 and 152) had arrived from Middle East, and I now had at my disposal in the forward areas of Bengal four squadrons of Spitfires and nine of Hurricanes for fighter operations; the stage was thus set for the opening of the battle in Arakan on the 4th February. Anticipating our own ground offensive by four days the enemy launched an attack with the object of annihilating the Sth and 7th Indian Divisions and pressing on to capture Chittagong. This ambitious plan was attended by the most impressive measure of air support. afforded by him in this theatre, sweeps by formations of fifty plus aircraft being reported daily. The objects of the J.A.F. appear to have been firstly to intercept our aircraft engaged on close support, secondly to increase the morale of his own troops and thirdly to give some measure of ground support by attacks on our positions and forward bases. As the battle developed, one other task assumed overtiding priority for the enemy air forces. The 7th Indian Division, cut off from its supply bases, was being supplied wholly by air. It was of vital importance to the enemy that our supply-dropping aircraft should not succeed in this task, but the air superiority which we had established, the provision of standing patrols.  particularly in the Kaladan Valley where, owing to the intervening hills, no radar cover below 10,000 feet was available and resort tosupply dropping by night enabled transport. aircraft to maintain the beleaguered forces for the loss of only one Dakota (C.47) to enemy fighters.",

The land communications of 7th Indian Division were soon cut and those of 5th Indian Division im danger, and it was only by supply dropping that the encircled forces could be expected to stand their ground and turn a potential catastrophe into a decisive victory. Japanese preparations for an offensive had been observed, however, and the possibility of encirclement envisaged, so that when supply by air was called for on 8th February, there was no delay.",
