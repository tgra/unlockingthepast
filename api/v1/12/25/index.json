            "description": "The Japanese floated troops down the Perak River by night, and on the 2and December the rath Indian Infantry Brigade was forced back South of Kuala Kangsar, The, 28th Indian Infantry Brigade was also pressed in the same direction, small detachments only being left North of Kuala Kangsar and West of the Perak River. Bridges were destroyed as the troops retired. While this was taking place on the Perak front, the Kelantan withdrawal was also continuing, the 8th Indian Infantry Brigade retiring South of Kuala Krai along the railroad. A problem similar to that of Krohco] and the r1th Division referred to above (see para. 115) now arose in regard to 8th Indian Infantry Brigade and the main body of III Corps in Perak, and, to a lesser degree, in regard to the force at Kuantan and the 8th Indian Infantry Brigade. {It was therefore decided to withdraw this 8th Brigade much further South into Central Malaya, and it took-up completely new positions in the Kuala Lipis-Raub area. A small party known as \u2018\u2018 Macforce \u2019\u2019 was left with an armoured train at Dabong to withdraw down the railway, demolishing it as they went. The Kuantan force was ordered to prepare to withdraw Westwards at short notice. On the 23rd December all our fighters on the mainland were withdrawn to Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Port Swettenham being kept as advanced landing grounds. The enemy was also occupy- ing various points down the East coast of Malaya, and had proceeded from Kuala Treng- ganu to Dungun. By the 25th December it would be true to say that something like one- half of Malaya had passed from our control."

            "description": "\u2018Cameron (protecting the South of Victoria), which had been heavily bombarded by the Japanese, and the Middlesex Regiment beat off an attack on Leighton Hill. The enemy, how- ever, penetrated through the A.R.P..tunnels and street fighting began at Wanchai. The con- duct of the civil population, which had thus far suffered some 4,000 casualties (1,000 killed), was, however, good and had become increas- ingly so since, the first depression after the evacuation of the mainland. On the same day the forces isolated in the - South of the Island made an effort to counter- attack towards Stanley Mound, but to no avail. On the 24th December the Royal Scots, fol- lowing heavy enemy attacks, were driven off the top of Mount Cameron, and Leighton Hill was captured after bombardment. The posi- tion in the South of the Island was unchanged. On the 25th December, in the early hours of - the morning, street fighting took place as the enemy fought his way towards the centre of the town, but another Japanese demand for sur- render was refused. Two hours later, how- ever, the Governor was advised by the Military and Naval commanders that further effective resistance could not be made, and, after carry- ing out a series of demolitions, our forces were ordered to lay down their arms. The Chinese kept their word and had endeavoured to assist the defence of Hong Kong by advancing on Canton, but their force was not strong enough to produce any serious effect on the Japanese."

            "description": "frontal assault in the present unfavourable con- ditions, There was now no hope that Fifth Army could arrive within supporting distance of a landing at Anzio within the proposed time; no advantage would be gained by a landing nearer to the present front under the abrupt southern slopes of the Aurunci; I therefore began to consider the possibility of making the SHINGLE force much stronger, strong enough to hold its ground by itself, for a longer time than We had previously considered. I put up this proposal, which virtually amounted to a new plan, at a Commanders-in-Chief confer- ence in Tunis on 25th December. The Cairo conference had just broken up and it had there been decided that General Eisenhower should take over the command of the invasion of North-west Europe, to be succeeded in the Mediterranean by General Wilson. Both were present at the conference, as was also the Prime Minister who was passing through on his way back from Cairo to London. I proposed we should assault with two divisions reinforced by some armour. The conference decided that, by a readjustment of the programme for the re- pair and refitting of landing craft in England, it would be possible for sufficient to remain in the Mediterranean long enough to carry out the assault without diminishing the numbers available for the imvasion of North-west Europe.{ We also had a lucky windfall in the arrival of fifteen Landing Ships, Tank on their way home from the Indian Ocean where a proposed operation for which they were ear- marked had been cancelled. It was decided, therefore, that all preparations should be made for carrying out SHINGLE with two assault divisions on or about 2oth January. The ob- jective, as before, was to be the Alban Hills."

I had Proposed to use for this x British Infantry Division, which had been originally intended for Eighth Army. The landing craft situation was quite uncertain. I pointed out on 8th November that, on the present programme, my Armies would still be ten thousand vehicles short by xst January and that it would be impossible to mount\u2019 an amphibious operation before 25th December. If the craft were then withdrawn it would be impossible to lift as much as a division with what would remain. However, we decided to go on planning on the assumption that sufficient might be avail- able. The SEXTANT conference was due to open in Cairo on 22nd November and General Eisenhower agreed to press there for the re- tention of the landing craft which I thought Necessary."

From now to the final evacuation of the city, the working of the essen- tial services, the provision of labour to unload ships and the cessation of all business became a major problem for the Government and a serious military embarrassment. The presence \u2018on all routes leading towards India of many thousands of refugees, which soon grew to hun- \u2018dreds of thousands, was another problem that occupied both civil and military to the end of the campaign."
