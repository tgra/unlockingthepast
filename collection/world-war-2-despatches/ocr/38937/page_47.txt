SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 JUNE, 1950

grudgingly committed, again in small detach-
ments,.on 18th May. Its initial losses were
extremely heavy.

On the 18th, while the attempt was being
made to rust the “‘ Hitler ’’ line at Aquino,
the Canadian Corps on 13 Corps’ left was ad-
vancing to contact with the line. South of
the Liri the French had captured Esperia and
Sant’ Oliva and the two mountains overlooking
Pontecorvo, Monte d’Oro and Monte della
Commune. II Corps had captured Formia and
was about to enter Itri and Gaeta, both occupied
next day. The battle had become fluid, and I
took steps to increase the pressure. It was
almost near the time for the breakout from
Anzio and I therefore ordered 36 United States
Division to the bridgehead; its arrival was
spaced out over four days and we hoped it
would pass unnoticed. It was extremely diffi-
cult to decide on the exact date for the VI
Corps attack. General Truscott, the Com-
manding General, had asked for three days’
notice, rather than the twenty-four hours in
the original orders, so as to give him two nights
to get his assault troops into position; it would
have to be done by night, for by day the
enemy had too good observation. This faced
me with rather a difficult problem in prophecy,
for the breakout would have to be timed care-
fully to fit in with Eighth Anmy’s advance and
it would not be easy to forecast where they
would be in three days’ time. On the main
front Eighth Army were ordered ‘‘ to use the
utmost energy to break through the ‘ Adolf
Hitler’ line in the Liri valley before he
Germans have time to settle down in it’’. The
Poles were directed to press on to Piedimonte
to turn the line from the north and the French,
after reaching Pico, were to turn northwards,
if at all possible, and envelop the southern end.
If they could strike into the rear of the enemy
facing Eighth Army, directed on Ceprano,
we should be able to surround a good
proportion of their force.

The operation for the capture of Pico proved
to be a major one. Fearing just such a
manceuvre ‘as I had planned Kesselri
had strongly reinforced the area with his best
troops from reserve, 26 Panzer and go Panzer
Grenadier Divisions (both less large detach-
ments) and was bringing over to their assistance
the greater part of the two divisions from the
Adriatic sector.* Asa result the French made
little progress on the roth but on the 2oth cap-
tured Monte Leucic, a high and dominating
mountain between Pico and Pontecorvo. They
were driven off it by a German counter-attack
on the 2ist but recaptured it on the 2and; on
the latter date, after two days of violent and
fluctuating fighting, they finally captured Pico.
This delay meant that their thrust northwards
would now have less chance of cutting off
any important German forces, for Eighth Army

. was about to assault the ‘‘ Hitler’”’ line and

expected, once that was broken, to make fairly
rapid progress, especially on the left. II Corps,
to the south, were pushing on, entering Fondi
on the zoth and reaching Terracina ‘on the
23rd. The French were therefore ordered to
advance north-west as well as north, directed
on Castro dei Volsci and Ceprano. The main
assault would be a combination of two great
drives; by Eighth Army through the “‘ Hitler *’
*305 and 334 Infantry Divisions; they were
replaced by 278 Infantry Division from Istria.

line and up the Liri and Sacco valleys and by
VI Corps Anzio on to Valmontone.
French and II Corps were to clear up the
mountainous triangle between the two drives.

Breach of the “ Hitler’’ Line.

In spite of their losses since the attack began
and the defeat of their right wing, Tenth Army
were still determined to defend the ‘‘ Hitler ”’
line in the valley between Piedimonte and
Pontecorvo. The defences were even stronger
than in the ‘‘ Gustav ” line which had already
given Eighth Army so much trouble; they
varied’ between five hundred and a thousand
yards in depth and the main system, of re-
inforced concrete emplacements, was linked by
tunnels and communication trenches into a
mutually supporting whole. The main weak-
ness was the lack of troops to man the defences
but Kesselring had all the same ordered the
strongest resistance. Eighth Army between
zoth and 22nd May was preparing for the
assault. Following the failure of the surprise
attack on Aquino on the evening of the 18th
heavier, but still hasty, attacks had been
mounted on the rgth by 78 Division on the
right and x Canadian Division on the left;
these ran into heavy fire which showed the
defences ito be as formidable as had been
expected. An attack in full strength would
be nec . _ The main blow was to be
delivered by the Canadian Corps north of
Pontecorvo while 13 ‘Corps would maintain
pressure at Aquino and concentrate forward
teady to advance abreast of the Canadians. The
Poles, who had captured Villa Santa Lucia on
the roth, were to continue the attack against
the strongly defended hill town of Piedimonte
which they had started on the zoth. 8 Indian
Division, after its relief by the Canadians, had
been sent back east of the Rapido; General
Leese now decided to bring it forward again
to reinforce 13 Corps, together with 6 British
Armoured Division. These moves led to con-
siderable congestion, a foretaste of the serious
traffic jams which were to be a feature of the
Liri valley operations.

The Canadian attack began at o600 hours
on the 23rd and met very stiff resistance, Our
casualties were heavy, particularly in
x Division, and the equally severe enemy
losses showed the effort which had been
made to hold the line. By noon on the 24th,
however, we had cleared the whole position,
except for Aquino, and 5 Canadian Armo

* Division was. exploiting rapidly towards the

River Melfa which crosses the valley at right
angles to the course of our advance and
offered the next delaying position for the
enemy’s rearguards. It was certain, how-
ever, that it could only be a delaying posi-
tion; the Germans must now withdraw in as
good order as possible to the ‘‘ Caesar:’’ line
south of Rome where Tenth and Fourteenth
Armies could join hands to form a connected
front barring any further advance north. It
was a faint hope now. Tenth Army was a
beaten force and, on the day the ‘‘ Hitler ’’
line was breached, Fifth Army began its attack
from Anzio which was soon to reduce Four-
teenth Army to the same state. On the same
day Kesselring ordered forward his last useful
formation in Italy, the Henmann Goering Divi-
sion from Leghorn. This was the first of the
formations which the Italian offensive diverted
from the western front; I commented at the
