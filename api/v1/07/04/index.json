            "description": "On: the 4th July, the oth Australian Division began to concentrate on the coast in rear of the El Alamein fortress, but I had to ask its com- mander, Lieutenant-General Morshead, to detach one of his brigades temporarily to pro- vide some infantry to hold the vital Ruweisat Ridge, which was the key to our whole posi- tion. This division was incorporated in the 30th Corps, in command of which Major-General Ramsden succeeded Lieutenant-Genera] Norrie on the 7th July. The enemy now began to move tanks and other troops-round the left flank of the 13th Corps which had been stretched as far west as Deir el Harra. Our front was now much extended and loosely knit. In order, therefore, to close the gap existing about Deir el Hima between the left of the 30th and the tight of the 13th Corps, the New Zealand Divi- sion was ordered to take ground to the east- ward, their place on the outer flank being taken by the 7th Motor Brigade. The enemy took advantage of this to extend his positions to the south and east and, on the gth July, he occu- pied our defensive locality near Deir el Qattara, which had been evacuated in accordance with my policy of avoiding the isolation of troops in detached posts. The enemy continued to exert pressure on this flank and eventually pushed as far east as Qaret el] Himeimat, but"

            "description": "On the night of the r4th July, the New Zealand Division and 5th Indian Infantry Brigade attacked along the Ruweisat Ridge and south of it and gained considerable ground to the west, including valuable observation posts on the ridge itself overlooking the Deir el Shein Depression and the country to the north. During the action Major-General Lumsden, commanding ist Armoured Division, was wounded and replaced by Major-General A..H. Gatehouse, commander of the roth Armoured Division which was still training and equipping in the Delta. About a.week later, during the attack of the 2and July, General. Gatehouse himself was wounded and was succeeded in the command of the Ist Armoured Division by Brigadier A. F. Fisher. Although the enemy counter-attacked with tanks on the evening of the 15th and regained some of the lost ground, our tactical position in this very important part of the front was improved by the operation. Moreover, we took some 2,000 prisoners, mostly Italians. ;"

The attack was supported by tanks and a strong artillery and was carried out with skill and determination. The mounds were secured and remained in our possession, as a valuable bastion constituting a permanent threat tothe enemy positions to the south of it."

The convoy was located by enemy aircraft and U-boats on Ist July, a little later than usual, and thereafter\u00bb was shadowed continuously except for a few short intervals in fog. Though this fog was not permanent enough to prevent shadowing, it did decrease the number of. air attacks. The first, by nine torpedo aircraft, took place late on 2nd July: it was unsuccessful and one aircraft was shot down. A solitary air- craft scored a torpedo hit on the morning of 4th July, the merchant ship later being sunk by our own forces ; and there was an unsuccess- ful attack by six bombers in the evening. Later the same evening another attack, by twenty-five torpedo bombers, took place: two ships were sunk and one damaged, and at least four aircraft were shot down."
