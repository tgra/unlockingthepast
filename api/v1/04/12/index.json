These formations used airstrips established near Manhton (“* Aberdeen ”), twenty-seven miles north-northwest of Indaw ; Mawlu (“White City ”), twenty. miles north of Katha, and in the Hopin area.

This was a strong position provided that the Yugoslavs and the Greeks were able to close the roads by which the line could be turned. The withdrawal began on the night rrth/12th April and was completed by dawn on the 13th. But during its course it became obvious that the 12th and 2oth Greek Divisions were disintegrating. They soon became thoroughly disorganized and only a few sub-units retained any fighting value. This was due in no way to lack of courage or fighting spirit, but to their lack of modern armament and their ox-drawn transport, which was too slow and unwieldy as soon as it became necessary to embark on a long move. The withdrawal of General Mackay’s force from Amynteion had to be covered by the rst Armoured Brigade, who carried out successful counter-attacks on enemy armoured fighting vehicles. During this withdrawal the brigade experienced considerable mechanical trouble, similar to that of the 3rd Armoured Brigade in",
