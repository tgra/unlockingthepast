The 7th Indian Infantry Brigade was on its way to attack the force above the escarpment, which had now turned north and was heading for El Abiar, when two columns, each said to contain a considerable number of enemy tanks, were observed moving northwards along the coast towards Solluch. The 7th Indian Infantry Brigade was obliged to turn and deal with these columns and to abandon the attempt to attack the force moving on El Abiar, which captured Regima about noon. General Tuker then obtained permission to evacuate Bengasi, as the 1st Armoured Division was already committed in the opposite direction and would not be able to intervene.",

Into this gap enemy troops penetrated having moved round the eastern flank by estate roads. The Divisional Commander (Major-General Barstow), while moving up the railway to visit the forward brigade, was ambushed by the enemy and there is little doubt that he was killed. He was a gallant and gifted officer and his loss was a severe blow. The 22 Brigade, in an endeavour to rejoin the division, moved #hrough  the jungle west of the railway. Some parties of the enemy were met and dispersed, the 5/11 Sikhs again distinguishing themselves, but the dense jungle proved too much jor the troops who were hampered by having to carry a number of wounded.
