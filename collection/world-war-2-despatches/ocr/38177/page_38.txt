enemy had dispersed westwards. The 4th
Armoured Brigade followed and swung south in
an attempt to cut off the enemy’s retreat. A
broad expanse of waterlogged country forced
them to make a wide detour which took them
over extremely broken ground; their advance
was greatly slowed down and they arrived to
find the last of the enemy vanishing.

The Armoured Division’s supply difficulties
now became acute and, until a field main-
tenance centre had been established, General
Gott could employ only the Support Group
and two armoured car regiments. He therefore
sent one armoured car regiment towards Msus
to keep contact with the enemy and another
towards Charruba to watch the tracks leading
out of the Gebel Akhdar. The Support Group
he‘ ordered to advance on Bengasi to repeat
the successful manoeuvre of the previous winter
by cutting off the retreat of the 21st Italian
Corps. Brigadier Renton was ordered to send
a column ahead to press on with all speed,
and to follow with the main body as soon as
it had replenished. The 4th Armoured Brigade
had to be withheld at Mechili until sufficient
petrol was forthcoming.

While the armoured brigade was at Mechili
the headquarters of the 2and Anmoured
Brigade, which had been reorganised, took over -
from that of the 4th Armoured Brigade. The
individual regiments had already been relieved.
in the course of operations, as and when regi-
ments of the original 22nd Armoured Brigade
were re-equipped, for the most part with
damaged tanks which had been repaired.

The landing grounds at Mechili were reported
safe during the afternoon of the 19th December,
and next morning squadrons which had followed
close behind our forward troops began to use
them. The speed with which aireraft began
to operate from landing grounds immediately
in rear of our foremost troops helped to com-
pensate for our inability to send large land forces
in pursuit of the enemy.

Our hopes of reaching Bengasi in time were
soon dashed. The recent rains had been un-
usually heavy and many parts of the southern
slopes of the Gebel Akhdar, which the Support
Group had to traverse, were under water.
Their own progress was greatly retarded, and
that of their supply echelons was rendered even
more difficult, with the result that in a short
while they were held up for lack of petrol.
On the 21st December, therefore, General Gott
decided to abandon the attempt and ordered
the Support Group to advance on Antelat
instead, leaving only a small column to press
on to Bengasi.

The maintenance difficulties which the 13th
Conps encountered did not come as a surprise.
It had been appreciated when the operation
was being planned that the difficulties of supply
would increase enormously in Western
Cyrenaica, and it was for that reason that I
had been so anxious to destroy the enemy
as far east as possible. Now we had to accept
the fact that the size of the forces employed
in pursuit would be very much restricted, until
the port of Bengasi could be developed and
brought into use. Meanwhile we should have
to resort to every shift and device to overcome
the handicap.

The Oases Force under Brigadier Reid had.

ground in the Oasis had’ been attacking enemy
supply lines and communications ever stnce.
The Oases Force had fulfilled its mission ad-
mirably, but it was not of a size to meet the
enemy forces which were now fleeing from the
Gebel Akhdar and across the desert. Realising
the inability of the weak Oases Force even to
impede the enemy’s retreat, General Ritchie
had sent the Guards Brigade Group with
supporting air squadrons straight to Antelat.
He had hoped to be able to despatch them some
time before the enemy broke at Gazala; but
the acute shortage of supply vehicles and the
unexpectedly strong resistance encountered at
Gazala had compelled him to postpone their
departure until the zoth December.

When the Guards Brigade reached Antelat
on the 22nd December, they found a hostile
force including thirty tanks lying around Beda
Fomm, covering the Axis withdrawal down the
coastal road. One of its battalions, which
occupied Antelat, was driven out again on the
23rd by a strong detachment of this force. By-
that time the Support Group had reached this
neighbourhood and had been sent north-west-
wards to interfere with whatever the enemy had
in hand at Carcura, off which seven ships were
lying. When the news reached him that the
Guards Brigade had been attacked at Antelat,
General Gott ordered the Support Group to turn
about and move at once to their assistance. At
the sight of both brigades assembled to attack
him the enemy withdrew from Antelat towards
Agedabia. The pursuit of this force would
have been an excellent task for ihe armoured
regiment which had arrived during the morn-
ing, but after a brief engagement with enemy
tanks it had no fuel left with which to give
chase.

While the 13th Corps was struggling to over-
come its maintenance troubles, the enemy com-
pleted the evacuation of Bengasi. Our
armoured cars, ordered to reconnoitre up to the
coastal road south of Bengasi on the zand
December, had found the passes down fhe
escarpment at Sidi Brahim, Sceleidima and to
the south held by enemy detachments. But on
the 24th a squadron of armoured cars, entering
Bengasi by the road from El Abiar, found the
town evacuated and the harbour empty.

An enemy flankguard remained round Beda
Fomm and to the west of Antelat during the
next two days. Columns from the Guards
Brigade made several attempts to dislodge them,
but the enemy was strong in artillery and the
brigade could make little headway. Meanwhile
the Support Group finished clearing the coastal
area further north. On the’26th December the
dast of the enemy, harassed as they went by
columns from the Guards Brigade, retired to
Agedabia.

Operations round Agedabtia.

For the next ten days the 13th Corps was held
up at Agedabia, where the enemy had left a
considerable force to cover his preparation of
positions in the marshes round El Agheila. The
country, round Agedabia is well suited to de-
fence, and the enemy exploited its naturai ad-
vantages with admirable skill. The strip of
Jand between the main road and -the coast is
swampy, and soft sand dunes make the few
dry patches practically impassable for vehicles.
The ground to the east and south is also
covered with soft sand and is bounded by the
