SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 FEBRUARY, 1948

advantage lay in denying to the enemy the use
of the RDF* stations there. The operation,
which was preceded by a very heavy A and
Naval bombardment, was carried out under
direct command of General Eisenhower, using 1
(British) Infantry Division. It was entirely
successful at negligible loss, and the use of the
airfield was very valuable for the Sicilian
campaign.

Invasion and Conquest of Sicily.

The period of planning’ for the invasion of
Sicily was unusually prolonged and it was
possible to devote a more intensive study to
the subject than is generally the case. I have
omitted, in the account given above, a good
many of the stages in that planning but it is
essential to give sufficient detail to make quite
clear the nature of the problem with which
we were faced and the solution which was
eventually adopted. This has also made it
possible to present the narrative of operations
in a much briefer form since on the whole in
this case the conventional phrase is justified
and operations proceeded according to plan.
I should like to take the opportunity now,
before passing on to the narrative of events,
of giving their due credit to the men who
made success possible.

General Dwight D. Eisenhower, «Commander-
in-Chief, Allied Expeditionary Force, was the
man on whom fell the ultimate responsibilty
of taking the great decisions. He commanded
darectly all sea, land and air forces in the
theatre. He and his staff could not have been
more helpful to me throughout; I knew
that when he had given his confidence he would
support me through everything and I had
already had the happiest experience in Tunisia
of what that support could be. His great
merits as a commander have been too well
illustrated in all the campaigns in Europe to
need further tribute from me but I would like
to single out one aspect in which I think he
excelled: the gift for managing a coalition of
different allies in arms. In almost all the wars
in which Great Britain has been involved we
have fought as a member of a coalition and
a British commander has, therefore, what I
may call a deep historic sense of the difficulties
of combining the efforts of an allied force; he
can remember the controversies of Marlborough
with the Dutch Field Deputies and Welhngton
going down on his knees to humour the frac-
tiousness of a Spanish General. Throughout
all the operations which I commanded in the
Mediterranean the British and American
forces fought not merely as two armies with the
same general objective and the same war aims
but as a single homogeneous army and, without
for a moment derogating from the spirit of loyal
co-operation of all commanders and men, there
is no doubt that the inspiration which gave life
and vigour to that co-operation derived
originally from General Eisenhower.

The Commanders-in-Chief of the naval and
air forces in the theatre came, in the chain of
command, directly under General Eisenhower
and occupied therefore a position co-ordinate
with my own. It is for this reason that I have
dealt only summarily in this despatch with their
operations but I must at this point try to

make clear the debt which land operations owed
to the sister services. On Admiral Cunningham
fell the weight of what was in some ways the
most arduous, detailed and vital part of the
operation, the actual conveyance of the troops
to their objectives. I do not mean merely to
point out the obvious: that to invade an island
it is necessary to cross the sea; but to evoke
to the imagination some picture of the gigantic
nature of the task of convoying for such dis-
tances, assembling and directing to obscure and
unlit beaches in an enemy territory an Armada
of over two thousand ships and craft. I must
mention only in passing the assistance of naval
gunfire on the beaches and the silent strength
of the covering forces waiting, and hoping, for
the appearance in defence of its native soil of
that fleet which once claimed to dominate the
Mediterranean. It is a theme which can be
adequately described only by a naval specialist,
and one of which the Royal Navy and the
United States Navy are justly proud. Air Chief
Marshal Tedder, Commander-in-Chief of the
allied air forces in the Mediterranean, was an
old colleague from the Middle East. His
mastery of air strategy was demonstrated in
Africa, Sicily and Italy and his mastery of the
art of war as a whole was shown by his subse-
quent appointment as Deputy Supreme Com-
mander, of all three arms, to General Eisen-
hower for operations in France and Germany.
I have referred elsewhere to the work of the
allied air forces. To sum it up it is only
necessary to say they gave us command of the
air and to demonstrate it to point to the pro-
tection our troops enjoyed in the first critical
days when the fighters swarmed over the great,
vulnerable convoys and the fighter-bombers
hunted up and down the roads of Sicily seek-
ing and destroying enemy reinforcements mov-
ing up to the beaches. The Commander of the
Tactical Air Forces, Air Marshal Coningham,
was another old colleague from the Middle East.
His headquarters moved always with mine and
our contact was so close that the word co-
operation is too weak; we were two parts of the
same machine and worked as one.

Of the Armies under my command I had
already had successful experience. General
Patton, commanding Seventh Army, had
already served under me in Tunisia and I had
complete confidence in him. He had there
taken command of a body of iroops, the excel-
lent material of which had been prevented
hitherto from showing its full capabilities by a
certain lack of experience and by difficulties of
terrain and climate, and had transformed it by
his inspiration into a fast-moving and hard-hit-
ting force crowned with victory. Seventh Army
was certainly fast-moving and hard-hitting and
it undoubtedly owed these qualities to the
leadership of its commander. General Mont-
gomery was also a commander in whom I
had every trust and confidence. He and
his Eighth Army had served under my com-
mand since August, 1942. Fresh from a cam-
paign where they had advanced eighteen hun-
dred miles in six months to share in the capture
of a quarter of a million prisoners, they showed
in Sicily that they could apply the lessons
learnt then to a very different type of terrain
and style of fighting. I was glad to welcome,
in addition to the veteran formations of the
Desert, the splendid 1 Canadian Division,
trained to a hair in the United Kingdom and
