PART IIL.
OPERATIONS IN THE ANDALSNES AREA.

29. The area of operations was confined to
the Gudbrandsdal valley betwen the base at
Andalsnes and Lake Mjésa, a distance of some
140 miles. Except in the area of Lesjaskog,
and at its Southern end, where there are roads
on either side of Lake Mjésa, the valley is
seldom more than a mile wide and in places
narrows to a few hundred yards; along the
whole length of the road, river and railway
interwine. The valley is flanked with moun-
tains and hills which are covered in snow at the
high levels. The side roads and tracks leading
into the valley are for the most part impassable
at this time of the year, except to ski troops,
of whom the enemy were reporled to have a
considerable number. Scattered along the valley
throughout its length are wooden farm build-
ings and occasional villages or small towns
such as Andalsnes, Lesja, Dombis, Otta,
Ringebu, Oyer and Lillehammer.

30. It would be difficult to imagine a Line of
Communication more exposed to air attack, to
which it was continually subjected during the
hours of daylight by means of heavy bombing
and machine gun fire: and there were no means
of protecting it nor of repairing the damage
done to the roads and railway: for this latter
work reliance had to be placed entirely on the
Norwegians, who did their best with very
limited resources. The key point of Dombis
was completely destroyed by bombing and Oita
almost completely so. Large craters on the
road made motor transport movement in-
creasingly difficult; it was singularly fortunate
that the railway was not more seriously
damaged.

31. The 148th Infantry Brigade commanded
by Brigadier H. de R. Morgan and consisting
initially of 1/5 Leicesters, less two companies,
8 Sherwood Foresters and one light Anti-Air-
craft Battery, a total of 1,000 all ranks, landed
from His Majesty’s ships in the Andalsnes area
on the evening of 18th April. A force of
Marines had landed previously to make pre-
liminary arrangements. [Brigadier Morgan’s
instructions were to land in the Andalsnes area,
secure Domb&s and then operate Northwards
and take offensive action against the Germans
in the Trondheim area. His instructions also
stated that his force was an independent com-
mand under the War Office until receipt of
further orders. As a preliminary to carrying
out his réle Brigadier Morgan despatched a
company to Domb&s where it arrived at 0400
hours, r9th April. ,

32. On roth April, the British Military
Attaché, Lieutenant-Colonel King Salter, repre-
sented that the Norwegian Army was in urgent
need of assistance, and stated that unless this
was forthcoming immediately, the Army would
abandon all further resistance. He further
stated to Brigadier Morgan that the War Office
had sanctioned the 148th Infantry Brigade
coming under the command of the Commander-
in-Chief, Norwegian Army. Owing to the
urgency of the situation Brigadier Morgan
decided to comply with the Norwegian request
for assistance, at the same time sending a signal
to the War Office for further instructions.

The Norwegian Commander-in-Chief’s orders
were that 148th Infantry Brigade should be
sent at once to the Lillehammer area to replace

the Norwegian troops who were tired out. He
hoped that the arrival of the British troops
would lend fresh heart to his force and conse-
quently he required Brigadier Morgan to attach
his troops under direct command of Norwegian
formations. The force was moved by train
to the Lillehammer area during 19th and zoth
April, where it was placed under command
2nd Norwegian Division.

33- On atst April, it was‘to move forward in
three groups to take up previously reconnoitred
positions south of Lillehammer and on either
side of Mjésa Lake.

Owing to a German attack during the after-
noon these groups never reached these positions
and orders were issued for a withdrawal at
oroo hours, 2znd April, to the high ground
between Falberg and Lillehammer. During this
withdrawal a party of 5 officers and 50 men,
1/5-Leicesters, was cut off and lost.

34. On 2and April our position was heavily
attacked from the air and with 3.7 inch
howitzers and 4 inch mortars. Shortly after
mid-day the Germans succeeded in working
round the Eastern flank and a daylight with-
drawal became imperative if the whole force
East of the river was not to be cut off.

The Norwegians had made no arrangements
for the occupation of the position in rear, but
the timely arrival of the remaining two com-
panies of 1/5 -Leicesters at the base enabled
them to be rushed forward by rail and bus
to positions near Oyer.

The Germans made no serious efforts to
follow up the withdrawal, being checked by
fire and road blocks. Their aircraft were how-
ever very active and the force suffered heavy
casualties from bombs and machine gun fire
from the air.

The position at Gyer was reached by about
1800 hours, though battalions and companies
were somewhat mixed. At this hour the force
was some 12 miles in front of any formed body
of Norwegians though three squadrons of the
Dragoons, a motorised machine-gun unit, were
placed under Brigadier Morgan’s command,
with orders to report to him at Tretten.

35. During the night 22nd/23rd April the
British force fell back to~a previously recon-
noitred position just South of Tretten.

Owing to this continued withdrawal rations
had been jettisoned in order to transport troops
so there was a shortage of supplies. Also posi-
tions were not entrenched, as all tools had been
left behind in the early stages of the with-
drawal. Consequently the men were lying in
the open exposed to full view of the enemy air-
craft and to artillery fire.

36. During 23rd April the Germans brought
up a section of 5.9 howitzers and at least two

They again started working round our
Eastern flank and a further withdrawal became
essential. Owing to the difficulties of com-
munications it is doubted whether the forward
companies ever received any orders and they
ree cut off by the enemy getting round behind

em.

The withdrawal of the remainder was fol-
lowed up by tanks and aircraft and casualties
were heavy, but the forward companies were
still holding out and must have inflicted heavy
losses on the enemy. The Norwegians had
taken up a defensive position about Favang
and the remainder of the force withdrew
through them during the night 23rd /24th April.
