103. Between 2000 and 2040, four T/B attacks were made from the port beam, two or three aircraft taking part in each attack.

The moon was bright and on the starboard quarter of the convoy.

SHEFFIELD reports that before and during the early stages  of these attacks a considerable amount of signalling with unnecessarily bright lights was taking place in the convoy; this presumably refers to the signals mentioned in paragraph 107 below.

(@) First Attack. '

Io4. At 1955, when the convoy was steering 114 , COSSACK, stationed on the port bow of the convoy, detected aircraft on R.D.F., and about five minutes later sighted an aircraft on the port side. white and green Very light, the signal for T/B attack,

105. The Rear-Admiral, roth Cruiser Squadron ordered an emergency turn of 40  to port together by rapid manceuvring procedure.

*  KENYA sounded two short blasts and turned,

followed belatedly by the port column of the convoy,

This signal was incorrectly transmitted as 45  to starboard and EDINBURGH and the starboard column turned to starboard.

106. The port screen and the convoy opened fire to port, but only HERMIONE and

. COSSACK actually saw aircraft.

COSSACK obseryed the aircraft making white flashes before turning in to attack.

(b) Second Attack.

108. Aircraft were reported bearing ogo , 3 miles at 2010 and others were detected on the starboard bow. Both these formations crossed from starboard to port, and attacked from the port beam. Two aircraft were seen by LAFOREY, flying from starboard to port about 2 mules ahead. |

ZULU heard 4 separate aircraft distinctly, but only saw one, which passed so close that her guns could not train fast enough to get on.
