Although the enemy was hitting out with great vigour, General Ritchie was positive that he was doing so only to cover the preparation of new positions in rear and decided to wait no longer. He therefore ordered the 13th Corps to proceed with their part in the operation against El] Adem. Some two hours after dark on the 7th December the 23rd Infantry Brigade began their advance along Ed Duda ridge. By daybreak they had captured an enemy position on the ridge within 2,000 yards of the Tobruk E] Adem road and by evening the whole of the enemy fortifications south-east of Tobruk had been cleared."

This same factor of distance, however, made it impossible for them to remain in contact until relieved, but a Catalina Flying-boat was despatched to shadow the convoy during the night. The Air Officer Commanding also ordered a reconnaissance by Hudsons starting early on the 7th December, fanning out from Kota Bharu on to the last known bearings of the convoy. No signal was received from the Catalina, and, from information received later, it is almost certain it was shot down, A second Catalina failed to make contact with the convoy. On the morning of the 7th December, visibility East and NorthEast from Kota Bharu was good. The reconnaissance found no ships in the area between Kota Bharu and the Southern end of IndoChina, thus confirming the supposition that the convoy had rounded Cambodia Point, and had followed the four leading ships North-NorthWest into the Gulf of Siam. In this Gulf the visibility was very bad and no positive information was received from this area until the evening, when a report was received that a Hudson had seen, through low clouds, three"

In December,  1941, while the actual strength of the Royal Air Force (see Appendix J) approached very closely to my forecast, the Army strength (see Appendix E) fell far short of the figure which it had been agreed was required to compensate for the deficiency in aircraft. The main deficiencies were:   17 Battalions; 4 Light A.A. Regiments; and 2 Tank Regiments. The strength in A.A. weapons in the Far East on the 7th December, 1941, is given in Appendix 92. The fact that we were entirely without tanks in Malaya was a serious handicap to any offensive land operations, whether on a small or a large scale. There were also very few armoured cars. Many efforts were made to obtain both tanks and armoured cars from various sources. On the rqth August the War Office offered forty light tanks from the Middle East. These tanks were at the time being employed for aerodrome defence, and they were offered to the Far East on the condition that they would be employed in an operational role, and that we could man them from local resources. Some delay occurred at Singapore in finding the best method of meeting the latter Ba"

Near the opposite end of the prospective theatre of operations, the island of Timor was important as being a definite link in the air communications between  Australia and the Netherlands East Indies. Its occupation by the Japanese would also be a serious threat to Australia: The importance of Timor was noted in the A.D.A. agreement, and it was referred to in A.D.B. Roughly half the island was Dutch territory and half Portuguese; it was the latter half which gave no small anxiety. The Japanese had a consulate in Dilli, the capital of Portuguese Timor, and by November, 1941, had received permission to run a regular flying-boat service to Dilli, and were gradually getting an economic hold on Portuguese Timor. In November, 1941, a small nucleus of Australian troops was sent to Koepang in Dutch Timor, where there was an aerodrome and a flying-boat base. On the rz2th December one infantry battalion, one independent company and a few coast defence troops reached Koepang from Australia, A combined Australian and Dutch force occupied Dilli in the middle of December, 1941. About the 7th December, in accordance with the A.D.A, and A.D.B. agreements, two flights of Hudsons of the Royal Australian Air Force moved to Ambon in the Netherlands East Indies. These were followed later by an infantry battalion."

Possibly the defensive preparations had been to some extent sacrificed in favour of the offensive."

Shortly afterwards our beach defence artillery opened fire and the enemy ships started shelling the beaches. At about 0025 hrs. on the 8th December the leading Japanese troops landed at the junction of the Badang and Sabak beaches and by oroo hrs. after heavy fighting had succeeded in capturing the adjacent pill-boxes manned by troops of the 3/17 Dogras. The garrisons of the latter inflicted very heavy casualties on the enemy before being themselves wiped out almost to a man. Hudson aircraft between midnight and dawn pressed home numerous attacks in the face of heavy A.A. fire from warships and transports One of the transports which is believed to have contained tanks and artillery was set on fire, either by air attack or gunfire, or perhaps both, and prevented from discharging its cargo.

By 5th December it would have completed its programme for the relief, rest and training of the four American infantry divisions in II Corps; 13 Corps had only been able to rotate their forces so that only a limited offensive effort  could be called for from them. American artillery ammunition was sufficient for not more than about fifteen days  full-scale offensive operations. In view of that fact and the other considerations which made it inevitable that this should be the last major offensive before the spring of 1945 it was essential that every chance should be calculated to ensure its success and I directed that the actual timing of the offensive, which would be some date after 7th December, must be dependent on the weather and, if necessary, it must be postponed until the weather was propitious. :"
