            "description": "For various reasons our offensive had already had to be postponed. After dumping had been finished, it was not possible to rely on the transport echelons being reorganised before the 11th November in readiness for the advance. Nor was it possible to complete the training of the 22nd Anmoured Brigade, which disembarked early in October, and that of the Armoured Corps. Headquarters before that date. At the Commanders -in-Chief Conference held on the 3rd October, therefore, 11th November was fixed as the date for the offensive to. begin. Unavoidable delays arose, however, in providing the full quota of transport for the 1st South African Division, and Major-General Brink found it impossible to complete its training by that date. The opening of the offensive was finally deferred until 18th November"

            "description": "To supply the large quantities of water now required, I ordered a pipeline to be laid between Alexandria and the forward area. I also gave instructions for the water sources at Fuka and Buq Bug to be developed. The orders for the construction of the pipeline and the development of the water source at Fuka were given on the 6th September, and on the 11th November the new water-point was opened sixty-five miles west of Matruh. A strict water ration of three-quarters of a gallon a day per man and vehicle had to be imposed in order to leave enough water to fill the new pipelines and storage tanks. In the space of two months, in spite of many difficulties, one hundred and forty-five miles of pipe had been laid and filled, and ten large reservoirs and seven new pumping stations had- been built. Adequate supplies of water were then available without in any way interfering with the transport of supplies."

The elections which had been held a few months previously in Syria and the Lebanon had passed off without any serious disorder, but the intensely nationalistic character of both of the governments caused some concern to the French authorities. Nothing of a serious nature occurred, however, until November. On 8th November, despite a request from the French D l gu  G n rale, the Lebanese Government exercised what it believed to be its rights under the constitution to eliminate all references to the Mandatory Power. The D l gu  G n rale reacted by arresting, on the morning of 11th November, the President of the Lebanese Republic, the Prime Minister, three other Cabinet Ministers and a leading Sunni Mohammedan Deputy."

He remained on Leros long enough to see the defences of the island organised to his satisfaction and to clarify relations with the Italians there, and since the re-organisation of the island's defences was proceeding satisfactorily, he was able to leave for Samos about midnight on 11th November, leaving Brigadier Tilney in command on Leros."

            "description": "The decision to make a dash for Tunis, though bold, was undoubtedly correct. The advance was pressed by land, sea and air; Bougie was occupied by 11th November, Bone on 12th November, by a British parachute battalion, and by 18th November our advanced forces were operating east of:Gebel Abiud on the coast road and B ja on the inland road, about sixty miles from Bizerta and Tunis respectively. At both points we were in contact with German troops. These had begun to arrive, in the first place by air, on oth November, meeting no resistance from the French authorities in Tunisia. On 15th November a United States parachute battalion occupied Youks Les Bains and Tebessa, in south-eastern iAlgeria, and co-operated with the French detachments at Gafsa in southern Tunisia. Between 17th November and 25th December two main attempts were made to capture Tunis. The first succeeded in advancing, on 28th November, as far as Djedeida, on the road between Tunis and Bizerta and only twelve miles from the former. At this point the enemy counter-attacked strongly with tanks and dive-bombers; the latter were able to operate from good airfieldss only a short distance in rear and our own air forces were ungble to give cover, since the rain had put all their temporary landing grounds out of action. Our forces on the inland road were therefore obliged to withdraw to Medjez el Bab. This town, as its name   the Ford of the Pass   shows, is of great strategic importance. It lies"

The brigade moving to outflank Fort White had, in the meantime, cleared the enemy from a 7,000 foot feature three miles down the Fort White  -Falam track (Point 7480). Then, after an initial failure, they gained the main road and established a road-block near Milestone 25, where later they gained touch with the brigade advancing along the road itself. Stiff resistance was met at Vownalu Mual (Milestone 29), and again at Milestone 31 where we were held up for two days. However, on the 11th November the advance was resumed, Numbers 2 and 3 Stockades falling without opposition. Forward elements pressed on to Milestone 40, but the main body was delayed by stiff resistance east of Number 2 Stockade."

The battalion destined to seize the airfield at Djidjelli and stock it with petrol was, however, unable to land by sea owing to the swell and went on by road from Bougie, not reaching Djidjelli until 13th November, This delay unfortunately prevented our fighters operating from the airfield and, as a result, the enemy bombers sank several ships in Bougie harbour before air cover could be provided. Losses in personnel were not high but in equipment were considerable, and the infantry were, for some time to come, operating only with what they could and in the clothes they wore when they left their ships."
