SUPPLEMENT to taz LONDON GAZETTE, 22 JANUARY, 1048

Another factor which influenced me in com-
ing to this decision was the danger of my Head-
quarters becoming intimately involved in the
defence of Malaya if I remained at Singapore,
to the neglect of the wider problems of the de-
fence of the Far East.

Relations with Commander-in-Chief, China
Station.

41. From about June 1941 onwards an intel-
ligence conference was held at-ten o’clock every
morning, and was attended, by the Commander-
in-Chief, China, and myself, and our senior
staff officers. Generally speaking, the division
of responsibilities was clear, and in other cases
they were divided up without any difficulty.
The Commander-in-Chief, China, had been
dealing with Free French problems, and con-
tinued to do so after my Headquarters was
formed, As our relations with French Indo-
China were largely concerned with economics
and shipping, he dealt with most of the prob-
lems of that country, whilst my Headquarters
dealt mainly with Siam. He also agreed to
take over responsibility for control of the Press
and continued to do so up to the beginning of
December, when Sir Tom Phillips arrived and
I took over this responsibility. ;

Other questions, such as food supplies, wel

dealt w:th together. In this case also shipping
was largely involved, and as the Commander-
in-Chief, China, had a representative on the
Food Committee, he generally represented our
combined views at meetings of the War Com-
mittee.
_ The Commander-in-Chief, China, took over
from me the control of the Miri oil denial
scheme. This was found more convenient since
the problems of oil supply were more closely
connected with the Navy than with the Army
or Air Force, and the evacuation of both
material and personnel from Miri was essen-
tially a Naval matter.

Agreement was reached in regard to surface
sea patrols near the coast, and it was decided
.that the Naval authoritics would be responsible
for patrolling in the open sea and the Army
would be responsible for similar work on the
rivers. One or two estuaries were dealt with
as special cases, but generally came under the
Naval authorities.

Conferences at Singapore.

42. Many conferences were held in Singa-
ore both before and after the formation of
eneral Headquarters, Far East. These were
as follows: —

(a) The Franco-British Conference held in
June 1939. ihe report of this conference con-
tained some usetul observations on the
general problems, but the basic assumption
of active French collaboration from Indo-
China vanished with. the:collapse of France.

(6) The Singapore Conference of October,
1940, with which should be included the
Tactical Appreciation dated the 16th October,
1940, prepared by the Commander-in-Chief,
China Station, the General Officer Command-
ing, Malaya, and the Air Officer Command-
ing, Far East. - (See paras. 79 and go below.)

(c) The conversations with the Dutch in
December 1940, the principal object being
to obtain information and agreement on cer-
tain matters raised in Appendix A of the Re-
port of the Singapore Conference.

(d) The Conference between British, Dutch
and Australian representatives, with United

543

States observers in attendance, held in Singa-
pore in February 1941, resulting in what is
known as the A.D.A. agreement. This
agreement included plans for mutual rein-
forcements, principally of air forces and sub-
marines. (See para. 44 below.)

(e) The Conference between the Ameri-
cans, Dutch and British, including Australia
and New Zealand, together with representa-
tives of India and the East Indies Station.
This was held at Singapore in April 1941,
and resulted in what is known as the A.D.B.
agreement. (See para. 45 below.) It was fol-
lowed by a shorter agreement between the
British and the Dutch, which dealt almost
entirely with Naval matters, and was really
a modification of the agreement reached in
A.D.A., bringing the latter into line with
A.D.B. It was known as B.D.

(f) Arising out‘of A.D.B., a detailed plan
for naval and air operations, known as
Plenaps was drawn up.

No political commitment was involved by
these agreements, and A.D.A. and A.D.B. re-
mained subject to ratification by the respective
Governments.

43. In the case of the conference leading to
the A.D.A. and A.D.B. agreements, I felt that
the representation was somewhat unbalanced.
In the former, the Naval representation of the
Dominions was weak since the Chief of the
Naval Staff in Australia, Admiral Colvin, was
unable to come, and New Zealand was repre-
sented by Australia. In the A.D.B. Conference,
the Naval representation was strong but that
of the Dominion Army and Air Force was com-
paratively weak. Further, in A.D.B. the
United States representatives were somewhat
junior, and there was no representative of the
Pacific Fleet, but only of the Asiatic.

‘44. In A.D.A. the necessity for collective
action was emphasised, it being pointed out
that Japanese aggression against any one coun-
try would be of vital importance to the others.
Agreement was reached on the particular
actions by Japan which would necessitate the
Naval and Military authorities concerned ad-
vising their respective Governments to take
active military counter-action. A suggestion
was made that Commanders-in-Chief on the
spot might be allowed to take measures in such
circumstances without prior reference to
London.

The principle of mutual reinforcement was
agreed, the Dutch undertaking to provide sub-
marines for operation in the South China Sea,
as well as one Fighter and three bomber
squadrons to reinforce Malaya; whilst it was
estimated that four Bomber squadrons would
be available from Malaya to reinforce the
Netherlands East Indies. Australia was pre-
pared to assist by the provision of Army units,
and of an air striking force at Darwin to rein-
force Ambon and Koepang. The necessary
administrative arrangements to prepare for these
land and air reinforcements were to be under-
taken at once, and progress reports were to be
rendered monthly to G.H.Q., Far East. The
principles on which sea communications would
be defended were outlined, and emphasis was
laid on the importance of making the passage of
the Northern line of the Dutch possessions as
difficult as possible for the Japanese. .

The A.D.A. report was approved generally
by the Chiefs of Staff, the main exception being
that there could be no prior definition of an act
