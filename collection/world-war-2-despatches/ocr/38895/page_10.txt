obtained the agreement of Commander-in-
Chief, Mediterranean to this some hours
earlier, and warning signals were at once sent
by the latter to all ships and forces concerned.
It is not certain that they did in fact reach
all the merchantmen, and by unfortunate
chance a number of enemy aircraft was
in the vicinity at the time our aircraft were
approaching. As might be expected, firing
which started spasmodically soon became
general, and it is hard to blame ships for
engaging low-flying aircraft which appeared to
be menacing them during an air raid. It is
considered that in only very exceptional cir-
Suntan mould shine os cencves of few
right to open at low-flying airc
approaching them. The solution must be

ways to route transport aircraft clear of our
shipping.

27. I cannot close this letter without paying
tribute to the magnificent work throughout all
stages of “Husky” of my Task Group Com-
manders, Rear-Admirals R. R. McGrigor, C.B.,
Sir Philip L. Vian, K.B.E., D.S.O., and T. H.
Troubridge, D.S.O.—as well as that of Captain

rd Ashbourne. I could not have been more
efficiently and loyally supported by them nor
by my staff under Commodore C. E. Douglas-
Pennant, D.S.C.

28. Although the enemy did not make a
determined attempt to prevent our assaults,
conditions were not always easy, and it is
considered that in general a very high
standard of seamanship and devotion to duty
was shown by officers and men of the Eastern
Naval Task Force.

NARRATIVE OF THE OPERATION.
D-1 Day.
Friday, 9th July, 1943.

Naval Commander Eastern Task Force
assumed operational control of all his ships
and craft at noon. Leaving Malta in his Head-
quarters ship, H.M.S. ANTWERP, at 0630,
he to the southward to sight first
the L.C.T. groups approaching from Sousse
and Tripoli, carrying the supporting arms for
the assault, and later the fast and slow assault
convoys from the Middle East and United
Kingdom, all of which were in their assigned
positions and proceeding according to plan.
The forces and landing craft starting from, or
staging through, Malta sailed as arranged
throughout the day to join their respective
group or convoy. H.M.S. ANTWERP re-
turned to Calafrana in the evening to land
the Chief of Combined Operations, and sailed
again after dark for the scene of the landings
south of Syracuse. :

Weather—The weather which in the early
morning was good deteriorated throughout the
day until in the evening the wind was force 6
from the north-westward. A short steep sea
resulted which, while it did not interfere with
the timing of the ship convoys, had the effect
of slowing down the craft convoys and driving
them off their course to the eastward. The state

of the weather caused a certain amount of
anxiety regarding the suitability of conditions
off the beaches for carrying out the assault,
but the question of suggesting a postponement
did not come to be seriously considered.

Enemy reports—No reports of enemy air-
craft were received during the day.

D Day.
Saturday, 10th July.

Weather—After midnight the wind com-
menced to decrease in strength and the dawn
ushered in a perfect blue Mediterranean day.

The Assaults.

The detailed accounts of the various assaults
are given in the reports of the respective Task
Group Commanders, etc., and only a general
outline will be found in this narrative.

A. Bark WEST.

The fast assault convoy (K.M-F. 18) under
Naval Commander Force “ V ” anchored about
half-an-hour late, in a position subsequently
found to be two miles to the eastward of the
planned release position.

@ SuGar Sector. . .

Considerable swell was still running in this
sector, but the first assault flight were quickly
and successfully lowered, and moved off not
more than ten minutes behind schedule. The
second flight were at once lowered and were
got away only fifteen minutes late (i.e., 0155).
The two flights beached on their cofréct
beaches five and eighteen minutes late respec-
tively. A runnel with nine feet of water
inside a bank off the beaches, of which warning
had been received while on passage from U.K.,
was encountered but all craft were carried
over it by the surf.

The loading of serials* was put under way:
immediately the other craft had departed, but
was slow on account of the swell. ;

Shortly after 0330 success signals were
observed and about 0415 a signal was received
that the shore was ready to take serials.

The Royal Marine Commandos also
successfully landed and reported about 0330.
The batteries which formed their objective
proved to be dummies, and they suffered only
a few casualties,

These landings were made without surprise
being lost and there was little opposition at
the beaches ; in fact it was not until the first
flight was leaving the shore that machine-gun
fire was opened.

The first L.C.A. reported back to their
parent ship about 0430. Naval casualties
amounted to two wounded.

(ii) Rocer Sector.

Having regard to the runnel mentioned above
an alternative plan was devised and ordered
whereby the troops would embark in L.C.T.
instead of L.C.A. at the release position and
then be launched in D.U-K.W. on reaching the
runnel,

The L.C.T. duly arrived and loaded from
§.S. MARNIX VAN SAINT ALDEGONDE,
but none reached H.M.S. GLENGYLE and

Admiralty footnote:

* Serials—convoys of ships or groups of Janding craft
when employed on regular ferry service between ports
or from ship to shore, were organised as a “‘ series ” and
each passage or trip was given a “ serial * number.
