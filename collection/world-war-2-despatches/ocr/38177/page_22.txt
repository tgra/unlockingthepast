reserves the attack might have succeeded, but
these were not available. Es oe

For a month now the Eighth Army had been
launching repeated attacks and it was evident
that it could undertake no more until it had
been thoroughly reorganised and greatly rein-
forced. The enemy had so strengthened his
position that it was beyond the power of the
Eighth Army in its existing state to evict him
either by manceuvre or direct attack. The
Eighth Army was also strongly posted and well
disposed for a defensive battle. The enemy was
obviously trying to build up his army suffi-
ciently to renew his efforts to seize the
Delta, but was unlikely to be able to make
the attempt before the end of August.

‘By mid-September the Eighth Army might
expect to be reinforced by two armoured and
two infantry divisions, and might then be able
to make a frontal attack against what was
likely to be a highly organised defensive posi-
tion. Our immediate task was to reorganise
and rearrange our forces, so as to provide an
adequate reserve in the hands of the Army
Commander, and to train the new divisions in-
tensively for the offensive which I hoped might
begin at the end of September. I informed
the Chief of the Imperial General Staff of these
conclusions.* Meanwhile, in case the enemy
should attack first, I gave orders for the El
. Alamein position to be strengthened and
developed in great depth.

‘During July, the Eighth Army took over
7,000 prisoners; and, though it had lost in
battle some 700 officers and 12,000 men during
that period, by supreme efforts it had stopped
the enemy's drive on Egypt ‘and laid
foundations on which to build our future
counterstroke.

Conclusion.

‘On the 6th August I flew to Cairo from my
advanced headquarters with the Eighth Army
and met the Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, and
the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General
Sir Alan Brooke, who had just arrived by air
from England, and discussed the situation with
them. Later the Prime Minister held a con-
ference, at which Field Marshal Smuts, the
Minister of State, General Sir Archibald Wavell
and the three Commanders in Chief were among
those present. The next day I accompanied
the Prime Minister on a visit to the Eighth
Army. After a short tour of the 30th Corps
area the Prime Minister came to my advanced
headquarters, where I explained to him the
tactical situation in detail and my future plans,
after which he met General Gott and other
officers of the 13th Corps and then went back
to Cairo. General Gott was killed the next
day when the aircraft in which he was flying
to Cairo on a few days leave was shot down.
His death at an early age was a great loss
to the Army, as he was an officer of much
promise, whom I had already marked down as
a possible Army Commander.

On the 8th August, Colonel Jacob brought
to Eighth Army Headquarters a letter from
the Prime Minister from which I learned that
the War Cabinet had decided that the moment
had come to make a change in the Middle East
Command and that I was to be relieved by
General Sir Harold Alexander.

SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 1948

The Prime Minister went on to say that it
was proposed to form Iraq and Persia into a
new Command, independent of the Middle East
Command. He offered me this new Command
and hoped I would accept it.

For some time previously, I had been closely
examining the possibility of freeing General

inan from the heavy administrative and
political responsibilities he was discharging as
commander of the Tenth Army. Since his
appointment to command the forces sent to
Traq from India early in 1941, he had carried
out these responsibilities with ability and
thoroughness, but I considered it essential to
free him from them so that he could’ con-
centrate on the strategical problem of the
defence of Persia.

iAfter prolonged and thorough examination of
the administrative considerations involved,
which were not easy to reconcile with the
simpler needs of a sound system of operational
control, we reached a solution which, though
possibly not ideal, was workable in practice.
My Lieutenant-General in charge of Administra-
tion, General (Riddell-Webster, was of the
greatest help to me in solving this problem to
which he gave much time and thought.

The new system, consisted in the formation
of a base area in Southern Iraq and South-
western Persia under a commander directly
responsible to General Headquarters in Cairo;
the appointment of an Inspector-General of
Communications for Persia and Irag, working
directly under my Lieutenant-General in charge
of Administration; and the transfer of Mosul
and Northern Iraq from the Tenth to the Ninth
Army. The transfer of Northern Iraq I con-
sidered essential in order to ensure unity of con-
trol of all land and air forces along the whole
length of the Anatolian frontier, the defence
of which was one problem to be handled by
a single commander. Moreover, General
Quinan would thus be freed from all responsi-
bility for the defence of Iraq from the north
and could devote his whole attention to the pro-
tection of Northern Persia. These changes also
facilitated co-operation between the various
army and air force commanders, which had
previously been somewhat complicated, as the
boundaries of their several Commands did not
coincide.

This transfer of responsibility, which I looked
on as highly important and necessary, was put
into effect shortly before I gave up my com-
mand but was never fully tested, as soon after-
wards Iraq and Persia and the Tenth Army
were divorced from the Middle East Command
and given a Commander-in-Chief of their own.
It seems likely, however, that the changes
described smoothed the way for the formation
of the new command.

I handed over my direct command of the
Eighth Army temporarily to General Ramsden
and went to Cairo the next day and did not
return to the Desert. The same day J had an
interview with the Prime Minister and told him
that I thought it would be difficult for me to
accept his offer of the new’ command, but that
I would like to have time to examine thoroughly
the probable strategical and administrative
effects of the proposal. After careful considera-
tion, I concluded that the arrangement ‘was
likely to break down in the event of a serious
threat from the north and that, therefore, I
could not accept the responsibility of putting
