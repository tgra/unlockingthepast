7596 SUPPLEMENT to THE

14. At oor8 an Oropesa float was passed on
the starboard hand, presumably CROMER’s,
as that ship was met at 0022 proceeding towards
it.

15. Dan buoys correctly‘marking the channel
were passed at 0023, 0042, 0048, 0057, OIOI,
OIII, 0131 and o142. In two cases sweeping
dans and the omginal channel dans laid by
LAFOREY were close together and were con-
‘fusing.

16. At 0026 LAFOREY was met steaming to

seaward. She reported ‘‘ Channel O.K. No
cross set ’’

17. At 0028 CROMARTY was passed stand-
ing by a drifting dan buoy. :

18. At 0052 LAFOREY and ANTHONY
passed at high speed steaming towards Nosi
ara.

1g. At or1o6 ANTHONY turned round and
steamed to seaward.

20. At 0130 course was altered to 136° for
the passage between Nosi Hara and Nosi
Anjombavola and at or42 DEVONSHIRE
passed Q.1 berth and altered course to the
Northward round Nosi Hara, coming to an
anchor in position 053° Q.1 berth 1.65 miles at
0057. This berth was 34 cables from the shore,
half way along the island, and was chosen to
have the island as a background on the bearings
from Nos. 7 and 8 batteries.

2I. Two minesweepers were already at
anchor off Nosi Hara, and CROMER joined
them at about 0205. LAFOREY, FREESIA
and probably two more minesweepers were to
the South Eastward of Q.1 when DEVON-
SHIRE passed.

Proceedings in the Western Anchorage.

a2. A period of waiting followed. The
movements of Groups IV and V were obscured
by Nosi Hara, but the passage of WIN-
CHESTER CASTLE and KEREN’s landing
craft, and that of LAFOREY, LIGHTNING,
FREESIA and ROYAL ULSTERMAN could be
followed almost up to the beaches.

23. At 0342 LAFOREY’s report of mines in
the vicinity of JJ was received,

24. DEVONSHIRE’s position lying head to
wind did not enable her to keep all her guns
bearing on No. 7 fort. Arrangements were made
to slip cable instantly in case it was necessary
to open fire. The pinnace was lowered and a
dan buoy was laid off Nosi Hara reefs to
facilitate manoeuvring the ship in the narrow
space available The officer who laid this bucy
reported that it was almost impossible to see
the ship against the background of the island,
even in the bright moonlight.

.25. At 0440 flares were seen on White Beach
signifying local success. there. At 0454
LAFOREY’s report that ‘‘ Red landing 0430
believed unopposed ’’ was received. At 0454
star shell appeared in the sky and was presumed
to be HERMIONE at Ambod1-Vahibe. At 0523
the Senior Naval Officer (L)’s order for WIN-
CHESTER CASTLE to weigh and proceed to
main anchorage was received. At 0540 the
Walrus aircraft was sent off to reconnoitre the
batteries and report particularly on No. 8
battery. At 0546 the success signal for No, 7

abattery was received. an

26. By now it was broad dayhght; WIN-
CHESTER CASTLE and BACHAQUERO
were seen advancing down the swept channel
towards the main anchorage. Simultaneously
a signal>was received from ROMNEY to the
effect that she had cut and exploded two moored
mines in the neighbourhood of Nosi Famaho
I decided to stop these ships immediately until
I was certain that the Senior Naval Officer (L)
understood the situation. Both ships were told
that there were mines in the anchorage and that
they were not to proceed until ordered by the
Senior Naval Officer (L). ROMNEY’s signal
indicated that 100 per cent. clearance of the
anchorage would be necessary to make it safe.
Signals explaining the position were passed to
WINCHESTER CASTLE at 0620, the Senior
Naval Officer (L) at 0625, BACHAQUERO at
0628 and the Flag Officer Commanding, Force
“F’? at 0652. The Senior Naval Officer (L)
subsequently sent a staff officer on board
DEVONSHIRE where the situation was fully
explained.

27. DEVONSHIRE and LAFOREY were

. acting as W/T guards for F.O0O.* 2 and

F.0.0. I respectively. Both got into com-
munication quickly and easily, LAFOREY at
0459 and DEVONSHIRE at 0514, reports
being passed by V/St to KEREN as they
came in,

28. At 0620 the Walrus returned and landed,
reporting that no sign of No. 8 battery was
visible.

29. Swordfish, Albacores, ‘Martlets and
Hurricanes were all now seen at intervals om
their various tasks. No hostile aircraft were
sighted at this stage.

30. At 0705 Senior Naval Officer (L) asked
if DEVONSHIRE was in communication with
the Flag Officer Commanding, Force “‘ F.”
Difficulty was being experienced as the Flag
Officer Commanding, Force ‘‘F” only
answered occasionally and several reports were
broadcast.

31. PREESIA and FRITILLARY began
inner A/S patrols.

32. At 0750 KEREN and various ships of
Group IV moved to the main anchorage, which
the sweepers had now swept. Mines con+
tinued to ‘be reported from Courrier Bay,

33 Consideration was now given to the ques-
tion of shifting berth to my mshore bombarding
position (N.r). Senior Naval Officer (L)
offered me sweepers but it subsequently trans-
pired that no sweepers could ‘be spared from
the more important task of clearing the channel
for BACHAQUERO. _ I decided therefore to
proceed to an intermediate position from which
I could enfilade the main road to Antsirane
and at the same time keep in good visual com-
munication with ships in both anchorages. The
position chosen was 105° Q.1 1.4 miles, where
the ship anchored at 0851.

34. During the forenoon ships of Group V
came into the anchorage and by 1200 the
outer anchorage was clear.

35. At 1126 a general call from the Army
on shore asked for bombing of the observation
post at Windsor Castle. At 1138 the Walrus
was sent off for this duty and carried out ten
