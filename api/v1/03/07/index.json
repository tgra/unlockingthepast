            "description": "3. On the 7th March, just before the fall of Rangoon, I cabled to the Chiefs of Staff a short appreciation. I expressed grave doubts of my ability to hold Burma, and anticipated a subsequent attack by the Japanese on N.E. India, J considered at this time that an undue proportion of our very inadequate land and air resources in the East was being allocated to the defence of Ceylon. In particular the diversion to Ceylon of a brigade of the 70 British Division, the only British division available in India, caused me concern. Ceylon already had two Indian Brigades and two brigades of local troops; two Australian brigades were being lent to its defence and an East African brigade was on its way there. My view was that if we lost command of the sea and air around Ceylon an additional brigade would be of no avail to secure the naval bases at Trincomalee or Colombo, which the Japanese could destroy without landing, in the same manner as at Pearl Harbour or"

The importance of this bridgehead to our subsequent operations cannot be over- estimated; the enemy reaction to it was immedi- ate, and a considerable number of surviving enemy formations soon became committed in the sector."

On the 4th March, with the aid of tanks, they over- Tan several enemy positions, the enemy\u2019s anti- tank artillery making no impression on our Shermans. After a sharp \u2018but successful en- gagement in the vicinity of the road junction south of Tamandu they exploited northwards to the village, which they found derelict and deserted and which was proudly handed over to them by a naval party which had landed a few hours earlier. Severe fighting, however, continued east and north of Tamandu for some days until the enemy\u2019s fierce resistance -was broken by the combined efforts of 74 Brigade and the West Africans advancing from the north.

On the morning of the 7th March, Army Head- quarters, administrative units and troops not required to cover the demolitions in Rangoon area moved out of Rangoon on the Prome road. Near Taukkyan, twenty-one miles north of Rangodh at about zz.00 hours, the leading vehicles of Army Headquarters ran into an enemy road block and the column was held up. Attempts by the x Glosters, 2/13  F.F Rifles and some tanks of the 7 Hussars throughout the day failed to clear the block. It must be remembered here that the force in Pegu was still cut off, all the efforts on the 6th March of the 63 Infantry Brigade to relieve it having been unsuccessful."
