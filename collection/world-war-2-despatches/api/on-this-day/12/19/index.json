            "description": "The 4th Indian Division set out at once on the morning of the 17th December. The 7th Infantry Brigade on the southern flank travelled at great speed, and within twenty-four hours reached Carmusa where one of its battalions relieved the Support Group column which had been sent on ahead. Another battalion captured Martuba landing ground, and the third the aerodrome at Derna, where a number of aircraft were destroyed and much transport and many prisoners taken. The 5th Infantry Brigade, originally directed to advance on Martuba by a more northerly route, traversed very rough country all the way and fell behind considerably. As the country round Derna appeared to be falling into our hands without great trouble, the objective of the 5th Brigade was altered, and it was instructed to secure the cross-roads at Giovanni Berta and at Lamluda, so as to cut off any enemy remaining in the Derna region. By making a wide turning moverhent over country the enemy had believed impassable, the 5th Brigade reached Lamluda on the r9th December and took many prisoners there. Giovanni Berta proved more difficult to capture as the enemy had left a detachment to cover it, but by the evening of the zoth that place, too, was in our hands. Derna was occupied on the 19th December, and by the 2st the 4th Indian Division had overrun the whole of the country east of Appollonia, Cirene, and El Faidia. After offering some resistance, Barce was taken during the afternoon of the 23rd. Bengasi itself was taken by a detachment from the 7th Armoured Division. By December 26th all organised resistance in the Gebel Akhdar had ceased, and the 4th Indian Division became responsible for restoring law and order in the hill country up to Bengasi."

            "description": "The landing grounds at Mechili were reported safe during the afternoon of the 19th December, and next morning squadrons which had followed close behind our forward troops began to use them. The speed with which aireraft began to operate from landing grounds immediately in rear of our foremost troops helped to compensate for our inability to send large land forces in pursuit of the enemy."

But when Italy was invaded, the Greeks, realising that the liberation of Greece would not immediately be attempted, relapsed into a civil war in which the E.L.A.S. bands set to work to destroy all other bands, so that they might ultimately claim to be the sole liberators of Greece. During the civil war no more supplies were sent to E.L.A.S., but Zervas, our most loyal ally, was kept supplied. By 19th December, 1943, both parties were exhausted and ready to come to terms and, after an appeal by M. Tsouderos, the Greek Prime Minister, negotiations for a renewal of the National Band Agreement were begun."
