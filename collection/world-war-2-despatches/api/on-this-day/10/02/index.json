From air reconnaissance carried out on Ist and 2nd October, it was known that a considerable enemy convoy was at sea; on the and it was sailing east in Naxos area, and the garrison commander on Cos assumed it was a reinforcement for Rhodes. The enemy's air superiority made it impossible for the Royal Navy to intercept the convoy by day, and a sweep carried out by destroyers on the night of 2nd October failed to locate it, At first light on the following day R.A.F. Beaufighters attacked the convoy, but without success. The garrison was therefore only conducting its ordinary routine precautions when, at 0500 hours on 3rd October, the enemy assault on Cos began, The seaborne invading forces, consisting of troops from the Greek mainland and from Crete, landed from merchant vessels, landing-craft and caiques, covered by aircraft and three destroyers, while a strong force of parachute troops, flown from the Greek mainland, was dropped on Antimachia airfield, which our aircraft were unable to use since it had been badly cratered in the air-raids which"

            "description": "bases and shipping was limited by the weather and the temporary unserviceability of our Cyrenaican landing grounds owing to rain. The enemy, on the other hand, taking full advantage of the proximity of his air bases, was able to make our reinforcements of Leros difficult. The dropping of flares at night hindered unloading operations on certain occasions, and the laying of minefields also added to our difficulties; in spite of all this enemy activity the strength of the Leros garrison was built up to the strength of a brigade. The original garrison, which had arrived between the 17th September and the 2nd October, was the 234th Brigade Headquarters, and the 2nd Royal Irish Fusiliers, with a company from the 2nd Royal West Kents, the remainder of the battalion being on Samos. This was reinforced by 4th November by the 4th Buffs, although their Headquarters Company was lost at sea, and early in November the Ist King's Own completed the Brigade."
