Even now, with Fifth Army on the Alban Hills and their centre disintegrating under Eighth Army’s blows, they continued to hope that the situation might yet be stabilized; captured enemy documents show that as late as 2nd June von Mackensen was still ordering resistance to the last and making plans for the redisposition of his forces with apparent confidence in the possibility of success.
