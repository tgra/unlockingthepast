(c) Our urgent and immediate need was
for reinforcements, which must be on a scale
not only to meet the present scale of attack,
but also that likely to be put in the field
against us;

(d) It was recommended that the United
States convoy at present directed to Brisbane
should proceed to Sourabaya, where aircraft
would be assembled and flown on to destina-

tion;

(e) It was desirable that the Chinese should
be asked to maintain the maximum pressure
on the Japanese in order to contain as many
divisions as possible, and subsequently to
provide bases for long-distance bombing
attacks on Japan.

Finally the conference considered that the
situation, though serious, need not give rise
to undue pessimism provided the necessary
reinforcements were supplied in the available
time, ‘but time was the essential feature.

Reinforcements.

118. From the 8th December, 1941, onwards
many requests for reinforcements had been
made from General Headquarters, Far East.

The time factor meant that reinforcements had’

to come from the Middle East, India and con-
voys already at sea rather than from the United
Kingdom. Complicated quadrangular refer-
ences between Malaya, India, the Middle East
and London were hence entailed, but Com-
mander-in-Chief, India, was most helpful in
appreciating the need for diversion to Malaya

of forces originally intended for his own com-'

mand. A sub-committee of the Inter-Allied
Conference, having considered all the previous
requests for reinforcements, agreed on the fol-
lowing immediate requirements for Malaya to
stabilise the situation:—
Air—
4 Fighter Squadrons;
4 Bomber Squadrons;
I Photographic Flight)
i Transport Flight; and
Reserves at 100 per cent. for fighters and
50 per cent. for bombers, plus aircraft to
complete existing squadrons and their re-
serves, :
Land—
1 Brigade Group;
1 Division;
Reinforcements for 9th and r1th Divisions;
3 Light A.A. Regiments;
2 Heavy A.A. Regiments;
x Anti-Tank Regiment;
50 Light tanks;
350 Anti-tank rifles;
Bofors ammunition; and
500 Tommy guns and ammunition;
Further large forces would be required
later in view of probable Japanese reinforce-
ments.
By the 27th December the following had been
definitely promised:—
Air—
51 Hurricanes. (One fighter squadron ex
convoy W.S, 12.Z with 18 additional pilots) ;
24 Blenheims. (One squadron from Middle
East);
52 Hudsons (from United Kingdom) ;
While measures were in hand aiming at
the release of a further 3 fighter squadrons
from the Middle East, and for 80 4-engined
United States bombers.

roth-25th December.

11g. In accordance with instructions from
London, a scorched earth policy was ordered
at this period instead of the denial scheme
referred to in para. 65 above.

The general situation on land by the rgth-
2ist December was that our troops were trying
to keep the enemy West of the River Perak,
while at the same time preventing him advan-
cing further South than the River Krian. To
this end the rth Indian Division, which it
was considered essential to maintain as a
fighting formation, was holding a line along the
River Kuran with the 28th Indian Infantry
Brigade, and also protecting Kuala Kangsar
with the r2th Indian Infantry Brigade, a de-
tachment of which was also further North along
the Grik road. The Division as a whole was
suffering from exhaustion, damaged feet and
loss of equipment. The 6th and r5th Indian
Infantry Brigades were now re-formed at Ipoh
as the composite 15th Infantry Brigade, while
a composite battalion of the and/z6th and
3rd /16th from these two Brigades was in Corps
Reserve, The Kelantan forces, 8th Indian
Infantry Brigade, gth Indian Division, had
suffered about a hundred casualties in each
battalion, and were now along the railway at
Manik i, Of elements not thus far engaged
in the main operations, the 22nd Indian Infan-
try Brigade (gth Indian Division) was at
Kuantan, while the Australian 22nd and 27th
Brigades were responsible for Johore, and
the xst and 2nd Malay Infantry Brigades for
Singapore Fortress. None of these last four
Brigades could be despatched North to relieve
the hard-pressed 11th Indian Division, ifor
the reasons given below. (See para. 138 below.)

120. Heavy enemy.air attack was now falling
on Ipoh aerodrome, and our own fighters were
driven further South to Kuala Lumpur
(Selangor). Attacks on our road and rail
communications were becoming an increasing
feature of the Japanese air operations. Recon-
naissance revealed that the enemy was now
making use of Sungei Patani aerodrome, where
thirty fighters were discovered. Our aircraft
were making night and dawn attacks on enemy
