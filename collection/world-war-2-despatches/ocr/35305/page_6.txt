5904 SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 17 OCTOBER, 1941

The initial scheme provided for the formation
of temporary maintenance depéts near the ports
of Brest and Nantes, but it was soon evident
that, with so long a line of communication,
an advanced base was required.

The use of the port of Havre had at first
been considered undesirable owing to certain
geographical and technical difficulties in the
air defence of the docks. These were, however,
overcome in mid-November, and an Advanced
Base area is now being established near this
port with the co-operation of the French
authorities, while Field Supply Depéts are being
set up further forward. By mid-December,
the staff of the Movement Control were working
some ninety stations, while fourteen ports were
in use for landing personnel, animals and stores.
Through these ports, a quarter of a million men,
forty-five thousand mechanical vehicles and a
monthly tonnage varying from sixty to one
hundred thousand tons of stores of all kinds
were imported and distributed to their various
areas and reserve depéts.

Works projects of great magnitude have been
in progress from the outset, and the problems
of accommodation have been many and complex.
An extensive programme of building and hutting
for depéts, hospitals and reinforcement camps
was put in hand, together with installations for
electric light and power, the bulk storage of
petrol and so on. A vast amount of minor
work in connection with accommodation has
been carried out by the Royal Engineers.

Railway construction at depdts and aero-
dromes has been undertaken by the Trans-
portation Services under very adverse weather
conditions.

The complicated nature of modern military
equipment has added greatly to the work of the
Royal Army Ordnance Corps, as regards both
storeholding and repair. Great difficulty has
been experienced in finding suitable accommo-
dation for depéts and workshops at the bases,
more especially since the whole of the resources
of France are engaged at high pressure on her
own war industries. New installations have
therefore been planned and are now under
construction. : ;

The maintenance of mechanical vehicles has
received constant attention and the number of
road accidents, and consequently of repairs,
has been greatly reduced through measures
taken by the Provost Service to enforce road
discipline.

The labour problem bids fair to become one
of great magnitude, and its solution may be
difficult. As no adequate labour force was
available on mobilisation, the gap was filled
by the temporary use of cavalry and infantry
reservists. Later, the Auxiliary Military Pioneer
Corps absorbed the various labour units already
in France. This Corps has carried out cheer-
fully and efficiently the important, but often
unexciting tasks allotted to its units.

I am grateful to the Government of India
for the high standard of the animal transport
units sent to France, which have proved their
usefulness on many occasions.

Major General P. de Fonblanque, General
Officer Commanding, Lines of Communication
Area, has under his command the greatest part
of the undertakings described above. They
now cover almost one third of France, stretching
from Dunkirk to Brest and from Cherbourg to
Marseilles.

The Welfare of the Force

23. The health of the Force has been good
and the number of troops in the care of medical
units has never exceeded 2-8 per cent. of the
strength of the Force, despite the unusually
severe weather conditions in December and
January.

I wish to express my appreciation of the work
of the Royal Army Medical Corps under my
Director of Medical Services, Major General
J. W. L. Scott.

The arrangements for leave came into force
on x8th December. The numbers permitted
to be absent on leave at any one time are based’
on the percentage of strength which can be spared
from the Force. By the end of January ten
days’ leave home had been granted to some sixty
thousand of all ranks and compassionate leave
had also been granted in deserving cases.

The question of leave was worked out in
great detail by the Adjutant General, Lieutenant
General Sir Douglas Brownrigg, and the members
of his staff.

The Expeditionary Force Institutes have now
established some ninety institutes open on the
Lines of Communication and bulk stores have
been established in forward areas to enable units
to replenish their own canteens. The same
organisation is providing concert parties and
mobile cinemas, and a proportion of the troops
are able to visit each week one of the enter-
tainments provided by the Entertainments
National Services Association.

1 am likewise grateful to those organisations
which have co-operated so whole-heartedly with
the Royal Army Chaplains Department in
attending to the welfare of the troops,

Amongst these are the Catholic Women’s
Guild, The Army Scripture Readers’ Association,
The Church Army, The Church of Scotland,
Toc H, The Salvation Army, The Young Men’s
Christian Association, and the Young Women’s
Christian Association.

The despatch and delivery of mails takes place
with regularity, and more than nine thousand
bags of mail have been handled in one day by
the Postal Service. The necessity for censor-
ship is fully realized, but there has been no
delay in the time taken in the transit of mail
for an ever increasing force,

The great distances between forward t
and the base made it necessary to depart from
the old established procedure whereby the 2nd
Echelon of the Adjutant General’s Branch has
always been located in the theatre of war.
This office is now established in Margate,
and the move has been fully justified by the
increased speed with which matters are now
handled.

Training and Organisation,

24. The absence of fighting has afforded
opportunities to continue the training of the
Force. Weapon training has been possible for
almost every unit, and thanks to the co-opera-
tion of the French Army, artillery practice
camps have been held and other training
facilities provided. Exercises with troops in-
volving road movement on a large scale have
been held and much progress has been made
in the technique of co-operation with the Royal
Air Force,

About eight hundred and fifty officers and
non-commissioned officers have been sent home
