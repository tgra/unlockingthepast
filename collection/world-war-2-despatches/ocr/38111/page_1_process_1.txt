The Main Threat,

6. In the main area of the S. w. Approaches, the first principle adopted was that of   the cork in  the bottle  , the object being to flood an area of sufficient depth to kill or keep submarines submerged from the Western limits of the St. George s:and Bristol Channels and the English Channel up to a point as near as possible to the route of our cross-channel convoys. The patrols were so calculated as to provide a cover of thirty minutes density in the area.. By this plan I expected a high percentage of kills if the U-Boats came through on the surface, or, alternatively, it would, force upon them maximum caution  tactics throughout their passage. In the latter event there would be a zone to the East of the flooded area in which U-Boats would be forced to surface for prolonged periods to recharge their batteries, and in which they could be attacked and hunted by air and surface 'forces with good prospects of success. Moreover, individual

patrol areas were so designed as to be readily.

removable from .one part of-the main area to another, so that.one portion could be immediately strengthened at. the expense of another in the. light of -the. situation  as it developed. Further, the  cork  could be pushed home or withdrawn at will.. In this way the plan preserved flexibility without detriment  to the principle upon which it was based.



The Need for Fighter Cover

7. The extent to which the   cork   could be inserted was considered dependent upon the

degr e of fighter cover that could be provided  

by A.E,A.F.,, since the Southern boundaries of our  patrols ran close in to the coast of France along which the enemy was expected to move his U-Boats under cover of-his fighters and shore defences. Once the assault was launched it was  expected that the enemy fighters  would be heavily: engaged in the area of the main battle and that no substantial numbers of S.E. fighters would be able to be spared for the protection of U-Boats: The commitment for providing fighter cover was not therefore likely to be a prolonged or heavy one, but it was reasonable to expect from the enemy some early reactions to the preparations in progress and also to any exetcises which took place before D-day. One such exercise, known as FABIUS, was considered sufficient in scope to make it possible that the enemy might believe the assault was starting.- Should this happen, I considered that it might be necessary

. prematurely to implement the plans of my Com-

mand in full, and in this case the requirement for S.E. fighter cover would become much more serious. I considered,  however, that at this stage our fighters would not be heavily committed elsewhere, and Air Commander-in-Chief,

A.E.A.F., confirmed  that full scale fighter sup- _

port could  be provided any time up to D-day. Provision for the protection of A/U aircraft against enemy long range fighters (Ju_ 88s) was to be met by allotting Mosquito and Beaufighter aircraft of my own Command for this task.

Convoy Cover

8. In addition to flooding the selected area, plans were made for the protection of our crosschannel convoys sailing along the South coast

 of England. I allotted this task principally to

the Fleet Air Arm Squadrons (eight of which  were placed under my operational control for * Overlord  ), backed by such 19 Group aircraft as I could spare from their main task.

Operation of Surface Hunting Groups

9. Surface hunting groups were to be operated under the control -of the Naval Commanders-inChief, Plymouth and Portsmouth. Co-operation between these Groups and aircraft was arranged between A.O.C. 19 Group and C-in-C Plymouth, who co-ordinated his own requirements and those of C-in-C Portsmouth.

AnTI-SHIP OPERATIONS

Tasks of 16 and 19 Groups .

ro. It was expected that the enemy would Jaunch an offensive with destroyers and light surface craft against dur convoys sailing to and from their assembly ports and on passage across the Channel. Air operations to meet this threat were to be conducted by 16 and 19 Groups, whose tasks were as: follows:  .

* 19 Group.

(i). To hunt and destroy E-Boats and S/W. Approaches and

 destroyers: in , the _, Western Channel. (ii), To provide anti-E- Boat and destroyer reconnaissance in conjunction with Naval Surface Forces operating in the area in @.
