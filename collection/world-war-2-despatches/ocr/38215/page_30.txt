158. On the 9th and roth December, Dutch
air reinforcements arrived in Malaya from the
Netherlands East Indies. They consisted of
three squadrons of Glenn Martin Bombers total-
ling 22 aircraft and one squadron of nine
Buffalo fighters. Unfortunately the Dutch
bomber pilots were not fully trained in night
flying or in advanced navigation over the sea,
so that it was necessary for them to return, a
squadron at a time, to the Netherlands East
Indies for further training in these subjects.
Nevertheless, the Netherlands East Indies had
shown a most co-operative spirit in sending
these aircraft, as well as. submarines, so
promptly to our assistance.

159. On the morning of the 11th December,
1941, rather more than roo aircraft were avail-
able for operations disposed as under :—

Bombers . z 18

The surviving aircraft from the Northern
aerodromes reinforced by a few from
the South.

160. On the 11th December it was decided
that the air policy should be as follows: —

(a) Bombing, except in special circum-
stances, to be confined to mght. This was
made necessary by the enemy’s fighter
superiority.

(6) The primary tasks of the fighters would
be the defence of the Singapore Base and the
protection of convoys bringing land and air
reinforcements to Malaya. The reason for
this was that we could not hope to regain
superiority without powerful reinforcements.
The safe arrival of such reinforcements was
therefore the first essential in our air
strategy.

As a result of this policy it was clear that
the Army would suffer from lack of air support
and of close co-operation in the fighting on the
mainland, though some seaward reconnaissance
would still be possible. I accepted this
situation.

SECTION XXI.—THE WiTHDRAWAL FROM
KELANTAN,

z61. On the 12th December 1941 the Com-
mander, 3 Indian Corps, visited Command
Headquarters to discuss the policy as regards
the Kelantan Force.

Jt will be recalled that the task of the Kelan-
tan Force had been the protection of the three
aerodromes in that State for the use of our
Air Force and the denial of them to the enemy.
In view of the situation some fresh instructions
were c.early necessary. The alternatives were
either to leave the force in Kelantan or to

SUPPLEMENT to tue LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

withdraw it for employment elsewhere. The

factors in favour of the former course were:—

(a) It might still be possible to prevent

the enemy making full use of the three aero-
dromes.

(6) The presence of our force in Kelantan
would contain a proportion of the enemy’s
force in that State.

(c) The moral effect of the withdrawal both
on the civil population and on our own
troops would not be good.

(d) We should probably lose some material
and equipment in the withdrawal.

In favour of a withdrawal were the following
factors : —

(a) The aerodromes were no longer required
by our Air Force and there seemed to be no
probabiity of them being required within a
reasonable period of time.

(b) It seemed probable that the main threat
would develop on the west coast, where we
had inadequate resources with which to
meet it.

(c) The communications of the Kelantan
Force, which now consisted of only a single
line railway with a number of bridges, were
precarious, especially ‘having in view the
enemy’s great air superiority.

(d) In view of (c) above and of the superi-
ority on land which the enemy was likely to
develop, it seemed probable that we should
Jose the force if it remained in Kelantan.

After full consideration I decided, with a
view to conserving our resources and concen-
trating them for the main battle which would
probably develop on the west coast, to with-
draw the Kelantan Force as soon as rolling
stock could be made available. This decision
was siibmitted to the C.-in-C., Far East, the
same afternoon and approved by him. Orders
were issued immediately and the evacuation
of surp.us stores started at once.

162. On the rath December the enemy
became very active and attacked in strength,
but the 2/10 Baluch Regt. counter-attacked,
coming to close grips with the enemy and
inflicting casualties.

On the 13th December the 2/10 Baluch
Regt. again inflicted casualties on the enemy
who were trying to advance round their flank.

163. During the mext few days the with-
drawal continued systematically, the enemy
being made to fight for each position, with
comparatively little loss to the defenders. By
the 16th December all surplus stores and equip-
ment had been evacuated and the withdrawal
of the troops by rail began, The 4/19 Hydera-
bads were the first to leave so that they could
tejoin their own brigade on the west coast.
On the roth December the railhead at Kuala
Krai was evacuated. The rearmost troops with-
drew from Kuala Krai on foot as the large
railway bridges a little south of that place had
by then been destroyed. Practically all the
stores and all the vehicles, except about 80
for which no railway flats were available, were
successfully evacuated. A rearguard under
Lt.-Col. McKellar, known as Macforce, was lett
behind to watch the railway and prevent the
repair of the bridges. It included troops of
therPahang Volunteers and the Malay Regi-
ment,;and carried out its duties most ‘efficiently,
