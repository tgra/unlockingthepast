SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

covered by this seotion of the Despatch, it may
be recorded here that 19 Indian Division, who
were responsible for a large area, held 15
Japanese Division with one brigade, the 98th.
At this stage (early May), troops were sot
available to evict the enemy from the strong
positions which they had prepared in the hills
some five miles east of Toungoo, and this enemy
force, which continued to be reinforced by
scattered detachments escaping from the north,
continued to be some menace to our com-
munications.

250. The armoured column, which on the
night 25th-26th April was 29 miles north
of Nyaunglebin, made a further rapid advance
on the 26th, capturing Nyaunglebin and driving
forward a further 19 miles; that is, to within
80 miles of Rangoon. The resistance en-
countered was reported as “increasingly dis-
organized ” and many casualties were inflicted ;
also three locomotives were captured, together
with rolling stock loaded with rations. On the
27th April, the armoured column met deter-
mined opposition at a village near Milestone 68
and fighting continued throughout the day,
Japanese suicide parties, who attempted to
destroy our tanks with pole-charges, having
to be eliminated. 17 Indian Division had passed
through 5 Indian Division on the 26th and was
busy mopping up and repairing crossings be-
hind the armoured column. Five bridges south
of Nyaunglebin had been destroyed by the
enemy and another washed away by a flooded
chaung. Valentine +bridge-layer tanks had
enabled our armour to cross, but our lorried
infantry was temporarily held up pending the
arrival of Bailey bridging.

251. By the morning of the 28th, the
armoured column had pushed forward another
six miles, but again met strong resistance at
Milestone 62, twelve miles north of Pegu. This
was cleared by nightfall, the Japanese losing
300 killed. Difficult country now lay ahead
with reservoirs and marshy ground. Both the
main road and the side-tracks were mined and
booby trapped, and these obstacles were
strongly covered by fire. Nevertheless, by the
29th April, 63 Brigade, supported by tanks,
had fought its way through Payagyi and
reached the outskirts of Pegu, despite stiff
opposition, both ground and air. To the north
of Pegu, an armoured detachment moved east,
just south of the Moyingyi Reservoir, and cut
the Pegu—Mokpalin road at Waw, 15 miles
north-east of Pegu.

252. 4 Corps was now straining every nerve
to get to Rangoon before 15 Indian Corps
could reach the city through the sea-gate. In
the present campaign they had captured or
destroyed 299 guns and killed over 16,000
Japanese, over 6,500 of whom had been
accounted for between the Ist and 28th April.
They thad cheerfully advanced and fought on
reduced rations to make room for more
ammunition and petrol. 17 ‘Indian
Division was now only some 50 miles from its
goal, and, it must be remembered, it was this
Division which had carried out such a gallant
withdrawal from Burma three years eatlier,
and, only the previous year, had fought so
magnificently in the defence of Imphal. 17
Indtan Division had an old score to settle,
and, if it was humanly possible, it was going
to be settled. But the obstacles to be overcome
were serious. Between 4 Corps and Rangoon

1925

lay the wide Pegu River, forming a very strong
defensive position. In this position was con-
centrated every available man that General
Kimura could raise, including, as we afterwards
found out, the whole of the Rangoon garrison,
They had orders “To ‘hold to the last”, and
the fanatical courage of the Japanese soldier
has never been questioned.

253. The Pegu River, astride our line of ad-
vance, was bridged in three places; the main
road bridge west of Pegu, the railway bridge
(branch line) about a mile to the north, and
the main railway bridge about three miles
further north. The enemy had prepared strong
positions on both banks of the river, including
Pegu itself, through which the river flows. I
do not believe, however, that these defences,
strong as they were, would have delayed 4
Corps—animated as it was by a fierce de-
termination to reach its objective—for very
long, had not a catastrophe intervened. A
violent tropical storm broke on the afternoon
of the 29th April and continued throughout the
night. All movement of tanks or wheeled
vehicles off the road became impossible; no
aircraft could land or take off ; the Pegu River
tose in full flood. It was a foretaste of the
coming monsoon, and I was indeed thankful
that the early capture of Rangoon was not de-
pendent on our land advance alone.

254. Despite the deep mud, 48 ‘Brigade
advanced on the 30th, stormed the Japanese
position at Milestone 51 at the point of the
bayonet and, by nightfall, that part of Pegu
which lies north of the river was in our hands.
North of Pegu, we thad an even more important
success. On the 30th, as our attack progressed,
the enemy blew all the three bridges, but at
both the railway bridges, our infantry, crawling
under heavy fire over the wrecked girders,
seized and held a small bridgehead. This most
gallant feat was the turning point of the battle ;
an attack on Pegu from the north-west had
been planned, but the ford eight miles up river
was found to be impracticable. The crossings
at the railway bridges, however, gave us what
we wanted—a bridgehead on the west bank.
Meanwhile, another infantry column drove the
enemy from a village six miles east of Pegu.

255. On this date also (the 30th April), we
rescued 350 British, American and Indian
prisoners of war. Their escort, on finding the
road to Moulmein cut at Waw, abandoned their
charges, but anly to be destroyed by our ad-
vancing troops. It was fitting that this rescue
should have been made by 17 Indian Division,
to which some of these prisoners had belonged
when they were captured in 1942.

256. The attack on Pegu progressed through-
out the Ist May, in a deluge of rain. « 99
Brigade attacked from the north, west of the
river, supported by 255 Indian Tank Brigade
firing from among the ruins of the northern
part of the town on the opposite bank. The
Japanese A.A. artillery had its hands full, both
in its normal and anti-tank réles, and we cap-
tured twelve guns. By nightfall, the town had
been practically cleared and the same night
the indomitable 17 Indian Division resumed
its advance south. It was a gallant effort.
Since our airstrips had been put out of action.
the troops had had to be further reduced to half
rations. They were hungry and soaked to the
skin, but their magnificent spirit was undimmed,
and Rangoon lay ahead. But they were not to
