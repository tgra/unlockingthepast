The 7oth British Division completed its
special training as L.R.P. brigades in the Now-
gong area by the end of October. Two extra
British Infantry battalions were added to the
Division to enable the requisite number of
.columns to be formed,

Troops other than infantry which were
absorbed in the Special Force, included two
field artillery regiments, an anti-tank regiment,
.a@ reconnaissance regiment, and two regiments
of the Royal Armoured Corps. On joining the
Special Force, the men of these units severed
for the time being their connection with their
original arm of the service.

6. The Special Force Headquarters opened
at Gwalior on the 25th October, for the training,
organisation and administration under H.Q.
Central Command of all L.R.P. forces and later
as required by South East Asia Command for
their operational control. This headquarters
was formed from resources made available from

. the 7oth Division and from personnel from the
United Kingdom. Its more important appoint-
ments were duplicated to allow of training and
planning to proceed concurrently, and it pro-
vided staffs where necessary for wings of the
L.R.P. brigades.

This was the general position of the Special
Force in November, and while the training of it
continued under me, it operated later in
strength against the enemy communications in
North Central Burma under the direction of the
Supreme ‘Allied Commander South East Asia
Command. The untimely death of Maj.-Gen.

Wingate at the outset of these operations was -

a tragic loss to the Force which had been his
conception from the start.

7. Airfield Defences.

Another extensive development was in the
land defence of airfields and airforce installa-
tions. The existing policy held good whereby
general and local land defence was the task of
the Army; but the R.A.F. were now to assist
to the limit of their own available resources.

Extensive camouflage measures were under-
taken to conceal airfields in the vulnerable area
of the Provinces of Assam, Bengal, Bihar, the
southern districts of Orissa, and in a coastal
belt of twenty-five miles from Orissa to Cape
Comorin.

To obliterate the traces of recent construc-
tion constituted a major difficulty, and a vast
campaign of grass and creeper growing had
been undertaken. The camouflage of the strips
themselves remained, however, the main prob-
lem owing to lack of materials, transport and
labour. Nevertheless progress was made.
Dummy aircraft of various designs were manu-
factured and put in use, and thirty decoy sites
in Bengal had been projected as a defensive
measure against night attack.

8. Chemcal Warfare and Special Weapons.
The use of gas by the Japanese seemed un-
likely, particularly so in view of the strategical
conditions on the Burma front.
-In order to lighten the load on the individual
* fighting soldier, I decided, with certain excep-
tions, to withdraw respirators and anti-gas
equipment from formations and units joining
the field army. Exceptions were the crews of
tanks and carriers. The equipment withdrawn
was, however, stored in forward ordnance de-
pots under special arrangements to admit of its

being rapidly issued in emergency. Anti-gas
training also continued, and a high standard

,was maintained, and for security reasons Com-

manders were directed to exercise discretion in
promulgating this policy.

9. Flame Weapons and Coloured Smokes.

A number of flame weapons, ‘both man-pack
and carrier-borne, were ordered from England
for 1943 and 1944, but their tactical use, the
arm of the service that will use them, and the
scales and method of maintenance in the field
remain to be decided after trials and demon-
strations have been carried out.

While it was decided to use coloured smokes
with mortars and certain smaller calibre guns,
none were yet available for these weapons.
Two thousand coloured smoke generators only
were provided from England, and small quan-
tities of grenades, filled with red and yellow
smoke only, were available from indigenous
production m India.

TRAINING

ro. The experience gained in recent opera-
tions and in Arakan exposed various short-
comings in our training, and this gave rise to
many of the measures carried out during the
period under review. Indeed, some of the
Measures introduced constituted fundamental
changes in our policy and practice in regard to
military training as a whole. In addition to
the expansion of our training framework in
various directions, much reorganisation and im-
provement of existing training formations, and
installations was effected. The most important
of these developments are summarised below.

11. The selection of candidates for commissions.

Since the war expansion of the Indian Army
began, selection has been by means of inter-
view boards. These boards consisted originally
of certain senior civil and military officers, and
were district and provincial in character.
Though this system had met with considerable
success, there was a high subsequent wastage
at Officers’ training schools, During the
period, these boards were centralised in General
Headquarters, and scientifically organised on
the system already evolved in the United King-
dom. By these means it was hoped to save
time and effort, as well as to select the embryo
officer at the outset for the work to which he
was most suited.

Similarly selection of officers for the Women’s
Auxiliary Corps (India) was commenced by
means of interview boards on the same lines.

12. The Training of Officers.

In order to provide the large number of staff
officers that were required for static formation
headquarters, it was decided in August to start
at the Staff College a series of short courses, each
of 60 students. The students for these short
courses were primarily selected from those who
were over age for the ordinary Staff College
course, and physically incapable of carrying out
staff duties in active formations.

The syllabus for instruction at the Tactical
School was completely revised to cover jungle
warfare and warfare in Eastern countries rather
than desert warfare on which its efforts had
primarily been concentrated.
