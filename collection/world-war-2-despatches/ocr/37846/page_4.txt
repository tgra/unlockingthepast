more favourable conditions. This same spirit
prevailed in the fighter squadrons which were
operating from forward aerodromes in condi-
tions of extreme discomfort. Although out-
, numbered and armed with aircraft inferior in
performance to those of the enemy, the pilots
never hesitated to give battle whenever the
enemy appeared. .

Reinforcement Plan.

15. Early in the new year, I visited Cairo
in order to discuss the question of reinforcement
which was then under revision. Operations
in the Western Desert were being brought to a
successful conclusion and it was hoped that,
by the time the weather conditions had im-
proved in Greece so as to allow occupation of
more aerodromes, it would be hg to spare
additional squadrons from the Middle East
Command. The reinforcement plan envisaged
a total force in Greece of fourteen squadrons
and I intimated that I would be prepared to
start accepting the additional squadrons by
r5th January. Â«It was hoped that the whole
programme would be complete by 15th April.
In planning the reinforcement programme, I
again endeavoured to get permission to use the
aerodromes in the Salonika area, some of which
had remained generally serviceable throughout
the winter and could be occupied forthwith.
The Germans, however, had commenced their
infiltration into Roumania, and the Greek
Government were particularly anxious to avoid
giving them any idea that we had any hostile
intentions in Macedonia which could be directed
only against German interests.

The Greek Air Force.

16. As I have stated already in this report,
the Greek Air Force had suffered severe casual-
ties in the early stages of the war and by the
end of the year, it was reduced to a mere token
force of a few serviceable operational aircraft.
Promises of the provision of modern fighter
aircraft had been received from the U.S.A.,
and the British Government had agreed also to
supply aircraft as and when they became avail-
able. Whilst admiring the esprit de corps and
enthusiasm of the officers and airmen of the
Greek air force, I considered that operation-
ally they had a lot to learn before they would
get full value out of really modern aircraft.
Similarly, from the maintenance point of view,
a considerable amount of re-organisation was
necessary before they would be able to main-
tain a reasonable degree of serviceability. As
these American and British aircraft would be
pores presumably at the expense of the

A.F, reinforcement or expansion programme,
I was determined to do all I could to ensure
that full use was made of them. I had pre-
viously discussed the whole problem with H.M.
the Kong of Greece and the Prime Minister

and had made the suggestion to them that a
British Mission of qualified R.A.F. officers and
airmen should be appointed to help them in the
reconstruction of their flying service. They
- welcomed the suggestion and in due course a
mission was provided, and the work of re-
organising the Greek air force on modern lines
was commenced. In addition to their primary
role, the Mission undertook also to reconnoitre
and supervise the work on all the new aero-
dromes which it was desired to use in spring,
and much valuable work they did in this
respect. ,

SUPPLEMENT To tur LONDON GAZETTE, 9 JANUARY, 1047

Offer of British Expeditionary Force.

17. Early in January, conferences were held
to discuss the possibility of sending a British
expeditionary force to Greece, but the Greek
General Staff, on learning the limited size of
the force that could be made available at the
time, decided that its presence would only tend
to provoke Germany, whilst it was not strong
enough to be able to provide any very material
support. .

Battle for Valona,

18. The Greek General Staff now realised
that, if as seemed probable the Germans in-
tended to make a move through the Balkans,
they might be faced in the spring with a cam-
paign on two fronts. They therefore con-
sidered it essential that every effort should be
made to bring the Italian campaign to an end
before such an eventuality arose, or at any rate
to shorten their front in Albania as much as
possible so as to have troops available to
strengthen their front in Macedonia. The
appreciated that an advance to a line n
of Valona would certainly accomplish the latter
and might conceivably, in view of the low
morale of the Italians at that time, achieve the
former. Consequently, early in February, the
Greek armies in Albania started a fierce offen-
sive in the direction of Valona. The prelimin-
ary attacks were successful and a certain
amount of progress was made. Bad weather,
however, intervened and, although the Greek
soldiers fought with their customary heroic dis-
regard of danger, the Italians were able to
bring up reinforcements and the advance was
held up just north of Tepelene.

Change of Air Policy.

1g. This battle for Valona is interesting from
the air point of view inasmuch as a change
of policy was forced upon us. Hitherto, my
bombing offensive had been directed almost
entirely upon lines of communication, ports
and aerodromes to the rear, and with the
limited means at my disposal was, I think,
instrumental in reducing the flow of reinforce-
ments and supplies to the Italian armies in the
field. When discussing this new operation both
with His Majesty the King and the Commander-
in-Chief, they stressed the vital importance of
a success, particularly as the morale of the
nation had recently been badly shaken by the
death of their Prime Minister, General Metaxas.
They pointed out that the Greek soldiers on
the front had experienced a severe winter and,
although full of fight, were not too well off for
munitions and supplies. Consequently, it was
essential that they should have the utmost en-
couragement and support that could be pro-
vided, This could best be given by my bomber
force being used in close support of the Greek
attack. I produced all the stock arguments
against this form of co-operation, and stressed
the fact that by bombing enemy communica-
tions leading to the battlefield a greater degree
of help would be given to their troops fighting
the actual battle. However, they reminded me
that the morale of some of the Greek soldiers
had been shaken severely by enemy bombing
attacks, and that the success of the whole opera-
tion might depend on the stimulus afforded by
seeing the Italians treated in the same way. I
therefore acceded to their requests.
