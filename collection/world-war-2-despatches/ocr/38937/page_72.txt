divisions, incorporated as replacements in three
of the original divisions, are counted. Summing
up I said:

“To put it briefly, we shall have to con-
tinue the battle of Italy with about twenty
divisions, almost all of which have had long
periods of heavy fighting this year, and some
for several years, against the twenty German
divisions committed to the battle front, with
the prospect of four more German divisions,
and probably two Italian divisions, joining
in the battle at a later stage. We are inflicting
very heavy losses on the enemy and are

* making slow but steady progress, but our
losses are also heavy and we are fighting in

country where, it is generally agreed, a

superiority of at least three to one is required

for successful offensive operations. It will be
small wonder, therefore, if we fail to score

a really decisive success when the opposing

forces are so equally matched ’’.

I was naturally fully conscious that by thus
battling on against odds we were fulfilling our
function in the grand strategy of the war, what-
ever the cost and even though we were to make
no progress on the ground at all. I was repeat-
edly reminded that this was the crisis of the
war and that now more than ever it was vital
to hold down the maximum forces in Italy,
away from the vital theatres in east and west.*
From this point of view the balance of strength
in Italy was definitely in our favour and I was
determined to keep it so; but I could not help
considering the question of how long I could
keep up the pressure. With the present rela-
tionship between the opposing forces, even
though enemy casualties exceeded ours, it
would be impossible to continue hammering
away at full stretch indefinitely, and to sus-
pend operations, if the suspension were long
extended, would be to renounce the whole ob-
ject of the campaign. The first relief I could
expect would be from the newly formed Italian
Combat Groups; they were still an unknown
quantity but would at least be useful in a
defensive réle. The first was expected to be
ready by the end of October, the second by the
middle of November; two more by the middle
of December and two by January. In the
event only five were formed; Cremona, Man-
tova, Folgore, Legnano and Friuli. Cremona
was the first to see active service, in January
1945. The Brazilians were also an unknown
quantity, though they were well equipped and
in good strength. They gave a good account
of themselves in the final offensive of the fol-
lowing spring. The coloured troops of the
United States 92 Infantry Division proved un-
suited for modern combat conditions; the divi-
sion was eventually reorganized, and made into
an effective formation by incorporating one
Japanese-American and one white American
Regimental Combat Team, the latter formed
from converted anti-aircraft gunners,

Eighth Army enters the Romagna.

I have already alluded to the difficulties of
operations in the Romagna and the fact that
water was now the main obstacle to Eighth
Army’s advance rather than high ground. The
whole area is nothing but a great reclaimed
swamp—and not wholly reclaimed in some
parts—formed by the lower courses of numerous

rivers flowing down from the Apennines in their
new north-easterly direction. The principal
rivers are, in order from east to west, the Uso,
the Savio, the Ronco, the Montone (these last
two after their confluence take the name of
Fiumi Uniti), the Lamone, the Senio, the
Santerno, the Sillaro and the Idice; these are
only the principal rivers and there are hundreds
of smaller streams, canals and irrigation ditches
in between them. By these, and by canalization
of the main rivers, the primitive swamp had
been drained after centuries of patient effort
and, as the water flowed off, so the level of
the ground sank; the river beds were thereby
left higher than the surrounding ground and
as soon as they descend into the plain all these
rivers need high banks on either side to keep
them in their course and to guard against the
sudden rise of level which heavy rainfall in
the mountains invariably causes. Even in the
best drained areas the soil remembers its
marshy origin and when rained on forms the
Tichest mud known to the Italian theatre. It
will be seen, therefore, that under autumn con-
ditions we should have difficulty in making
full use of our armoured superiority. Tanks
were hampered also by the intensive cultiva-
tion, and in particular by the vineyards. The
Germans had prepared fieldworks and well-
studied plans for defence on all the main water
lines and were determined to offer the most
stubborn resistance in this vital sector. To
Kesselring his eastern flank was the pivot
which, if a withdrawal was forced on him, he
would have to hold firmly in order to swing
back his right into a position blocking the ap-
proaches to Austria through north-eastern Italy,
whether that position was based on the line
of the Po and Ticino or the Adige. The pivot
was not, however, in serious danger until he
was forced back to a line between the Valli di
\Comacchio, a large lagoon on the Adriatic
shore, south of the Po, and Bologna in the
south-west. Before that position was reached
he had reason to hope that the cumulative effect
of so many opposed river crossings and the
deterioration of the weather would bring Eighth
Army’s offensive to a standstill.

» The Canadians crossed the Marecchia by
Rimini on 21st September and the next day
the New Zealanders passed through 1 Canadian _
Division to exploit up the coast. 5 Corps also
reached the river on the 22nd, having mopped
up the Coriano area, and on the 23rd exploited
forward to make contact with the ridge be-.
tween the Marecchia and the Uso. By the 25th
the enemy was generally back behind the Usa
but not in very good order and advances were
made all along the Army front. In the plains
we had cleared the whole eastern bank of the
Fiumicino by 29th September but the enemy
was still holding out in the foothills south of
Route 9 when the rain descended with great
violence for four successive days. All the fords
over the Marecchia and Uso became impass-
able and the approaches to the bridges, neces-
sarily more congested, were in very bad con-
dition; the Fiumicino, normally a shallow
trickle, swelled to a width of thirty feet and its
speed and depth made it impossible for in-
fantry patrols to cross. Going off the roads
became quite impossible. The enemy took
heart from this to maintain a steadfast resist-
ance and it was not until 5th October that the
