screen, course having been altered to. 340
degrees at 1635. Our destroyers were well clear
of the smoke by 1700 but the enemy were out
of sight, evidently having retired at high speed
to the Westward and South-westward.

47. Between 1640 and 1925 a series of heavy
bombing. attacks were made on our fleet by
enemy aircraft operating from shore bases.
WARSPITE was bombed at 1641, 1715, 1733,
1823 and 191x. EAGLE was bombed at 1743,,
1809, 1826, 1842 and 1900. These two ships
received the most attention but the 7th Cruiser
Squadron received numerous attacks and many
bombs fell near the destroyers. In some cases
attacks were made from a considerable height.
There were no hits and the fleet suffered no
damage but there were numerous near misses
and a few minor casualties from splinters.
MALAYA claimed to have damaged two air-
craft with A.A. fire but no enemy machines
were definitely seen to crash.

48. From 1700 the fleet steered 270 degrees,
. the destroyers forming Cruising Order No. 3
in company with the 7th Cruiser Squadron to
the Northward of WARSPITE. By 1735 the
fleet was within 25 mules of the coast of Calabria
and course was altered to 200 degrees. When,
however, it became clear that the enemy had
no intention of resuming the fight and could
not be intercepted before making Messina,
course was altered to 160 degrees at 1830 to
open the land and to 130 degrees at 1930

49. After the action, as subsequently
reported by WARSPITE’s aircraft, the enemy
fleet was left in considerable confusion, all units
making off at high speed to the South-west and
Westward towards the Straits of Messina and
Port Augusta. It was not until 1800 that they
sorted themselves out, the cruiser squadrons
taking station to the South-eastward of their
battleships and destroyers to the North-west
and astern of them. The last enemy report was
received from WARSPITE’s aircraft at 1905
and the enemy fleet was then in position 37°
54’ N, 16° 21’ E, i.e about ro miles off Cape
Spartivento, steering 230 degrees at 18 knots.

They were attacked by their own bombers at
1705 and again at 1857. No hits were
observed.

50. At 2115 course was altered to 220 degrees
for a position South of Malta. There were no
incidents during the night.

51. The following destroyers were detached
so as to arrive at Malta at 0500:—STUART.
DAINTY, DEFENDER, HYPERION, HOS.
TILE, HASTY, ILEX, JUNO. (STUART
arrived with only 15 tons of fuel remaining).

52. At 0800 the fleet was in position 35° 24’
N, 15° 27’ E., steering West, and remained
cruising to the South of Malta throughout the
day while destroyers were fuelled.

53. An air raid took place on Malta at 0855
but no destroyers were hit. Three or four‘enemy
aircraft were shot down.

54. The first batch of destroyers completed
fuelling at 1715 and rejomed the Commander-
in-Chief at’ 1525. HERO, HEREWARD,
DECOY, VAMPIRE and VOYAGER were then
sent in, the last three to sail with convoy M.S.
One after refuelling. At 2030 ROYAL
SOVEREIGN with NUBIAN, MOHAWK and
JANUS were sent in, and GLOUCESTER and

STUART were detached to join convoy M.F.
One which had been sailed from Malta by the
Vice-Admiral, Malta, ‘at 2300 on oth July
escorted by DIAMOND, JERVIS, and VEN-
-DETTA.

55. Flying boat reconnaissance of Augusta
had located 3 cruisers and 8 destroyers in har-
bour and a! 1850 EAGLE’s stnking force was
flown off io carry out a dusk attack. Un-
fortunately these forces had left harbour before
the stnking force arrived. One flight, however,
located a destroyer of the NAVIGATORI class
in a small bay to the Northward and sank it.
The other flight returned without having
dropped torpedoes. The striking force landed at
Malta on completion of the operation.

56. At zooo the 7th Cruiser Squadron was
detached to search to the Eastward in the wake
of convoy M.F. One.

57. At 2100 the fleet was in position 35° 28’
N, 14° 30° E., steering 180 degrees. There
were no incidents during the mght.

58. At o130 course was altered to 000 degrees
so as to be in position 35° 10’ N, 15° 00’ E.,
at 0800. ROYAL SOVEREIGN, with HERO,
HEREWARD, NUBIAN, MOHAWK and
JANUS, rejcined from Malta at this time and
EAGLE landed on the striking force from Malta.

59. At ocoo the Commander-in-Chief in
WARSPITE screened by NUBIAN, MOHAWK,
JUNO and JANUS, proceeded ahead at 19
knots to return to Alexandna. The Rear-
Admiral, 1st Battle Squadron, in ROYAL
SOVEREIGN, with EAGLE and MALAYA and
remaining destroyers, proceeded on a mean line
of advance of o80 degrees at 12 knots to cover
the passage oi the convoys.

bombing aitacks. Between 1248 and 1815 five
attacks were made on WARSPITE and attendant
destroyeis, 56 bombs being dropped. Between
r1m2 and 1804, twelve attacks were carned
out on the forces in company with the Rear-
Admiral, rst Battle Squadron, about 120 bombs
being dropped, and four bombing attacks were
carried out on convoy MS. One. There was no
damage and no casualties. It was noted that
the ship was shadowed by aircraft who trans-
mitted “‘ longs ’’ by W/T at intervals in order
to direct attacking aircraft.

61. At 1300 convoy M.S. One was passed and
VAMPIRE relieved JANUS on WARSPITE’s
screen, JANUS remaining with the convoy.
