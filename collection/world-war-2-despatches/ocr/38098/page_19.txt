SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 16 OCTOBER, 1947

RENOWN. As contact was now definitely
established course was altered to 180° to range
the striking force and aircraft were flown off at
0926 in position 47° 16’ N. 15° 51’ W.

59. In the meantime the spotting aircraft

which had been flown off at o509 had become’

lost in rain, failed to establish contact by
W/T with KING GEORGE V and eventually
had to be D/Fd back.

60. After sighting MAORI I considered
detaching ARK ROYAL to the southward to
range the striking force, keeping RENOWN in.
the vicinity of MAORI ready to ‘support
KING GEORGE V and RODNEY as required.
I decided thowever that the appearance of
RENOWN on the scene before KING
GEORGE V established contact was undesir-
able in view of the low visibility and further-
more it was imperative to afford ARK ROYAL
the maximum d of protection should
KING GEORGE V fail to establish contact and
thus leave the third striking force as the only
means of dealing with BISMARCK.

61. Heavy gunfire was heard to the north-
ward at 0855 but no report was received in-
dicating what ship or ships were in action.

62. At 0940 SHEFFIELD appeared from the
westward, and I ordered her to join ARK
ROYAL on a course of 290° while RENOWN

turned towards the scene of action to investi-*

gate. ARK ROYAL was instructed to fly off
a spotting aircraft for RENOWN.

63. At 0952 a signal was intercepted from
Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, ordering
destroyers to close. Five minutes before this
I had informed Commander-in-Chief, Home
Fleet, that SHEFFIELD and ARK ROYAL
had been detached, and that RENOWN was
closing him from the southward; I also
requested his position, course and speed.

64. The Commander-in-Chief’s signal order-
ing the destroyers to close coupled with NOR-
FOLK’s signal that she had ceased flank mark-
ing and Rear-Admiral Commanding, Ist
Cruiser Squadron’s signal ordering DORSET-
SHIRE to torpedo BISMARCK at close range,
led me to suppose that the action was success-
fully concluded so in view of the Admiralty
signal which had just been received indicating
that a heavy scale of air attack was to be
expected I decided to rejoin ARK ROYAL to
aftord A.A. protection. I informed Commander-
in-Chief, Home Fleet, accordingly at 0953.

65. At 1025 as I still had no definite in-
formation I asked Commander-in-Chief if he
had disposed of the enemy; the replied that she
was still afloat, adding three minutes later that
he could not get her to sink by gunfire. Shortly
afterwards Commander-in-Chief ‘also informed
me that he had been forced to discontinue the
action on account of fuel. I was about to order
the T/B striking force to finish off the BIS-
MARCK when DORSETSHIRE, who had been
ordered by Rear-Admiral Commanding, tst
Cruiser Squadron to torpedo the enemy at close
range, reported at 1034 that the BISMARCK
was sinking and at 1039 that she had been
sunk. "

66. The torpedo striking force from ARK
ROYAL located the BISMARCK just in time
to see the finish of the action. The enemy was

‘ c

4865

duwn in the water, on fire and silenced.
DORSETSHIRE was seen to be in close
proximity to BISMARCK and would have been
endangered by a torpedo attack on the latter,
The striking force therefore closed KING
GEORGE V for instructions but could obtain
no answer either by V/S or W/T. The striking
force then returned to the vicinity of the
BISMARCK and were in time to see DORSET-
SHIRE sink her with torpedoes from close
range.

67. Meanwhile at 0955 an enemy aircraft had
been sighted ‘by RENOWN and _ engaged.
About this time COSSACK and NORFOLK’
both reported that they were being bombed.
SHEFFIELD’S R.D.F. was not efficient owing
to damage from splinters when she had been
engaged by BISMARCK. Enemy aircraft were
sighted from time to time and engaged when-
ever they came out of the clouds. Weather
conditions prevented the use of fighters. There
appeared to be both Focke-Wolfes and Heinkels
present.

68. The striking force returned about 1115
and were ordered to jettison their torpedoes
before landing on as the motion of the ship was .
even greater than the previous day and to land
on with torpedoes would have jeopardised the
aircraft. Whilst landing on was in progress a
Heinkel came out of the clouds and dropped a
stick of two large and about five smaller bombs
600 yards astern and to port of ARK ROYAL.
This’ was the last interference experienced by
Force ‘‘H’”’. Landing on was completed by
1152, and from then on the air appeared clear
of enemy aircraft and course was shaped to the
southward at 24 knots.

APPENDIX.

CoasTAL COMMAND OPERATIONS IN CONNECTION
WITH THE BISMARCK AND Prinz EUGEN
2IsT-27TH May, 1941.

May 21st.

At 1300 hours an aircraft of P.R.U. located
and photographed one Bismarck class battleship
and one Hipper class cruiser at anchor in small
fiords near Bergen.

The weather deteriorated during the afternoon
and evening but a strike of 6 Whitleys of No. 612
Squadron and 12 Hudsons of Nos. 220 and 269
Squadrons took off between 2150 and 2330
hours to attack. Owing to bad weather con-
ditions only 2 Hudsons dropped bombs, and
poor visibility prevented any results being
observed.
May 2and.

Aircraft patrolled off the Norwegian coast
from first light but weather conditions by 1000
hours had forced all of them to return. Blen-
heims of No. 248 Squadron maintained meteoro-
logical sorties off the coast all day reporting
the weather conditions, which became. worse
with 10/10 cloud down to sea level.

Sunderlands of No. zor Squadron maintained
a patrol up the meridian of 5° West between
latitudes 6220 N and 6500 N from 0930, but had
to return at 1100 on account of fog with nil
visibility.
