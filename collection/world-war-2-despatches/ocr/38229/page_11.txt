SUPPLEMENT To tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948

‘withdrawal to the Sittang position commenced.
On the 22nd our forces had reached the right
‘bank of the Sittang.

107. During this period air operations con-
tinued at the maximum intensity practicable
in support of the Army. The air battle of Ran-
goon still continued. With the loss of Moulmein
we lost our forward air base in this area,
‘Consequently, air operations, both fighter and
bomber, were carried out from the main air
base at Rangoon. Furthermore, with the cap-
ture of territory by the enemy, our warning
system in Tenasserim was rapidly rolled up.
Now warning of the approach of enemy raids
‘over Tenasserim was impossible. For the de-
fence of Rangoon we still had observer posts to
the East of Rangoon, while our R.D.F. set
provided some warning. But the interception
of enemy aircraft supporting the Japanese Army
‘was impracticable unless such attacks took place
when our fighters were present over the line.

108. The Supreme Commander, General Sir
Archibald Wavell, visited the command during
the last week of January and on the 5th
February. At these meetings I explained the
air situation and our urgent need for reinforce-
ments, particularly the acceleration of the
2 reinforcing Hurricane Squadrons which had
been promised and for an allocation of 24 Hurri-
canes per month from the flow. As regards
bombers, I asked for 2 further remforcing Blen-
heim Squadrons, for 16 Blenheims to equip
60 Squadron and for 12 Blenheims a month from
ABDA Command flow of maintenance aircraft,
and additionally for the Mohawks to re-equip
the 2 Lysander Squadrons. General Wavell
said that he would do what he could to meet
these requirements, but explained the pressing
need for air support in Malaya and the N.E I.

109. During thé period 16th to 23rd February
the maximum effort that could be put forward
by the bombers was 102 sorties, in which
89,992 Ibs. of bombs were released in low flying
attacks on the enemy, accompanied by machine
gun fire. Such objectives as the ra:lway station
at Moulmein, troop concentrations and M.T.,
river traffic and aerodromes were bombed.
Direct hits on such things as trains and paddle
steamers in Sittang were observed. Fighter
support for the Army and the security of our
bombers continued.

Air Action on the Bilin-Kyaikto Road.

110. For the first time in the campaign the
enemy provided a satisfactory bombing target.
‘On the 21st an enemy column of some 300 or
more vehicles, ox-carts and M.T. was reported
on the road between Bilin and Kyaikto. The
‘“bomb line’ ran North and South through
Kyaikto. The total fighter effort of the Rangoon
defence and what bombers were at readiness
were ordered to attack at 16.25 hours. -The
first sortie off was one of 12 P 4o’s at 16.30,
closely followed by 8 Hurricanes at 16.40. A
tetal of 38 fighter sorties and 8 Blenheim sorties
were engaged in the attack. Direct hits were
reported on MT: and horse transport accom-
panied by many fires. The village of Kyaikto
through which the column was passing was also
set on fire. At 16.25 hours the Army Head-
quarters moved the ‘‘ bomb line ’’ to-a line run-
ning North and South 2 miles West of Kyaikto.

111. The enemy had during the afternoon of
the 21st penetrated through the village of
Kyaikto and moved along the road running
North to Kimmun. That afternoon their in-
fantry were seen by the Duke of Wellingtons
West of this road (and North of the Kyaikto
Road). Their thrust that mght at the Sittang
Bridge took place up this roadj when they
worked round our left flank and attacked the
Bridge inthe rear of the 16th and 46th
Brigades. It is evident that although our air
attack in some weight on the enemy’s main
column could not have entirely prevented his
attack from developing, 1t must have reduced
its scale and intensity. ‘

Alleged bombing of own Troops.

112. There was an incident reported on this
day and remarked upon in Army reports. It
is alleged that our troops at Mokpalin were
bombed and machine gunned by some Blenheim
aircraft between 12.00 and 15.00 hours. The
facts are that at the request of Army Head-
quarters 8 Blenhems bombed Kawbein (near
Bilin) in the morning and landed back at their
base after mid-day. After an exhaustive en-
quiry, in which I have taken the opinion both
of Officers who were in the air and on the
ground, I have failed to reach a firm conclusion
that our aircraft did, in fact, bomb our own
troops at this time and place. The enquiry
is complicated by such statements as ‘‘ the
attacking aircraft were identified by roundels
on the underside of their wings ’’—our Blen-
heims have roundels on the upper side of the
wing but certainly not on the underside, and
the possibility that the Japanese used captured
Blenheims during this campaign should be.con-
sidered. There is, moreover, a great similarity
between the plan silhouette of the Japanese
Army 97 medium bomber and the Blenheim,
and there must have been a number of enemy
bombers flying over Mokpalin about this trme
because the enemy effort was concentrated on
the Sittang area, a few mules to the West of
Mokpalin. _ Since, however, the country be-
tween the Rivers Sittang and Bilin 1s closely
covered in jungle, I consider it not improbable
that some crews by mistake may have bombed
the wrong objective. The enemy effort reached
on this day a total of go fighters and 12 bombers
in action in the Sittang area. The Sittang
Bridge was the scene of the heaviest attacks.

113. In the meantime, Mandalay had its first
attack by 10 bombers on the roth.

u4 G.R. Escort for Shipping..—Such escort
to shipping, GR. reconnaissance and coast-
wise search in the Gulf of Martaban as was
practicable was.carried out with the slim effort
available. Fighter support against bomber
attack was provided once our convoys came
in range.

115. To extend the range of our reconnais-
sance for this purpose and to give forewarning
of enemy naval movements in the direction of
the Andaman Islands}. it was decided to locate’
reconnaissance aircraftrat Port Blair. The con-
struction of a landing: ground in' the Andaman
Islands presented some difficulty, but after con-
siderable work it was possible to construct a
runway of 800 yards at Port Blair. The only
type of reconnaissance aircraft available that
could be operated from such a base was the
Lysander and 2.of these aircraft were fitted
