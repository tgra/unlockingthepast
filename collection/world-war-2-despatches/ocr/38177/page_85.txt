SUPPLEMENT to tar LONDON GAZETTE, 15 JANUARY, 1948

lays down the policy to be adopted for the
defence of Cyprus against attack by airborne
and seaborne forces.

‘2. Appreciation—In order to launch a ‘large
scale attack- on Cyprus by airborme and sea-
borne forces, it is necessary for the enemy to
be: established -in- Southern Anatolia. Without
this he cannot give fighter cover to his troop-
carrying aircraft or sea convoys, nor can he
give them air support for their landings and
subsequent operations. The possibility of an
attack will become apparent when the enemy
begins an advance into Anatolia.

3. The probable scales of attack are given in
Appendix A.*

While the enemy is not established in
Southern Anatolia only small scale raids by
pafachutists .or landing parties are to be
expected.

: 4. Object—My object is to secure Cyprus so
as to ensure the use of air bases on the island
for ourselves and to deny them to the enemy.

5- Forces guailable.—The forces available
for the defence of Cyprus against the scales of
attack given in Appendix A are detailed in
Appendix B.* They will i known as the
‘*-Approved Garrison.’

6. Intention.Should an attack on Cyprus
develop, my intention is that the garrison shall
meet the enemy with a mobile and aggressive
defence based on secure keeps and prepared
positions ‘astridé the main lines of approach
inland from the coast.

Method—

7. Command.—You will take command of
all troops in Cyprus and become Commander
25 Corps. The present Commander 25 Corps
and staff will remain in Cyprus at your disposal
and his functions will be decided as a result of
recommendations to be made by you as soon as
possible after receipt of this Instruction. You
will submit your recommendations to G.H.Q.
for approval, including any possible reduction
or adjustment of his staff.

:. Your task is to revise and adjust the de-
fence scheme of the island according to the
principles laid down in succeeding paragraphs.
In making this plan every consideration will
be given to the present layout of R.A.F. and
administrative installations. The plan will be
submitted to G.H.Q., M.E.F. for approval,
and when approved will not be altered without
reference to G.H.Q.

g. The highest possible proportion of the
** Approved Garrison ’’ must be made avail-
able for mobile operations against enemy land-
ings. Mobile columns must, however, be based
on secure keeps, which must be held by
nucleus garrisons until the tactical situation
requires their reinforcement up to the full garri-
son for which they are designed. -

10. The security of aerodromes is important
both to ensure their use by our own air forces
and to deny them to the enemy. It is not
possible to provide from the resources available
sufficient troops for adequate protection of all
aerodromes now in existence, but in the siting
of defended keeps and mobile reserves due con-
sideration will be given to the security of
R.A.F. landing grounds. Any landing grounds
whicli are not required by the R.A.F. will be
demolished now. Any which are essential te

the R.A.F. for. ing seawards will be
thoroughly mined and kept ready for destruc:
tion at-shortest notice.

11, The A.M.E.S. stations in. Cyprus must
be kept in action to enable our air forces to
operate with maximum efficiency. They ‘must,
therefore, be protected against damage by
saboteurs, raiding parties from the sea, and
parachutists. Their siting and protection will
be reviewed in consultation withthe R.A:F:

12. The siting of dumps and installations in
Places near the coast to which access from thé
sea is easy will be avoided unless they are
given adequate protection, and theirlocation will
be planned to take advantage of the protection
afforded by the general layout of the defences
of the island. 4

13..The use of anderwater obstacles at
beaches favourable for enemy landings will be
examined in consultation with the naval autho-
rities, and they will be installed where useful
and practicable. a

14. Administration, — Ammunition and
supplies for the ‘‘ Approved Garrison ’’ for go
days will be held in the island.

15. Equipment and transport for any units
of the ‘‘ Approved Garrison ’’ which are not
yet in Cyprus will be kept in good condition
and ready for issue at three days’ notice.

16. The garrison will be made up to the
approved strength as soon as possible. In order
to ensure that incoming units will be ready for
operations without delay, you will submit to
G.H.Q., M-E.F. on the first of each month a
statement in terms ‘of the ‘‘ Approved
Garrison ’’, showing units strengths, unit equip-
ment, units transport, reserves of ammunition,
reserves of supplies and petrol (in days), ord-
nance reserves, medical reserves.

Deficiences will be made good as soon as
possible.

17. Evacuation.—Should the strategic situa-
tion require the evacuation of Cyprus, the exist-
ing plan for complete evacuation will be put
into effect. It is not my intention to attempt
evacuation once battle has been joined in the
island.

No. 134. ~
* gand July, 1942.
(This Operntion Instruction cancels Operation
Instructions 123, 129 and 133-}

Introduction.—_This Operation Instruction is
designed to cover the improbable case where
the enemy is strong enough to launch a large
scale offensive against Eighth Army before the
latter can itself resume the offensive.

2. Information.—Our positions at El Alamein
are being rapidly strengthened with a view to
giving battle in this area should the enemy
take the offensive.

3. Defensive positions are being prepared in
the Burg el Arab and Wadi Natrun areas and
are being prepared and ‘improved on the. .
