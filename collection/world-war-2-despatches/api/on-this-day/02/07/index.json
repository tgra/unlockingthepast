            "description": "4. Immediately after the fall of Benghazi on 7th February, I received a telegram from the Chiefs of Staff setting out a new policy for the forces in the Middle East. General Metaxas had died towards the end of January and the new  Greek Government had sent a request on 8th February for information as to what help we could afford them in the event of a German attack. The War Cabinet accordingly directed that no operations were to be undertaken beyond the frontier of Cyrenaica, which should be held with the minimum possible force necessary to secure the flank of our Egyptian base, and that it was essential to be able to send the largest possible army and air forces from the Middle East to assist the Greeks against a German attack through Bulgaria, At the same time the operations against the Italian Dodecanese, which were in preparation, were to be pressed on and  undertaken at the earliest possible moment."

By nightfall the situation was unchanged. The enemy's position was desperate, with a confused mass of vehicles almost 20 miles in length pinned to the roads between our Armoured Brigades in the South and the Northern detachment in the Soluch area, now beginning to turn South-West. Certain enemy groups had, however, managed to evade the 4th Armoured Brigade by moving through the sand dune area between the main road and the sea. One group in particular, consisting of tanks strongly supported by infantry, repeatedly attacked the Southern detachment, now reinforced by a third R.H.A. battery, during the night 6th/7th February and early morning 7th February, In all nine attacks were delivered against 2nd Rifle Brigade, and"
