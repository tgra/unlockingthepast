eastern airfields in order to give protection to
. Ships lying off the beaches. Air Chief Marshal

Tedder also entered strong objections from the
air pot of view. The Eighth Army plan
would leave thirteen landing grounds in enemy
hands, and this was far too many for effective
neutralisation by air action, He considered
that it was vital to success to capture these
airfields for our own use at the earliest possible
opportunity and gave as his formal opinion
that unless this could be guaranteed he would
be opposed to the whole operation. IJ was
therefore faced with a complete contradiction
of opinion between the Army view, represented
by General Leese, and the views of the Com-
mander-in-Chief, Mediterranean and the Air
Commander-in-Chief.
was impossible to reconcile these conflicting
points of view.

I therefore decided to recast the whole plan.
T took the decision on 3rd May, based on a
conference on 2nd May which I had been pre-
vented from attending by impossible flying
weather, to cancel the American assault in the
west and transfer the whole weight of Seventh
Army to the south-east of the island, on the
immediate left of Eighth Army. I decided, in
fact, to take a risk on the administrative side
rather than the operational risk of dispersion
of effort. This was contrary to what had
hitherto been regarded as one of the funda-
mental principles of the operation: that we must
capture Palermo at the earliest possible oppor-
tunity if we were to have a hope of maintain-
ing sufficient forces for the reduction of the
. island. On my new plan the only ports we
should be certain of capturing in the first stage
would be Syracuse and Augusta, the latter
more a naval anchorage than a port, and pos-
sibly Catania; the whole of Seventh Army
would have to depend on beach maintenance
except for such help as it might get from the
small port of Licata which, as already stated,
was only rated at a capacity of six hundred
tons a day.* The risk was therefore grave,
but there were two factors which brightened
the prospect. The first was that there was a
reasonable probability of suitable weather in
July for beach maintenance. The second was
the coming of the Duxw. I need not describe
these ingenious amphibious vehicles, which are
now familiar to everyone, but it is interesting
to note, in view of the great part they later
played, that I had never seen one up to that
time. General Millert, my Major General,
Administration, had received advance reports
and had ordered large quantities from the
United States on 22nd March. When they
arrived it was discovered that the claims made
for them were fully justified by their perform-
ance. It is not too much to say, indeed, that the
Duxw revolutionised the problem of beach
maintenance. Nevertheless I arranged that
Eighth Army should meet the commitment of
providing a thousand tons per day through
Syracuse for Seventh Army from D plus 14 to
supplement their maintenance over the beaches
until they could capture and bring into use
the port of Palermo.:

sound strategic lines but there was one con-
sideration which gave me some concern and
which I should like to mention here. As I
have said, I had decided to take a calculated
administrative risk for operational reasons; but
this risk was unevenly divided and almost the
whole would fall on the Seventh Army. In
other ways also it might well seem that the
American troops were being given the tougher
and Jess spectacular tasks: their beaches were
more exposed than Eighth Army’s and on some
there were awkward sand bars, they would
have only one small port for maintenance and
Eighth Army would have the glory of captur-
ing the more obviously attractive objectives
of Syracuse, Catania and Messina, names which
would bulk larger in press headlines than Gela
or Licata or the obscure townships of central
Sicily. Both I and my staff felt that this
division of tasks might possibly, on these under-
standable grounds, cause some feeling of
resentment. I knew, from the Tunisian cam-
paign, General Patton’s punctilious and
scrupulous sense of duty and that there was no
possibility of his questioning any orders he
might receive from me, but in the case of so
difficult and important an operation and, since
it might appear that an American Commander
was being required to scrap the results of diffi-
cult and tedious planning and undertake a
heavier burden than he had expected at the
order of a British superior, I felt a natural
anxiety about American reactions. I wish to
place on record here that General Patton at
once fell in with my new plan, the military
advantages of which were as clear to him as to
me, and neither he nor anyone in Seventh
Army raised any form of objection. It is
an impressive example of the spirit of complete
loyalty and inter-Allied co-operation which
inspired all operations with which I was asso-
ciated in the Mediterranean theatre.

The Final Plan

The new plan was approved by the Com-
bined Chiefs of Staff on 12th May, the day
before that on which German resistance in Tuni-
sia came to an end. I accordingly issued on
xgth May my Operation Instruction No. 1.
This laid down the principles on which the
plan of operations was based and the tasks of
the two Armies. At the risk of some repeti-
tion of facts already given it will serve a useful
purpose to set out the main lines of this
instruction.

“An operation is to be prepared to seize
and hold the island of Sicily as a base for
future operations . . . The intention of the
Allied Commander-in-Chief is to seize and hold
the island by operations in five phases’

“ Phase I.

Preparatory measures by Naval and Air
forces to neutralize enemy naval efforts and
to gain air supremacy.

“ Phase 2.

Pre-dawn seaborne assaults, assisted by
airborne landings with the object of seizing
airfields and the ports of Syracuse and
Licata.

* Phase 3.

The establishment of a firm base from
which to conduct operations for the capture
of the ports of Augusta and Catania, and
the Gerbini group of airfields.
