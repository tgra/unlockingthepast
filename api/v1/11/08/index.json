Nothing of a serious nature occurred, however, until November. On 8th November, despite a request from the French Délégué Générale, the Lebanese Government exercised what it believed to be its rights under the constitution to eliminate all references to the Mandatory Power. The Délégué Générale reacted by arresting, on the morning of 11th November, the President of the Lebanese Republic, the Prime Minister, three other Cabinet Ministers and a leading Sunni Mohammedan Deputy.",

            "description": "Before proceeding to summarize the dispositions of our own troops and the enemy at the time I assumed command it is essential to recapitulate briefly the course of events in the preceding three months, since the very complicated situation then existing was a natural development of the confused and varied fortunes of the fighting during that period. .The original expeditionary force which had come ashore on 8th November, 1942, was divided into three task forces which had landed on the west coast of Morocco, north and south of Casablanca, at Oran, and at Algiers. The former two were American; the landing at Algiers, though under American command, included a British Brigade Group and it was the intention to build up into Algiers as rapidly as possible the advance elements of the British First Army, under Lieut.-General (now Sir Kenneth) Anderson, General Eisenhower’s mission was first to secure his ‘base in the three assault areas and establish communications between them, and then to launch First Army eastwards from Algiers into Tunisia to seize the ports of Tums and Bizerta. In accomplishing the former task he had first to overcome the resistance of the French garrison, numbering over a hundred thousand regular troops in Algeria and Morocco. It was believed that these forces would resist the landings and if that resistance was prolonged, although after the first few days the French would probably have to withdraw to the mountains and conduct a guerilla campaign, we should probably be faced with at least three months’ fighting before our base and communications could be deemed safe. This appreciation, and the danger of venturing without air cover into ports which the German bombers could reach, were the main reasons why the most easterly landing was made at Algiers, instead of nearer to Tunisia, which would have given us a better start in the race for the Tunisian ports. In order to do this it would have been necessary to land all three assault forces inside the Mediterranean, for our limited resources, especially in shipping, could not be stretched to produce a fourth assault force. But this would mean that our lines of communication would run _ exclusively through the Straits of Gibraltar which could be closed if Spain entered the war on the",

            "description": "The decision to make a dash for Tunis, though bold, was undoubtedly correct. The advance was pressed by land, sea and air; Bougie was occupied by 11th November, Bone on 12th November, by a British parachute battalion, and by 18th November our advanced forces were operating east of:Gebel Abiud on the coast road and Béja on the inland road, about sixty miles from Bizerta and Tunis respectively. At both points we were in contact with German troops. These had begun to arrive, in the first place by air, on oth November, meeting no resistance from the French authorities in Tunisia. On 15th November a United States parachute battalion occupied Youks Les Bains and Tebessa, in south-eastern iAlgeria, and co-operated with the French detachments at Gafsa in southern Tunisia. Between 17th November and 25th December two main attempts were made to capture Tunis. The first succeeded in advancing, on 28th November, as far as Djedeida, on the road between Tunis and Bizerta and only twelve miles from the former. At this point the enemy counter-attacked strongly with tanks and dive-bombers; the latter were able to operate from good airfieldss only a short distance in rear and our own air forces were ungble to give cover, since the rain had put all their temporary landing grounds out of action. Our forces on the inland road were therefore obliged to withdraw to Medjez el Bab. This town, as its name ‘‘ the Ford of the Pass ” shows, is of great strategic importance. It lies",

            "description": "From this point of view it would be an advantage to win our victory assoon as possible and the Prime Minister expressed disappointment that I had put back the date of my offensive a fortnight beyond my first very tentative estimate. I called a Commanders-in-Chief meeting to discuss the problem, with Admzral Harwood, Air Chief Marshal Tedder and Mr. Casey, the Resident Minister in the Middle East. At this meeting I explained the situation fully, pointing out that if the battle was to have its desired effect, both in’ the military and political fields, it must be crushing and decisive beyond any doubt, and to ensure that I must have an adequate time for full preparations. I laid particular stress also on the importance of having a good moon. TORCH* was scheduled for 8th November. My offensive was planned to precede it by just over a fortnight and I was convinced that this was the best interval that could be looked for in the circumstances. It would be long enough to destroy the greater part of the Axis army facing us, but on the other hand it would be too short for the enemy to start reinforcing Africa on any significant scale. Both these facts would be likely to have a strong effect on the French attitude. The decisive factor was that I was certain that to attack before I was ready would be to risk failure if not to court disaster. My",

The estimate on which we were working, as already stated, assumed an enemy garrison of two German and six Italian mobile divisions and five Italian coastal divisions, against which we were bringing a force of just over ten divisions with two more in reserve. From the point of view of numbers, therefore, we had no actual superiority and such advantages as we enjoyed —the initiative to attack where we chose, command of sea and air, and a certain superiority in equipment, at least over the Italians—would be diminished by dispersion. Moreover, it must be remembered when considering the frame of mind in which we set out on this expedition that this was the first large-scale amphibious operation in the war against a defended coastline and opponents equipped with modern weapons. I am not belitthng in any way the landings of 8th November, 1942, but the description I have given above could not be applied to the resistance met on that occasion and we could not expect the fighting in Sicily to cease as quickly as it had done in Algeria and Morocco. No care was too great to ensure that our first landing in Europe should be successful beyond doubt.",

At that time the coastal sector was held by the recently arrived 65 Infantry Division, a relatively inexperienced formation, with 16 Panzer Division supporting it in reserve. To the south 1 Parachute Division held a front of some twenty-five miles in the mountains. Before the main Eighth Army attack began 16 Panzer Division was withdrawn to proceed to the Eastern front; after the attack went in 26 Panzer Division had to be hurriedly brought back from the Mignano sector, where",

It began by reaffirming the objectives given on 25th September, the capture of Rome and the maintenance, subsequently, of maximum pressure on the enemy. Rome, of course, ‘had great political value but we did not regard it primarily as a prize to be won but rather as something which we knew the enemy intended to defend and for which we could make him fight his hardest. To draw him into battle and destroy his forces was our real object. The directive Tecognised that the enemy “‘intends to resist our occupation of Southern Italy to a greater degree than hitherto contemplated.’ was therefore given, in the first phase, to the build-up of our land forces and of such air forces as were specifically required to assist them in their task. However, six heavy bombardment groups of the Strategic Air Force must ‘be in Italy and operating by the end of the year for use in the bombing programme . against Germany. Finally I was directed, after the capture of Rome, to secure possession by occupying a general line to cover Civitavecchia and Terni, the former being taken into use as a port.",
