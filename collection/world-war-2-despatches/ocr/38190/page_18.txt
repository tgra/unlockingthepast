crganised into three sections—two covering
Wanchai Gap, the third in reserve. They were
ordered to support the Winnipeg Grenadiers in
every way possible,

A Japanese monoplane flying over Stanley
was hit, was obviously in trouble, lost height
and was last seen low behind Lamma Island,
and not re-appearig, may be presumed to be a
casualty, giving a total of five enemy aircraft
shot down during the battle.

along the Repulse Bay Road endeavouring with
Lieut -Colonel W. J. Home to force a way
either West via Middle Spur or North via the
gap to join up with the West Infantry Brigade
It was not known till later that the attempts
were unsuccessful owing to the strength of the
enemy

At about 17oo hours the enemy was re-
ported to have surrounded the civilian food
stores (Little Hong Kong) and to be attacking
again at Wong Nei (Chong Gap, driving out a
company of 2 Royal Scots and some Winnipeg
Grenadiers. Some of the enemy moved up
towards the high ground, Mount Nicholson.t
