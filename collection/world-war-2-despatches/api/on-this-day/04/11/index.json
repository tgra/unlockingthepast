            "description": "On 8th April an attempt was made to break out of Mechili at dawn, The enemy had by this time been reinforced by armoured troops, and our troops came under heavy artillery and machine gun fire. Certain parties which showed great determination and resource, managed to escape. In particular the detachment of the Ist Royal Horse Artillery with some Indian troops broke away to the south and eventually reached Sollum on 11th April. Another party of the 18th Indian Cavalry Regiment with some Australian Anti-Tank guns also got away. The remainder of the force, including practically the whole of the Headquarters of the Division, was captured.",

            "description": "Meanwhile, our forces holding the Florina Gap had been hotly attacked by the Germans on oth April and compelled, after a strong resistance, to withdraw on 11th April. By the evening of 12th April, our front had been formed roughly on a line extending from the coast near Mount Olympus, along the Aliakmon River to Servia, thence N.W. towards the Albanian lakes. Continued bombing and machine-gun attacks by Blenheims and Hurricanes contributed to the delay of the enemy's advance during the critical periods in which our troops were falling back on new positions. These operations were inevitably accompanied by considerable losses and in one raid on the 13th April, for example, a complete formation of 6 Blenheims of No. 21z Squadron was destroyed by Me.109 s. Wellingtons continued to attack more distant objectives. On the night of 13th/z4th April a force of 10 Wellingtons from Nos. 37 and 38 Squadrons made a further effective attack on the railway goods yard at Sofia, destroying a large number of trucks containing explosives. At the same time - other Wellingtons bombed and machine-gunned M.T. convoys at Yannitsa and Gorna Djumaya. In operations on the following night Wellingtons destroyed the bridge over the Vardar River at Veles and Blenheims dropped bombs on",

The advance from Pyawbwe was taken up by 5 Indian Division, which passed through 17 Indian Division on the 11th April. 123 Brigade Group reached Yamethin on that date and our armour contacted the enemy seven miles to the south. During the night, an enemy detachment some 400 strong, with an anti-tank battery, entered the town from the east and occupied buildings and trenches commanding the road. This detachment fought to the last man and it took two days to eliminate them, the process being considerably hastened by accurate air strikes. In the meantime, a by-pass road was constructed west of the town to allow our unarmoured vehicles to get forward. On the 12th the Japanese achieved a minor success in one of their rare air attacks, 16 vehicles of a petrol and ammunition convoy being destroyed by them.",

            "description": "326. Further south, through traffic was at no time possible across the Venetian Plain. The Brenta zone of interdiction was well maintained; in particular, an attempt to make the Padua north railway bridge serviceable was forestalled by a M.A.S.A.F. attack on the 11th April. More repair activity was apparent in the Piave River zone, but here again, M.AS.A.F. heavy bombers prevented any return to serviceability of the Nervesa and Ponte di Piave diversions. Less interdiction was maintained at the Livenza River zone, but this was comparatively unimportant owing to the disruption at Nervesa, further west. In the Tagliamento River zone, the Latisana diversion was still incomplete when it fell into Allied hands, and that a Casarsa, kept out of action by M.A.T.A.F. fighter-bombers until the 12th, was knocked out for the last time by M.A.S.A.F. on the 24th.",
