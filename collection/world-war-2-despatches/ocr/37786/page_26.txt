267. The role for the brigade agreed between.
the War Office and the Belgian authorities in
London was that they should carry out garrison
duties only. It soon became clear, however,
that this decision had not been communicated
to the brigade, and on its arrival in the Middle
East a demand was made for an operational
role. This request was backed by Lieut.-
General Ermens, C.-in-C, Belgian Congo, in
his interview with me in July, 1943. I stated
that, provided the Brigade Group was re-
organised on British war establishment, it
might be possible to contemplate an operational
role after six months’ guard duties. With this
Lieut.-General Ermens agreed, The continued
and extensive guard duties on which the brigade
was employed throughout 1943 resulted in little
training being carried out; the guard duties
were partly responsible, too, for the general
apathy to which the majority of the European
personnel succumbed, but the promise of a
relief from guard duties and of employment in
a more active role gave a fillip to morale. At
the beginning of 1944 the brigade was showing
more aptitude for training.

268. Throughout the period, the Egyptian
Army has never. failed to meet any request of
the British Forces to take over duties within
Egypt, to free British troops for operations in
field formations. They have taken over the
duties of mine watching in the Suez Canal and
‘auch of the anti-aircraft and searchlight de-
tence of Egypt, in addition to the coast defence
of Alexandria and Port Sudan. Frontier con-
trol has been carried out satisfactorily by the
Egyptian Frontiers Control Administration,
working in close co-operation with Head-
quarters, British Troops in Egypt.

269. Political problems ‘have occurred in
higher command, and the relations of high
officers with the Egyptian Government have
not always been smooth, but junior officers
have been largely unaffected and the rank and
file have been good. British Commanders with
whom Egyptian units have co-operated have
frequently expressed their appreciation of the
degree of efficiency displayed, particularly in
their anti-aircraft and searchlight duties. This
state of affairs is the more praiseworthy since
the Egyptian Army has been gravely handi-
capped throughout by shortages in transport
and equipment of all types.

270. In addition to training and equipping
Allied troops within the Command, Middle East
has also played an active but difficult part in
organising and equipping the guerilla move-
ments in the Balkans. These guerilla opera-
tions have become, since the beginning of 1943,
a serious commitment for the Germans. Move-
ménts for national liberation have gathered
impetus and strength, and in Yugoslavia
especially the Germans have been forced to tie
up divisions which would most certainly have
been of great use elsewhere: Unfortunately,
the Partisans in Yugoslavia, Greece and
Albania have not been able to agree on common
action in their respective countries against the
Germans, In fact their quarrels, which have
been very bitter, have helped the enemy con-
siderably and have undoubtedly postponed the
realisation of their national liberation.

271. In Yugoslavia the Partisan movement
has made the most effective military contribu-
tion to the Allied cause. Regular military
formations have been organised, and a Partisan

General Headquarters under Marshal Tito has
been established, By August, 1943, Partisan
troops numbéred 100,000, and the collapse of
Italy gave them increased morale and easiet
access to arms and supplies, both from Italian
sources and because, with the opening of the
Adriatic, it became possible for us to supple-
ment air supplies by shipments. As a result,
by the end of the year, Partisan forces in
Yugoslavia numbered some 250,000 men.
During the year they survived three major
attacks and contained a force of sixteen German
and six Bulgarian divisions, together with large
numbers of Croat and Serbian troops under
German command.

272. With Partisan Genera] Headquarters,
Middle East Command has maintained constant
and cordial relations since the first British
liaison officers were dropped by parachute in
May, 1943. By the end of the year twenty
liaison missions were being maintained with the
Partisans, and over 6,000 tons of stores had
been shipped to them in addition to 339 tons
dropped by air.

273. As against the growing effect of
Marshal Tito’s Partisans must ‘be set the fact
that, by playing upon fear df Communism,
German propaganda has succeeded in nullifying
the value of the other liberation movement in
Yugoslavia, that of the Chetnicks, under
General Mihailovic. Large numbers of Chet-
nicks have actively gone over to the Axis and
have taken part in operations against Tito’s
forces, and by the end of the year the Chetnick
movement was of no value to the Allies and
was receiving no supplies from Middle East.

274. In Albania, British officers have been
instrumental in training national forces, which
amounted to four brigades at the end of the
year. Here also there were political difficulties
between the parties of the ‘‘ National Front ’’
and the more left wing ‘‘ National Liberation ’’
movement which, in fact, has carried out most
of the operations.

275. In Greece, a British Mission had arrived
during January, 1943, but for some time found
it impossible to control the quarrels and unco-
ordinated activities of the guerillas, among
whom the rival ‘bands of the left-wing E.L.A.S.
and the Republican E.D.E.S. (commanded by
Colonel Zervas) were engaged in constant
fights. At last, in July, a National Band Agree-
ment was drawn up to divide the whole country
into area commands and control all guerilla
activities under a General (Headquarters.

276. Under this co-ordinated command, a
widespread and successful attack on communi-
cations was garried out before and during the
attack on Sicily. But when Italy was invaded,
the Greeks, realising that the liberation of
Greece would not immediately be attempted,
relapsed into a civil war in which the E.L.A.S.
bands set to work to destroy all other bands,
so that they might ultimately claim to be the
sole liberators of Greece. During the civil war
no more supplies were sent to E.L.A.S., but
Zervas, our most loyal ally, was kept supplied.
By 19th December, 1943, both parties were
exhausted and ready to come to terms and,
after an appeal by M. Tsouderos, the Greek
Prime Minister, negotiations for a renewal of
the National Band Agreement were begun.

277. In Crete, also, a small British mission
was established, but the strength of the
