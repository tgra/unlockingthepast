On the roth July, therefore, I decided to prohibit fighters from entering the gun-belt, whatever the circumstances, after the 17th July. At a conference held to discuss this change, General Pile pointed out that an obvious corollary to it was to move all the guns inside the belt, so as to have them all in one place and provide both guns and fighters with clearly-defined spheres of operation. The logic of this argument was irrefutable; and I agreed to examine detailed proposals for moving all the guns into the belt except a few which would remain on the coast to act as   markers  ."

The Division was now concentrated to rest and refit about Wanjing, 16 miles south-east of Imphal, where it could, if necessary, easily move in either direction and act as a reserve to 23 Indian Division on the Tamu road or to 5 and 17 Indian Divisions about Bishenpur. 50 Indian Parachute Brigade (two battalions) which had been operating most successfully on the flank of 20 Indian Division across the tracks running south from the Imphal - Ukhrul road, was similarly withdrawn for rest and re-organization in India."
