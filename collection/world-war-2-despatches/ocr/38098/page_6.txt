than attempt his destruction, and on this
policy I acted. °

Their Lordships’ signal had enquired my
** intentions ’’ as regards re-engaging with
PRINCE OF WALES. I was careful in my
reply to state my “‘ opinions '’ and not my
intentions, and I was grateful that They left
the matter to my judgment.”

24. After full consideration of the facts, I
am of the opinion that this decision was justi-
fied and correct. Some of the factors affecting
it require emphasis. The PRINCE OF

, with many of the contractor’s work-
men still on board, had joined the Fleet on
25th March. It was not till 27th April that
the last of her turrets could be accepted from
the contractors and that practice drills with the
whole main armament could be started.
Captain Leach had been able to report on x7th
May, shortly before the Fleet sailed for this
operation, that he considered his ship fit to
operate; but neither he nor I interpreted that
report as implying that she was fully worked up.
Her turrets, of a new and untried model, were
known to be liable to teething troubles and
could already be seen to be suffering them.
The effects of all this on her gunnery had been,
witnessed by the Rear-Admiral Commanding,
First Cruiser Squadron, and he knew, in addi-
tion, that her bridge was seriously damaged,
that she had taken in 400 tons of water aft
and could not exceed 27 knots. The BIS-
MARCK 'and PRINZ EUGEN, on the other
hand, after working up for many months under
ideal conditions in the Baltic, had given evi-
dence of a véry high degree of efficiency: the
BISMARCK had been hit, but the Rear-
Admiral Commanding, First Cruiser Squadron,

could see no sign of damage. a

25. In these circumstances, the senior offiger
on the spot was clearly justified in his con-
clusion that he was more likely to achieve his
object of ensuring the enemy’s destruction by
keeping touch until the approaching reinforce-
ments should arrive. If these powerful rein-
forcements had not been ‘in the vicinity, the
problem would, of course, have been a different
one.

26. At 1445 the Admiralty asked the Rear-
Admiral Commanding, First Cruiser Squadron,
to report on the percentage fighting effici .of
the BISMARCK and requested his intentions
as regards PRINCE OF WALES re-engaging.
The Rear-Admiral Commanding, First Cruiser
Squadron, replied that the BISMARCK’s
efficiency was uncertain but high, and.that he
considered that PRINCE OF WALES “ should
not re-engage until other heavy ships are in con-
tact unless interception fails. Doubtful ‘if she
has speed to force action.’’ From his reply I
assumed that the Rear-Admiral Commanding,
First Cruiser Squadron, would not force action
unless the situation changed materially, or in-
structions were received either, from the
Admiralty or myself. I had complete confidence
in Rear-Admiral ‘Wake-Walker’s judgment, nor
did I wish. the enemy to be forced away to: the
westward.

Shadowing during Daylight on 24th May.

27. After the action had been broken off,
the three ships continued to shadow. The
enemy proceeded on a south-westerly course,
with minor alterations, until 1240. They tried
hard, by frequent alterations of; course and

speed, to throw off-the shadowers; and the
rapid variations of visibility, between two and
seventeen. miles, were of great assistance to
them; but their efforts were without success.
SUFFOLK, using. her R.D.F. in a masterly
manner to overcome the difficulties of varying
visibility, shadowed from the starboard quarter
to cover any attempt to break back along the
ice; NORFOLK, with PRINCE OF WALES in
company, kept out on the port quarter to ensure
the detection of any alteration to the southward.
About 1240 the enemy seem to have abandoned
hope of evasion by daylight, for they turned
south, presumably to gain sea-room for another
attempt by night, and reduced to 24 knots.

Movements of the Battlefteet,

28. At the time the first report of the sight-
ing of the enemy was received by me, KING
GEORGE V, with REPULSE, VICTORIOUS, .
GALATEA, AURORA, KENYA, HERMIONE
and nine destroyers in company, was in
approximate position 60° 20’ N. 13° ‘W. I had
always thought the enemy, when breaking out,
might have long distance aircraft reconnoitring
ahead of them, to give warning of any of our
forces in a position to intercept; if either or
both of our capital ship forces were reported,
the enemy might turn back through the Den-
mark Strait or shape course and speed to avoid
contact. I therefore altered course to 280°
and increased to 27 knots with the idea of
reaching a position from which I could inter-
cept the enemy to the eastward of the Denmark
Strait, and at the same time be able to rein- «
force HOOD and PRINCE OF WALES if they
were able to bring him to action and reduce his.
speed, or force him in my direction. As more

+information was received, it became clear that
the enemy intended to continue his attempt to
break out; though there was still the chance
that he would turn back when he encountered
HOOD and PRINCE of WALES or, if HOOD
and PRINCE OF WALES were to the west-
ward of him when contact was made, he might
endeavour to break to the south or south-
eastward.

29. The sinking of the HOOD and the
damage to PRINCE OF WALES made it un-
likely that the enemy wculd B€ forced to turn
back, and the best hope lay iir-interception by
my force, though tliis would riot become pos-
sible unless he reduced his speed. Course was
altered accordingly to 260°, and later to 240°.
Reports suggested that the enemy was keeping
a few miles off the edge of the ice, possibly
in the hope of finding thick weather. From my
point of view the greatest danger lay in his
hugging the coast of Greenland, and then
making his way to the westward, where I
suspected he might have an oiler: for, if he
could refuel, he would be able to use higher
speeds than KING GEORGE V could main-
tain and so get away,

30. The enemy’s alteration to the southward
and his reduction of speed were a great relief,
although there seemed a good chance that he
was leading our forces into a concentration of
U-boats. It suggested that he did not know
of my force and it made interception possible.

31. There was still a grave risk of his getting
away by sheer speed, and though I knew the
Jack of experience of the crews of the aircraft
