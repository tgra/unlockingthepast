35. By comparison, the strength and com-
position of the Allied fighter force was most
satisfactory. Spitfires, Lightnings, and latterly
Thunderbolts and Mustangs, completely trans-
formed the situation which had obtained until
November, 1943, when our Hurricanes were
outclassed and out-manoeuvred by the enemy.
Backed by a warning and control system of
high standard, Allied fighters had without fail
rendered the enemy’s incursions into our de-
fended areas costly and ineffectual. During the
eleven months covered by this despatch 165
enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground
or in the air, together with 47 probables and
152 damaged. This destruction was achieved
against a total enemy effort, offensive and
defensive, of 1,845 sorties. One enemy air-
craft was destroyed for every eleven sighted ;
that the air superiority established before the
period of this narrative was well maintained
over the year, needs no further proof.

36. This virtual dominance of the air over
Burma. was the result of hard work with small
dividends upon the part of our fighter organ-
isation. Freed from the necessity of estab-
lishing superiority, the majcr problems remain-
ing to Allied fighters by the time this despatch
opens were the interception of sneak raids,
usually undertaken by the Japanese Air Force
under the protection of cloud-cover, and the
searching-out and destruction of a meagre
enemy air force dispersed upon a generous net-
work of rear airfields. Initially, the greatest
danger was to the stream of transports hauling
supplies to the Imphal Plain, which offered the
best prey ever presented to any air force.
Some one hundred unarmed aircraft flew daily
in and out of the area, and fighter patrols
laboured under the handicaps of extensive cloud
Sounlitions and a shortage of P.O.L.* at their

aSES.

37. Moreover, the mountainous terrain to the
east precluded efficient early air raid warning,
and the enemy could at will come un-
announced through the valleys. To minimise
the danger, traffic was routed along a corridor
from the Khopum Valley to Palel under a
fighter umbrella. Ground signs were displayed
en route to indicate the presence of enemy
aircraft which was also broadcast by R/T.
The sight of a stream of transports flying into
the Imphal Valley with a screen of Spitfires
circling overhead was a most heartening sight
to the garrison, who thereby received con-
stant assurance that their aerial life-line was
unbroken. The precautions taken and the im-
potence of the enemy resulted in only two
transports being destroyed by enemy action
during the whole of the siege, a remarkable
achievement.

_ 38. The danger to transport aircraft per-
sisted during the whole of the advance, since
they were continually operating in front of the
warning screen, and fighter bases were not
always established as far forward as was tac-
tically desirable. For this there were two main
reasons; in the early stages of the advance
through hilly jungle no airstrips could be con-
structed near the front, and second, having
debouched on to the plains, the Army were not
willing to devote supplies and resources to

establish fighter bases in the area of dropping
operations.

39. On two occasions, therefore, our trans-
port aircraft were victims of enemy sneak
raids ; on one day in November while dropping
along the Tiddim Road, five aircraft were de-
stroyed by the enemy, and on the 12th Janu-
ary four were shot down while supply dropping
near Onbauk, an airfield recently recaptured
from the enemy which, however, had not by
that time been prepared for defensive fighters.
Even when during the temporary halt around
(Mandalay, and Spitfires were able to occupy
the Shwebo and Monywa airfield groups, air
supply was proceeding over a hundred and
thirty mile front which the four available
squadrons of Spitfires were hard pressed to
cover in conjunction with their other defensive
commitments. It is a lesson of the campaign
that the air supply of ground forces depends
on the immediate deployment as far forward
as possible of fighter squadrons to patrol the
Lines of Communication. Had the enemy used
his fighters effectively instead of frittering away
their effort on infrequent low-level attacks
against forward troops, he would have been
able to do great execution among our Dakotas
and Commandos, thus seriously impeding the
advance.

40. Since it was not always possible to engage
the enemy in the air, it was necessary to search
out his aircraft on the ground. To this end,
intruder raids were undertaken at frequent
intervals, and paid a dividend of 80 destroyed,
25 probably destroyed and 78 damaged aircraft
on enemy airfields. In October, a series of
raids were undertaken against the Rangoon
airfields with the additional motive of hinder-
ing the transfer of units to the Philippines.
In this operation, many types of aircraft were
employed, including Beaufighters, but, as air-
craft resources became more suited to opera-
tional requirements, intrusion was progressively
left to the Mustang squadrons of the Air
Commandos, who on more than one occasion
in the spring of 1945, made the 1,500 mile
round trip to the Japanese base airfields in
Siam with good results totalling 38 destroyed,
10 probably destroyed and 21 damaged aircraft.

41. The problem of destroying an enemy
intent on conserving his forces and possessing
a wide choice of airfields containing many
revetments (Meiktila airfield disposes of over
a hundred) is not an easy one. In addition,
the enemy’s skill with light anti-aircraft and
machine-gun fire is well-known, and low-level
“ strafing” runs are apt to be costly. It was
found uneconomical to make a preliminary
reconnaissance run to discover which revet-
ments were occupied, and often only a quick
snap-shot at a target seen late in the “ strafe ”
was possible. In view of these factors it will
be seen that the result achieved is more than
creditable.

42. Early attempts to ground or destroy the
enemy by bombing his airfields were ineffective
and were discontinued in favour of more worth-
while targets.

43. The enemy’s offensive effort was so

ineffectual as to be hardly worth mentioning
except to recount the losses he sustained. In
