xz. On the r3th, it was decided to add the
frish Guards to the Bodo force and the Head-
quarters of the 24th Brigade. They embarked
in the sss CHROBRY which had brought 3
Tanks from England for the Bodo Force. While
on passage with STORK and WOLVERINE as
escort the CHROBRY was bombed and set on
fire, the four senior officers of the Battalion
being killed. The troops were saved and brought
back to Harstad but their equipment was lost.
It was then decided to send the South Wales
Borderers in the EFFINGHAM but she
grounded and became a total loss during the
night 17th-18th. The troops were brought back
to Harstad in EFFINGHAM’s Escort,
COVENTRY, CAIRO, MATABELE and
ECHO, while the greater part of the Military
Stores, with 4 Bren Carriers out of 10 were
salved in Local Craft and landed at Bodo.
EFFINGHAM was finally destroyed by
torpedo.

12. During the next few days the troops after
being re-equipped at Harstad were taken to
Bodo by Destroyers, but news from that area
was of the continual advance of the enemy.

13. On the 18th Colonel Trappes-Lomax of
the Scots Guards reported withdrawing from
Mo.

14. On the 21st General Auchinleck informed
me that he was proposing to appoint Colonel
Gubbins in command of the 24th Brigade and
Independent Companies, that is, of all forces
in the Bodo area. With this I fully agreed.
Brigadier Fraser had had to be invalided on
account of a wound received earlier when recon-
noitring at Ankenes in the Narvik area.

15. Enemy air power in the Bodo area
steadily increased and with corresponding
harassing effect upon our forces. Only on one
occasion was it possible to hit back and then
(on the 27th May) 2 Gladiators brought down
4 enemy aircraft.

16. A trawler force, to work in the Bodo
area, arrived at Skjelfiord from England on the
18th May under the command of Lieutenant-
Commander (acting Commander) W. R. Fell,
R.N. These vessels not being suitable for the
work, Commander Fell organised a force of local
vessels and took them south on the 24th May
where they performed remarkable work and
were almost continuously in action for seven
days.

17. A telegram was received on the 24th May
from the Chiefs of Staff ordering the evacuation
of the whole of our forces from North Norway.
Plans to reinforce Bodo were then abandoned
and instructions were sent to Brigadier Gubbins
to be prepared to evacuate.

18, On May 28 the enemy with a force of 30
aeroplanes bombed the town of Bodo, which to
a greater extent than most Norwegian towns
was built of stone, until it was reduced to com-
plete ruin.

19. The evacuation of Bodo was successfully
accomplished on the 29th and 31st, 1,000 men
being taken direct to U.K. in VINDICTIVE
and the remainder brought to Harstad in
Destroyers and small craft.

rath /13th May, in addition to establishing con-
tact with French troops working south, had as.
its object the occupation of the Oydejord
Peninsula, and the northern shore of Rombaks.
Fiord, This was held by some to be a neces-
sary prelude to any direct attack upon Narvik
itself, allowing, as it would, of the positioning
of field artillery on the peninsula to support
such an attack. As soon as the necessary area
had been occupied and, with the assistance of
H.M.S. FAME, the northern shore of Rombaks.
Fiord had been cleared and occupied as far as
Lillelerget, General Bethouart felt himself ready
for the next stage, for which he had prepared
his plan, i.e., the capture of Narvik. Com-
mander Hubback was attached to the French
Staff for this purpose; his success in this work
in connection with Bjervik had been much
appreciated by the French Command. My
general direction to him was that he was to do:
everything to further the project and to promise
that all possible naval support would be forth-
coming. He carried out this work admirably.
It was decided that the attack would take place
on May 23rd/24th or on the first favourable
opportunity after that date. This was the
earliest date it was estimated the M.L.Cs. could
be released from what, at the moment, was
the all important work of preparing Bardufoss
and Skaanland Aerodromes for the reception of
Hurricanes and Gladiators. The conditions that
were required to form a favourable opportunity
were held to be either—

(a) Such weather conditions as were likely
to largely reduce or abolish any danger of air
attack; or

(b) The ability to provide efficient fighter
protection overhead.

2. The weather, towards the date mentioned,
turned fine and seemed settled and with the
impending arrival of the Hurricanes on the
26th/27th it was eventually decided that the
operation should take place on the 27th/28th
and that date was adhered to.

3. The plan, in so far as the naval spera-
tions were conceined, is forwarded separaiely
and, except in one or two minor details, it was.
adhered to.

4. The ships that took part were CAIRO
(Flag) SOUTHAMPTON (R.A.18),
COVENTRY (C.S.20) and the Destroyers
WHIRLIND, FAME, HAVELOCK, WALKER
and FIREDRAKE.

5. The plan is open to criticism in details—
its great merit, however, was in that it was
the plan of those who had to carry it out. The
weak point in the plan was that owing to the
paucity of transport available—a less bold man
than General Bethouart might well-have made
this an excuse for inaction—it was necessary
to leave the First Flight of 290 men vnsup-
ported for an unduly long time as the timetable
in the plan indicates, Owing to the hard work
to which the M.L.Cs. had been subjected in
transporting guns and plant and stores of all
sorts required for the completion of the aero-
dromes at Bardufcss and Skaanland and the
sinking of one during an air raid, only two
of these vessels were available—and one of
these was only capable of about three knots.
The A.L.Cs. similarly were reduced from four
to three, one of them having been burnt out.
An attempt was made to supplement the means
of transport by using the two picket boats of
