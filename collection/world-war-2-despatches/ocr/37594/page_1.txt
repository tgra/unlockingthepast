OPERATIONS IN THE SOMALILAND PROTECTORATE, 1939-1940

PREFACE BY THE WAR OFFICE

1. The following despatch deals with the
period from the outbreak of war with Germany
in September, 1939, to the evacuation of British
Forces from the Somaliland Protectorate in
August, 1940, in the face of Italian invasion.
It covers the preparatory stage before Italy’s

into the war on 11th June, 1940, and the
brief period of operations from 5th to 18th
August, during which the small British Garrison
fought a fierce and skilful withdrawal action
against overwhelming numbers.

2. This is the personal narrative of General
Sir Archibald (now Field-Marshal Lord) Wavell,
Commander-in-Chief, British Land Forces in
the Middle East. As such he was responsible
for preparations over a vast area against the
possible entry of Italy into the war on the
side of Germany. ‘When this occurred in June,
1940, he was faced with the problem of dis-
posing pitifully small resources in manpower
and material to meet enemy aggression in an
area which included Egypt, Palestine, Trans-
jordan, Sudan, Cyprus, Iraq, British Somali-
Jand, the shores of the Persian Gulf and East
Africa. The United Kingdom at the same time
was facing a still more desperate situation
caused by the fall of France and the apparent
imminence of a German invasion.

3. No commander could have been satisfied
with the inadequate resources available and it
is understandable that the War Cabinet should
have appeared to General Wavell to be pre-
occupied with the paramount task of the de-
fence of the home country.

4. In retrospect it might appear that the
policy of avoidance of any action which might
give Italy cause for entering the war against
the Allies was in some respects unjustified. On
her eventual entry, all the disadvantages of
such a policy became apparent, while the bene-

fits which would have been gained by her con-
tinued neutrality tend to be forgotten. British
Somaliland suffered particularly in lack of
defence measures and intelligence of enemy
dispositions owing to the original policy of
complete evacuation in face of invasion. Asa
result of Anglo-French Staff conversations just
prior to the outbreak of war this policy was
modified to the extent that the British Force
was to withdraw to French Somaliland.

This policy was dictated by the general weak-
ness of the position and by the Sopa of
expending resources on a Protectorate which
had little or no strategic importance.

By December, 1939, the French had
strengthened their garrisons in French Somali-
Jand and a common defence plan and a more
enterprising policy become possible. This plan
was based on the defence of Jibuti and Zeilah
by the French while the British defended Ber-
bera, the capital and centre of British interests
in British Somaliland.

5. The new defence policy required a change
of administrative control of the forces in British
Somaliland from the Colonial Office to the War
Office. Owing to discussions between the War
Office, Colonial Office and G.O.C.-in-C.,
Middle East, this change did not become
effective until June, 1940, when the War Office
finally assumed responsibility for the admini-
strative control of the forces in the Protectorate.

6. Italian troops crossed the frontier on 5th
August, 1940, and the small British Force,
deprived of the expected support of the French
garrison of Jibuti, was pressed back on the port
of Berbera and successfully evacuated. Many
of the troops.so saved were re-deployed to re-
turn on the tide of British offensives six months
later, when all lost territory was regained in
the first stages of the destruction of the Italian
