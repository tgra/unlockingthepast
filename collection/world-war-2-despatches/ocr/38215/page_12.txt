Ultimately; however, as there was no imme-
diate prospect of British aeroplanes being avail-
able to use the aerodromes, the project was
postponed except as regards an air landing
ground at Kuching in Sarawak and a landing
strip at Miri.

44. In British North Borneo there were
several excellent natural harbours which were
undefended. There was a small but efficient
local Volunteer Force but, owing to lack of
resources, it was not possible to provide any
regular troops for the defence of this territory.
The Governor of British North Borneo was
therefore informed by the C.-in-C. Far East
that his territory could not be defended and
that the role of his local forces should be the
maintenance of internal security.

45. In West Brunei and East Sarawak were
situated the important Seria and Muri Oil Fields
and the Lutong Refinery. It was the policy
of the British Admiralty, in the event of war
breaking out in the Far East, to do such
damage to the wells and plant that they would
be of no use to the enemy. This work was the
responsibility of the Army, and for this pur-
pose a demolition party with an infantry
escort of about a company (partly Indian
and partly British) was stationed there.
There was also a 6 in. battery. A partial denial
scheme was put into effect before hostilities
broke out.

46. The town of Kuching, the capital of
Sarawak, is situated some 8 miles from the
coast and is approached only by waterways.
The intervening country is mostly bush-covered
or marshy. The town itself lies on both sides
of the Bintawa River. The air landing ground
is situated some 7 miles south of the town to
which it is connected by a metalled road. The
only land communication between Sarawak
and Dutch West Borneo was a bush track unfit
for wheeled transport.

The O.C. Troops Sarawak and Brunei (Lt.-
Col. Lane) was instructed that his primary
object was to secure the air landing ground for
the use of our Air Force and to deny it to the
enemy; also that if, owing to overwhelming
forces, this object could no longer be attained,
then he should act in the interests of the defence
of West Borneo as a whole, his line of with-
drawal being by the bush track into Dutch
West Borneo. This defence problem was not
an easy one. If the plan envisaged only the
close defence of the landing ground, then the
enemy would be free to move unopposed up
the waterways where he would be most vul-
nerable. Moreover, the people of Kuching
Town would be left entirely unprotected. On
the other hand any attempt to defend Kuching
itself would lead to great dispersion.

The O.C. Troops had at his disposal the 2/15
Punjab Regt. (less one weak company to
Lutong), the Sarawak Rangers, some local
volunteers trained chiefly for administrative
duties and some regular administrative detach-
ments. The Sarawak Rangers, which had pre-
viously been disbanded, had recently been re-
formed but owing to lack of weapons were only
partially armed. There was no artillery, except
some field guns manned by the infantry, and
no engineers.

Under the defence scheme prepared by the
O.C. Troops, the Sarawak Rangers were em-
ployed as scouts north of Kuching and detach-

ments of regular troops were pushed forward to
block the waterways. The remainder of the
2/15 Punjab Regt. was held in reserve at the
landing ground, where defensive positions were
under construction. I approved this plan during
a visit to Kuching at the end of November
1941. I was informed at the same time that
there were large Japanese plantations in the
area immediately east of Kuching.

47. Review of Strength Requived.—Shortly
afier taking over command I was instructed
to review the Army strength required for the
defence of Malaya. Before doing so I personally
visited all the main defence areas and also
arranged for a strategical examination of the
defence problem by a joint staff committee.
In the course of that examination I asked to be
informed what damage the Air Force at its
existing strength might be expected to inflict
on a hostile sea-borne expedition before it
reached the shores of Malaya I based my esti-
mate of the Army strength required on the
figure given. In the event, unfortunately, the
damage done fell far below this figure. I have
no record to show, and { do not wish to infer,
that this figure was given by the A.O.C.

I pointed out the serious deficiencies in the
strength of the Air Force, the obsolescence of
many of the aircraft, the weakness of our naval
forces and the greatly increased threat from the
Japanese occupation df Indo-China which had
then been extended to the southern portions of
that country.

On the 2nd August, 1941, I gave my estimate
of the Army strength required in a telegram to
the War Office. This estimate was not exam-
ined in detail by the C-in-C Far East but the
despatch of the cable was approved by him as
a definition of the target. Summarized, it
asked for:—

48 Infantry Battalions.

4 Indian Reconnaissance Units
9 Field Artillery Regiments.

4 Light Anti-Aircraft Regiments
2 Tank Regiments.

3 Anti-Tank Regiments.

2 Mountain Artillery Regiments.
12 Field Companies.

with the necessary administrative units. This
was exclusive of the Volunteers, the infantry
aiti-aircraft and tank units required for aero-
drome defence, and also of the Anti-Aircraft
units required for the defence of localities in-
cluding the Naval Base. In a Tactical Appre-
cjation forwarded by telegram in September
1941 two Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiments for the
Field Force were asked for while the Anti-Air-
craft Guns reauired for the defence of Singa-
pore were estimated at 212 Heavy and 124
Light.

The main difference in the above estimate
over those which had been submitted previously
was that it made provision for a 3rd Corps
Reserve in North Malaya of one complete Divi-
s'on and certain Corps Troops units, for a com-
plete division instead of two brigade groups in
the Kelantan-Trengganu-Pahang area, for two
regular infantry battalions for Penang and for
a brigade group instead of one battalion in
Borneo.

This estimate was accepted by the Chiefs of
Staff, but it was recognised that the target could
pot, in the existing circumstances, be fulfilled
