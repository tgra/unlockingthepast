Commander. I pointed out the grave disad-
vantages of such a system and urged the
Supreme Allied Commander to arrange for the
appointment of a commander of the Allied
Land Forces. He eventually agreed to my
recommendation and put forward his proposals
to the Chiefs of Staff in September.*

143. It had originally been intended that the
headquarters of 11 Army Group which, under
the new organization was to become H.Q.,
Allied Land Forces, should go to Kandy. I
pointed out in my first Despatch the grave dis-
advantages of placing this headquarters at a
place so far distant from the area of operations
to which both signal and other communications
were so bad.j I continued therefore, to press
during the summer for the move of H.Q. 11
Army Group, to the neighbourhood of Cal-
cutta. The Supreme Allied Commander
finally approved this proposal and arrange-
ments were made to move my Headquarters
to Barrackpore. The Commainder-in-Chief,
India, with that readiness to help which always
distinguishes him, moved H.Q., Eastern Com-
mand, to provide my staff with the necessary
accommodation and offices.

144. The need for the closest co-operation
between the Army and the Air Forces at all
levels of command had led the Supreme Allied
Commander to set up a committee to examine
and report upon the best method of improving
co-operation.

Its principal recommendation was that army
and air headquarters should be alongside each
other at all levels down to and including com-
posite group level. I strongly supported this
proposal, which involved the following. re-
organization of air commands :—

(@ Eastern Air Command absorbed Third
Tactical Air Force and was to work in con-
junction with Advance Headquarters, Allied
Land Forces.

(6) 221 Group became a Composite Group
for co-operation with Fourteenth Army.

(©) 224 Group was to provide support for
15 Indian Corps in the Arakan.

@ 10 US.A.AF. was to continue to
operaté with Northern Combat Area Com-
mand.

In each case, the army
quarters were to be located together. Opera-
tions subsequent to those covered by this
Despatch have shown the wisdom: of these
decisions.

Adjutant-General Questions.

145. Reinforcements. J have already men-
tioned the shortage of infantry reinforcements
in discussing the availability of formations, but
the demand for all types of reinforcements has
continued to exceed the supply. The general
position has, except that of certain highly
technical trades, however, improved since the
situation described in my first Despatch.

SUPPLEMENT 10 THE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 1951

Shortages, although a very severe handicap,
have not made it necessary to withdraw units
but it has been necessary to send some British
infantry drafts to reinforcement camps with-
out previous jungle training in order to main-
main battalions at minimum fighting strength.
This does not mean that drafts are, sent for-
ward wholly untrained since they are given
some training by the camp training staffs.

146. Releases. As a result of the announce-
ment of the scheme for the “Re-allocation of
British Manpower ” on the cessation of hostili-
ties in Europe, instructions were issued to
units early in November, together with pro-
visional Class A release rolls. Personnel fell
into three categories :-— :

(a) Surplus to manpower requirements.

(b) Those called out for vital post-war
reconstruction.

(c) Compassionate cases.

147, Repatriation. The reduction, in Sep-
tember, of the period of overseas service to
3 years and 8 months caused widespread satis-
faction. The numbers affected, however, were
large and their despatch had to be spread over
the following four months, except in the case
of the officers and men of the Royal Corps of
Signals. The repatriation of Signal personnel
had unfortunately to be delayed and spread
over the period January to March 1945, whilst
officers had to wait longer and were to be sent
home .between February and April as the
teplacements had to arrive before repatriates
left their units.

148. Leave. (a) The opening, in August, of
the Indian Army leave scheme for officers filled
a long felt want. All British officers and British
other ranks who had completed 5 years’ ser-
vice abroad were eligible, but the number was
so large that leave could only be granted to
those with 8 years’ overseas service. Even so,
it is likely that it will take over 12 moriths to -
send these officers home, owing to the limited
number of passages.

(6) A special war leave programme was
arranged between July and October. This
enabled Indian other ranks, whose leave was
overdue, to go to their homes.

Medical.

149. Evacuation of Casualties. While
Imphal was still surrounded, all casualties
had to be flown to the base hospitals
as described in my ffirst Despatch, I
had always pressed for the movement of sick
and wounded to hospital by air, but until
operations in Arakan and Imphal this year
there had never been enough aircraft. Their
increasing use on this important duty reduced
the number of men who had to travel by the
old types of transport. As we advanced down
the Tiddim and Tamu roads, airstrips were
constructed for use by light aircraft in the first
place, and, later, by cargo aircraft as the strips
were enlarged and their surfaces improved.
Casualties were sent to a central air mainten-
ance area in Imphal and thence by returning
supply aircraft to the base hospitals. All
casualties from the Tiddim road were flown
back. From Tamu, sick and wounded
travelled both by air and road.

On the Arakan front, the movement of
casualties by air was limited almost entirely
to those of 81 (West African) Division in the
Kaladan Valley, since water transport was
available for other formations.
