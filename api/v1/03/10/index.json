            "title": "Battle for Mandalay Heats Up: Japanese Forces Prepare Counter-Offensive as Allies Struggle",
            "description": "second half of February it must have been clear that this battle was not going very well, but the position did not yet seem irretrievable. At that time 19 Indian Division had broken out of their bridgehead at Kyaukmyaung and begun their advance on Mandalay (i refer later to these operations), but they had not yet crossed the formidable Chaungmagyi Chaung, which most effectively bars the approach to Mandalay from the north. 2 British Division had only penetrated five miles inland from Ngazun. 20 Indian Division were being bitterly attacked and were still confined to a narrow semi-circle of ground. They had not yet linked up with 2 British Division. 7 Indian Division had already captured Pagan, but believing, as they did, that 4 Corps was still operating on the left of 33 Corps, the enemy regarded this crossing merely as a diversion which could be dealt with by the troops on the spot. General Kimura therefore decided to restore the generally adverse situation by a counter-offensive. The main effort was to be by 15 Army, which, reinforced by most of 18 Japanese Division, was to launch an offensive with 18 and 31 Divisions from Madaya and Sagaing towards Wetlet (on the Shwebo railway line from Sagaing). On the right flank of this counter-offensive 33 Army, with 56 Division and a regiment of 18 Division, was to hold the areas round Lashio and Namtu, whilst on the left 28 Army was to defend the Irrawaddy valley about the Yenangyaung and Mount Popa areas and launch an offensive in the Pakokku area. The scale of the latter—it was to be made by a composite force of less than divisional strength —showed that the real threat in that area was not yet appreciated. The general offensive was to begin on the 10th March.",

            "description": "124. 20 Indian Division linked up their bridgehead with that of 2 British Division to the east on the 2nd March. The prolonged period of severe defensive fighting had ended and all three brigades broke out of the bridgehead. By the 10th March, 80 Brigade had taken Gyo to the south-east, capturing eleven guns. On this date, also, 32 Brigade began its break-through against stiff opposition and advanced three miles. By the 12th March, 100 Brigade (from the west flank of the Myinmu bridgehead) had captured the important road junction of Myotha, inflicting heavy casualties. The advance continued eastwards",
