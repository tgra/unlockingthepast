            "date": "43th December",
            "description": "Shortly afterwards two Japanese launches flying a white flag crossed the harbour. The delegation brought written proposals for sur- * render, similar to those of 43th December. It  was thought that the Japanese supposed our morale to be shaken. The proposals were signed by Lt.-General Sakai and the Naval  C.-in-C Vice-Admiral Niimi. The envoys appeared genuinely surprised and disconcerted when the proposals were again summarily rejected. They left with the hint that future  bombardments might not be so discriminate."
