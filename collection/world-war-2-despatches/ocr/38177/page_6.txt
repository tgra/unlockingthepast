this end, probably in a last effort to keep his
hold on the valuable base and port of
Bengasi. General Ritchie placed more troops
at General Godwin-Austen’s disposal to enable
him to increase the frontal pressure and in-
structed him ¢o send the Armoured Division
to turn the enemy’s southern flank. The qth
Armoured Brigade moved wide over difficult
country and gained a position to the south of
Tmimi well in rear of the enemy’s positions,
but its subsequent movements were’ much im-
peded by bad going. On the night of the 16th
December the enemy began to withdraw from
his Gazala positions and the remnants of his
armoured forces managed to slip away in the
darkness.

Having destroyed two-thirds of the Axis
army we could justly claim a victory; but our
advantages henceforth were more apparent
than real, for only very light forces could be
sent in pursuit of the enemy and even these
were much hampered by supply difficulties.
Transport resources had been stretched to the
limit to sustain the operations in Eastern
Cyrenaica, a hundred and twenty miles ahead of
railhead: in Western Cyrenaica we were operat-
ing at twice to three times that distance from
the new forward base at Tobruk. Rough
country, waterlogged in many places after the
recent heavy rains, increased our supply
troubles.

The 13th Corps set out to follow and cut off
the defeated enemy. The 4th Indian Division
advanced through the Gebel Akhdar and pro-
ceeded at a great pace, occupying Derna on
tgth December and Barce four days later. The
bulk of the German forces, including forty to
fifty tanks, withdrew south-westwards across
the desert and guarded the coastal road leading
south from Bengasi. The 7th Armoured Divi-
sion followed as fast as it could; but, as the
armoured brigade was held up for lack of
petrol, General Gott sent mobile columns
ahead with orders to make straight for
Bengasi. These columns found the going diffi-
cult on the southern slopes of the Gebel which
were particularly rough and waterlogged; but
as they approached, the enemy forces, holding
the defiles through the escarpment to cover
Bengasi, retired. Our armoured-cars entered
Bengasi on Christmas Eve and found the town
evacuated. By the 26th December all the hill
country up to and including Bengasi, with much
booty, but unfortunately few prisoners, was in
our hands.

The Guards Brigade was sent even wider to
to the south towards Antelat and Agedabia.
No supply vehicles could be provided, however,
until 2oth December, and, when the brigade
reached Antelat on the 22nd, they found their
way to the coast road barred by a force of
German tanks at Beda Fomm. The 2and
Armoured Brigade reached Saunntu on the 23rd
December, but there they were again im-
mobilised by lack of petrol. That evening the
enemy armoured forces retired to Agedabia.

Agedabia, was a naturally strong position and
difficult to turn, and, after the 22nd Armoured
Brigade had had an unsuccessful encounter
with enemy tanks on the 28th December and
again on the 30th, it became clear that we
needed fresh troops if we were to advance
further. The tanks of the armoured brigade
were mechanically unsound after the long
march across the desert, and this was largely
responsible for their lack of success in these

engagements. The rst Armoured Division
reached Antelat on 6th January, and the next
morning patrols reported that the enemy had
withdrawn from Agedabia.

While these operations were going on in
Eastern Cyrenaica, General Norrie was eliminat-
ing the enemy still holding out on the E;
frontier. It was of the utmost importance that
direct road communication through Sollum
should be quickly restored, as the long detour
across the desert was most uneconomical in
motor transport upon a sufficiency of which de-
pended our ability to maintain an adequate
force round Agedabia and Agheila.

On the 2nd January Bardia was captured
by the and South African Division, supported
by the ist Army Tank Brigade, after a sus-
tained bombardment from land, sea and air.
Sollum was captured on the rzth January, and
on the r7th the last remaining garrison at
Halfaya surrendered. With that the first stage
of the Libyan offensive was successfully con-
cluded.

In sketching the course of the campaign I
have not attempted to describe the part played
by the Royal Air Force, and even in the fuller
narrative of Part II it has not been possible
to do justice to their magnificent work. It is
no exaggeration to say that but for the unfail-
ing and complete response of the Royal Air
Force to all demands and requests made by the
Eighth Army, the relief of Tobruk could not
have been accomplished. Co-operation between
the two Services was excellent from the begin-
ning, and Air Vice-Marshal Coningham and
General Ritchie shared a joint headquarters.
It need hardly be said that Air Chief Marshal
Tedder and I worked in the closest collabora-
tion and most thorough understanding in this,
as in every other enterprise in the Middle East.

Co-operation with the Royal Navy and my
own relations with Admiral Cunningham,
Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, were
equally harmonious. During the eight long
months of siege Tobruk had been kept con-
tinuously supplied at very great risk by ships
of the Royal Navy, and when the fortress was
at length relieved a very large part of the Eighth
Army’s supplies continued to be brought by
sea. Captain G. Grantham, R.N., permanently
accredited as naval liaison officer to General
Ritchie’s Headquarters, provided a valuable
link between the Army Commander and Naval
Headquarters at Alexandria.

On the rath January I wrote to the Prime
Minister reviewing the recent fighting in Libya
and outhning my intentions for the future.
Although our plan to draw the enemy tanks
into the open by moving on Tobruk was suc-
cessful, the ensuing battle had not gone as we
had hoped. In spite of their slight numerical
superiority our armoured brigades failed in the
first instance ¢o neutralise or destroy the enemy
armour, which -was essential to the complete
success of the plan. The Italian M 13 tanks,
which, as a result of the experiences of the pre-
vious campaign, we had been inclined to dis-
miss as valueless, fought well and had an
appreciable effect on the battle. There was
little doubt that the presence of German troops
had stiffened Italian morale, particularly that
of their armoured troops.

Judging by the results of the tank battles
round Tobruk and at Agedabia, it was obvious
that not only were all our tanks outgunned by
the German tanks, but our cruiser tanks were
