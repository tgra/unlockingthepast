two months, and it is with great personal regret
that I now leave you on the arrival of your
new Army Commander. During these weeks
you have stopped the enemy; and, in spite of
your heavy losses and the inevitable disorganisa-
tion consequent on a rapid withdrawal from the
frontier, you have forced him on the defensive,
taken ten thousand prisoners from him -and
destroyed or captured many of his guns,
vehicles and other equipment. You will, I
know, join me in acknowledging the great and
glorious part our air forces have played in help-
ing us to achieve these results. Without their
aid the story would have been very different.
I thank you with all my heart for the magnifi-
cent way in which you have responded to the
heavy calls I have made on you and for your
unfailing cheerfulness and tenacity in the worst
circumstances. I know you will continue in the
same fine spirit and determination to win under
your new Commander. I wish you luck and
speedy and complete victory.”

Part III.—OrGanisaTion, TRAINING AND
ADMINISTRATION.

The Organisation of the Army.

To find the correct organisation for the fight-
ing troops to enable them to defeat the enemy
under the peculiar conditions of mechanised
war in the Desert was of prime importance.
This problem, therefore, was always foremost
in my mind.

At the conclusion of the Eighth Army’s
offensive in Cyrenaica it was plain to me that

our existing divisional and brigade organisation .

did not allow of that very close co-operation on
the battlefield between the armoured corps, the
artillery and the infantry which was to my mind
essential to success. The Germans had reached
a very high standard of co-operation between
the three arms and I felt that we must try at
least to equal and, if possible, surpass them.

There was no doubt, too, that as a result of
the recent fighting an impression had been
created in the minds of some junior leaders
and soldiers, other than those of the Royal

. Armoured Corps, that our armour had not alto-
gether pulled its weight in the battle. It was
very necessary to eradicate any such feeling,
and I felt that the best way to do this was to
associate the three arms more closely at all
times and in all places,

It seemed to me that our pre-war divisional
organisation was too rigid and lacking in
flexibility to be really adaptable to the con-
ditions of modern quick-moving warfare in the
Desert, or even elsewhere, having regard to
the fact that great battles are fought and won
in flat country, not in mountains.

I decided, therefore, while keeping the
divisional framework with its traditions and
associations, to reorganise the brigades,
armoured, motorised and infantry, into brigade
groups each with its own artillery and engineers,
so that they could be self-contained and cap-
able, if necessary, of rapid transference from
one higher formation to another to meet the
temporary needs of a rapidly changing situa-
tion. In this way I felt too that the three arms
would be forced into closer permanent contact
with each other and all officers would have a
chance to acquire a broader outlook, which was
often conspicuous by its absence as a result of
faulty traditions and training.

Secondly, I was sure that our practice of
forming large armoured. divisions, strong in
tank units and relatively weak in infantry, was
wrong, because it tended to encourage the idea.
that the Royal Armoured Corps was an army
within an army and also because, to gain the
mobility and flexibility we required for victory,
we must have more armoured divisions. By
diluting armoured divisions with motorised
infantry we could not only form twice as many
armoured divisions, each with a smaller con-
tent of armour it is true, but also restore the
proper balance of the three arms and so secure
their better co-operation on ‘the battlefield.

I therefore teorganised my armoured.
divisions, giving to each an armoured brigade
group and a motorised infantry brigade group
instead of two armoured brigades and a sup-
port group. This organisation, which proved
its value in the subsequent operations, was
later introduced into the army in the United
Kingdom.

At the same time I had considered the in-
clusion in the armoured division of a lorried
infantry brigade group, but later discarded this
idea as likely to make the formation too cum-
bersome. But, as a result of the fighting which
culminated in the battle of E] Alamein, I again
considered changing the basic divisional
organisation so as to produce a division of
increased striking power and mobility in place
of the infantry division, which, as often as not,
had proved to be a liability rather than an asset
in desert fighting, owing to its relative immo-
bility and its vulnerability in open country.

My idea was that the normal or basic
division should contain an armoured brigade
group and a motorised brigade group, each
with its own artillery component, and, in addi-
tion, an artillery group comprising two field
regiments and a motorised medium machine-
gun battalion. Each division would also have
allotted to it a lorried infantry brigade. This
brigade would not necessarily move with its
division at all times, but, being lorry-borne,
could be rushed forward when needed, either
to carry out a deliberate attack on an en-
trenched enemy position, or to consolidate
ground gained to form a pivot of manoeuvre.
The ‘remaining infantry would be retained in
their divisional organisations and used for hold-
ing defensive positions, protecting forward aero-
dromes, and guarding vital points on the lines
of communication against air and sea-borne
attack. They would be specially trained and
equipped for these duties and also to serve as
replacements for the lorried infantry brigades
in the mobile divisions. These ideas were being
examined when I handed over my command.

The Training of the Army.

Reorganisation alone obviously would not
bring about that closer co-operation on the
battlefield and improvement in mutual under-
standing between the three arms which was so
necessary. I therefore ordered a drastic over-
haul and reorganisation of our ‘training system.
In this I was most ably assisted by Major-
General’ A. Galloway, my Deputy Chief of the
General Staff, and by my Director of Military
Training, Major-General A. F. Harding who,
was appointed in January 1942 to this post,

- which was created at my request.
