SUPPLEMENT to rHE LONDON GAZETTE, 12 APRIL, 1951

efficiency eliminated a multitude of small
delays; these ancillary organisations worked
with the industrial efficiency of a large com-
mercial factory.

59. A comparison between the American
packing loading agencies at Dinjan and the
R.LAS.C. Air Supply Companies at Hat i
reflected no credit on the British ground organi-

sation. Here it should be emphasised that no .

reflection is intended on the personnel in-
volved; British Officers and Indian Other
Ranks were strained to breaking-point, and
often had to work seventy-two hours at a
stretch to complete their tasks; the fault lay
in the fact that the importance and nature of
the work demanded a much more generous
scale of personnel, facilities, and organising
ability than could be allotted by the Army.

60. An examination of the data gathered on
Air Marshal Garrodâ€™s tour brought to light the
differences of organisation and procedure
between the two air supply systems, and re-
vealed a crying need for improvement in the
organisation operated by C.A.A.T.O. and
C.C.T.F. Too numerous to recount here, these
points did have the effect of initiating action to
improve the operating procedure, Meanwhile,
Air Command was pressing for the speedy
development of the recaptured bases along the
Arakan Coast at Akyab and Ramree whose
employment would shorten the haul into Cen-
tral Burma. Journeys from the established
bases at Chittagong, Comilla and Tulihal were
now becoming so long that in order to com-
plete three trips in a day, aircraft had to take
off at first light and perhaps not finish until
after dark. The strain on technical mainten-
ance, flying and loading personnel can well be
imagined.

61. It was in February that an overland
advance to Rangoon supplied entirely by air
was first put forward as a serious proposal.
Fourteenth Army prepared a plan which
envisaged two parallel drives southwards along
the axes of the River Irrawaddy and of the
Mandalay-Rangoon railway, while a large force
from 33 Corps, of up to three and a half divi-
sions, struck east to Takaw with the object of
containing and destroying all enemy forces cut
off north of Meiktila.

62. Air Command reactions to the plan were

G) a re-orientation of supply lines, using
Akyab and Ramree as advanced air supply
heads which would result in substantial re-
duction in length of the air supply line as
the force advanced south of Mandalay.

Gi) We doubted the soundness of the plan
which aimed at a total destruction of the
enemy in addition to the capture of Rangoon
if the former necessitated a drive eastwards
to cut off and destroy the enemy in the hills.
This would inevitably involve a_ supply
problem in that direction in addition to
sustaining a main advance southwards.

63. A study of the situation after the fall of
Rangoon shows that these reactions were fully
justified. Apart from this, the plan had many
advantages, and at a major conference in
Calcutta on 23rd February which heralded my
arrival as Allied Air Commander-in-Chief, it
was approved in principle and the target for

1973

tonnage to be hauled in its execution decided.
The maximum lift was assessed at 1,887 tons
per day between 20th March and Ist April and
2,075 tons per day between Ist May and 15th
May. I emphasised that these figures would
entail a very high rate of effort from the
squadrons involved, and would entail consider-
able retrenchment during the monsoon to pay
off the mortgage in maintenance and overstrain
we would have contracted in its achievement.

64, Meanwhile, the air lift was still increas-
ing. In February, C.C.T-F. hauled 51,210 short
tons of supplies into the operational area. In
addition, at the end of the month, a small
though vital airborne operation took place to
consolidate the capture of Meiktila, which had
been seized following an armoured dash from
their bridgehead on the Irrawaddy by 17 Divi-
sion.

65. Troops were landed to reinforce the fly-
ing column which had seized the airfield and
was now being fiercely attacked on all sides by
the enemy. Transport aircraft landed and dis-
charged their loads under fire, many suffering
damage while so doing. One aircraft taking
on wounded for its return journey had a shell
explode inside it, causing further injuries to
the casualties who were already emplaned.
Thus, within very few days, landing became
impossible, and it was necessary to resort to
the less economical practice of dropping, which
still further increased the load on our transport
squadrons.

66. The Meiktila operation was a success,
and a captured Japanese Staff officer assessed
it as the turning point in the battle for Burma.
It was not accomplished without mistakes, how-
ever, which rendered it far more hazardous
than it might otherwise have been. It should
be established that aircraft will not land until
the possibility of the airfield being subjected
to heavy fire is ruled out. Planning should be
carried out on this premise. Secondly, the
R.A.M.O. that was established on the airfield
was pitifully inadequate, the officer in charge
having to guide aircraft to unloading points
instead of being free to organise their quick
turn-around under fire. In a critical opera-
tion, such points might make all the difference
between success and dismal failure. They
merit much greater consideration in combined
planning than has hitherto been accorded them.

67. By the beginning of April, Meiktila was
again safe for landing, although shells were
still bursting less than 200 yards from the
strips. Preparations were immediately com-
menced to build up stocks to maintain Four-
teenth Army in the final dash which was to
carry them 250 miles southward in the second
half of the month. On the 20th, the main
airfield at Lewe was captured and speedily
prepared for light aircraft and gliders, which
began landing on the morning of the 21st.
Toungoo, 50 miles further south, was occupied
on the 22nd and, in spite of bad weather, over
100 Dakotas and Commandos landed on the
24th. Within five days, Pyuntaza, another
airstrip 70 miles further south, was also receiv-
ing supplies, and a battalion group was flown
in to cut the enemy escape route eastwards
from Pegu. The enemy was still active on
both sides of the narrow strip along the
Mandalay-Pegu railway which had formed our
