Diary or Events.

Part I.

Passage of Straits of Gibraltar to detaching of Force X and commencement of Force 2's withdrawal.

Monday, woth August (D.1).

Cape Spartel was passed at midnight 9oth/ roth. During the passage through the Straits of Gibraltar a large number of fishing boats was passed  between Malabata and Tarifa and also two neutral steamers steaming to the westward. . .

2. At 0245 fog was encountered. The visibility'was at times down to 1 cable. The fog cleared at 0500. At 0840 the force proceeded sestwards at 134 knots in Cruising Disposition

o. 16.

3. During the day, ships which had been detached to refuel at Gibraltar rejoined, and at 1600 the force was complete with the exception of WRESTLER, who, owing to a mechanical defect, was later replaced by AMAZON.

4. The day was uneventful except that alarms were caused through the I.F.F. of several of the Hudson aircraft provided by Vice-Admiral Commanding, North Atlantic, for A/S patrol, not showing. This on one occasion caused the  duty section   of 4 fighters to be flown off from VICTORIOUS to intercept and entailed the breaking of W/T silence on radar reporting and fighter direction waves.
