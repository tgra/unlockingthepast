sixty sorties per month. Generally, planning
did not exceed more than fifty sorties per
month, in view of the maintenance difficulties,
the extremely long sorties which had to be
flown, and the fact that the Guerilla Organi-
sations might not have continuous operations
in hand. While it was possible to carry out
the majority of the operations over Malaya
with safety during daytime, or under last light
conditions, it was not considered wise to make
these flights in daylight in the immediate
vicinity of Singapore.

285. The three principal home bases for the
S.D. operations were at Jessore in Bengal,
Minneriya_in Ceylon, and later the Cocos
Islands. The operations from the Cocos did
not begin until mid-July, when sorties were
flown to all parts of Malaya. From Bengal,
the S.D. operations were principally over
Burma and French Indo-China, but flights
were also made deep into Malaya, one air-
craft logging twenty hours thirty-nine minutes
for one of its sorties.

Operations Increased for Malaya.

286. The strategic plan for the assault on
Malaya called for an even greater effort by
the S.D. squadrons based in Ceylon. By July,
the underground forces had been so organised
by our personnel, and supplied with arms and
equipment to such proportions, that they con-
stituted a very real threat to isolated garrisons
of Japanese troops. The time was considered
opportune to foster and galvanise these organi-
sations into a formidable. fighting force to
harass the enemy at the time of our own land-
ings in Malaya. For this purpose, therefore,
it was decided to use heavy bomber aircraft,
based on the Cocos Islands, to supplement the
S.D. operations into Southern Malaya, and to
employ these aircraft on the first ten nights
of the July and August moon periods. These
operations were controlled by Headquarters,
No. 222 Group. Aircraft airborne from the
Cocos Islands were routed in daylight through
the gap in the Sumatra mountain range between
1° North and 2° North, and carrying a pay-
load of 5,000 Ibs. In this way, approximately
75 per cent. of the Malayan dropping zones
was covered.

287. In order to carry out very long range
S.D. operations within the Command with
worthwhile payloads, Liberators at one time
were operating with an all-up-weight (a.u.w.)
of 66,000 Ibs. This had paid a great dividend
in establishing links with the underground
forces in Malaya.

288. To keep the a.u.w. within the margin
of safety, however, and at the same time carry
the maximum payloads, it was necessary, on
occasion, to cut the amount of extra petrol
carried to the irreducible minimum ; to strip
aircraft of non-essential equipment, and to
carry only essential crews.

289. In the weeks immediately preceding
-the Allied landings on Malaya, a considerable
weight of weapons, ammunition and concen-
trated food was dropped to thousands of
organised guerillas, together with trained
guerilla leaders.

290. The operational records of the aircraft
engaged on S.D. operations in the Command
show that aircraft of No. 222 Group alone
flew: nearly 11,000 hours between May and

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 APRIL, 1951

September, 1945. The Cocos squadrons,
although not altogether fully experienced in
S.D. work, speedily established an enviable
reputation for accurate dropping. When it
is realised, too, that the sorties carried out
by Catalina aircraft entailed, for the most
part, night landings on enemy waters in vary-
ing conditions of sea, without benefit of fiare-
path, some idea is gained of the high skill
required from these R.AF. pilots.

291. The sudden end of the war in South
East Asia did not conclude the tasks of the
S.D. squadrons, but brought instead a new,
series of commitments under Operation
“Mastiff” for the relief and liberation of
Allied prisoners-of-war, an aspect which is
dealt with in a later chapter of this despatch.

Outstanding Operations by Lysander Aircraft:
. 292, Any report or narrative on S.D. opera-
tions would be far short of completeness with-
out mention of the magnificent work done by
light aircraft, notably Lysanders. The untiring
efforts of Lysander pilots, indeed, greatly
assisted Force 136 to carry on their activities
behind the enemy lines during the drive through
Burma, and I feel justified in singling them out
for especial mention.

293. Particularly outstanding work was done
by the Lysander Flight of 357 Squadron, Not
only were personne] infiltrated, but seriously
wounded personnel were evacuated from the
field. In addition to the urgent operational
stores flown in, commitments had included
transport of Staff Officers to Party Commanders
in the field, and the evacuation of enemy
prisoners-of-war and documents.

294. The versatility of the flight had in-
creased with each operation. Sorties often
necessitated flying in foul monsoon -weather
and landing on very smail strips. On one occa-
sion a landing was attempted at Ntilawathihta,
near the Papun-Momaung Road, on a very
short strip and on wet and slippery grass. The
aircraft slid into a deep ditch at the end of the
strip, but escaped with negligible damage. In
attempts to extricate the aircraft, lumber
elephants would not go near, but the com-
bined efforts of fifty local inhabitants even-
tually succeeded in hauling the plane back on
to the strip; the pilot then flew back to base.

295. On many occasions Lysander sorties
came near to failure owing to the presence of
Japanese troops in the area. Force 136 nearly
always had to cover the landing area for fear
of surprise by Japanese patrols.

296. On another occasion, a pilot was in-
volved in a skirmish between Japanese troops
and Force 136 Guerillas at Lipyekhi, when
his aircraft failed to start for the return journey
to Rangoon. Firing took place across the
strip, but the aircraft escaped damage. It
was rendered serviceable next day by a rescue
sortie, and was able to return to base.

297. Another escapade was accomplished
when Squadron Leader Turner, Flight Com-
mander, damaged his Lysander in an attempt
to pick up personnel at Ngapyawdaw, near
Kinmun. Shortly after he had landed, the
neighbourhood was compromised by Japanese
forces and repair of the aircraft was impos-
sible. Attempts to rescue’ Squadron Leader
Turner were abortive until ten days later,
