. 30th July.

The Force passed through: Position “ Cc ”
about 0300 on the 30th July and ADVENTURE
was detached. As she was only -one hour
behind her programine I did not consider it
necessary to make an amended’ time ° for her
rendezvous. | _ - :

24. The weather éonitinned ovficast and from ‘

- the point of view of ‘evasion it could hardly
_ have been better; the conditions were such that
it was extremely unlikely that -the Force would
be sighted by aircraft. My experience of the

‘ weather had made me realise the possibility that

‘fog might come down in the middle of fiying- ”

‘off. I therefore made a plan by which-one
carrier operated on one side of a line parallel
to the wind through the flying-off position and “
- the other carrier on. the other side, and I
arranged that, so far as ___ possible,
DEVONSHIRE and VICTORIOUS should
operate on the inshore side of this line, thus

giving FURIOUS a clear run to seaward. After °

discussion with V-ICTORIOUS : the original
Position: “‘ M ”’ was decided .on for the flying-
off position and a position 30 miles, 040 degs.
from Position ‘‘ M_’’ was fixed for flying-on. I
also made 1400’ the zero hour, ‘half an hour
_ later than’ my original intention. ;

25. During the” approach German destroyer :

wireless signals had been heard, and by the use

of the HF/DF set* in INGLEFIELD it had -

been: possible to place them as operating off

Tana Fiordt. At-one time I had an idea that '

they were escorting a convoy towards Kirkenes,
but eventually came to the conclusion that they
were probably hunting a Russian submarine off
Tana Fiord. Considerable interferencé was also ©
experienced on the R.D.F.. This seemed to
come from a station of sorts at Vardo. As we .

approached the coast. R.D.F. transmission was -
stopped as I felt it was possible’ that x might.

_ lead to our. detection.

26. The weather was at frst iavonrable,
overcast. low clouds and visibility not too good,
but about 1200 the clouds thinned and finally
cleared away with good visibility. Still, the
Force had not been sighted and there appeared
every reason to hope that the attack would be

- launched without it being ‘detected. The wind
was off shore ‘and +this facilitated the approach,
These hopes, however, were doomed. At 1346,
just .as FURIOUS was flying
canes, which had to be got off the deck before
her T.S.Rs.t could’fly off, an .He.r1z- was
sighted. An enemy report was made by this
aircraft and from that moment the German

. destroyers operating off Tana Fiord ceased to .

- transmit. I considered it was too late to call
. off the attack and it-was accordingly launched’
as originally arranged.

flew off twenty T.S.Rs. in one range, followed
by twelve ‘Fulmars ‘eighteen minutes later.
FURIOUS commenced ten minutes _ before
VICTORIOUS by flying off four Hurricanes
and nine T:S.Rs. These were followed by a _
‘second range of nine. T.S. Be and finally by six.

“28. The Striking . Force went: into the attic
as planned at 1429 (Z +: 29). followed seven
minutes later by the fighters. Three of the;
Fulmars from VICTORIOUS and the fo
Hurricanes were kept for the protection of
Force. During thé attack the Hurricanes w
refuelling in -VICT ORIOUS.

29. The Striking "Forse knew before leavi ig
that the Force had been sighted and that they
must meet fierce opposition: Nevertheless the
attack was pressed home courageously and

gallantly: in , face of great .odds aid
VICTORIOUS’s - aircraft suffered heavy
casualties. ° : "

30.- The material results were disappointing,
The: attack by VICTORIOUS’s aircraft was
thought to have achieved results as follows :—

. BREMSE. «Two teepede hits.
2 Merchant Ships. - At least one torpedo
. hit each. ,

hit each.

It has: ‘since been ‘learnt that BREMSE was *
not hit.

3r. FURIOUS had the misfortune to find
- Petsamo empty of’ shipping and her torpedoes
had to be expended on easily repairable wooden
quays, but it is probable that her bombs did
* considerable damage to the oil tanks and ship
yard. .

32. Capea ©), ‘gra Destroyer Flotilla in
INGLEFIELD . was sent shorewards to visi-
‘bility distance ‘to act as a guide to returning
aircraft and remained there until completion
- of fiying- -On.

* 33. At t6r2 aircraft were seen to be ‘return-
ing from the attack and it soon became apparent
.that many weré missing’ from VICTORIOUS.
At- 1735 VICTORIOUS reported that she was
still short of eleven Albacores and two Fulmars,
_ who had petrol till about 1900. FURIOUS had
" completed landing on at 1657 and reported the
loss of, two Fulmars and one Albacore. I in-
informed the Forcé that I should remain in the
vicinity until .Tg00.

+34. Daring the fiying-off andl ‘fying-on’s opera-
tions, the, two divisions of, the Force had
operated independently, the cruisers conform-
ing to the carriers’ movements. VICTORIOUS -
had orders to remain as near as possible to
FURIOUS. . These’ operations were very satis-
" factorily catried out and at no time were the
carriers more than six or seven miles apart.
