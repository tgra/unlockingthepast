Fiord, This was held by some to be a neces- sary prelude to any direct attack upon Narvik itself, allowing, as it would, of the positioning of field artillery on the peninsula to support such an attack. As soon as the necessary area had been occupied and, with the assistance of H.M.S. FAME, the northern shore of Rombaks. Fiord had been cleared and occupied as far as Lillelerget, General Bethouart felt himself ready for the next stage, for which he had prepared his plan, i.e., the capture of Narvik. Com- mander Hubback was attached to the French Staff for this purpose; his success in this work in connection with Bjervik had been much appreciated by the French Command. My general direction to him was that he was to do: everything to further the project and to promise that all possible naval support would be forth- coming. He carried out this work admirably. It was decided that the attack would take place on May 23rd/24th or on the first favourable opportunity after that date. This was the earliest date it was estimated the M.L.Cs. could be released from what, at the moment, was the all important work of preparing Bardufoss and Skaanland Aerodromes for the reception of Hurricanes and Gladiators. The conditions that were required to form a favourable opportunity were held to be either\u2014"

The C.O. decided that he would be unable to hold the position and conducted an orderly withdrawal behind the Gidu. armoured cars covered the withdrawal and acted as a decoy to the enemy tanks. Unfortunately three armoured cars got bogged following the infantry over soft ground and had to be abandoned after all weapons, etc., had been removed. (In point of fact all these armoured cars were eventually recaptured.) Meanwhile on 13th May 1 N.M.R. attacked the positions cover- ing Sciasciamanna. This energetic attack was completely successful and resulted in the cap- ture of 800 prisoners, two batteries of artillery and nine tanks. The advance was continued to Sciasciamanna which was entered on 14th May, and to Dalle which was occupied on 17th May. A further 650 prisoners, some guns and armoured cars were captured."
