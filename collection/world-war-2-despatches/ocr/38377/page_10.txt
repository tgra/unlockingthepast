51. The damage to FIREDRAKE was
doubly unfortunate in that it deprived the port
column of the convoy of T.S D.S. protection.
FEARLESS and NESTOR had been detailed as
spare T.S.D S. ships. FEARLESS having been
sunk, NESTOR only remained. The delay
which would have resulted while NESTOR
streamed her sweep could not be accepied.
Furthermore, in the absence of FEARLESS,
FIREDRAKE, AVON VALE and ERIDGE,
the screen was already undesirably thin. The
Rear-Admiral Commanding, 18th Cruiser
Squadron, therefore, decided to accept the in-
creased msk of damage by mines and to press
on without further delay, retaining NESTOR
on the convoy screen.

Enemy Aircraft Search for Convoy.

52. At 2000 Force X and the convoy altered
course to the northward in accordance with the
pre-arranged route. The latter had been selected
solely from the point of view of safety from
enemy mines, but the alteration to the north-
ward at this time had another and unexpected
advantage, for just over an hour later enemy
aircraft were reported on the starboard bow.
These split into two groups and made an
abortive attempt lasting half an hour to locate
the convoy.

53. There is no doubt that the enemy ex-
pected the convoy to take a more or less direct
route from the Skerki Channel to Pantellaria
In fact, they must have felt certain of this since
they made no attempt to keep the corivoy under
air observation during the critical period before
and just after sunset, and in consequence the
alteration of course to 075° at 2000 was un-
observed, and the anticipated attack at dusk,
which was most to be feared, never materialised.

54. At 2250 Force X altered course to 105°
and a quarter of an hour later to 133°. From
this time until midnight aircraft were observed
searching with flares to the southward of the
convoy. The flares appeared to be towed, but
no opinion could be formed of the effectiveness
of this method of search.

55. The period between 2250 and 0013/24,
when the convoy entered the Italian convoy
route, was probably the most dangerous irom
the point of view of mines, and in view of the
absence of the T.S.D.S. destroyer ahead of the
port column and of two M.T. ships being with-
out paravanes, it was with considerable relief
that C.$.18 turned to 160° at 0013/24 into the
Italian convoy route.

56. At 0046, FOXHOUND, 5 cables ahead
of the starboard column, reported a mine in
her sweep and moved over to port to clear it.
Except for a distinct bump felt earlier at 2017
on the bridge and in the engine room of
NESTOR, followed by a report of an object
like a mine in the wake, this was the only

* evidence of the presence of mines throughout

the passage.

E-Boat Attack on Force X, 0300 2qth July
(D.4).

57. The convoy passed through Position K
12° E.) at 0230. A quarter of
an hour later three unidentified objects were
detected by COSSACK, stationed 5 cables ahead
of the port column, on her R.D.F.

58. At 0250, short flashes of light followed
by the sound of motor engines starting up
indicated to COSSACK and EDINBURGH
(leading the port column) the presence of
E-Boats.* One was promptly illuminated by
searchlight and heavily engaged by these two
ships. MANXMAN found the target perfectly
illuminated by cross searchlight beams and also
opened fire. After firing torpedoes, one of
which passed under the stem of COSSACK,
the E-Boat retired at high speed but not before
she had been repeatedly hit. Two torpedoes,
either from the same or another E-Boat, passed
down the port side of EDINBURGH.

59. Shortly afterwards, ARETHUSA, the
rear ship of the port column, sighted another
E-Boat, which had apparently passed down
between the port column of the convoy and
the destroyer screen. This boat was engaged
by both ARETHUSA and FARNDALE (the
rear ship of the port screen), and hits were
observed. One officer in ARETHUSA was con-
fident that the boat was stopped; there is no
evidence, however, that she was sunk.

60. Shortly after these attacks, one ship of
the convoy was observed by NESTOR (the rear
ship of the starboard screen) to be dropping
astern.

Subsequent action by NESTOR is referred
to later in this narrative.

61. At 0305 the noise of an E-Boat was heard
by EDINBURGH on the port side, and imme-
diately afterwards its wake was seen. It was
promptly illuminated, and raked with pom-
pom, o.5-inch and Oerlikon fire at 1,500 to
2,000 yards range, the target appearing to be
enveloped in a hail of tracers. The E-Boat
stopped out of control, and at this moment
the main armament fired a broadside of 12 guns
at fixed sight range. When the splashes sub-
sided nothing was seen.

62. Meanwhile, COSSACK detected hydro-
phone effect by asdic in several positions ahead,
and at 0315 sighted ‘another E-Boat on the port
bow. Speed was increased and endeavour
made to ram, but the boat passéd across
COSSACK’s bows too close for searchlight to
follow. Fire was opened and sounds like
splintering of wood heard. A torpedo was fired
by this boat, and it is estimated to have passed
immediately under the stem of COSSACK, who
was only 100 yards from the enemy at the time.

63. For the next 20 minutes further sounds
of motor engines were heard by COSSACK and
EDINBURGH, but no further contacts were
made, other than a fleeting glimpse from
COSSACK of a boat withdrawing under cover
of smoke. Discretion on the part of the sur-
viving E-Boat Commanders was apparently
allowed to suppress their valour.

64. The result of these encounters was that
of the 6 to 12 E-Boats present, one was sunk,
one possibly sunk, and two others damaged.

65. This meeting with E-Boats might have
had different results had their attacks been
carried out more resolutely. It seemed that
they were not expecting surface forces, and the
surprise discounted their tactical advantage.
