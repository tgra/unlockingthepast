6. The reference in article (d) to offensive
operations squadrons of the Tactical Air
Force was hardly more than a convenient
fiction. Its purpose was not so much to place
these operations under my control, as to pre-
vent them from prematurely absorbing the
energies of the Air Officer Commanding and
staff of the Tactical Air Force, to the detriment
of their more important task of preparing for
the coming events in Europe. Although the
operations were planned and their execution
ordered from the headquarters of No. 11 Group,
which was part of my command, they were
supervised until the 15th March, 1944, by the
Air Commander-in-Chief himself. Thereafter
they were directed by the Air Marshal Com-
manding, Second Tactical Air Force (Air
Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham, K.C.B.,
D.S.O., M.C., D.F.C., A.F.C.). This arrange-
ment was typical of a series of complex rela-
tionships brought about by the special circum-
stances of the time. In effect it meant that the
Air Officer Commanding, No. rr Group {Air
Vice-Marshal H. W. L. Saunders, C.B.,
C.B.E., M.C., D.F.C., M.M.), while he never
ceased to be constitutionally my subordinate,
acted for certain purposes as the agent first of
Air Chief Marshal Leigh-Mallory and later of
Air Marshal Coningham.

7. My real task, then, was that set out in
articles (a), (b), (c) and (e) of the directive,
and as much of article (d) as related to opera-
tions by formations under my own command.
In short, it was primarily a defensive one.
Although squadrons of A.D.G.B. were to play
their part in operations over France during the
assault phase of the European operations, the
Overall Air Plan issued by the Air Commander-
in-Chief showed that my most significant
responsibility even in that phase would be to
stand guard over the base. Obviously, we
were approaching a stage at which the needs
of the offensive must have priority. The direc-
tive of the 17th November emphasized the need
for economy in defence “‘ in order to make
greater provision for offence ’’, and called upon
me to suggest changes in organisation with this
need in mind. My problem, in fact, was to en-
sure, with limited resources, that the United
Kingdom was securely defended from air attack
as a base for the great operations by land, sea,
and air which were being planned.

(b) Resources Available.

8. In the circumstances some “' rolling up ””
of the Group and sector organisation seemed
clearly justified. No. 14 Group, in the north
of Scotland, had already been amalgamated
with No. 13 Group before the time of my
appointment. During the next few months I
secured approval for further reductions. By
6th June, 1944 (D Day) the number of opera-
tional fighter Groups had been reduced to four
and the number of active sectors from tq to 14

—tless than half the number in existence at the
end of 1941. Still further reductions were made
later.

g. Plans for translating the Air Commander-
in-Chief’s directive into practice were worked
out by my staff and his in consultation. The
basic strength of A.D.G.B. was fixed at ten
day-fighter and eleven night-fighter squadrons.
In addition six night-fighter squadrons ear-
marked for allotment to No. 85 Group—a
Group formed for the purpose of defending the
overseas base after the ]and forces should have
advanced beyond the lodgment area—were to
be put under my command for the time being.
So long as I retained them I should be respon-
sible for the night-fighter defence of the lodg-
ment area as well as the United Kingdom and
the waters between. Similarly, six day -fighter
squadrons intended ultimately for No. 85
Group ‘were to be put at my disposal to enable
me to keep German reconnaissance aircraft at
bay, and perform a number of other tasks
arising directly out of the situation created by
the coming assault. Finally, another fifteen
day-fighter squadrons were to remain nominally
in A.D.G.B., but be lent to the Second Tacti-
cal Air Force for the duration of the assault
phase. Only in an emergency would these
squadrons revert to my operational control
before the end of that phase. It was agreed,
however, that if a serious situation should
arise, the Air Officer Commanding, No. 11
Group, would be justified in using any part
of ‘his uncommitted resources (other than
American units) for the daylight defence of
his Group area. A few aircraft of the Royal
Navy would also operate under my control.

ro. Thus, the maximum number of Royal
Air Force, Dominion and Allied squadrons on
which I was expected to call—including the
fifteen squadrons lent to the Second Tactical
Air Force—would be 48: rather less than half
the number that had been considered necessary
for the defence of the United Kingdom at the
end of 1941, when the main theatre was in
Russia.

Ir. However, since 1941 much progress had
been made in the technique of fighter intercep-
tion, especially at night. The German Air
Force, on the contrary, was known to have
lost a great deal of its hitting power since
those days, and its offensive spirit had de-
clined. Furthermore, great advances had been
made in the technical methods and equipment
on which the “‘static’’ elements of the air
defence system relied. Against this I had to
reckon with the psychological difficulty of
maintaining the fighting spirit of men placed
on the defensive while their opposite numbers
were fighting an offensive battle. But despite
this handicap, and despite the numerical
limitations of the forces under my operational
control, it was my opinion that the air de-
fences would give a good account of them-
selves against any attack by orthodox weapons
that the German Air Force might deliver.
