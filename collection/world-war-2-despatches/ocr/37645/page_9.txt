SUPPLEMENT To Taz LONDON

forward to place itself astride the Barentu-
Agordat road, south of Agordat, Gazelle Force
covered its left flank and secured the L. of C.
of 4th Indian Division. The Commander 4th
Indian Division took'a risk by side-stepping
his force from the west to the south of Agordat,
and against a determined enemy capable of
launching a counter attack his L. of C. would
have been in jeopardy, but, throughout the
advance from Kassala, the enemy had shown
no very determined fighting spirit, and in the
ciroumstances this risk was justifiable.’ By 27th
January, 5th Indian Infantry Brigade had
reached Biscia and was moving forward to join
1th Indian Infantry Brigade as quickly as it
could be moved, bringing with it the ‘I’
tanks. Such had been the speed of the move
that 4th Indian Division Signals had now
Teached breaking point. Over 100 miles of
cable had been used, and there had been no
time to collect the cable which had been laid
out in the Gash area before the advance had
commenced. The cypher personnel were over-
worked, and were approximately 48 hours
behind hand with their messages. Commander
4th Indian Division destroyed these messages
and started afresh. .

Agordat was the first town of any size met
in Eritrea. It was a strong defensive position.
To the north and west the Baraka Valley; south
was the feature known as Laquatat—a large
hilly feature, with concrete trenches, emplace-
ments and O.Ps. East of the Laquatat feature
and extending for about two miles is an open
plain, intersected with dry stream beds, and
defended by a series of field defences and anti-
tank pits. This plain was bounded on the east
by M. Cochen, a big, rocky feature rising 2,000
feet from the plain. At the foot of M.-Cochen
towards Laquatat is a low underfeature, a mere
pile of rocks roo feet high, forming a natura]
flank to the line of artificial defences across the
plain. This feature was named Gibraltar by
4th Indian Division. The strada from Barentu
approaches Agordat from a direction slightly
west of south, and on entering the town turns
sharply east and runs through a narrow gorge
bounding M. Cochen on the north. From
thence it runs through more open country until
crossing the River Carabei at the Ponte
Mussolini, a large modern bridge 18 kilos from
Agordat.

The Gourse of the Battle.

The course of the battle was as follows.

Gazelle Force was first ordered to explore
the possibility of encircling Agordat from the
south, but found themselves entangled in the
many khors and had to return. They next
attempted to get round the north flank, but
again difficulties of the Baraka River: and the
dom-palms were too great. Gazelle was then
left watching the northern flank, whilst rzth
Indian Infantry Brigade was moved across to-
wards M. Cochen, 5th Indian Infantry Brigade
stepping-up and taking its place on the left of
rrth Indian Infantry Brigade, connecting 11th
Indian Infantry Brigade and Gazelle Force. “A
night reconnaissance in force discovered that
Laquatat was very strong. Commander 4th
Indian Division therefore directed rxth Indian
Infantry Brigade on to M. Cochen and two
battalions supported by an Artillery O.P. Party
succeeded in establishing themselves on the top
of the mountain. ‘They were strongly resisted

by five battalions of the enemy and although
severely counter-attacked, and on one occa-
sion nearly driven off, a grip was maintained on
the ‘hill for 48 hours. A note-worthy incident of
the fighting on this hill was the gallant bayonet
charge by a party of Sappers and Miners led
by an Indian Officer in aid of a hard-pressed
party of 3/14 Punjabs. On the morning of
31st January, 2 Camerons attacked and stormed
the rocky ridge known as Gibraltar. On this
being secured, x Royal Fusiliers, supported by
“IT” tanks, launched a successful attack
against the enemy positions in the plain
between Laquatat and M. Cochen. 2 Camerons
exploited along the lower slopes west of M.
Cochen, knocking-out enemy medium tanks
with anti-tank rifles as they advanced. Shortly
before mid-day three ‘“I’" tanks and the
carriers of 2 Camerons carried out a raid along
the west side of M. Cochen towards the main
road. In this area they: encountered enemy
medium and light tanks and troops which were
probably the enemy’s counter-attacking force
waiting in this area. Five medium and five
light tanks were destroyed and large numbers
of enemy troops, both Italian and Native, were
killed. At 1430 hours 3/1 Punjabs, supported
by two ‘I’ tanks, passed through 1 Royal
Fusiliers and secured some low hills just to the
south-east of Agordat. These were captured
just before nightfall, and the enemy’s main
L. of C. was cut. Artillery O.Ps. on M.
Cochen had reported during the afternoon that
they could see the enemy withdrawing from
the Laquatat feature into the town, and the
R.A.F. reported large bodies of enemy stream-
ing through. the gorge north of M. Cochen.
Two ‘I tanks under command of a Second-
Lieutenant were sent into the gorge after dark
in an attempt to create a panic. Next morning
Agordat town was occupied by 5th Indian
Infantry Brigade, and although the enemy and
native population had indulged in a night of
looting, destruction of property was not unduly
great. A large quantity of war material and
guns fell into our hands. A proportion of the
enemy infantry escaped by rail and over the
hills to the north of the main road,

Barentu Front.

In the meantime sth Indian Division was
attacking Barentu. By 27th January, 1oth
Indian Infantry Brigade advancing on Barentu
from the north after their action east of Kern
had reached a point about two miles north of
the town. Here the road winds up a long and
very steep gorge. The road itself works its way
up the western side, and near the top the enemy
had carried out a successful demolition, blow-
ing hundreds of tons of rock down on to the
road. : .

The country around Barentu is excellent for
defence, consisting as it does of a number of
low ridges, thickly covered by scrub. To a
defender they offer a series of good rearguard
positions. To an attacker they are difficult, as
it is hard to point out an objective, and even
harder for the attacking troops to know when
they have reached an objective. Barentu itself
is on a little knoll in the centre of a saucer of
hills. The defence had the advantage of excel-
lent covered lateral communications and
although pressed from two sides, could deny
artillery observation to us until the rim of the
saucer was secured. It was through this type
