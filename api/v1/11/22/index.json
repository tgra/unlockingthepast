            "description": "rthage conferences on 25th October and 3rd November and it had been agreed that an amphibious landing should be made south of the Tiber when Fifth Army had advanced to within reasonable supporting distance. I had Proposed to use for this x British Infantry Division, which had been originally intended for Eighth Army. The landing craft situation was quite uncertain. I pointed out on 8th November that, on the present programme, my Armies would still be ten thousand vehicles short by xst January and that it would be impossible to mount\u2019 an amphibious operation before 25th December. If the craft were then withdrawn it would be impossible to lift as much as a division with what would remain. However, we decided to go on planning on the assumption that sufficient might be avail- able. The SEXTANT conference was due to open in Cairo on 22nd November and General Eisenhower agreed to press there for the re- tention of the landing craft which I thought Necessary."

            "description": "-140. On 22nd November, 1941, G.H.Q. issued their appreciation of the situation. Briefly, this appreciation considered that any further major action by Japan in the near future would take place from South Indo-China against Siam, rather than from North Indo- China against the Burma road. G.H.Q. did not, however, disregard the possibility of Japan making a \u2018\u2018 gambler\u2019s throw \u2019\u2019 against Malaya or even against Singapore itself. G.H.Q. concluded that the most likely operation which would be called for on our part in -the immediate future would be to the set plan \u2018\u2018 Matador,\u2019\u2019 namely an advance by our land forces into South-East Siam? A.H.Q. was accordingly instructed to make all preliminary moves and to be ready to support \u2018\u2018 Matador \u2019\u2019 at 72 hours\u2019 notice, and was informed that this support for \u201c* Matador \u2019\u2019 was to take precedence over the preparations then being made for an Inter- national A'r Force to operate in South China. A.H.Q. was also warned that the full recon- naissance plan for detecting the approach of a sea expedition against Melya might be ordered later."
