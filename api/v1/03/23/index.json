            "description": "42. Mopping up in the thick mountainous jungle was a difficult and necessarily slow operation, and it was not until the 5th March that we were able to resume the interrupted course of our offensive. Razabil was captured by 5 Indian Division on the 12th March. It was found to be a position of great strength, complete with underground rooms, etc. The Tunnels position was surrounded by the 19th March, and was finally captured by 36 British Division some days later. Meanwhile, 7 Indian Division had taken Buthidaung and had also captured the outer ring of the Kyaukit defences. These defences were evacuated by the enemy on the 23rd March and considerable equipment fell into our hands. On the 25th, about 500 enemy again infiltrated to the Negakyedauk area, but were dealt with expeditiously.",

With the arrival of fresh formations this programme was now beginning to show results: “ ¥ ’’ Division was dissolved on 16th March when relieved by 3 Infantry Brigade, the first to arrive of xz Infantry Division; the other two brigades of the division took over sectors of the front on 1gth and 23rd March and Divisional Headquarters assumed command in the Medjez area. 78 Division and x Guards Brigade were relieved and the latter went to join 6 Armoured Division in reserve.

The enemy had already begun to move reinforcements to this area, including 164 Division from the western end of the Mareth line, together with some Italians, and 2r Panzer Division from Army Group reserve.

Nothing could move on the Giggiga plain without being seen, and the aerodrome was in full view of the hills 9,000 yards away. The enemy appeared to be holding a broad front and therefore Commander 11th (A) Division decided he would await the arrival of 1st S.A. Brigade and attack the pass with two brigades on 23rd March. Patrol activity by the Nigerian Brigade during this period resulted in a claim by the enemy that heavy attacks had been carried out, all of which had been repulsed with great loss. On 20th March I received definite indications that the enemy was planning a further withdrawal and it was decided to attack with the Nigerian Brigade only, next day. After stiff fighting ist Nigeria Regiment were able to take a height overlooking the pass on its northern side by 2000 hours on the evening of the arst. The enemy evacuated the pass that night. It transpired that the position was in fact 4 miles in breadth. It was heavily wired, had gun positions iunnelled into the hills, extensive tank traps and mine fields. It had however no depth, and there is little doubt that, the occupation of the height captured by our troops had made it untenable.",

            "description": "The armies facing us were still strong* wellequipped and in good heart. Four divisions, by no means the best, had been transferred to the Eastern front between January and March to balance the transference of the Canadian Corps and 5 British Division from my command but General von Vietinghoff, who succeeded Field-Marshal Kesselring on 23rd March, on the latter’s transfer to the Western front, commanded on that date a force of twenty-three German and four Italian (German-equipped) divisions. t Furthermore, by contrast with other fronts, the divisions which faced us in Italy were real divisions and not the scratch baitlegroups which usurped the name elsewhere. Reinforcements had continued to arrive and a vigorous comb-out of rear areas and a considerable reduction in all but essential services had maintained fighting strength. The parachutists, for example, were particularly strong —1 and 4 Parachute Divisions went into action with sixteen thousand and nearly fourteen thousand men respectively—and so were the mobile divisions; in fact the average strength for German divisions was eleven thousand five hundred, slightly over the standard war establishment strength for infantry divisions at that period of the war.t The troops were well rested and had spent the period of the lull in intensive training. Morale ‘was astonishingly good. In spite of the desperate situation of German arms in the homeland itself the Germans in Italy continued to show the same resolute spirit of resistance and dash in counter-attack which had distinguished them hitherto. It was not until they had been driven against the Po, and had lost all their heavy weapons in the vain attempt to cross it, that any large-scale surrenders were recorded.§ To",

Its military importance lay in its seaplane base, in the possibility of establishing an aerodrome there, and in its potential value to the enemy as a submarine base. The original garrison was one British company. For security against a Japanese raid a battalion of Gurkhas was added early in January, When it became obvious that Rangoon could not be held, it was decided to withdraw the whole garrison, which was successfully carried out on rath March. On 23rd March the Japanese occupied Port Blair.",
