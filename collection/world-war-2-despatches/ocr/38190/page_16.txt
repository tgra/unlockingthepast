off at 0500 hours. The Royal Navy however
did not take over these infantry posts, for the
bulk of the naval party was used in‘an attempt
to reinforce Wong Nei Chong Gap from the
South.

(x) At daylight laden junks, barges, motor
launches and ferries were observed crossing to
the vicinity of North Point, but the exact area
of Janding was not under observation as ‘‘ low
level ’’ observation posts had been over-run,
and buildings, etc., obscured the foreshore from
the view of the upper observation posts.

(y) Between 0800 and ogoo hours small par-
ties of enemy were observed on Jardines Look-
out, coming down on to Wong Nei Chong Gap.
In this area confused fighting was taking place,
troops of various units participating, as well
as the Canadian Brigade H.Q. staff. Brigadier
J. K, Lawson (about ro0o0 hours) reported
that the H.Q. shelters were over-run, firing into
them was actually taking place at point blank
range and that he was going outside to fight
it out, after destroying telephone exchanges,
etc. He did so, and I regret to say was killed,
together with his Brigade Major. Major Temple
and personnel of H.Q. West Group, R.A. were
also killed. During the next thirty-six hours the
groups of shelters here changed hands several
times, but in spite of every effort the enemy
secured a definite lodgment.* Part of the
enemy attack came on to Stanley Gap and

- involved the 3.7-in. A.A. Section there. The
Royal Artillery of the nearest 3.7-in. Howitzer
positions were called on to assist, and leaving
their gun position were drawn into the fighting
with their small arms. Unfortunately, as it
was thought that a temporary counter attack
only was involved, steps were not taken to
temove small essential parts, e.g., locks, or
firing levers, and these guns together with
ammunition later fell into enemy hands and
were used against us. t

64. The Officer Commanding R.A.F. had
some time previously requested that his officers
and men should be used for ground defence,
and at this time the Royal Air Force were taking
up positions with the Royal Navy in the Aber-
deen area, where they assisted materially in the
subsequent fighting.

65. (a) It now became necessary to form a
new West Group R.A. This was done at
Wanchai Gap, and communications readjusted
by 1500 hours, Major Duncan being appointed
Commander. This smal) group of artillery gave
admirable support during the next few days,
being continuously in action though repeatedly
shelled and dive bombed. Such counter
battery work as remained possible was under-
taken by R.A. HQ at Fortress HQ.

(b) At 0845 hours, roth December, the
Mount Parker 6-in. Howitzer Section 600 yards
North of Tytam Gap was firing with one of its
howitzers straight down the road towards
Lyemun ‘Gap. :

informed me that {fe Japanese had suffered very

t Lt: Gen. ‘Kitajama"three weeks after the capitu-
lation informed my Commander, Royal Artillery, of
this fact Our defences in the Mount Cameron area
also noticed that at one period the enemy artille:
fire seemed far more efficient, every round going off,
and no “‘ blinds ’’ as customary. A map of artillery
dispositions was also shown to the Commander, Royal
Artillery, with three regimental artillery areas marked,

SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 29 JANUARY, 1094

66. At 0730 hours six motor torpedo boa
were sent to the vicinity of Green Island to t
ready to attack enemy vessels ferrying trooy
from the mainland to the’ island. On the
arrival at the rendezvous they were orderé
direct by the Commodore to attack in pair
The first attack by M.T.Bs. 07 and og wi
successful and sank one enemy landing craf
set another on fire and forced a third to tu
back (each held about forty troops). Whil
returning 07 was hit and damaged, and w:
towed in by 09. The second pair of mot
torpedo boats had already been ordered |

_attack, but by the time of their arrival ferryir

actoss the harbour had ceased. Whilst retur
ing M.T.B. 12 was badly hit and ran asho:
out of control in Kowloon Dock area. Tt
third pair were ordered not to attack, but b
mischance (or deliberately) M.T.B. 26 di
so and was sunk with all hands i
the middle of the harbour. During the:
operations these craft came under fire fro
both sides of the harbour, and in the fin
stages enemy fighter aircraft joined in hb
attacking them with light bombs and wit
machine gun fire. Our casualties amounted 1
80 per cent. It was not considered that adequa
results would accrue from further attacks b
day or by night, the harbour being full :
wrecked shipping and underwater obstacles.

67. At 1000 hours, 19th December, Lieut
Colonel J. L. Willcocks (who as previous!
arranged, was commanding the Defence Forc
around Stanley Prison of which he was Supe
imtendent) reported that the Stanley platoo
of prison officers was in its prepared positior
on Stanley Peninsula, covering the batteries.

68. At this juncture I conferred wit
Brigadier Wallis about the stabilisation of tt
position. The situation was that at 0800 how
the Royal Rifles of Canada were finding it difi
cult to maintain their positions on Mou
Parker and they were attempting to hold tk
6-in. Howitzer positions in that area, togeth
with the R.A. personnel who had taken u
local defence dispositions. Some of the R.é
personnel consisted of those from the .6-ir
Howitzer Section at Lyemun Gap which ha
been over-run. No British officer was avai
able for this latter section. Owing to the lack «
mobilization transport and the 40 ft. haul u
to the road by winch, the guns had been aba
doned and small parts removed.

These defensive positions round the Mou.
Parker 6-in. Howitzer position were obvious.
not adequate to act as a serious “‘ stop ’”’
the enemy. They had been hastily improvise:
Mount Parker not being held by us, they we
overlooked by high ground on two sides, ar
were only six hundred yards in front of tl
Combined Headquarters of East Infant.
Brigade, the infantry battalion in the Sout
East Sector, and R.A East Group. Infant
available for reinforcing in -this area had be:
employed towards Mount Parker and were nc
out of touch. There was thus the grave dange
if the enemy staged a serious attack here, of t
loss of all these Headquarters ‘and the cutti
off of all the troops in the area Collins
Battery—d’Aguilar Peninsula—Obelisk E
included in which were the wireless persont
of the Civil Government at d’Aguilar Wirelc
Station. Accordingly I anthorised Brigad
Wallis to withdraw his HQ to the Stonet
