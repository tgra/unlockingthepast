SUPPLEMENT to raz LONDON GAZETTE, 2 JUNE, 1948

The Ishigaki strikes took off at 0855 and
1440. Both runways at Ishigaki field were
left unserviceable and Miyara airfield was hit.

Low cloud varying between 7/10 and 9/10
made bombing difficult at both islands,

At 1423 a high snooper was detected
approaching the Fleet from the westward.
Fighters were ordered to 30,000 feet’ and at
1442 intercepted 36 miles to the south westward
at 26,000 feet. The enemy, a Myrt, was shot
down 4 minutes later by Hellcats from H.M.S.
INDOMITABLE.

One airborne enemy aircraft was shot down.
Several barges were damaged.

554 tons of bombs plus 95 R/P were dropped"

on targets.

Own losses:—in combat nil; operationally
I Avenger and 2 Seafires.

During the day Commander Third Fleet’s
.Signal was received. This indicated the nature
of future operations for the British Pacific
Fleet. In the light of this, and after con-
sulting A.C.1, it was decided to release H.M.S.
FORMIDABLE early for repair of battle
damage. It was felt that this was necessary
to ensure that 4 carriers would be available
for operations on completion of the forthcoming
storing period. This decision was communi-
cated to Commander Fifth Fleet.

At 1930 the dusk CAP were landed on,
radar pickets were recalled, and the Fleet
withdrew to area Cootie. CTF 57 assumed
tactical command at 1930.

proceeded in tow of H.M. Tug WEASEL to
Leyte, H.M.A.S. NORMAN acting -as escort.
CTF 112 was requested to arrange for a larger
tug to meet and relieve H.M.S. WEASEL.

were continued.

HMN.ZS. ACHILLES joined. 1F 57.

During the day 2 Hellcats from H.M.S.

Manus.

At 1815 the Fleet detached from the Tanker
Group taking departure for the operations area
with only 3 carriers in company. It had been
hoped to bombard Miyako on the morrow, but
with the reduced number of aircraft available
it was judged wiser to forego this plan in favour
of an entire air effort.

24th May.
At 0510 A.C.1 assumed tactical command.
In view of the absence of H.M.S. FORMID-
ABLE, it was planned to send in only 4 strikes
each day, the first to be flown off 2 hours later
than normal so as to provide late afternoon
strikes as desired by CTF 51.

At dawn visibility was low, the sky overcast
with rain and drizzle. Flying-off was post-
poned. At ogoo four fighters flown off reported
weather improving slowly in the vicinity, and
at 1000 it was decided to make 3 strikes 3 during
the day, os flying-off position being 23° 40’ N
126° 52’ E

wooded area near Hirara where one large ex-
plosion was observed, ~

ways at Ishigaki airfield were left unserviceable.
Three hits with 1,600 lb. bombs were observed

vicinity the last CAP was landed on at 1907 and
radar pickets were recalled. The Fleet with-
drew to the southward for the night, and CTF 57
