SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

Japanese savagery in Borneo. They were con-
sequently reluctant to continue guerilla tesist-
ance in Java-in the circumstances in which they
finally found themselves. It was only then,
when the British wanted to go on fighting after
the general capitulation in Java, that differ-
ences arose as to the best line to pursue.

686. Nevertheless, I want to express my
thanks to the Dutch Their wish to help was
unbounded. They fulfilled their planned under-
takings to the full. Special recognition 1s due
to those of them who, as a result lost their lives
in Malaya’s defence. When arrangements had
to be made to transfer the R.A.F. to the N.E.L.,
their Army, Air Force and Civil Administra-
tion placed everything at our disposal. As a
community the Dutch refused the British
nothing—labour, materials, money and help of
every kind were ungrudgingly given—frequently
at considerable sacrifice. The devotion of their
‘doctors and nurses to our sick and wounded
was outstanding. The Royal Air Force owes
a debt of gratitude to these people.

‘Recommendations for meritorious service.

. 687. I have already reported to the appro-
priate branch of the Air Ministry the names of
those whose services were particularly
meritorious, and whom I recommend for
honours, awards and mention in despatches.
But I want to bring to your notice here the
units mentioned hereunder, and also to name
a-few individuals who rendered particularly
meritorious service but who, I regret to report,
are no longer alive.

Air Vice-Marshal C. W. Pulford, C.B., O.B.E.,
A.F.C.

688. This officer, despite ill health, worked
unceasingly and uncomplainingly to overcome
the many difficulties with which he was faced
when preparing his Command for war and
after hostilities had broken out. He never
flinched from meeting an overwhelming situa-
tion with very inadequate means. No man
could have striven. more wholeheartedly to
carry a burden which was far beyond one man’s
capacity. All his decisions were reached with
complete disregard for self and entirely in the
interests of what he felt to be his duty accord-
ing to the situation and to his instructions.

689. He refused to leave Singapore himself
until all his men had been evacuated. He lost
his life in a last-minute attempt to follow his
Command to the N.E.I. (see para. 394). His
selfless devotion to duty and his loyalty to all
those around him, both senior and junior, were
an inspiration to all.

Personnel of the R.A.F. Far East Command.

690. I am confident that the late Air Vice-
Marshal Pulford would wish me to place on
record the praiseworthy manner in which the
personnel, of all ranks, under his Command
carried out their duties. I know ‘how deeply
he appreciated the loyal support they gave
him.

Aircrews.

691. The aircrews of our squadrons, of the
Royal Air Force, Royal Australian Air Force
and Royal New Zealand Air Force alike, con-
sistently met the calls that were made upon
them despite the enemy’s great superiority in
numbers and equipment,

especially in the’

matter ot fighters. Their own aircraft, onthe
other hand, were many of them obsoléte and
old, and were difficult to maintain owing to
technical shortages and poor tacilities for over-
haul work. Their aerodromes possessed little
protection against air attack, sometimes none
at all. They flew long distances by night over
jungle-clad country in the face of violent tropi-
cal thunderstorms with the help of only rudi-
mentary navigational aids; towards the end with
none at all. It is difficult to overstate the
‘cumulative effect of the hazards ‘which they
faced. They deserve the very greatest praise
for the way in which they consistently carried
out their missions despite these hazards and
despite casualties.

692. At the risk of selecting examples which
may prove invidious to other units, against
whom no reflection is intended, I would par-
ticularly mention the following : —

Fighter Defences of Singapore.

693. Credit is due to the spirited leadership
of the late Group Captain E. B. Rice, Fighter
Defence Commander of Singapore, and of the
late Wing Commander R. A. Chignell, his
Chief Air Staff Officer. Both were outstanding
in their selfless devotion to duty. They were
primarily responsible for the good morale which
the small fighter force at Kallang maintained
throughout the campaign in the face of a numer-
ous and better armed enemy. The steadiness
of the ground personnel of this fighter station
is also worthy of mention,

No. 4 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit.

694. This flight, flying unarmed and unarm-
oured Buffaloes, unfailingly carried out their
photographic missions deep into enemy terri-
tory dominated by a very superior enemy
fighter force. Its service throughout the
Malayan campaign was most valuable.

No. 232 (F) Squadron.

695. This unit, under the leadership of the
late Squadron Leader R. E. P. Brooker D.S.O.,
D:F.C., who volunteered to take command at
a critical moment, was in constant action from
the time it arrived in Singapore in mid-January
1942 until fighting ceased in Java. It inflicted
severe casualties on the enemy in the air, in
landing craft and on the ground. It volunteered
to remain in Java as the last fighter squadron.
Great credit is due to all ranks of a magnificent
squadron, drawn as they were from the ranks
of several different fighter units.

Nos. 36 and 100 (TB) Squadrons.

696. These two squadrons attacked the enemy
landing at Endau on 26th January, 1942,
covered as it was by numerous Zero fighters,
whereas their own fighter escort was unavoid-
ably small. They pressed home their attacks
on their obsolete Vildebeeste torpedo-bombers
regardless of casualties, amongst whom I regret
to report were lost the Commanding Officers of
both squadrons, the late Squadror’ Leaders
R. F. C. Markham and I. T. B. Rowland. After
being reorganised into a composité: squadron
in Java, and after having patched up their old
aircraft, they again pressed home attacks against
the enemy convoys which were invading that
island, this time at night, again suffering casual-
ties and the loss of ‘their squadron commander,
the late Squadron Leader J. T. Wilkins. Such
gallant conduct speaks for itself.
