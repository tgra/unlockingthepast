SUPPLEMENT to tHz LONDON GAZETTE, 5 JUNE, 1046

(b) In view of the above it was impossible
to operate fighters at all and for this reason,
and only this, the enemy had local air
superiority.

(c) Because there was no aerodrome in
Somaliland from which to work, our
bombers were forced to operate from Aden
which was a range of 200 miles over sea. At
this range the air effort was greatly ham-
pered and it was impossible to keep in close
touch with the military situation.

(d) Since the enemy had iocal air
superiority our bombers were continually
being attacked by fighter aircraft while the
crews were trying to concentrate their atten-
tion upon the ground to assist the Army and
trying to get a grip of the fast changing mili-
tary situation. This made our bombers
extremely vulnerable.

(e) The aircraft with which we are
equipped is a fast medium bomber which is
excellent for its proper role but unsuitable
for close army co-operation work, especially
when not protected by fighters.

Conclusion.

13. In short the air effort expended in sup-
port of the Army in Somaliland was the maxi-
mum which could be given with the air forces
available and with no protected aerodrome
from which to work. It proved expensive in
aircraft and crews but certain valuable results
were obtained.

14. In conclusion the sincere thanks of the
R.A.F. at Aden are due to the Military
Authorities in Somaliland for their assistance,
close co-operation and careful regard to our
limitations m the circumstances,

i. In normal circumstances A.A. Bofors
guns would have been made available for the
defence of aerodromes at Berbera and Laferug.
None, however, existed with the force.

2. I would not like an impression to arise
that no A.A. defence was provided by the
Army at these two aerodromes. Each aero-
drome was given ground and low altitude
defences by a Platoon of Infantry with two
A.A. V.B. guns; whilst at Berbera the A.A.
layout of the two 3-inch A.A. guns included
protection of the aerodrome as far as was
possible, though the primary objective pro-
tected was the port area.

3. In actual fact, the platoon protecting the
Berbera aerodrome brought down one enemy
fighter.
