nneventful, Force C arriving Alexandria at 1700
on the 2gth May.’

23. At 2100 on the 28th May, Force D, con-

for Sphakia, where they were to embark troops

during the night 29th/3o0th May.

eas Seer ee the N Ra al. Officer-in-
Charge, Suda at Sphakia saving Boe up to
1 000 troops would be available for evacuation
atthe following night but another message was
recsived from CREFORCE stating that it was
unlikely that the, troops could hold out until
the night goth/ 3ist May. CREFORCE
thought that ‘‘ an optimistic view ’’ of the fight-
ing troops which could be evacuated, was under
2,000 but.there would be a number of stragglers
(CREFORCE 0.672 timed 1310 of 28th May).
Tt was deduced from these two signals that the
situation in Crete was very bad but that 10,000
troops remained to be evacuated. Of these,
only 2,000 would be in organised bodies.- The
night 2oth/30th May, would have to be the
last night for evacuation.

“sent to drop a message over Retimo ordering
‘the garrison to withdraw to Plaka Bay on the
south coast.
return and.CREFORCE reported that he could
not guarantee that the troops had. received the
‘message. . As they had no supplies it was doubt-
ful whether they would be able to reach the
coast. It was, therefore, decided to send ships’
to Sphakia only for the evacuation but 1,200
Tations were dropped by: air on Plaka Bay.

- 26. On the 2gth May, Major General J. F.
-Evetts, C.B., C.B.E., M.C., flew to Cairo from
Alexandria to explain the naval situation and
“to: discuss the question of further evacuation
, with General Wavell. After consulting General
-Blamey and Air Marshal Tedder, General
.Wavell sent a personal message to the Com-
*mander-in-Chief, Meditertanean, ‘saying that it
was thought that ‘‘ GLEN ”’ ships and cruisérs
ought not to be risked any more but that des-
troyers should continue the evacuation (MID-
EAST 0/ 18492 of 29th May).

27. In a ‘‘ Most, Immediate ’’ message to the
Admiralty’ the Commander-in-Chief, Mediter-
ranean, summarised the situation regarding the
evacuation up to-date. Three cruisers and one
destroyer had already been damaged and
casualties to the closely packed troops on board
amounted to some 500, Further heavy
casualties to men must be expectéd on the

- following day, especially if GLENGYLE was
hit with 3,000 troops on board. The Com-
*mander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, ‘asked if he
was justified in accepting a scale of loss and
_damage.to his already weakened fleet. He was,
‘however, ready and willing to continue the
evacuation as longaas a ship remained to do so,
‘realising that ‘it was against all tradition to
leave troops. deliberately in enemy, hands (the
Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean’s message
timed 1305 of 29th-May, to.Admiralty). .

28. A reply from the Admiralty was received
at 2026/29th ordering GLENGYLE to: tum

The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, how-
ever, considered that it was then too late to turn
the GLENGYLE back and he informed the
Admiralty accordingly, adding that three extra
destroyers, with. no troops-on board, were: being
sent to meet GLENGYLE (the Commander-in-
Chief, Mediterranean’s message timed 2147 of
2gth May to Admiralty). The Admiralty ap-
proved the Commander-in-Chief, Mediter-
ranean’s action (Admiralty message timed 0105

2g. Captain (D), Tenth Destroyer Flotilla in
STUART, with JAGUAR and DEFENDER
left Alexandria p.m. on the 29th May to join
Force D. These destroyers had no troops and
the intention was that in addition to providing
extra protection to Force D they would be
available to take troops off from any ship which
might be damaged by air attack (see paragraph

ne

30. During the course of the day, General
Evetts’ Staff Officer, Colonel R. B. Jennings,
had been able to interview a number of senior
officers recently returned from Crete. As a re-
sult of these interviews coupled with the more
hopeful signals which had recently come from
CREFORCE and the Naval Officer- -in-Charge,

* Suda, it became clear that the situation in Crete

was not so desperate as had been thought. The
Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, therefore,
decided to send four destroyers to embark men

on the night of 30th/3rst May. .

31. Meanwhile Force D, under C.S.15 were
proceeding to Sphakia. At 1003 on the 29th
May, a single JU.88 dropped a stick of bombs
close to PERTH without result. GLENGYLE
and the cruisers of Force D were anchoréd off
Sphakia by 2330/29th whilst the A.A. cruisers
and destroyers patrolled to seaward. The A.A.
cruisers were not required to embark any troops
but the destroyers closed in one at a time to
embark their quota. The troops were ferried
from the beach to the .ships in GLEN-
GYLE’s landing craft, assisted by two Assault
Landing Craft which had been carried in
PERTH. The beach was too small for ships’
boats to be used in addition. By 0320/30th a
total of about 6,000 men had been embarked
and Force D proceeded towards Alexandria.
Three motor landing craft were left behind. for
use on subsequent nights.

. At 0645 /30th May, STUART, JAGUAR,
ant ‘DEFENDER joitied Force D to act as
additional escort. Theré were three ‘air attacks
on the force during the passage to Alexandria.
In the first of these at 0930, PERTH was hit

‘and her foremost boiler rcom put out of action.

In the second'and third attacks there was no
result although bombs fell very close to PERTH
and JAGUAR. Some of our fighter patrols
failed to make contact with Force D- but the
force was covered by two or three Royal Air
Force fighters during most ‘of' the day. These
fighters, on one occasion, ‘drove off 20 JU.87s
JU.88s, and, in vatious engagements, shot
down two H.E.1r1s° and damaged a number
of other enemy “aircraft.: In addition, one

-JU.88 was séen “to be damaged by ‘ships’ gun-
fire. ‘ .
