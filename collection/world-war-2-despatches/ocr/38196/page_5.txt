SUPPLEMENT ro tar LONDON GAZETTE; 5 FEBRUARY, 1948

June, 1942; it was always employed to stiffén
the Itahan infantry;"ndminally under’ opera-
tional command of the Italian XXI Corps but
administered direct by Panzer Armee. The same
role was given to the Ramcke Parachute
Brigade of four battalions. This force was
apparently organised in the first place to co-
operate with the Italians in an assault on Malta
in the summer of 1942 which was cancelled
when Rommel’s success in the desert seemed
to render the operation unnecessary. It fought
throughout in a ground role and showed high
qualities of training and courage. Finally there
was a motorized, heavily armed group known
as 288 Special Force, a miniature motorized
division, originally organised to take part in
the Syrian campaign of 1941 and sent to Africa
in April, 1942.

The Italians provided two of the armoured and
six of the infantry divisions in the Panzer Armee.
The two former, 132 Ariete and 133 Littorio
Divisions comprised, together with ror Trieste
Division, XX Corps, usually qualified as XX
(Mobile) Corps. The northern end of the line,
from the sea to south of Ruweisat ridge, was
held by XXI Corps with, from north to south,
the German 164 Division, 102 Trento Divi-
sion* and 25 Bologna Division; two battalions
of the Ramcke Parachute Brigade were also
under command in the sector of the two
Italian divisions. The shorter southern sector
was held by X Corps with 27 Brescia and 185
Folgore Divisions.t The latter was originally
a parachute division, the first which Italy had
formed. It was rushed across hastily in August
to strengthen the infantry of the Panzer Armee
and was always used in that role.” Unlike the
other Italian Divisions, which were recruited
on a territorial basis, this division was formed
of men of outstanding physique picked from
the whole country and, although quite un-
accustomed to African conditions and ham-
pered by shortage of equipment and lack of
administrative services, it gave a very good
account of itself. Besides the formations I
have enumerated there were three independent
Bersaglieri regiments, of motorized infantry,
employed as Corps troops. In rear of the de-
fended line was 17 Pavia Division which was
resting at Mersa Matruh under Army command.
16 Pistoia Division, a recent arrival in Libya,
was in reserve in the Bardia area and the
‘* Young Fascists’ Division at Siwa oasis.

The organization and armament of these
troops reflected the prevailing conditions of the
desert. All the German formations, except
for the newly arrived 164 Division, were
motorized; the Italian divisions were not, except
for the three in XX (Mobile) Corps. The Ger-
man armoured divisions were equipped with the
Mark III and Mark IV tank; a few of the latter
were of the newer type with: the high velocity
75, millimetre gun. Italian armoured divisions
were equipped with the M13 tank, of thirteen
tons and mounting a 47 millimetre gun; it was
mechanically unreliable and poorly armoured.
In both German and Italian infantry divisions
the most striking feature was the very great
strength in anti-tank guns. It is fair to say
that, though all desert warfare is not armoured

name Folgore in September.

warfare, it is always conditioned by the presence
of" ariour; since the desert allows infinite
mobility and flanks are nearly always open,
every formation and unit down to the smallest
must be capable at any moment of all-round
defence and prepared to meet an armoured -
attack. For this reason anti-tank guns were de-
centralized down to infantry companies which
had a total of three apiece and, where possible,
six. They were usually of 50 millimetre calibre
though 90 Light Division was equipped with cap-
tured Russian 3 inch pieces (7.62 millimetre).*
The Italians in 1942 had carried out a re-
organization of their infantry on simular lines.
In both armies, therefore, the unit for infantry
was the company, organized on homogeneous
lines throughout and heavily armed with anti-
tank guns. A characteristic feature was the
formation of ‘‘ Kampfgruppen”’ or “‘ Rag-
gtuppamenti ’’ which we should call ‘‘ columns
of all arms” or ‘‘ task forces,’’ created for a
special mission.

The Axis Commander-in-Chief, Field-Mar-
shal Erwin Rommel, had commanded the
German forces in Africa since their first arrival
in February, 1941, and a considerable body of
legends had grown up around him. It was
natural that the British Press should pay par-
ticular attention to the German commander
whose forces were engaging the only British
army in the field at that time, but this interest
had led to an exaggeration of his undoubted
qualities which tended to have a depressing
effect on our own troops, however much it
may have appealed to the newspaper reader at
home. I have always considered it vital to
obtain all the information possible about my
principal opponents and I took steps shortly
after my arrival to sort out the truth from the
legends about Rommel. He was a Wurtem-
berger of a middle-class professional family who
was commissioned in an infantry regiment
shortly before the first world war; he served
with distinction .on the western, Italian and
Rumanian fronts, winning among other decora-
tions the order ‘’ Pour le Mérite,’’ the highest
Prussian award for gallantry. Between the two
wars he was chiefly known as the author of
works on infantry tactics. A Colonel in 1939
he commanded 7 Panzer Division in France in
1940 as a Major-General. Since arriving in
Africa he had been rapidly promoted from
Lieutenant-General to Field-Marshal and had
been awarded the senior grade of the Ritter-
kreuz, the highest Nazi decoration. As I
studied the records of his African campaigns it
was soon clear to me that he was a tactician
of the greatest ability with a firm grasp of every
detail of the;employment of armour in action
and very quick to seize the fleeting opportunity
and the critical turning points of a mobile battle.
I felt certain doubts, however, about his
strategical ability, in particular as to whether
he fully understood the importance of a sound
administrative plan. Happiest when controlling
a mobile force directly under his own eyes he
was liable to over-exploit immediate success
without sufficient thought for the future. An
example was the battle of November, 1941,
when, after winning a great tactical success at

aircraft gun, beloved of Allied War Correspondents,
