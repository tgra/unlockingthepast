First, the advance to the Dyle from roth-16th May ; then from r7th-26th May the withdrawal from the Dyle to the Escaut, the defence of the ian frontier and of the southern and western flanks ; and finally the withdrawal and embarkation of the Force from 27th-31st May.",

We could muster about two hundred and twenty medium tanks, and the enemy almost certainly no fewer.

The Canadian Corps was to move up Route 6 through Ferentino to the Army boundary and prepare to pass 6 South ican Armoured Division through in pursuit through Rome. Should the enemy succeed in stabilizing on the  Caesar? line 13 Corps would join in a concentrated attack to the north of the Canadians. Ferentino fell on 1st June and the Canadians pushed on to Anagni, which was captured on the 3rd. By this time the fall of Rome was clearly imminent and Eighth Army turned its best efforts to get forward 6 South African and 6 British Armoured Divisions to lead the pursuit. It was not an easy task, for the South Africans had to pass through the, whole Canadian Corps and then found Route 6 blocked by the French Expeditionary Corps and II Corps.
