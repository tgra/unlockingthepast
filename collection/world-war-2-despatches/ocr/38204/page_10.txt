1002:

return to base by the reverse of their oatward
routes, SCEPTRE and SEANYMPH remained
‘on patrol off Andoy,

113. THRASHER, TRUCULENT and
-SYRTIS arrived without incident at Lerwick
on 3rd and 5th October.

114. At about 1700A on the 3rd October a
weather forecast was received from the
Admiralty that weather was expected to
deteriorate and liable to reach gale force 8*
from the south-west in the vicinity of
STUBBORN’s position. Realising that dark-
ness was approaching and that should
STUBBORN, with X.10 in tow, meet this gale
during the night it might be impossible to take
off the crew, and that there would be. little
chance of regaining contact with X.xo if the
tow parted, I decided that the passage crew
should be embarked in STUBBORN while
there was still time. I informed STUBBORN
to this effect, instructing him to scuttle X.rto
at his discretion, since the chances of being able
to’ tow her the 400 miles to base without a crew
on board were slight and should she break
adrift she might drift into the enemy’s hands.

115. STUBBORN was in fact already having
trouble with her tow, for at 1230Z on the 3rd
October the tow had paried in a heavy astern
swell and considerable difficulty had been ex-
perienced in getting X.10 in tow again. The
last wire on board was already in use and this
had had to be recovered and passed again,
using the still serviceable portions; and it was
not until 1700Z that STUBBORN had been
able to proceed, at dead slow speed as the swell
showed no signs’of going down. The opera-
tional Commanding Officer and First Lieutenant
of X.r0 had been transferred back to their’ craft
to relieve the seaman and stoker passage crew
while this operation was taking place.

116. On receipt of my signal (see paragraph
114), STUBBORN decided to sink X.10 after
the crew had been recovered. The crew were
embarked by 2040Z and at 2045Z X.ro sank in
position 66° 13’ N. 04° 02’ E. STUBBORN
then proceeded and arrived at Lerwick at 1330Z
on the 5th October.

117. Whether X.10 could have been brought
into port is doubtful. The expected gale did
not materialise until the 6th October, Even
so, at the slow speed at which X.10 had to be
towed, STUBBORN could not have arrived at
Lerwick by that time. The loss of X.r0,
after all she had done and all the efforts
to bring her safely home, is very much
regretted however.

120, The success of this operation is the
culmination of many months spent in develop-
ing and perfecting the new weapon, in the
intensive training of the crews for the hazardous
enterprise, and in detailed and careful plan-
ning for the actual operation.

SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 FEBRUARY, 1948

r21. The officers and men under my com-
mand who have been responsible for the techni-
cal development in its early stages and for the
preparation of the craft immediately prior to
the operation have shown skill and persever-.
ance in overcoming the many difficulties which
have arisen. That so many of the ‘craft were
able to reach their destination in such good
condition after so long a passage is a credit to
all those concerned with their material and
equipment. In\this they have received every
assistance from the Admiralty Departments
concerned,

122. The operation involved the strictest and
most intensive training. By his leadership and
ability, Commander D. C. Ingram, D.S.C.,
R.N., as officer in charge of training inspired
all officers and ratings alike and achieved that
high standaid of training and fitness which was
so essential. He was responsible that the crews
were at the peak of their efficiency at the time
the operation began. :

123. The skill and seamanship shown by the
Commanding Officers of the towing submarines
played a most important part in the operation,
and the safe and timely arrival at the shpping
positions of four X-craft of the six which set
out is in no small measure due to the skill with
which these officers handled the submarines
under their command. I would like to pay
special tribute to the Commanding Officer of
H.M.S. STUBBORN, Lieutenant A. A. Duff,
R.N., for the determination and fine seaman-
ship he displayed both on the outward passage
with X.7 and in the recovery of X.10 and his
‘ater efforts to bring her safely to port.

124. The part played by the passage crews
of the X-craft contributed to a large extent to
the final success of the operation. During the
jong and arduous passage these crews kept their
craft in a high state of efficiency by constant
care and attention, so that with one exception
when the time came for the operational crews
to take over, the craft were in an efficient state
for the final stages of the operation. They
showed fine seamanship, determination and en-
durance. The one exception was X.1o0, and
her passage crew were in no way responsible
for the defects which developed on passage.

125. Finally, I cannot fully express my ad-
miration for the three Commanding Officers,
Lieutenants H. Henty-Creer, R.N.V.R., D.
Cameron, R.N.R. and B. C. G. Place, D.S.C.,
R.N., and the crews of X.5, X.6 and X 7,
who pressed home their attack and who failed
to return. In the full knowledge of the hazards
they were to encounter, these gallant crews
penetrated into a heavily defended fleet anchor-
age. There, with cool courage and determina-
tion and in spite of all the modern detices that
ingenuity could devise for their detection and
destruction, they pressed home their attack to
the full and some must have penetrated to inside
the A/T* net defences surrounding the
TIRPITZ. It is clear that courage and enter-
prise of ‘the very highest order in the close
presence of the enemy were shown by these
very gallant gentlemen, whose daring attack
will surely go down to history as one of the
most courageous acts of all time.
