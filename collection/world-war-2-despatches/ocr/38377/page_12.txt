and three more Swordfish to carry out a search
between 000° and 100° to a depth of 50 miles
to locate any enemy surface forces that might
be in a position to attack MANCHESTER.
None was sighted. MANCHESTER was re-
ported to be in position 37° 19’ N., 3° 44’ E.
at 0710 leaving a large oil track, slightly down
by the stern and with a slight list to port.

80. At 0816 a Cant was sighted 10 miles to
the eastward and was shot down by the fighter
patrol.

81. The situation at Iooo was as follows.
Force H in position 37° 18’ N., 04° 30 E.
steering 290° at 18 knots. FIREDRAKE and
ERIDGE south of Galita making 8 knots to
the westward, having “been reported by a
shadower at 0710. Convoy M.G.1 in three
gfoups ranging between 4o miles west to 20
miles east of Galita with one ship, the
SVENOR, just outside Malta. MANCHESTER
and AVON VALE about 65 miles to the west-
ward of Force H proceeding at 11 knots and
Possibly reported by a reconnaissance aircraft
at 0700.

82. I decided that Force H should continue
to the westward till about 1330 by which time
MANCHESTER would be reasonably clear of
enemy air attack, and would have three des-
troyers in company, Vice-Admiral Command-
ing, North Atlantic having ordered VIMY and
VIDETTE to rendezvous with her. About 1330
I intended to turn east in order to fly off 6
Swordfish for Malta during the night,and then
rendezvous with Force X in the Vicimty of
Galita Island about 0730.

83. During the day calls for help were in-
stercepted from all three groups of the M.G.
convoy. The first came at 1230 from EN-
COUNTER, who was escorting Group 2. She
teported a threatening aircraft in the vicinity
and later reported an attack by four T/Bs,
Ibut all torpedoes missed. The attack was
followed about 20 minutes later by high level
bombing when some 30 bombs fell between
AMERIKA and THERMOPYLAE. At 1345
ENCOUNTER reported 2 unknown ships bear
ing 283°, 12 miles from position 37° 18’ N..
8° 35’ E. These were later identified as FIRE-
DRAKE and ERIDGE.

84. At 1342 Group I called for help in posi-
tion 37° 19’ N., 8° oo’ E. A high level attack
Tesulted in bombs dropping between TALA-
BOT and BRECONSHIRE and half an hou:
later BRECONSHIRE was near missed by
some small bombs from a Caproni. Group 3
called for help at r171z when in the same posi-
tion and again at 1815.

85. ENCOUNTER left Group 2 at 1430 and

» proceeded ahead at 28 knots to join and escort

Group 1. At 1740 she was attacked unsuccess-
fully by 3 high level bombers, ENCOUNTER
joined Group 1 at 2140 and thereafter had an
uneventful passage. No further signals were
Teceived from any of these ships during the
day. Their estimated E.T.A.* at Gibraltar as
signalled by Vice-Admiral, Malta, was: —

Group 1 Dawn/ 26th.

Group 2 1800/26th.

Group 3 o100/27th.

Group 4 o100/ 28th.

Admiralty footnote -
* ET A —expested time of arrival

86. Force H turned to the eastward at
1345 and an hour later a reconnaissance of
5 Swordfish was flown off from position 37° 45’
N., 3° 47’ E. to search for enemy forces between
000° and 00° to a depth of go miles. Nothing
was sighted.

87. VIMY and AVON VALE, who with
VIDETTE were escorting MANCHESTER,
obtained an asdic contact at 1500 and carried
out several attacks with depth charges but there
was no evidence of success.

Despatch of 6 Swordfish to Malta.

88. At or00 ARK ROYAL flew off 6 Sword-
fish fitted with long range tanks for Malta
from position 37° 42’ N., 7° 17’ E. These all
arrived safely.

Movements of Force ’H, early a.m. 25th July
(D.5).
89. Force H turned back to the westward at
0130 for two hours and then proceeded east
to meet Force X.

go. At 0512 a flashing light was seen to the
north-east and ARK ROYAL was ordered to
fly off a Swordfish armed with depth charges
to investigate. It was thought this might pos-
sibly be a U-Boat homing aircraft. It turned
out, however, to be the Italian Hospital Ship
SORRENTO searching for survivors, presum-
ably after the air attack on the fleet on the
23rd.

gi. A reconnaissance of 3 Swordfish was
flown off at 0556 in position 37° 37’ N., 07° 32’
E. to make certain there were no enemy forces
between Force H and Force X. These aircraft
found nothing. The visibility was 10-15 miles.
A fighter patrol was flown off at 0615.

Departure of Force X from Malta, 24th July

(2.4).

g2. The cruisers of Force X left Grand Har-
bour at 1800/24 followed by the destroyers at
1845. All ships received a fine send-off from
the Maltese and in particular from the crews
of the M.T. ships and the troops who had taken
passage. FARNDALE who had developed con-
denser trouble remained at Malta.

93. Force X had a few air alarms during the
evening of the 24th but no attacks developed,
probably due to better support from the Malta
Beaufighters which, largely due to inexperi-
ence, had given me cause for anxiety by their
performance on 23rd July during the approach
to Malta.*

94. The force followed the same route as
that taken the previous day by Convoy M.G.r
and had an uneventful passage. This route ran
from 20 miles south of Pantellaria to Kilibia
light dnd subsequently in French territorial
waters round Cape Bon and south of Zembra
Island, thence to a position 030°, ten miles
from Cani Rocks.

Footnote -

* On D3 the Beaufighters sank an E-Boat and
damaged an $79, and on D4 they shot down two
JU.87s when covering the convoy

The disappointing imitial performance of the
Beaufighters from Malta was due to shortage of
equipment and to imexperience in co-operation with
the Royal Navy The Beaufighters rendered an
important contribution to the safety of the convoy
by operating over Sardima, where they destroyed
52 enemy twin-engined aircraft on the ground and
damaged a further 34 j
