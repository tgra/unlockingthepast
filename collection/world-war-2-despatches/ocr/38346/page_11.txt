SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 7 JULY, 1048

48. When EXETER was hit and started to
lose way ENCOUNTER and POPE drew

rapidly ahead, still engaging the enemy destroy-.

ers. They had ceased making smoke and when
Jast seen were a considerable distance ahead.
No report from the,Commanding Officer of
U.S.S. POPE is available, but in conversation
with him I understood that his ship was chased
by the enemy cruisers but drew away from them
taking advantage of rain squalls. He endeav-
ured to work round to the North and West
until repeatedly attacked by high level and
dive bombers, which latter eventually suc-
ceeded in putting the ship out of action, neces-
sitating her abandonment at about 1330.

49. Throughout this final action both
ENCOUNTER and POPE were well handled
and well fought. Their effective smoke laying
' was undoubtedly of great value.

50. Some 400 survivors of EXETER were
picked up after about one hour in the water
by two Japanese destroyers, which then left
the scene of the action on an Easterly course
The remaining survivors were indeed fontunate
to be picked up after about 24 hours in the
water by a Japanese destroyer working in com-
pany with a cruiser or cruisers, the majority
of survivors being subsequently transferred to
the Dutch hospital ship OP-TEN-NOORT, then
in Japanese hands. Three days later this ship
proceeded to Macassar where all prisoners on
board her were transferred on roth March to
the Dutch military barracks which had been
turned into a P.O.W. camp.

51. General Remarks.

(i) No signals were intercepted from
PERTH or HOUSTON to indicate the
presence of Japanese surface forces in the
vicinity of Sunda Strait, nor was any informa-
tion concerning enemy forces received after
sailing from Sourabaya p.m. 28th February.

(ii) As stated in para. 33 mo acknowledg-
ment was obtained of the enemy report made

- and repeated about 0800/1. The following
extract from a note written after release from
Japan by the’C.P.O. Telegraphist in charge
of EXETER’s W/T Department, may throw
some light on the difficulties of enemy report-
ing in this area at this time.

“Four messages were transmitted, afte:
being coded, by the P.O. Telegraphist ir
the Remote Control Office on the wave fre-
quency used by ship to shore, H.M.S.
ANKING and an Australian station (name
uncertain but may have been Port Moresby,
I cannot recall). No receipt was received
from the above station who was calling
H.M.S. ANKING, the W/T guardship at
Batavia, who had proceeded to sea thus
taking away the link with Batavia. Remote
‘Control Office reported ‘‘ No receipt ’’ so the
Jast two messages were also broadcast on the
Indian Ocean station wave on the ‘“‘I”
method wave frequency used by Colombo,
Bombay and Aden. We abandoned ship
immediately after their transmission but it
is almost certain that they | were received
by one of the three stations.”

52. Results of action.

(i) Destroyer mentioned in para. 34.—The
Gunnery Officer of U.S.S. POPE, which was
stationed on the starboard bow of EXETER,
informed me that on board POPE they felt
certain that this enemy destroyer was hit.
This was not seen in EXETER as the
destroyer was enveloped in smoke but POPE
was im a better position to see after the
enemy’s turn away under smoke.

(i) Destroyer mentioned in para. 42.—The
‘hit on this destroyer was made by EXETER’s
main armament, Her ultimate fate was not
seen because of smoke, but a Japanese
officer subsequently stated that this
destroyer’s stern was blown off killing 70 men.

(ini) Damage to enemy aircraft——From a
statement by a Japanese officer on hoard one
of the cruisers to which survivors were
initially transferred, EXETER’s A.A. :arma-
ment shot down one aircraft and damaged
another. The latter with tail damage was
shown to the Director Gunner of EXETER.
Tt is understood that both ENCOUNTER

and POPE claimed hits on the enemy
destroyers but no doubt these will be made in
their separate reports.
