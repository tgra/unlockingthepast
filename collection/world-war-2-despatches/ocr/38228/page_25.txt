SUPPLEMENT to tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1948

across the river was completely held up for
three hours by a 3-ton lorry which got off the
roadway. Movement did not therefore start
again till 06.30 hours.

At 08.30 hours, as the 7/10 Baluch was
marching through the railway cutting im-
mediately east of the bridge, the enemy put in
a heavy attack from the north-east of the
bridgehead. One and a half companies of the
3 Burma Rifles holding that sector were forced
back and the attack went through almost to the
end of the bridge itself. An Advance Dressing
Station north of the bridge was overcome, The

M.S., D.A.D.M.S. and all medical per-°*

sonnel were taken prisoner. Two companies of
the 4/12 F.F.R. at once counter attacked and
re-took the original position on the north and
north-east of the perimeter. The Battalion
was supported by the 7/10 Baluch. The
bridgehead was again lost and re-taken later.
D Company 2 DW.R. then on the west bank
was ordered across the River and took up a
position on the south-east of the bridgehead
perimeter. The ferries immediately above the
bridge were destroyed in view of the situation
and there was no communication with the re-
maining battalions or brigades which were
still a considerable distance on the far side of
the river. :

At about 14.00 hours the bridgehead was
shelled. About this time two platoons of 1/3
G.R. reached the bridgehead. It transpired
later that the 2/5 R.G.R. and 1/3 G.R. had
staged an attack on the enemy between them
and the bridgehead. These platoons, whilst
taking part in the attack, had lost direction in
the dense jungle. They were subsequently em-
ployed in the defence of the bridgehead. Dur-
ing the remainder of 22nd and during the night
heavy pressure continued on the bridgehead.
The original garrison had had considerable
casualties and 1/4 G.R. less one company were

- brought up to reinforce it. In spite of heavy
fire stragglers started to come in via the river
bank from the south—all telling the same story
of troops ambushed, cut up and scattered. It
seemed as if no unit of the Division remained
intact, and as the enemy pressure gradually in-
creased the Commander 48 Brigade after con-
sulting the Divisional Commander by telephone
and obtaining his consent, decided to blow the
bridge before daylight on the 23rd.

At 05.30 hours on the morning of the 23rd,
after very heavy fighting, the bridge was
blown.

The destruction of the bridge left the other
two Brigades and two battalions of 48 Bri-
gade on the far side of the River in a very pre-
carious position and it is necessary now to
return to the story of their action on 22nd.

At about 08.45 hours on 22nd heavy fire was
opened on 3/7 G.R., the leading battalion of
46 Brigade, an immediate counter attack
failed to dislodge the enemy and further attacks
developed on both flanks. 5/17 Dogras and
one company 2 D.W.R. endeavoured to deal
with these attacks but while doing so a further
attack was made on the rearguard—2 D.W.R.
Severe casualties were sustained on both sides.

ro. Bridgehead recaptured. About 10.00
hours Brigadier Ekin, Commander 46 Brigade,
organised a sweeping movement through the
jungle which enabled the troops on the road to
move forward and join 16 Brigade, three
miles further on, This Brigade was also by this

‘1691

time heavily attacked. This action continued till
dark on 22nd and the column under the
Brigadier 46 Brigade encountered about 20 00
hours a large enemy force moving up the rail-
way line on Mokpalin. By now the forces in-
volved were much split up and various
elements eventually made their way through the
jungle and crossed the river higher up. Mean-
while Brigadier Jones, 16 Indian Infantry
Brigade had been fighting hard and a number
of gallant counter attacks had been carned out
by battalions of that Brigade and the Gurkha
battalions of 48 Brigade which were cut off
from the bridge. By 09.00 hours on the morn-
ing of 23rd he had cleared the enemy from the
bridgehead and organised its defence with his
own Brigade, two battalions of 48 Brigade
and portions of all three battalions of 46 Bri-
gade. He also had the Divisional Artillery and
most of the M.T. with him. By this time, how-
ever, the bridge had been blown and there were
no boats.

Very determined attacks supported by
artillery and air bombing were still being made
by the enemy from ,the south and east and
there was no hope of organised withdrawal.
Brigadier Ekin now succeeded in joining 16
Indian Infantry Brigade and after discussion
it was decided that the only course possible was
to start withdrawal by every means possible
before disorganisation became complete.

Great credit is due to those officers and men
who held their positions to the last to cover the
withdrawal of the others and the evacuation, so
far as it was possible, of the wounded. Many
men swam the River, a most formidable under-
taking involving nearly an hour in the water.
A large number who attempted it were un-
fortunately drowned in the attempt. Others
crossed, under fire all the time, on improvised
tafts on which they carried such of the wounded
as they could collect. Others with the aid of
ropes collected in Mokpalin crossed the gap
between the remains of the bridge, also under
fire. A number of others who could not swim,
forced their way through the jungle and crossed’
some miles higher wp, where the River is
narrower, in boats or rafts. Quite a number
did not get back to our lines for many days, or
in afew cases weeks, afterwards.

It has only been possible to obtain the names
of a few of those who performed outstanding
acts of gallantry on this day. Many swam the
River again and again under fire bringing over
parties of wounded and the whole episode,
disastrous as it was, is a magnificent example
of heroism on the part of all ranks of the
forces engaged. The fact that a large propor-
tion of men eventually rejoined their units
shows that at no time was there any disposi-
tion to surrender to the enemy. Brigadier Ekin
swam the River about 15.00 hours and Brigadier
Jones about an hour later. Although many of
the troops were able to make good their escape’
few were able to bring back their arms and
practically all transport and equipment had to ,
be abandoned. Many of the transport mules
which had been turned loose swam the River
on their own and joined up with other units
which had mules.

102. Condition of Troops. From this date
onwards none of the Infantry Brigades concerned
could be regarded as more than remnants,
ready to defend themselves doggedly but other-
wise unfit for any of the normal operations of
