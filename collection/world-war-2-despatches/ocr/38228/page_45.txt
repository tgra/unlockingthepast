SUPPLEMENT to tus LONDON GAZETTE, 11 MARCH, 1048

LC.S., my Chief Civil Adviser. In the with-
drawal to India, the feeding arrangements for
the thousands of refugees who came out through
Kalewa and Tamu worked extremely well and
very few demands were made on the army for
rations. The refugees themselves were no
bother and the majority of them, more par-
ticularly the women, displayed a courage and
heroism under most trying conditions which
were worthy of the best traditions of India.

gt. Indigenous Units. I cannot close my
report without making some mention of the
behaviour of the indigenous units. Political
considerations arising out of the separation of
Burma from India brought about the enlist-
ment of Burmese into the Burma Army. Prior
to this, only Karens, Chins and Kachins had
been enlisted. That this former policy was right
was amply demonstrated by the fighting in
Burma. The Burmese proved thoroughly un-
reliable and deserted wholesale and thus they
began the disintegration which later affected all
indigenous units except the Signals. : As the
campaign progressed, the Karens and Kachins
also began to desert. This, I think, was largely
because they felt they were being cut off from
their families. This feeling affected the Karens
first since many had their homes in Lower
Burma. The Chins on the other hand, did not
desert to the same extent, which is almost cer-
tainly due to the fact that the final withdrawal
was through their country.

As a result of the distrust and suspicion
éngendered by desertions, often in the face of
the enemy, only two battalions of the Burma
Rifles remained in the Burma Division at the
end of the campaign. One of these was com-
posed of Chins and the other was wholly
Indian.

I must pay a tributé to the Burma Army
Signals which had a large proportion of Karens
and some Burmese personnel. This unit did
magnificent work and was completely reliable.

Part IX—Conc.ustons.

g2. It may be thought that after 3 years of
war it is a little late still to be learning lessons
from our enemies. The old proverb, however,
should be a safeguard against this feeling, and
after an unsuccessful campaign one must of
necessity examine the causes of failure.
_ I do not propose further to comment on the
events which led up to the loss of Rangoon since
it was already too late to save that city when I
arrived in Burma. I have stated earlier and
I wish to emphasise again that in the absence of
a road to India the loss of Rangoon virtually
decided the issue of the campaign. Thereafter
my task was to impose on the enemy the maxi-
mum delay possible with the means remaining
at my disposal.

93 Training and Equipment. From what 1
had learned of the nature of the fighting since
the beginning of the campaign and from my
personal experience of the operations in Burma,
I was impressed by the apparent ease with
which the Japanese were able to outflank our
forces by moving through thick jungle country,
whereas our troops were tied to the roads.

The reason for this was that the Japanese
were organised, equipped and trained for the
type of country over which they fought whereas
our troops were not. The Japanese also had
the help of local guides and the assistance of

171i

many friends amongst the local population. In
fact they had all the advantages which accrue
from having a plan and from preparations
made over a long period in time of peace.

The Imperial Forces were almost completely
mechanised down to unit transport which made
movement off the few roads almost impossible.

‘As the campaign progressed units supple-
mented their motor transport by the local pur-
chase and requisition of bullock carts. This
form of transport, however, is too slow and
cumbersome for tactical use in the jungle where
pack transport or porters are really required.

The technique of jungle fighting, as under-*
stood by the Japanese, was virtually non-
existent in my force. Success in this type of
fighting depends largely on the ability of parties
to find their way through the jungle and to keep
touch with one another. It demands a know-
ledge, of all types of signalling by visual and
by sound and also requires a high scale of low
powered wireless sets with infantry battalions.
It demands also training to eliminate the sense
of loneliness which so often saps the morale of
those who are not used to it.

Quite apart from jungle fighting, however, the
mfantry were not sufficiently well trained in
modern tactics which require above all else the
ability to manoeuvre in small parties under the
fire of their own weapons. Towards the end
of the campaign, however, some formations had
learned how to take the Japanese on at their
own game.

There had been no training with tanks prior
to the arrival of the 7 Armoured Brigade and it
was not unnatural therefore that the armoured
units did not receive the support from the in-
fantry which they needed. The infantry, on

- the other hand, came more and more to rely on

the tanks to get them out of a tight corner.

The country on the whole was unsuitable for
the employment of armoured fighting vehicles.
In the thick jungle country they were neces-
sarily confined tothe roads and tracks and
even in the open country of the dry zone the
small bunds surrounding paddy fields caused
the tanks to slow down in order to avoid break-
ing their suspension. Nevertheless, the tanks
did invaluable work and the reliability of the
American M3 or ‘‘ Honey’’ was quite
remarkable.

94. Power of the Offensive. It did not need
the Burma campaign to prove the power of
the offensive under modern conditions, more
particularly in its effect on the civil popula-
tion, Burma was singularly dependent on her
poor communications particularly railways and
IW.T. As has been explained at some length
these soon began to break down and I wish to
draw attention once again to the vulnerability
in this respect of eastern countries where the
ignorance and gullibility of the population
renders them even more susceptible to the lying
tongue of rumour than their western
brothers.

This campaign was fought by comparatively
small forces over a very large area and there-
fore militarily the offensive, coupled with air
superiority and the help of the local population,
enabled the Japanese to concentrate superior
forces at the decisive point, since the defence
had necessarily to be more dispersed.

The right method of defence was, I am con-
vinced; to hold defended localities well stocked
with reserves of supplies and ammunition
