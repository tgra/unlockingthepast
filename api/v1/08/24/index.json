The Light anti-aircraft defences continued to show improved results and, because many of the attacks were delivered against the outskirts of the London area, the heavy guns in the Thames Estuary were able to take part in the battle. This was the densest concentration of Heavy guns which the Germans had so far encountered and, though only a limited number of planes was destroyed, formations were consistently broken up before they reached their objectives.",

The attacks on Brest between 24th August and 6th September were shared by the United States Eighth and Ninth Air Forces and R.A.F. Bomber Command. More than 6,000 tons of bombs were dropped on the garrisons of this city. The attacks on Le Havre, Boulogne and Calais were R.A.F. Bomber Command operations, and provided excellent examples of reduction of a town by air bombing. This was especially so in the case of Le Havre. The Allied casualties in the against a strongly fortified garrison of 11,000 defenders totalled only 400. Between 1st and r2th September, 2,042 sorties were flown against Le Havre alone and 11,000 tons of bombs were dropped, 5,000 tons of this total being aimed in one massive daylight attack on an extremely small area.",
