SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 18 OCTOBER, 1948

20-m.m. that is normally associated with flak-
lighters. The flak-lighter had more armament
than this and may have been the one
bombarding Mulat the previous night.

38. Partisans on Ist reported four beached
vessels the following morning. L.R.D.G. on
Rivanj reported three. Royal Air Force recon-
naissance on the morning of the 13th, reported
three aground, two still burning. Also,
Partisans reported a northbound convoy going
through the Pasman Channel earlier on the
evening of the 1th.

Most of the enemy vessels were laden, at least
one with petrol, and one F-lighter with
ammunition.

A report just received indicates that there
was a southbound convoy that night going from
Trieste to Split and it was probable that this was
one of the convoys attacked.

Strategic or Tactical Conclusions.

39. This was the first really decisive victory
of D-boats* over the old enemy, F-lighters, and
was made possible due to low visibility, land
background, uncertainty of identification,
absurdly close ranges, excellent gunnery and
admirable coolness on the part of the three
following Commanding Officers. In fact
D-boats are not suited to a ‘‘ snap ’’ torpedo
attack and the fact that H.M.M.T.B.634 was

having to manoeuvre on inner engines made her

slower on the turn than usual. This kept the

three M.T.B.s well behind the Senior Officer.
As it turned out, no tactic could have been more
successful. H.M.M.G.B.662 drew all the
enemy’s fire and attention away from the body
of the unit, and the smoke from the guns drifted
across the line of sight of the enemy so that
they were able to get into within one hundred
yards without ever being fired on. The first
that the enemy knew of there being any ships
there other than H.M.M.G.B.662 was the full
broadsides of three ‘‘Ds’’ from under one
hundred yards away. This contributed
materially to the success of an action which in
its results surpasses anything this flotilla has yet
done, for the cost of very few casualties and
very slight damage.

There is little to say about the second and
third attacks, as intuition is incapable of
analysis.

40. I would not, on the strength of this
action, recommend that units of D-boats can
take on units of F-lighters, unless the action
can, as it were, be fought on a site of the
D-boats’ choosing. On this particular occasion
the enemy was firing at us with very much
heavier armament than we possess, and if the
visibility had been a hundred yards or so better
I cannot but feel that we would have lost at
least one boat. What is certain, though, is that
once the action is joined, and both sides are
firing, the enemy will be the first to become
erratic.
