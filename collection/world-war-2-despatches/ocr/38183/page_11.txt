SUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 22 JANUARY, 1948

A very successful exercise based on this second
one was held in Burma in July, 1941, and Hong
Kong carried out two or three on similar lines.
Defensive Prepatations.

48. The question of the best method of
defending the important sectors of the East
Coast of Malaya gave rise to much discussion.
‘One school of thought argued that, as there
were insufficient numbers to defend any great
length of beach, the enemy would be able to
dand outside the defended portion, thus out-
flanking the defendera and possibly cutting them
off. The best course..-“~ction was, therefore, to
fight on a prepared position in rear where the
road.leading into the interior could be defended,
This school also argued that attempts to hold
the beaches would result in a purely linear
defence with insufficient troops in hand for
counter-attack. ;

The view of General Headquarters, Far East,
was that it was essential to hold the beaches,
because it was during the period of landing
that the enemy would be most vulnerable, and
if the beaches were given up he would be fight-
ing on equality with us. Again, it was during
this process of landing that oursmost effective
co-operation between the Army and Air, and
possibly the Navy as well, could be effected.
Admittedly there was a danger of having a
purely linear defence, but this was primarily
a question of adjustment between the forces
retained in reserve and those detailed for hold-
ing the beaches themselves.

Another point was that of all-round defence.
It was difficult with the forces available to have
units in a group of perimeter’ posts and at the
same time to protect an adequate length. of
beach. Further, the defenders must be pre-
pared to hold on for a period to be reckoned
by weeks rather than by days, even if sur-
rounded by the enemy and out off. There was
but little object in this unless adequate reserves
were available in rear to attack the enemy and
restore the situation. The 2and Australian
Brigade at Mersing found a satisfactory solution
to the problem in that they had perimeter
defences for units,‘ mutually supporting each
other and primarily defending the beaches,
But in their case the 27th Australian Brigade
was available in Johore for counter-attack on
a large scale. The problem was more difficult
at Kuantan and Kota Bharu for the reasons
indicated above. (See para, 12.)

Although it was my policy to allow the
General Officers-in-Command as much freedom
as possible, I found it necessary in the case of
Malaya to issue orders that the first line of our
defence was to be the beaches. Previously, ex-
cept on Singapore Island and Penang, beaches
were going to be occupied only by watching
posts, and the first lines of defence were sited
inland. This change involved a considerable
amount of work and preparation of obstacles
and defence posts at Mersing, Kuantan and
Kota Bharu.

It was found at one period that the work of
preparing positions and putting up obstacles was
taking up so much time that the training of the
troops was being hampered and, in addition, the
wire generally required renewing after about six
months. Also, I

available hours was drawn up, allowing a pro-
portion for training. a proportion for renewals,
and the balance for‘new work. As far as prac-
ticable, troops consiructed the actual defences
in which they would ‘normally fight. New works
carried out included not only defensive prepara-
tions, but facilities for making counter-attacks,
e.g., preparation of hidden paths fit for Bren
ers.

Looking back in the light of what actually
happened, it is easy to point out that a lot of
the preparation was wasted, and that the energy
so taken up should have been expended else-
where; for instance, a great deal of time was
spent on the Mersing area, which was never
heavily attacked. Mersing, however, was a very
important place, and, had the Japanese estab-
lished themselves here instead of at Kota Bharu,
they would have been at once within a short dis-
tance of Singapore; and it is possible that, had
these defences been less strong, they might have
attacked the Mersing area at an early stage in
the operations. I feel, however, that steps
should have been taken before war broke out
to strengthen the defences on the Northern and
North-Western sides of Singapore Island.

49. We also had to be prepared for the possi-
bility of a break-through in the Mersing area,
which would have isolated Southern and
Northern Malaya from Singapore, and this con-
sideration affected the siting of depots for stores
and ammunition. Therefore, preparations were
made to enable a force to be supplied, if neces-
sary, by a line of communication running
through Kuala Lumpur to Penang, so that they
would be able to operate quite independently of
Singapore.

Another possibility that had to be considered
was that of a sudden descent without warning on
a part of Singapore Island with the object either
of destroying some important place, such as the
main wireless station, or of establishing a foot-
ing, awaiting subsequent reinforcements. This
possibility was met by having a portion of the
Singapore garrison ready to come into action
and move at very short notice.

Operation *‘Matador.”’

50. The importance of the Southern end of the
Kra Isthmus, especially the neighbourhood of
Singora, has already been referred to (see
paragraph 12 above). The possibility of an
advance into this Isthmus, in order to hold a
position North of Haad Yai Junction, was con-
sidered soon after the formation of General
Headquarters, Far East. Detailed plans for
carrying out this operation were prepared, and
the code word ‘ Matador ’’ was eveniually
given to it. It was from the start realised that
the essential feature of this operation was fore-
stalling the Japanese on a position near Sin-
gora; see, for instance my telegram to the
Chiefs of Staff through the War Office, in which
it is stated: ‘‘ The success of this plan would
depend on rapidity of execution in order to fore-
stall the Japanese on the Songhla line ’’; also
my telegram from which the following is an ex-
tract: ‘I wish to emphasise the fact that the
forestalling of the Japanese in Singora area is
essential to the success of ‘ Matador.’ “*

This necessitated at least twenty-four hours’
start before the Japanese landed, and rapid
movement of our force once the order was given.
It was realised all along that, if these conditions
could not be fulfilled, then the Matador opera-
tion would be impracticable. The psychological
