By the 13th January A.H.Q. became convinced of the possibilty of a landing in this vital area, and a general direction was therefore issued to all squadrons governing their action in such a contingency. A daily reconnaissance by 6 Hudsons was instituted to detect the approach of any convoy from Indo-China; reconnaissance northwardse up the east coast, although restricted, was still maintained."

            "description": "115. The attack on Mandalay Hill was Jaunched by 98 Brigade early on the 9th March, and the hill was captured after 24 hours of the most bitter hand-to-hand fighting. The enemy fought to the end, the last defenders being killed by means of petrol drums, set on fire, which were rolled down into the tunnel they were holding. There followed three days of street fighting. By the 14th the city had been cleared and Fort Dufferin invested. A gallant attempt by 98 Brigade to storm the fort failed, the attackers being held up by the thick weed in the moat. Old fashioned siege warfare methods were then adopted, in order to avoid the casualties which a direct assault would have entailed : but even medium artillery, firing from 500 yards, and aerial rocket projectiles failed to break the massive walls, with their earth embankment. By the 19th March, however, the Japanese had had enough, and that night the remnants of the garrison attempted to escape through the ruins. The majority were intercepted and only a few got away. An immense quantity of equipment, chiefly ordnance stores, fell into our hands and 160 civilian internees were rescued. The capture of Mandalay was a fitting climax to a great advance. (Between the date it crossed the Irrawaddy on the 9th January and the fall of Mandalay, 19 Indian Division had accounted for 6,000 Japanese killed, actually counted on the ground."

While 64 Brigade of 19 Indian Division was engaged at Shwebo, the other two brigades were switched eastwards, via Myemun and Kinu, to the Irrawaddy. Destroying all tesistance in their path and relying on speed to achieve surprise, they rushed the river and effected two crossings. 98 Brigade established a bridgehead at Thabeikkyin, 28 miles northeast of Shwebo, on the 9th January, after overcoming enemy defence in the village; 62 Brigade followed suit at Kyaukmyaung, due east of Shwebo, on the 16th. The river at Thabeikkyin runs between steep rock banks, jungle-covered almost to the water's edge. It is only about 500 yards wide, but is swift and deep. Concentrated i harassing fire rendered raft assembly difficult by night and impossible by day, but our crossing at this point"
