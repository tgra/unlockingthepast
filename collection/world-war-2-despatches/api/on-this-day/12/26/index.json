The 22nd Armoured Brigade, for which it at last became possible to provide fuel, was ordered to work round to the south towards Chor es Sufan, while the Guards Brigade made its way through the sand dunes to attack Agedabia from the west. The Guards Brigade's attack, made on the 26th December, failed owing to misdirection, and the following day"

            "description": "The 13th Corps set out to follow and cut off the defeated enemy. The 4th Indian Division advanced through the Gebel Akhdar and proceeded at a great pace, occupying Derna on tgth December and Barce four days later. The bulk of the German forces, including forty to fifty tanks, withdrew south-westwards across the desert and guarded the coastal road leading south from Bengasi. The 7th Armoured Division followed as fast as it could; but, as the armoured brigade was held up for lack of petrol, General Gott sent mobile columns ahead with orders to make straight for Bengasi. These columns found the going difficult on the southern slopes of the Gebel which were particularly rough and waterlogged; but as they approached, the enemy forces, holding the defiles through the escarpment to cover Bengasi, retired. Our armoured-cars entered Bengasi on Christmas Eve and found the town evacuated. By the 26th December all the hill country up to and including Bengasi, with much booty, but unfortunately few prisoners, was in our hands."

Columns from the Guards Brigade made several attempts to dislodge them, but the enemy was strong in artillery and the brigade could make little headway. Meanwhile the Support Group finished clearing the coastal area further north. On the 26th December the dast of the enemy, harassed as they went by columns from the Guards Brigade, retired to Agedabia."

On the 27th and 28th, a large party of the garrison came over to them, and at 1000 hours on the 28th, the Acting Governor sent a message asking for an interview with General Fowkes, The interview was held that night at Chebele in a railway coach, Monsieur Chancel, Free French Delegate in East Africa, being present. General Dupont signed an agreement whereby French Somaliland took her place as part of the Fighting French on the side of the  Allied Nations. The anxieties of the last few days were terminated without bloodshed. Credit for this is due to Major-General Fowkes, Mr. Hopkinson and Monsieur Chancel. The tesolution, patience and co-operation of Monsieur Chancel were remarkable and made a great contribution to our common cause."
