            "description": "5. It was, as it turned out, fortunate that such defence as was ,available was mainly in Ceylon, since a Japanese naval raid into Indian waters took place in the early days of April, in the course of which Colombo was attacked by carrier-borne aircraft on the 5th April and Trincomalee on the oth April. Our defending fighters inflicted considerable losses on the enemy aircraft, which did little damage on land; \u2018but they suffered some losses themselves; and the Blenheim squadron, which was sent to attack the Japanese aircraft-carriers, was practically destroyed without accomplishing anything. Had the attack been renewed it would have \u2018been difficult to meet. Though little damage had been caused on land, two 8-inch cruisers, Dorsetshire and Cornwall, and aircraft-carrier (Hermes) and some smaller naval vessels had been sunk by Japanese air- craft in the waters around Ceylon."

            "description": "On 5th April 4 Infantry Division assumed command in the sector north-east of B\u00e9ja and on 7th April 78 Division attacked north of Oued Zarga to carry out the second part of the Army task. It met opposition from the German 334 Division but continued to press forward on a front of about ten miles to a depth, eventually, of ten miles. This is a most desolate and barren area of mountains, with few and scat- tered villages. The most important success was the capture on rqth April of Gebel el Ang and, Gebel Tanngouche, two ridges over three thou- sand feet high eight miles north of Medjez, the enemy recaptured both next day but in a fur- ther attack we recovered Gebel el Ang and part of Tanngouche The mountain village of Heidous, which the enemy had converted into a strongpoint, remained in his hands but was now threatened from both north and south The object of our operations hadi \u2018been achieved. Medjez had been freed from enemy threat and we were able to build up there, in security, the stores required for our final offensive."

This wide turning movement loosened the enemy on the left, and while Bremen was masked from the South by 30 Corps, a hook further up river came in on the city from the East. Bremen fell at the end of the month."

Germany declared war on Greece and Yugo-Slavia on the 5th April, r9q4r, and launched her attack at dawn the following day, crossing the Greek frontier into Macedonia by four routes, with the main thrust along the Struma Valley. Simultaneously they advanced Westwards into Yugo-Slavia along the Strumica Valley in the South, from Dragoman to Nis in the North, and by other intermediate routes. The Greeks resisted strongly at Rupel, tem- porarily checking the German advance through the Struma Valley, but despite this opposition . the Germans succeeded in penetrating Thrace and Macedonia and occupied Salonika on the 8th April."

Nevertheless I told him that no form of direct military aid was to be given, his troops were not to get involved in armed clashes but Free French elements from French Somaliland could be allowed to rally on British soil."

The booty taken included a useful haul of 1,500 gallons of petrol and 3,500 gallons of oil. \"Surprise was complete ; for some days afterwards, enemy convoys, routed via Taungdwingyi, continued to be welcomed by 20 Indian Division, 32 Brigade was followed by 80 Brigade, which entered Natmauk, 28 miles north-north-west of Taungdwingyi, on the 15th April. Both Brigades then continued their rapid advance westwards to the Irrawaddy. 32 Brigade reached the river at Myingun, nine miles south- east of Magwe, on the 19th without opposition. On the same day, 80 Brigade occupied Magwe after slight opposition from astonished Japanese administrative units. \u2018We thus controlled the Irrawaddy at two points 22 and 33 miles south of Yenangyaung respectively. Considerable equipment was captured in Magwe and, once more, unsuspecting convoys entering the town were captured."

The Japanese were not slow to take advantage of this opportunity and, on the 5th April, began to develop pressure in this direction. At first the movement was compara- tively slow but later, when enemy reinforce- ments arrived, the momentum rapidly increased especially as there was a failure on the part of the Chinese to carry out the-demolitions which had been prepared. Unfortunately the two imporiant bridges at Toungoo and Bawlake were not blown but the demolitions on the Toungoo-Mawchi road were gallantly blown by the Karen Levies after the Chinese had re- treated. In these operations the Levies suffered considerable casualties. Karenni and the Shan States were held by the Chinese Sixth Army consisting of 55, 49 and the 93 Divisions. Owing to the great length of the front, the Sixth Army was much strung out and had only a small reserve in the Loilem area."

On the 30th March the Commander-in-Chief in India arrived by air in Burma and on the ast April I accompanied him by air from Mandalay to Magwe, proceeding by road to Corps Headquarters at Allanmyo. At a con- ference which took place here on the afternoon of the rst April the Commander-in-Chief agreed that, in view of the difficulties of the country and the fatigue of the troops in 17 Division, a withdrawal from Prome to the Allanmyo area should commence forthwith, and that this with- drawal might have to be continued even further north into the dry zone south of Taungdwingyi, where the country was more open and more suitable for the employment of tanks. On the evening of the 1st April the enemy attacked Prome and penetrated the defences held by the 63 Infantry Brigade securing the high ground south of the town, The 17 Division was forced to withdraw on the and Apml north and north- east of Prome. On the 3rd April the 17 Division moved back through 1 Burma Division, in position in the area Dayindabo- Pyalo, to the area Ywataung-Kyaukpadaung- Bwetkyichaung, the 48 Infantry Brigade and the 7 Armoured Brigade, less one regiment, moving during the night of the 3rd to 4th \u2018April to Satthwa. On the 3rd April xr Burcorps issued an Operation Instruction covering the possibility of a withdrawal to the line Minhla- Taungdwingyi and the withdrawal from Prome, which was originally intended to stop at Allan- myo, was, in view of the tired state of the troops, continued to this line, which was reached by the night of the 4th-5th April ex- cept by the 2 Burma Brigade, moving up the west bank, which did not reach Minhla till the night of the 8th-gth April."
