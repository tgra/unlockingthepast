It was found necessary to  start at Ahmednagar a new special Officer Cadre Training Unit (O.C.T.U) for the Indian Armoured Corps. :

A further officer cadet training unit was also started at Dagshai for the training of cadet officers for the Women's Auxiliary Corps (India). :

An effort was made to improve the training in University Officers Training Corps (U.O.T.C.) and thereby attract more candidates through that channel for commissions in the army. Cadets of U.O.T.Cs. can now obtain Certificates  A  and  B  for which syllabi have been laid down by General Headquarters. Those who qualified for these certificates gained certain advantages, if and when they were selected, and went to Officers Training Schools.  

In order to give as many officers as possible practical experience in the more modern methods of fighting the Japanese in jungle country, fifty officers from the India Command were sent to Australia and New Guinea, where they Were to be attached to fighting units of the Australian Army for about three months.

In order to train and bring up to date senior officers of the Army and the Royal Air Force in problems of air support in eastern theatres, two courses were held in Simla in July which the majority of Brigadiers General Staff and General Staff Officers rst Grade of divisions and a large number of Group Captains and Wing Commanders R.A.F. attended. Considerable value was gained from these inter-service discussions.

13. Initial training of the soldier.

It was apparent that the basic training period for infantry recruits was too short and it was decided to increase the total period of training to eleven months, nine of which to be spent in basic training at regimental centres, and two in special jungle training divisions.

Similarly it became necessary to increase the period of mechanical transport training for recruits from fourteen to twenty weeks. This

again was likely to be increased to twenty-four -

weeks, and would ensure that the recruits obtained at least 120 hours  driving trainiag before being posted to an active unit.

The training carried out in reinforcement camps on the lines of communication was also much improved with the help of the active divisions which depended on these camps for reinforcements. These divisions have been able to provide instructors, and a considerable increase in equipment has also been made available.

.14. Training in Jungle fighting.

A second jungle warfare school was opened at Shimoga in Mysore State, to train instructors both British and Indian in the technique of living and fighting in the jungle.

The Jungle Warfare Training Centre at Raiwala, which was originally designed to give recruits training in jungle fighting, was not now needed for this purpose, since the jungle training divisions had come into being. It was used, therefore, for training complete units, and all three battalions of the 50th Indian Parachute Brigade were trained at this centre. -

In order to inculcate the higher- degree of accuracy and better ammunition contro] that has been found necessary in jungle fighting, greater stress was laid on quick and accurate snap shooting and less on rapid fire. Psychologically this was having encouraging results.

15. Collective Trammg. .

In order to carry training for fighting in the jungle a step further, the 14th Indian Division at Chhindwara and the 39th Indian Division at Saharanpur were converted into jungle training divisions.

Each Indian infantry regiment had its training battalion in one or other of these divisions, Similarly in the case of British reinforcements, it was necessary not only to give basic training to many of the infantry reimforcements who lacked it on arrival from the United Kingdom, but also to give them training in jungle fighting methods. For the first task the 13th Bn. The Sherwood Foresters was temporarily converted into a basic training umit and stationed at Jubbulpore. : .

For jungle training*of British Troops the 52nd Infantry Brigade was foymed at Budni in Bhopal State. It consisted of the 2oth Bn. The Royal Fusiliers, 7th Bn. The South Lancashire Regt. and 12th Bn. The Sherwood Foresters. Here British infantry reinforcements did two months  training in the forest before going to active battalions. .

Collective training m jungle fighting was also necessary for those formations being trained for combined operations.* In order to meet this need, both for those units already under training in India in an amphibious r le, and for others that would arrive in India in the future, a training headquarters was created. Each of the two wings of this headquarters was designed to orgamse the collective training of one division at a time in combined operation and jungle warfare,

16. Engineer Training.

The need in this Command for a school of military engineering had been felt for some time, to relieve existing engineer training centres of special training commitments for which they were not designed. A school was accordingly planned during the period, which when in being, would give technica] post-graduate, training to selected young officers, deal with the training of M.E.S. personnel, and generally standardise engineer instruction to a greater degree than hitherto,  

Additionally the school of military engineering would centralise all engineer officer cadet training in India.

Another engineering training establishment started was the Obstacle Assault Centre. This contained both engineer and armoured corps lements, and dealt with problems of the assault against Japanese defences and other obstacles.

17. Combined Operations Organisation and Training.

On the 2oth June, 10943, the Combined Operations Directorate at G.H.Q. consisted of a Group Captain R.A.F. (Director)) a Military Member (Lt.-Col.), and a Naval Member (Lt.-Commander). These were assisted by a

+ small inter-service staff. . * * See also paragraphs 18 and 19 below under  Combined Operations, India.  . B
