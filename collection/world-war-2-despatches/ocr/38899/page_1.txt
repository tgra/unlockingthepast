OPERATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE LANDINGS IN THE
GULF OF SALERNO ON 91TH SEPTEMBER, 1943.

Admiralty foreword :—

The Naval forces taking part in Operation
“ Avalanche ” were under the general control
of the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean.

The Naval Task Force for the operation was
under the immediate command of Vice-
Admiral H. K. Hewitt, U.S.N., who was known
as the Commander Western Naval Task Force.
This Force was charged with the escort to and
the landing of the Fifth Army at Salerno and
with the subsequent support of this Army until
it was firmly established on shore.

The Western Naval Task Force included the
+ Northern Attack Force (Force “ N ”) composed
of British and American Ships and Craft and
under the command of Commodore G. N.
Oliver, R.N., and the Southern Attack Force
(Force “ S$”) composed of U.S. Ships and Craft
and under the command of Rear-Admiral John
L. Hall, Jr., U.S.N.

The Naval Covering Force (Force “ H ”) was
under the command of Vice-Admiral Sir
Algernon Willis, while the Naval Air Support
Force (Force “ V ”) was under the command of
Reéar-Admiral Sir Philip Vian.

The report of the Commander Western
Naval Task Force on this operation will be
published by the U.S. Navy Department in
due course.

The following Despatch was submitted to the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on
the 8th March, 1945, by Admiral of the Fleet
Sir ANDREW B. CUNNINGHAM, K.T.,

8th March, 1945.

I have the honour to forward the report of
the Naval Commander Western Task Force

Salerno.

on the Operations in connection with the land-

1943*,

2. Owing to the unavoidable delay in for-
warding the report of the Naval Commander.
Western Task Force due to more urgent de-
mands on the time and facilities of his staff,
it is not my intention to do more than com-
ment on the salient features of this operation,
the more so since many of the lessons learnt
have been incorporated in other operations
which have been carried out subsequently in
this and other theatres. Except insofar as is
stated in the succeeding paragraphs, I fully
concur with the suggestions and recommenda-
tions of the Force Commander, whose report
is very full and covers every aspect of the
operation.

Planning.

3. My detailed remarks on the planning of
Operation “Avalanche” are contained in
Appendix I.

4. Having decided that the mainland of Italy
was to be invaded on the West coast, it was
clear that the seizure and development of the
port of Naples was of paramount importance,
since no other port in Western Italy could

5. The choice for the actual point of attack
lay between the Gulf of Gaeta and the Gulf of
The former had the advantage of
having an open plain as its immediate hinter-
Jand and it was clear that a successful landing
in this area might lead to the early capture
of Naples. On the other hand, its beaches
