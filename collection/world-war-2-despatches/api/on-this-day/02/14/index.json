            "date": "14th February",
            "description": "On the morning of 14th February a strong German force, estimated to contain about a hundred tanks, emerged from the Faid pass and attacked the positions held by x United States Armoured Division at Sidi Bou Zid. The American division was rather dispersed at the time the attack was made, with detachments at Sidi Bou Zid, on the Gebel Lessouda, an isolated mountain north of the village, at Sbeitla and south of Hadjeb el Aioun on the Sbeitla-Pichon road. The German armour was. handled with great dash and supported by a strong force of dive-bombers. Our forward battery positions were overrun and while a tank battle raged in front of Sidi Bou Zid another enemy force had by 1130 hours cut off the infantry holding positions on the Gebel Lessouda. Our tank losses were heavy and the battle became fluid and difficult to control. By evening 1 Armoured Division had concentrated between Sidi Bou Zid and Sbeitla, and next day, the 15th, attempted a counter-attack. This was unsuccessful and the armour drew off towards Sbeitla, leaving the infantry on Gebe] Lessouda still isolated; some were able to withdraw but many were taken prisoner. It was now clear that our armour had been too depleted to hold the plain and a withdrawal was ordered back to the Western Dorsale. To conform, the Ranger battalion and the Derbyshize Yeomanry detachment had been already withdrawn from Gafsa which was entered by the enemy on the afternoon of the 15th and the French withdrew in their sector-from the Eastern to the Western Dorsale. This movement was carried out in good order and the enemy followed up only slowly. | General Anderson"

I was therefore flung straight into a position where I had to give my main attention to the needs of the tactical situation, but I had already given much thought to the strategy which it would be necessary to pursue and was confident that, when the immediate dangers had been averted, and after a necessary period of complete reorganization, I should be able to work out the strategic answer to the problem of Tunisia on the hnes made necessary by the nature of the country and the strength and dispositions of the opposing forces."

All the white population had been evacuated and considerable demolition done. That the evacuation was hurried, however, was proved by the fact that we were able eventually to put into commission three of the eight 4.9 C.D. guns, and ten of the sixteen 77 mm, A.A. guns. Quantities of stores and ammunition were abandoned by the enemy."
