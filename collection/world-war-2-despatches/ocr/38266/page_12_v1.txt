APPENDIX   B.  G.H.Q. Operation Instruction No. 19.

To

G.O.C.-in-C., Eastern Army.

1. Since there is now no possibility of capturing Akyab before the monsoon, His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief directs that the object of operations before the rains in that area will be to regain the initiative and inflict a severe defeat on the enemy. To this end offensive operations will be initiated on both sides of the Mayu River.

2. At the same time you should consider, and prepare so far as this can be done without weakening your offensive action positions to be held during the monsoon period.

3. Your positions must cover the Maungdaw  Buthidaung road, Maungdaw airfield and the mouth of the Naf River, with as much depth as possible in front of them. If possible, the Indin landing strip and the Yezogyaung  Apaukwa track should be covered. The latter offers the shortest route to the Kaladan Valley, which may be of considerable importance in operations after the monsoon.

4. The forces under your command in the Mayu area have advantages over the enemy of numerical preponderance, better equipment and the support of superior air forces. If these advantages are skilfully used, it should be possible to take successful offensive action and achieve your object. The enemy's over-confidence engendered by recent successes may lead him to expose himself to an effective counter-stroke; particularly East of the River Mayu.

5. You will, in conjunction with A-O.C., Bengal, draw up joint plans to implement the above policy. An appreciation and copies of Directives issued to the Naval and Air Force Commanders are attached.
