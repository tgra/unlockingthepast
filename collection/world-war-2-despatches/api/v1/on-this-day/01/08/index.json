The bad weather prevailing at the time of the Greeks  capture of Kelcyre on the 8th January prevented our aircraft from operating in close support of their troops during their advance; in fact, until the middle of February operations were of necessity of a sporadic nature, the weather and state of aerodromes on occasions preventing our aircraft from operating for several days at a time. Subsequently, on the xoth January, as the Greeks continued to make slow progress towards Tepelene, Blenheims attacked enemy troops retiring from Kelcyre towards  Berat. Otherwise: support to the Greek forces at this time was confined to Blenheim attacks on the bases at Berat, West of the Central Sector and Elbasan, beyond the Northern Sector."

The Greek advance had  st its impetus by the beginning of the year as the result of increased enemy resistance, lengthened lines of communication and severe winter conditions. The Greeks still retained the initiative, however, and after operations had apparently become static, they made a further advance, capturing Kelcyre on the 8th January, 1941, and thereafter making slow progress along the Northern side of the Kelcyre-Tepelene gorge. There was little activity in other sectors."

Many of the latter were of a very poor quality and it had become apparent that the only satisfactory solution was to recruit as many labourers as possible into the labour companies; also that it was essential that they should be handled by officers and N.C.Os. who understood them and that accommodation should be provided as near as possible to their work. By arrangement the Governor cabled to the Colonial Office requesting that the Services should be given authority to accept decisions by the D.G.C.D. as regards conditions of service reached after consultation with interested departments. No authority was received, but the War Office was informed that in view of the urgency the labour scheme agreed upon locally was accepted."

General Montgomery was succeeded, on rst January, 1944, by General Leese,t who had commanded 30 Corps in the desert and in Sicily, In the new organisation in the Mediterranean, Allied Force Headquarters now had a wider authority, including those areas which had previously come under General Headquarters Middle East. To a large extent, therefore, its preoccupations were political and logistical; I was accordingly instructed that for the conduct of the campaign in Italy I was given a free hand. For this Teason the title of my headquarters was changed from Fifteenth Army Group to Headquarters Allied. Armies in Italy} and my administrative staff was reorganised and put on a proper level with the operations staff. At the same time I was relieved of the duties of Deputy Allied Commander-in-Chief, being succeeded in the appointment by Lieutenant-General J. L. : Devers of the United States Army."

I managed eventually a slight readjustment of the progtamme, as a result of a conference on 8th January, which gave us a reasonable guarantee that we should be able to supply the force landed. I also planned to land in the first follow-up convoy a mobile, hard-hitting force from 1 United States Armoured Division and 45 Infantry Division. Later the remainder of these divisions was to follow. This meant that in two months SHINGLE had grown from a first tentative figure of twenty-three thousand men to an expected eventual strength of one hundred and ten thousand. It was hoped that the Germans would not be able, with the resources available to them in Italy, both to block off this force and to hold the   Gustav"

Nicholson) remained concentrated in the Yazagyo area until the 12th December, when it began its forward move to the Kalewa bridgehead. The leading Brigade. the 6th, passed through 11 (East African) Division on the 21st and advanced rapidly along the road from Kalewa towards Pyingaing. West of Pyingaing the advance was checked by a strong rearguard position. With the assistance of 32 Brigade of 20 Indian Division as stated above, the enemy was cleared, and Pyingaing was captured on the 24th. Determined resistance was again encountered in the Wainggyo Gorge, nine miles south-west of Pyingaing, but was overcome with tank support. The advance of 2 British Division continued with great speed. Dominating features astride the road 12 miles east of Pyingaing were cleared, and a large enemy detachment was successfully ambushed on the 28th December. On the 31st, the Kabo Weir, 11 miles north of Ye-U was captured intact. This was an important economic gain, since the Kabo Weir controls the irrigation of an extensive area of rice-growing country. It was a propitious entry into the Shwebo plain  the enemy's demolition party, sent to blow up the weir, arrived to find us in occupation. On the 2nd January, 5 Brigade had established itself at Ye-U and the Division was driving the enemy back on to Shwebo, the northern outskirts of which were reached by the 8th January. 64 Brigade of 19 indian Division had already reached the eastern outskirts on the 7th, having come via Kanbalu. Shwebo town was finally occupied on the 10th January, after the Japanese rearguard had fought to the last. man. 6 Brigade of 2 British Division was then concentrated at Shwebo after relief by 268 Indian Brigade in the Kabo Weir area. This advance of 150 miles in 20 days was a fine performance by an all-British Division."
