SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 9 JANUARY, 1947

watercourses and the surrounding mountainous
country. The escort of Hurricanes destroyed
a Dornier. A large proportion of the German
forces moving west against the Yugo-Slav
armies had to pass through Strumitsa, as weil
as all the forces advancing on Salonika and
those about to deploy themselves before our
positions on the Mt. Olympus region. Conse-
quently, as many heavy attacks as possible
were made against targets in this area.

On the following day, the bad weather con-
tinued but in spite of it, we were able to get
some of our reconnaissance machines through,
and again in the evening we bombed enemy
M.T. in considerable concentration near
Strumiisa.

Since the army co-operation squadron was
short of aircraft, and since it was considered
expedient to avoid sending unescorted Blen-
heims on jong reconnaissances, the fighter
squadron was asked to help out with recon-
naissance. This squadron was thereafter fre-
quently asked to provide recce aircraft, and
although the pilots had had no reconnaissance
training, they carried out the most valuable
work throughout this period of great stress.

The wing commander had received an appeal
to give bombing support to the Greeks who were
cut off in the Salonika area. On consulting
the force commander as to the relative danger
to the army of the various points which the
German advance was. threatening, the wing
commander decided, in view of the limited
opportunities for air operations offered by the
weather, and in view of his limited air re-
sources, not to dissipate any effort on a front
which was already lost in spite of the gallant
action still being fought in the Rupel area
by the Greeks} Nevertheless, the powerful
bombing attacks against Strumitsa were bound
to have a direct effect upon the situation in
the area of Kilkis and Salonika, since German
columns passing through Strumitsa and south
to Lake Doiran were attempting to encircle the
Mt. Beles position. \

On the following day, the weather was again
very bad. From the information available,
however, it was now clear that very consider-
able German forces were passing through
Strumitsa, some advancing south by Lake
Doiran were already in or around Salonika,
whilst the greater part continued west and north
west and were threatening the Monastir Gap.

The situation was beginning to unfold, con-
tact was expected shortly on the Olympus line
but anxiety was felt on account of the ineffec-
tiveness of the Yugo-Slav resistance and the
lack of information as to the situation in the
north. Every effort was made by our air force
to alleviate the pressure on the Yugo-Slav army
in order to give them time to withdraw in front
of the highly mobile German forces, and to
take up strong positions in the mountains and
gorges.
gth-15th April—ist Withdrawal.

40. Communications between Force H.Q.
and Wing H.Q. to Athens were now becoming
extremely poor, and I was virtually out of
touch not only with the wing commander but
with the G.O.C., with whom it was essential
for me to be in constant communication.
Accordingly, I sent an officer of air rank to take
over operations in the forward area. The air
officer took over at a time when, in view of the
intention of the army to withdraw to the

B

Olympus line, plans were being drawn up to
withdraw the ground party of the squadron of
Blenheims at Niamata and to use it only as an
advanced landing ground.

During the next few days, until the complete
evacuation of the Larissa plain on the 15th,
enemy M.T. columns and concentrations on the
roads between Prilep and Bitolj and in the
Amyntaion Area were bombed successfully by
our aircraft. Our army had had litile time to
prepare strong positions in this area, which they
had hoped would be protected for some time
by the resistance of the Yugo-Slavs. A heavy
burden was therefore thrown upon our air forces
which now virtually had to make up for the
time lost by the caving-in of the Yugo-Slav
forces. No stone was left unturned to delay the
enemy and to shield our ground forces. Mean-
while, our army was engaged in fighting a rear-
guard action in the areas around Amyntaion
and Kleisoura.

No sooner was the withdrawal to the Aliakmon
line complete when, on account of the threat
to its left flank, it became nec for the army
to make a further withdrawal to the Thermo-
pylae line. Consequently, all R.A.F. units
on the Larissa plain had to be withdrawn at
once with the utmost speed along roads which
were already congested. At the same time, the
R.A.F. continued to throw all its power into
delaying tactics.

On x4qth April, the weather improved and
German air activity intensified. The Germans
had brought their fighters forward to the Prilep
and Monastir areas, where their engineers had
prepared the necessary landing strips. The Ger-
man air force was mainly directed in close sup-
port of their army, and heavy dive bombing
attacks were made against our troops. Our
Hurricanes, escorting our ‘bombers in attacking
enemy M.T. on the roads near Ptolemais and

‘ disorganising his lines of communication, shot

down many enemy aircraft.

41. On 15th April, the main effort of the
German Air Force was directed against our air
force, which had been delaying their military
operations and had taken toll of their aircraft.
Large numbers of short range fighters made their
appearance over the Larissa plain and ground
straffed Niamata. In spite of A.A., every air-
craft of the Blenheim squadron located there
was destroyed. Owing to the breakdown of the
Greek observer system, our fighters were at a
hopeless disadvantage. When, on one
occasion, Me. rogs appeared over their aero-
drome at Larissa without any warning, three
Hurricanes were attacked whilst taking off and
two were shot down. The third shot down one
Me. r09. Although, when our fighters were
able to get off, they played havoc with the
enemy, the situation was obviously untenable.
I was present on the Larissa aerodrome whilst
this attack was in progress and I ordered the
Squntions to withdraw to the Athens area forth-
with. .

The Albanian Front.

42. Meanwhile, the wide manoeuvre of the
German forces advancing swiftly through the
mountain passes north west and west of Skoplje
was developing. Their intention was to force
contact with the helpless Italian forces near
Kukes in northern Albania and to threaten the
tight flank of the Greek armies in Albania from
the Lake Ochrida area. The Greeks, who had
