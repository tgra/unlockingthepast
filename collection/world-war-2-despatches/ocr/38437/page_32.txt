234. In this battle the part played by
gunners and fighters was so conspicuous and
important that it tends to monopolize atten-
tion, perhaps unduly. I am conscious that in
writing the foregoing account of the flying bomb
campaign I have not resisted the natural ten-
dency to bring out those features which make
for easy narrative and positive statement. I
wish, therefore, in this summing up, to empha-
size that victory over the flying bomb was
gained by the joint efforts of thousands of men
and women of the different Services, working
in every variety of unit and at all levels of
responsibility. As an example of this co-
operation I may cite the mutual trust and unity
of purpose that always existed between General
Pile’s staff and mine. So far as the work of
the gunners and fighter crews is concerned,
the bare chronicle of their achievements re-
quires no embellishment. Nothing need be
added, therefore, except perhaps a word of
tribute to those whose work was done outside
the limelight. The contribution of Balloon
Command, too, speaks for itself, although per-
haps in too modest a tone for its true value
to be apparent. Every one of the 232 bombs
brought down by the balloons was one which
had eluded the other defences and would almost
inevitably have hit the target if it had been
allowed to continue on its way. To the
administrative skill and practical efficiency
which enabled the deployment of the initial
barrage to be completed in less than a third of
ithe time originally forecast, I dan give no
higher praise than by comparing this feat with
those performed by Anti-Aircraft Command at
the same time and in July. The part played
by the Royal Observer Corps—the Silent Ser-
vice of the air defences—was an epic in itself.
Together Anti-Aircraft Command, Fighter
Command, Balloon Command and the Royal
Observer Corps made up a team in whose play
I am proud to have had a share. .

235. Of the helping hand extended by many
who were not members of the team, limitations
of space forbid that I should say much. A hint
has already been given of the technical advice
and assistance rendered by distinguished men
of science. Acknowledgement must also be
made of the important part played by the Royal
Navy and the Admiralty, especially in con-
nection with the problems of obtaining and
utilising early warning of the approach of fly-
ing bombs over the sea, and also that of help-
ing pilots to “ pinpoint ’’ their position off the
coast. In particular, the heroism of those who
sailed in the small craft which operated off the
French coast, under the noses of the Germans
and exposed to attack by land, sea, and air,
deserves to be remembered.

236. Teamwork, aided by such help as this,
won the “ battle of the bomb’’. Indeed, it
is not too much to claim that the flying bomb
was prevented from achieving even a second-
ary purpose; for although we suffered casualties
and damage, the flow of supplies to the Allied
Armies across the Channel went on unim-
peded by the worst the flying bomb could do.

237. Such, then is the answer to our ques-
tion, so far as it concerns the flying bomb.

238. I turn now to the A-4 rocket. This
was in some ways a more disturbing menace
than the flying bomb. Not that it was more
destructive; but it was difficult to counter, and

fore-shadowed further develooments which still
loom ahead of us. Albert Speer, one of the:
ablest and most far-seeing of our enemies,
remarked soon after the German surrender
that, whereas the flying bomb had had its day,
the rocket must be considered the long-range
weapon of the future. On the other side of
the scale must be set the complication and.
high cost of such missiles. Delivering approxi-
mately the same explosive charge as a flying
bomb, the A-4 rocket required twenty times.
the productive effort, or as much as six or
seven fighters.

239. That the German rocket attacks of 1944
and 1945 were conceived with a well-defined
military object in view is open to doubt. I
fancy that if the situation had been less des-
perate the Germans might have postponed ac-
tive operations until further trials enabled them
to attain a higher standard of accuracy. Their
plight was such, however, that in September,
1944, they found themselves constrained to im-
provise a rocket offensive from Holland in
order to cushion the shock resulting from the
obvious failure of the flying bomb. This does
not mean that if northern France had remained
in their hands, and our countermeasures to the
flying bomb been less successful, they would
not have used both weapons together; but that
in such circumstances the use of the rocket
would have been equally premature. The
standard of accuracy attained, the many mis-
fires, and the inconsistency of method adopted
by different firing units, all point in the same
direction.

240. To an even greater extent than the fly-
ing bomb campaign, then, the rocket offensive
must be regarded merely as a harassing attack.
In the outcofme it was not particularly success-
ful in that capacity. Why was this? The
contribution of the defences, as I have related,
was practically limited to tracking the missiles,
trying to locate the firing points, and attacking
these and other targets more or less frequently
and more or less effectively with fighters and
fighter-bombers. As I urged at the time,
these measures were not, by themselves, enough
to interfere seriously with the rate or quality
of the enemy’s fire. The ineffectiveness of the
A-4 rocket was due rather to the inaccuracy
of the weapon and to the restricted scale of
attack, reduced as it was by the enemy’s in-
sistence on dividing his efforts between Ant-
werp and London, probably from propagandist
motives. But to say this does not imiply that
no effective countermeasure to the rocket would
have been possible in any circumstances. In
one sense its very lack of weight was what
made the attack so hard to counter. For if the
enemy had begun to fire at a much greater
tate, he could no longer have lived from hand
to mouth. He would have been obliged to
store rockets and fuel in bulk near the firing
area. Valuable bombing targets would then
have been offered to us; and in such a case
the Chiefs of Staff would doubtless have con-
sidered lifting their virtual ban on the use of
the strategic bomber forces against rocket tar-
gets. I have little doubt that if this had been
done and the diversion of part of our bomber
effort been accepted, we should soon have
been able to restore the scale of rocket attack
to its original proportions.

241. Accordingly, so far as the rocket was
concerned the answer to our question is that,
although in the circumstances the effect of the
