The greatest co-operation was given by

Captain Barber, Superintendent of , Trinity

House, Cowes, to. whom considerable credit
is due: The difficulty. of keeping to a swept
channel with a strong cross tidé had always
been: foreseen before D day and the attention

of all concerned was drawn to it ‘in my Opera-

tion Orders. As feared, however, the light
buoys were roughly treated during the open-
ing phases of the operation and a very large
tiumber of these was sunk. ’ :

Heavy Air Attack on Havre.

68. By: x4th June there was a considerable
concentration of enemy E-Boats in Havre and at

my request Bomber Command 'carried out a’
heavy attack on the port just before dusk with -

the object of immobilising the: enemy craft.
This attack was extremely successful and 10
E-Boats and threé torpedo boats. are known
to have been sunk, in addition to many other
minor vessels. i

Visit of H.M. The King. .

69. His Majesty The King visited the British
assault area on 16th ‘Juné in H.M-S.
ARETHUSA. This visit gave the greatest
satisfaction and encouragement: to all British
naval personnel on the Far Shore.” On. the
other hand it is worth remarking here that I
had to make strenuous efforts‘ to reduce the
overall number of official visitors to the assault
area during the first few weeks of the operation.
The number of persons of gredter or lesslim-
portance who produced good reasons for pro~
ceeding there was alarming, observing that,
during their stay, of necessity they occupied
the time and attention of officers who should

have been engaged in other more useful work.

The Northerly Gale.

70. From D. day onwards the weather was
never what one expected fot June in the
Channel and from 14th June ‘onwards it de-
teriorated steadily apart from a temporary

improvement during the night'17th-x8th June.

which raised false. hopes of bétter conditions.
Low cloud very largely deprived our army
of their close air support and a moderate. to
strong wind made conditions generally un-
favourable for the optimum rate of discharge
of shipping off the beaches ‘urd for the cross-
Channel: MULBERRY tows. On 19th June a
north-easterly gale, unexpected, and unforecast,
began and at once stopped all unloading to
the beaches. Conditions deteriorated rapidly
and a large number of landing craft: was soon
in difficulties: Steps were taken to stop, the
sailing of further build-up convoys, but some
of those already at sea had; to continue, to
prevent congestion in U.K. anchorages. Addi-
tional tugs were despatched to the Far Shore
to assist ships and craft in difficulty until the
weather moderated. Casualties were suffered
by MULBERRY tows that jwere already at
sea and all further sailings of these had also
to be stopped. By 2oth Tans a large number
of ferry craft had been stranded by the onshore
wind and had received serious damage. All
unloading was on this day suspended, although
a quantity of stores had been discharged the
two previous days in the sheltet of MULBERRY
B (Arromanches). To meet this situation it
‘was decided to dry out, regardless of risk of

damage, a number of stores: coasters and all

“at Arromanches.

L.S.T. awaiting discharge.* It had previously
been ‘considered. that L.S.T. should not: dry
out except in an emergency, but thé opera-

tion was sé successful when attempted on a ~

large scale that thereafter this became the
normal method of discharge. ‘Coasters were
also beached successfully and only a few of
these ships suffered damage. By 2st June it
was apparent that the continued high seas were
seriously damaging the MULBERRIES. The
BOMBARDONS protecting both harbours
‘broke adrift and sank and generally proved
useless to withstarid weather with wind force
6f and above. The damage to blockships and
the PHOENIX breakwaters was dar more
severe at MULBERRY A (St. Laurent) than
GOOSEBERRY I also lost
all protectivé value. The WHALE piers in
MULBERRY A were ‘completely wrecked,
chiefly by landing craft being driven down on

to them. The gale eased slowly on 22nd June, —

but the sea did not finally go down until the
next day. .

71. The results of the gale were. to confront

the -Task Force and Assault Force Commanders

with a very critical situation just at the time
when their organisations were finally settling
down and when it was hoped that they and
their staffs might be withdrawn. It is very
difficulg to estimate the total effect of the galé
on the operation as a whole.. An army estimate
was made which suggested that from 19th to
24th June inclusive the unloading loss due to
the gale was in the neighbourhood of 20,000
vehicles and 140,000 tons of stores. The effect

of the gale on the arrivals of shipping and,

craft in France during these days is shown in
ihe attached Table A. From the naval point of
view the most serious result was the stranding
of about 800 craft of all types, most of which
were damaged and’ neaped, as this caused an
immediate shortage of ferry craft on the far
shore. It was soon also apparent that the
damage done to St. Laurent harbour was very
largely -irreparable, and, shortly afterwards,
you decided that this harbour would ‘not be
completed but that all remaining resources
would be devoted to the strengthening of
Arromanches to withstand winter conditions.
42. Asa result of the gale it was decided that
the Task Force and Assault Force Commanders
would have to remain in the assault area until
conditions were again normal.- Energetic
measures were taken to salve all the damaged

craft possible, and new equipment and block- |

ships were sent over for the MULBERRIES,
About 250 additional hull repair ratings drawn
from the Home Fleet and Home Commands
were brought forward as planned for such an
emergency, and an additional repair ship and, a
reserve port repair party were moved over to
the assault area. The full salvage organisation
was mustered. Due to the energy and resource
of all concerned about 600 stranded craft and
a few coasters and other small vessels were

temporarily repaired and refloated at the next’

spting tides, on 8th July. A further 100 were
tefloated a fortnight later.
Landing Craft Repair Situation.

73. The numbers of damaged landing craft
returning after the assault were much greater
