remain in close order and will be manoeuvred as a unit until action 1s joined.  When the signal   Act independently   is made or at discretion of Commanding Officer, REPULSE will assume freedom of manoeuvre remaining in tactical support but engaging from a wide enough angle to facilitate fall of shot.

5. Intend to operate at 25 knots unless a chase develops and subsequently to retire at maximum speed endurance will allow.

6. Capital ships should attempt to close below 20,000 yards until fire is effective but should avoid offering an end on target. Ships must be prepared to change from delay to nondelay fuzes according to target.

7. PRINCE OF WALES and REPULSE are each to have one aircraft fuelled and ready to fly off if required If flown off aircraft must return to land base. Kota Bharu aerodrome is understood to be out of action.

8. TENEDOS will be detached before dark to return independently to Singapore.

g.  Remaining destroyers may be detached during the night gth/1oth should enemy information require a high speed of advance In such case these destroyers are to retire towards Anamba Island at ro knots until a rendezvous is ordered by W/T.

TO: PRINCE OF WALES, REPULSE

. FROM: C.-in-C., E.F Inform Ships  Companies as follows: Begins   The enemy has made several landings on the north coast of Malaya and has made local progress. Our Army is not large and is hard pressed in places. Our Air Force has had to destroy and abandon one or more aercdromes. Meanwhile fast transports lie off the coast.

This is our opportunity before the enemy can establish himself. We have made a wide circuit to avoid air reconnaissance and hope to surprise the enemy shortly after sunrise tomorrow Wednesday. We may have, the luck to try our metal against the old Japanese battlecruiser .KONGO or against some Japanese cruisers ahd destroyers which are reported in the Gulf of Siam.~ We are sure to get some useful practice with the H.A. armament, ~ Whatever we meet I want to finish quickly and so get well clear to the eastward  before the Japanes  can mass too formidable a scale of an attack against us. So shoot to sink.  Ends. .

IMMEDIATE.

Only significant enemy report 1s contained in my 1125Z/gth. Enemy apparently continuing landing in Kota Bharu area which should be frurtful as well as Singgora.

2. On the other hand enemy bombers on South Indo-China aerodromes are in force and undisturbed They could attack you five hours after sighting and much depends on whether you have been seen today.

Two carriers may be in Saigon area.

3. Military situation at Kota Bharu appears difficult. Aerodrome is in enemy hands.

4. All our northern aerodromes are: becoming untenable due to enemy air action. C.-in-C., Far East, hints he 1s considering concentrating all air efforts on defence of Singapore area.

5. Extremely difficult to give you clearer picture because air reconnaissance communications are so slow due partly to damage to aerodromes.
