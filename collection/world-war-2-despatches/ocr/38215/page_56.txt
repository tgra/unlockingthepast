organised into seven company groups. The
road, which passed through miles of swampy
country, had been blocked in many places.
Each block had to be cleared in turn and some
ot the fiercest and most terrific fighting of the
whole campaign took place on this day, our
troops, harassed on all sides, repeatedly charg-
ing with the bayonet, and the Japanese Guards
fighting with their traditional fanaticism. It
was not till o600 hrs., 21st January, that the
head of the column reached the bridge at Parit
Sulong to find it held by the enemy.

361. Early in the withdrawal the Commander
45 Indian Brigade (Brigadier Duncan) was
killed while leading a bayonet charge. He had
set a magnificent example of courage and forti-
tude and can in no way be held responsible for
the disaster which overtook his untrained
' brigade. The command of the force devolved
upon Lt.-Col. Anderson A.I.F., who for his
fine leadership was awarded the Victoria Cross.

362. At 0833 hrs. 2st January I ordered
the Commander Westforce to assume command
of all troops on the Yong Peng—Muar road at a
time to be arranged direct with the Commander
rz Indian Division. The reasons for this change
in command were as under: —

(@) The movements of the Segamat and
Muar Forces now required very careful co-
ordination.

(b) The shortening of communications now
made it possible for the Commander West-
force to control both forces.

(c) The only possibility of communication
with the Muar Force was by W/T from Head-
quarters Wesitforce.

363. At 1230 brs. 21st January I held an-
other conference at Yong Peng. The decisions
reached at this conference, which concerned
chiefly the organization for future operations,
will be recorded later. The Commander West-
force reported, however, that he was organizing
a counter-attack with 2 Loyals, withdrawn
from the Segamat front, to recapture the Bukit
Payong feature with the object subsequently of
re-opening communications to the Muar Force.
To this project I gave my approval. That it
was not subsequently carried out was due"partly
to delay in the provision of transport for the
move forward of the 2 Loyals and partly to the
difficulty of providing artillery support. Having
studied the problem carefully I am now of the
opinion that the chances of a single battalion
being able to advance 7 miles through that type
of country and relieve the Muar Force in the
time available were remote. The remaining in-
fantry in the Yong Peng force were by that
time too exhausted to be able to take a useful
part in the operation.

‘364. Throughout the 21st January desperate
efforts were made by the Muar Force to force
the river crossing at Parit Sulong. But the
bridge was strongly held and the attacks were
repulsed. In the rear a new threat appeared
in the shape of heavy tanks, several of which
were destroyed by anti-tank guns and tank-
hunting parties. By nightfall, however, the
position held had become very contracted. The
following morning food and medical supplies
were dropped by three aircraft from Singapore,
but at ogoo hrs. the Commander Muar Force
Teluctantly. gave the order for all guns, vehicles
and heavy weapons to be destroyed, for the

wounded to be left behind in charge of volun-
teers and for all who could walk to make their
way through the jungle to Yong Peng.

Eventually some 550 Australian troops and
some 400 Indian troops rejoined. I regret to
have to record that the wounded who were left
behind were, almost without exception, subse-
quently massacred by the Japanese.

365. The 45 Indian Infantry Brigade ceased
to exist. Those killed included the Brigade
Commander, every battalion comimander and
second-in-command and two of the three ad-
jutants. Only one or two of the surviving
British officers had more than a few months’
service. This brigade had never been fit for
employment in a theatre of war. It was not
that there was anything wrong with the raw
material but simply that it was raw. It was
the price of our unpreparedness for war and
over-rapid expansion.

306. Throughout the Battle of Muar the
Navy and Air Force did their utmost to help
us, the former by sending gunboats nightly to
bombard the Muar area and the latter by
mobilizing all possible resources, however
antiquated, to attack the enemy.

367. The Battle of Muar, which lasted six
days, was one of the most sanguinary of the
Malayan campaign. Our small untried force,
in spite of its handicaps, had held at bay a
division of the Japanese Imperial Guards and
by doing so had saved the Segamat Force
which would otherwise inevitably have been
lost.

368. The Withdrawal from Segamat.—On the
afternoon of the 18th January the enemy
attacked with tanks near the main road north
of Batu Anam but were repulsed. During the
night, in accordance with the decision
previously recorded, the 9 Indian Division fell
back ‘behind the line of the River Muar and the
247 Australian Brigade Group behind the River
Segamat.

During the night r9th/2zoth January the 9
Indian Division was withdrawn south of the
River Segamat to the Tenang area. All the
big bridges over the Rivers Muar and Segamat
were destroyed.

During the night 2oth/2zrst January the 27
Australian Brigade Group was withdrawn by
M.T. from the line of the River Segamat and
fell back direct to Yong Peng, where it took
up positions covering the vital road junction.
The 9 Indian Division moved one brigade
group to the Labis area and one to Kampong
Bahru. On the afternoon of the 21st January
the forward troops of the 22 Indian Brigade
successfully ambushed the leading Japanese
troops moving down the main road. Our
troops, having got used to this novel form of
warfare, were now displaying more cunning.

During the night 21st/2a2nd January the 22
Indian Brigade Group less one baitalion (R.
Garhwal Rifles) moved by M.T. to the Kluang
area, the R. Garhwal Rifles marching down the
railway to the Paloh area, The 8 Brigade.Group
was in position astride thé main road sonse 12
miles south of Labis where the enemy mad con-
tact early on the 22nd January. Fighting con-
tinued on this front throughout the day. Durin,
the following night the8 Brigade Group fell back
behind the River Gerchang some 4 miles north
of Yong Peng, a strong pgsition where further
fighting took place én the“23rd. This day was
also remarkable for intense enemy air activity,
