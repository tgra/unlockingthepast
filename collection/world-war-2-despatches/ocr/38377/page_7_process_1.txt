AURORA, ARETHUSA with 3 destroyers of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla and 3 destroyers* from the Home Fleet. S.  PASTEUR would convey to Gibraltar the personnel not already embarked in H.M. and M.T. ships, for subsequent transfer to H.M. Ships together with naval and military details for Gibraltar.

3- On the 8th July, the Admiralty issued certain decisions and instructions. These were as follows : 

(a) M.G.1 was to proceed by the westward route,

(b) The order of importance of the three objects of the operation was to be taken as

(i) The safe arrival of Convoy  ' Substance   at Malta.

(ii) The subsequent safe return to Gibraltar of the warships forming the escorting  forces.

 (ii) The safe arrival at Gibraltar of

| M.G.r.

(c) In view of the above it would not be possible to provide close escort for M.G.r and it was preferable for this convoy to leave Malta on D.3. 

(4) The advantage claimed for sailing M.G.1 on D.3 with the subsequent dispersal was that the enemy would be presented with a multiplicity of targets.

(e) It was essential for warships to carry troops, and an additional carrier would not be available.

I was instructed, after consultation with ViceAdmiral, Malta, to issue detailed orders  forthe whole operation.

4. On the oth July, the Vice-Admiral Commanding, North Atlantic Station asked for as. many additional flying-boats as possible to be  made available at Gibraltar from p.m. D.- 4 to D.3 in order to provide cover for the operation.

5. Special instructions were issued by me on the roth July to conceal the object of the operation.

6. On the 8th July, I had asked Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean if arrangements could be made for the following submarine dispositions :  

(a) 2 off Naples.

(b) x off Palermo.

(c) 2in southern approaches to Messina. - (d) 1 off Marittimo.

{e) 3 off Cagliari.

Of these, (a) and (e) could be provided fronr the Western Mediterranean.
