Here they were joined by the rest of the Division and 255 Indian Tank Brigade (less one regiment left with 7 Indian Division). The advance continued the same day, but to avoid the difficult country between Pyinsin and Welaung, the Division fanned out, 48 Brigade and a proportion of armour moving on Taungtha, via Kainye, and 63 Brigade with the main body of the Tank Brigade directed south-east on Seiktin and then north-east, via Welaung. Both columns reached Taungtha on the 24th February after overcoming desperate resistance and clearing many minefields. By the evening of the 24th, our leading troops had progressed five miles south-east of Taungtha, towards Mahlaing. By 0900 hours om the 26th we had captured the important Thabutkon. airfield intact, smashing through a determined Japanese effort to protect it.
