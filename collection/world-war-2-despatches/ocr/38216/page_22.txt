203., However, with the destruction of air-
craft on the ground in N.W, Malaya in mind,
it became evident to A-H.Q. that a dangerous
congestion of aircraft existed at Kuantan, par-
ticularly vulnerable because there was no A.A.
protection there at all. Orders were issued to
O.C. Kuantan, early on the gth, to retain ra
Vildebeestes and the 13 Hudsons of Nos. 1
and 8 (GR) Squadrons, R.A.A.F., and to
despatch the remainder to Singapore,

204. At noon the expected attack took place,
and Kuantan was subjected to its first experi-
ence of high bombing, followed up by the
bombers flying low and shooting up at will.
A.H.Q. thereupon decided to evacuate Kuantan,
the surviving 10 Hudsons and 8 Vildebeestes
returning io Singapore. The withdrawal of
the ground party from Kuantan might have
been better controlled. From then on Kuantan
was available as an A.L.G. for refuelling only.

December, 1941.

205. During the night 9-roth, reports were
received of a landing north of Kuantan. Six
Vildebeestes and 3 Hudsons were ordered to
attack. The Vildebeestes found 3 small ships
and bombed them with doubtful results, but
the Hudsons which arrived later found no
target although they prolonged their search of
the area past daylight. There is reason to
believe that the beaches at Kuantan had been
fired on dunng the night, but that the enemy
force was only a light reconnaissance to test
the. defences, and its size had been magnified in
the telling.

206. Further bombing of Kuantan aerodrome
on the morning of the roth added to the un-
certainty of the situation and all available
bombers in Singapore were put at short notice
to await developments. Sharks from the target-
towing flight carried out reconnaissance of the
approaches to Singapore, whilst Blenheim IV’s
from No. 34 (B) Squadron, using Kuantan for
refuelling purposes, continued reconnaissance
of the east coast up to 50 miles north of Singora,
confirming once more the large concentration
of shipping off the Siamese coast.

207. The false report of a landing at Kuantan
proved to have a vital bearing on the move-
ments of H.M.S. ‘‘ Prince of Wales’’ and
H.M.S, “‘ Repulse’’, and it is now necessary
_to turn to the events leading up to the sinking
of these two vessels.

Sinking of H.M.S. “ Prince of Wales’? and
“ Repulse ’’—1oth December, 1941.

208. The C.-in-C. Eastern Fleet, Admiral Sir
Tom Phillips, decided to sail on the 8th Decem-
ber, 1941, with H.M.S. ‘‘ Prince of Wales ”’
_and H.M S. ‘“‘ Repulse ”’ accompanied by four
destroyers, with the object of attacking the
concentration of Japanese transports reported
between Singora and Patani. He intended to
arrive in the target area at dawn on the roth
December.

209. Before leaving on the 8th December
(p.m.) the C.-in-C. .asked for the following : —

(a) Reconnaissance 100 miles to north of
the force from daylight, Tuesday, the gth
December:

SUPPLEMEN®#0 THE LONDON GAZETTE, 26 FEBRUARY, 1948

(6) Reconnaissance to Singora and beyond,
ten miles from the coast, starting at first
light on the roth December:

(c) Fighter protection off Singora at day-
light on the roth December.

The A.O.C. gave tentative replies that he
could provide (a), hoped to be able to pro-
vide (6), but could not provide (c). It was
decided that he should go thoroughly into the
problems involved and give definite replies to
the Chief of Staff, Eastern Fleet (Rear Admiral
Palliser), who remained at the Naval Base in
close liaison with G.H.Q.

210. The doubt about the reconnaissance re-
quired in (b) above was due to the fact that
the reconnaissance would have had to be pro-
vided by Blenheim IV’s based on Kuantan,
and it was uncertain whether this aerodrome
would be out of action or not.

az. The reason why the fighter protection
asked for in (c) could not be provided was
mainly that the northern aerodromes were
either untenable or else had been badly damaged
by bombers; this meant that the fighters would
have to operate from aerodromes at consider-
able distance from Singora, and, owing to the
short endurance of the Buffalo, would have
been able to remain only a very short time
over the Singora area before having to return
to refuel. These factors meant that a short
patrol might possibly have been provided at
intervals at Singora, but that it was impossible
to guarantee appreciable fighter protection.

azz. On the evening of the 8th December the
A.O.C. confirmed his tentative replies to the
Chief of Staff, Eastern Fleet, and this infor-
mation was passed by the latter to the C.-in-C.
The signal as received on board ‘‘ Prince of
Wales ’’ expressly stated that no fighter pro-
tection could be provided on roth December,
1941. The words “‘ off Singora ’’’ did not ap-
pear in the text of the signal, but were 1m-
plied in the light of Admiral Phillips’ request
(para. 209 (c)).

213. The agreed air reconnaissances were
carried out on both the gth and roth
December.

214. In the early hours of roth December
a signal was received at Singapore indicating
that the Fleet might return sooner than ‘was
originally planned Apart from this no com-
munication was received from the C.-in-C, and
his position was unknown.

215. Suddenly, shortly after 1200 hours on
the roth December, a signal, originating from
H.M.S. ‘‘ Repulse ’’, was received in the ©
Operations Room at A.H.Q. of enemy air
attacks on H.M.S. ‘ Prince of Wales ’’ and
“Repulse ”’ in a position some 60 miles East-
wards of Kuantan. No. 453 (F) Squadron (11
aircraft), which was standing by specifically to
provide protection for these ships in case of
their return to Singapore, left six minutes later,
only to arrive in the area, 165 miles away, to
find destroyers picking up survivors from these
two great vessels, For the rest of the day a
number of sorties by flying boats and fighters
was carried out in connection with the return
of these destroyers to Singapore.

216. It subsequently transpired that the
Fleet had been located by Japanese reconnais-
sance p.m. gth December, and that later the
