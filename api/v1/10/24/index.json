            "title": "Strategic Timing: October 23 Set as D-Day for Key Offensive After Extensive Preparations",
            "description": "Perhaps the-most difficult decision I had to face was thetiming of the offensive. Obviously the sooner we could attack the better, for the enemy was strenuously perfecting his defences. When I went down to the desert with the Prime Minister he asked me when I thought I should be ready; I replied, as a most tenta, tive estimate, for at that time I had only been in Middle East a few days and had not had time to study an offensive operation in detail, that I thought the end of September a possible date. He asked General Montgomery the same question when we arrived at Eighth Army Headquarters and the latter replied to the same effect, saying ‘‘ Not before the first week in October ’’ This estimate now needed revision. ‘We had in any case lost a week as a result of the batle of Alam el Halfa and our losses, though comparatively slight, and the redisposition of troops which that battle had caused had set us back perhaps another week. I was determined that Eighth Army should have all the time necessary for training and the assimilation of its new reinforcements. Above all I wanted the armoured divisions of 10 Corps to have ample time to settle down into a welldrilled and confident ‘whole; we were bringing against the enemy almost double his strength in tanks, 1t was vital to ensure that we were able to make full use of this superiority. On these grounds, therefore, I decided to wait until as late as possible in October. The actual date was determined by the phases of the moon. The plan must involve a series of infantry attacks against strong defences to gain possession of the enemy’s minefields and make gaps, in them to pass the armour through. For this a night assault was obviously demanded and if the infantry were to be able to hft the mines quickly and accurately they would need good moonlight. . Full moon was on 24th October and in agreement with General Montgomery I therefore decided on 23rd October as D-day.",

            "description": "unqualified success. During the critical hours of 24th October when ro Corps was still trying to deploy the enemy was still inclined to believe that the weight of our armour lay behind 13 Corps and launched only a few minor counter-attacks in the north. So, although 13 Corps had failed in its secondary mission, its assault was sufficiently successful to convince the enemy that he must keep two armoured divisions in the south not only on 24th but even on 25th October. Moreover a naval operation which successfully simulated a landing at Rasel-Kenayis 65 miles west of El Alamein made him keep 90 Light Division back at Daba. Undoubtedly the death of the Axis Commanderin-Chief had assisted the confusion which was evident in the enemy camp. General Stumme had gone forward on a reconnaissance on the night of the 23rd with his Chief Signal Officer; as they were standing close together the latter was struck down by a sudden burst of machinegun fire and Stumme, who had apparently been overworking in a climate to which he was unaccustomed, was seized by a heart attack of which he died on the spot. It was some time before he was missed and his body recovered and this delayed the assumption of command by General von Thoma, Commander of the German Africa Corps.",

            "description": "I presented this appreciation at a conference at Carthage with the Commanders-inChief on 24th October. It was agreed by General Eisenhower and signalled to the Combined Chiefs of Staff. The conference agreed that it was essential to retain the initiative and approved my plan of campaign which I teported at the same time. Eighth Army’s advance up the east coast was running into a cul-de-sac of rather unimportant country; but General Montgomery was of.the opinion that if he could establish himself on the high ground north of Pescara, after crossing the Trigno, Sangro and Pescara rivers, he could then strike south-westwards down Route 5, the Via Valeria, to Avezzano and threaten Rome from the east. In conjunction with. this southwesterly attack by Eighth Army, Fifth Army",

            "description": "The climax of the assault was reached between 20th and 24th October. On’ the 2oth 88 Division attacked and seized the great massif of Monte Grande and Monte Cerere. On the 22nd the same division captured La Costa, only four miles from Route 9 and on the 23rd 34 Division captured Monte Belmonte, about ten miles east of Route 65 and nine miles from the centre of Bologna. That same night 78 Division stormed Monte Spaduro for which the Irish Brigade had been struggling since the 2oth. This was Fifth Army’s finest effort of the winter campaign. For the Germans it was a real crisis, for a relatively small advance would put the Allies on Route 9, behind Tenth Anmy; the front would be split and even an immediate withdrawal might lead to disaster. The only course was to hope that we might be so exhausted by the struggle in the mountains as to be incapable of that supreme effort. As he had done at Cassino, Vietinghoff decided to hold on in that hope and to make the still closer and strengthen the hope he brought across from opposite Eighth Army the two . divisions famous for the defence of Cassino,",
