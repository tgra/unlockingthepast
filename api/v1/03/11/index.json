            "description": "At the same time I was informed by the Chiefs of Staff that it had been decided to place the military garrison of Malta under my command, just as the Naval and Royal Air Force garrisons were under command of the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean and the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief respectively. The change took place on the 11th March. In actual fact it made little practical difference except that henceforward the three Commanders-inChief and the Middle East Defence Committee had a unified responsibility for Malta as an integral part of the Middle East theatre. The position of General Dobbie as Commander-inChief of Malta was not affected.",

            "description": "38. The element of surprise which had accompanied the entry of these forces and which had been aided by diversionary bombing around Bhamo and Indaw was maintained throughout. Even when the enemy divined our intentions, our air superiority was instrumental in rendering his attacks ineffectual. It was not until 11th March and 13th March that the enemy attacked the two landing grounds which had been first extemporised— by which time one had already been evacuated and a detachment of Spitfires of No. 81 Squadron had been installed on the other. Other landing strips were contrived as the occasion arose, though for the most part the thirty columns of the division were supplied by dropping. Much of the effectiveness of this air supply depended upon the standard of training of the Dakota crews, The dropping zones were continually being changed as the columns moved from place to place. Delivery normally took place by night and there was often no ather guide than navigational skill supplemented by pre-arranged light signals which became visible only when the aircraft arrived in the vicinity of the dropping zone. Danger from ground fire whilst dropping was a frequent and accepted risk. This was no less true of occasions on which Dakotas were able to utilise a landing ground, for enemy detachments were often in the neighbourhood. The strip opened in the later stages of the operation at Hopin was evacuated because of small arms fire through which our aircraft had unavoidably to pass before landing.",
