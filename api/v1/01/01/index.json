The enemy counter- attacked, but, generally, we retained the ground taken. On the night of the 1st January the assault was resumed, again to the east, of the main road. The enemy resisted stubbornly and inflicted a number of casualties on our tanks which led the attack. This bold night"

On the afternoon of the 1st January six small steamers accompanied by other craft were reported anchored at the mouth of the River Bernam, which flows into the sea a few miles south of the River Perak. The River Bernam is navigable for launches to Rantau Panjang, whence tracks lead to the main road, so that the threat to our communications was ob- vious. At 1930 hrs. some enemy troops landed at Ulan Melintang on the River Bernam. To meet this threat the 12 Brigade Group was moved from its rest area at Bidor to the Changkat Jong area."

Late on the 1st January the Commander rr Indian Division reported that an enemy force had landed at Ulu Melintang near the mouth of the River Bernam (a little south of the mouth of the River Perak) and that he had moved the 12 Brigade Group to meet this threat. He further said that he thought he could continue to hold the Kampar position, where a strong attack had already been repulsed, for several days but that, if he did so, his ability to hold the enemy north of the Kuala Kubu Road Junction might, in view of the threat to his communications, be prejudiced. He asked for authority to withdraw his force from Kampar at his discretion. - This was granted."

Brink, C.B., D.S.O. I was then able to place the force on a three division front, 1rth (A) Division on the tight, rath (A) Division in the centre ,and ist (S.A.) Division on the left. The length of the front to be held seldom permitted me to form a force reserve, though from time to time I depended on formations out resting in the Highlands or units under training.

This, especially the appointment of General Kuter, was a big step forward but that it did not go far enough soon became evident, and at a further meeting at Thelergma airfield on 24th January, the Commander-in-Chief made me ** responsible for the employment of American troops,\u201d\u2019 though not yet in control of the French Corps. After a long conference with me that night General Juin agreed to place his Corps under my command, and next day this decision was confirmed by General Giraud."

            "description": "of delay, there were at present as many fit for battle as the means of transport could deal with. An estimate prepared for me on 6th September showed that by the end of the month we should have available in the Mediterranean one armoured and eleven infantry divisions and an airborne brigade; this figure did not in- clude the divisions due to return to the United Kingdom but included one division earmarked for operations against the Dodecanese.* By 1st January this figure should have risen to twenty infantry divisions, five armoured divisions and possibly one airborne division. I must emphasise, however, that this was the total for the whole theatre and out of it must be deducted the four divisions required for the garrison of the Middle East and North Africa and the forces intended and promised for the support of Turkey if that country should enter the war.t Our position is therefore clearer if we contrast these forces not merely with the nineteen German divisions already in Itaiy but with the fifty-odd in the Mediterranean theatre from South France to the Balkans."

            "description": "163. The situation on the 1st January neces- sitated further modification of the plan, which had already been anticipated. The Akyab garrison was known to have been further weakened, although to what extent was still uncertain. 25 Indian Division had .reached Foul Point, Rathedaung and Kudaung Island well ahead of schedule. 81 (West African) Division was successfully containing the enemy by its pressure in the Kaladan. It was, there- fore, imperative to block the Japanese Minbya\u2014 Myebon escape route as early as possible. The immediate possession of Akyab thus became essential to our further progress, and the quickest emergency plan for its capture was put into action. 3 Commando Brigade, mounted in the Naf River as previously planned, was to carry out an assault landing on the north- western beaches of the island, supported by such naval and air bombardment as could be prepared at short notice. Simultaneously 53 Brigade was to cross the two mile wide mouth of the Kywede River in country craft, from Kudaung Island. 74 Brigade would be ferried across the four mile wide Mayu estuary from Foul Point and follow up 3 Commando Brigade. D-Day was fixed for the 3rd January."
