            "description": "156. Once the operations had started and the troops which had been staged there had been ferried to Sicily, Malta's role diminished. The dumps of supplies, petrol and oil, ammunition and Ordnance stores were partially despatched. Supplies of bread, approximately 18,000 Ibs. daily, were shipped from 22nd July to 13th August. Apart from that, little was done by the island except to meet small urgent demands."

            "date": "13th August",
            "description": "East of Etna the country offered many obstacles to a rapid advance. It is a thickly inhabited narrow strip, confined between the mountains and the coast, and the cultivation, especially the walls of the vineyards and olive groves, makes it excellent defensive terrain. 5 and 50 Divisions could make only slow progress, although the enemy had by now decided to evacuate and was seeking only to impose the maximum delay. Thanks to the difficulties of the terrain which I have already mentioned, he was able to extricate a high proportion of his troops, though not, of course, their heavy equipment. The Messina area was very heavily defended; anti-aircraft fire, for instance, was described by our pilots as worse than over the Ruhr. General Montgomery was anxious to bring a Corps into reserve to prepare for the invasion of Italy and on 13th August he pulled out 5 Division and 13 Corps Headquarters to join the Canadian Division in preparation for the new assault, 50 and 51 Divisions continued the pursuit. An attempted landing in rear of the enemy on the night of 15th August, in the style of those carried out on the north coast, was very nearly successful but the enemy were retreating too fast for any to be cut off."

            "date": "13th August",
            "description": "24. The enemy resumed his advance from Hargeisa on 8th August. At 12.30 hours on gth August he encountered our forward delaying detachment, consisting of one Company Northern Rhodesia Regiment with one machinegun section of the Somaliland Camel Corps. This position was quickly overrun by three tanks which are reported to have been led round the mines, which had been placed in front of the position, by Somalis who knew their location. These tanks were reported as medium tanks, their type has not been definitely established, but they were certainly larger than light tanks. Since the force at this time possessed no weapon to deal with medium tanks, Captain Howden of H.M.A.S. Hobart sent a 3-pdr. naval gun with three ratings up to the battlefield where it was placed at Observation Hill in the Tug Argan position. On 13th August two Bofors guns also arrived at the front."
