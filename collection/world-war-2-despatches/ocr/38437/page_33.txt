SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 20 OCTOBER, 1948

defences was small, potentially we had the
means of keeping the situation in hand if the
scale of attack had risen.

242. On the broader issue of the extent to
which the Germans were right, in the military
sense, to develop their two long-range weapons
and put them into operation, a number of
questions naturally arise. Would several
thousand fighters have been worth more to the
enemy than the 20,000 flying bombs and 3,000
rockets, or thereabouts, which he aimed at
England and Continental cities? Put thus, the
issue is misleadingly simple; the fighters would
have been no usé without pilots, ground crews,
bases, and supplies of aviation spirit greater
than the Germans could command. if this
effort had been put into the production of
bombers instead, the Germans would still have
‘been no better off: the crews and the aviation
spirit would not have been forthcoming.
indeed, since by the time the most ‘important
decisions were taken the Luftwaffe had lost
much of its striking power, the devotion of so
much skill and manpower to the flying bomb
and the A-4 is at least understandable. The
former was an ingenious weapon, which we
might not have overcome if we had been less
well prepared; the latter a notable advance on
anything that had gone before, and a source
of problems with which the nations are still
grappling. The sponsors of these engines of
destruction may be pardoned for a certain
lack of judgment if they fancied themselves on
the brink of changes comparable to those which
followed the rifled barrel and the machine-gun.

243. Whatever the pros and cons of the Ger-
man policy which lay behind the operation of
the flying bomb and the A-4 rocket, it is prob-
able that, as the end approached, the German
measures to stave off general defeat became less
well co-ordinated and more involuntary. I
have tried to show why I think it more than
doubtful whether Hitler could have developed
a decisive attack with the flying bomb and the
rocket in 1944, whatever targets had been
chosen. I have suggested that in fact he was
confronted with the peremptory need of a sign
which would show his followers that England
was being attacked, and so mitigate to some
sapiee the terror that was coming upon them.
Where action is taken under forces of over-
whelming compulsion there can hardly be a
question of fastidious strategic judgment.
None the less, in the complex and often
tangled web of German strategy one important
thread was missing. Though hidden at first
by reason of the great number of aircraft
deployed to lead off the German land cam-
paigns, its absence became more obvious as
operations went on. I refer to the German
failure to think consistently in terms of air
power. The Luftwaffe was allowed to run
down, and no big enough measures were set

in train for its continuous replenishment, es-
pecially in respect of competent bomber crews.
The result of this neglect was a progressive
loss of air superiority, at first over the occupied
territories and finally over the “‘ living space ”
“of Germany.

244. If, as Koller had said, the flying bomb
and the A-4 rocket were to be regarded as a
substitute for the strategic bomber force, the
cardinal mistake was to suppose that these
novel weapons could be used effectively in the
absence of air superiority, which alone could
have provided reasonable immunity from air
attack. Only air superiority could ensure that
the places where the missiles were stored, ser-
viced, and fired, the crews who fired them, and
the vehicles which carried them by road and
rail would not be subject to systematic inter-
ference.

245. By the time the flying bomb and rocket
campaigns were got under way, the Allies had
gained a high degree of air superiority over
all the areas from which the weapons could
be fired. Hence we were in a position to con-
duct a counter-offensive at will, and without
serious hindrance from enemy aircraft, where-
ever targets might present themselves and
whenever the scale of attack by the Germans
was sufficient to warrant the diversion of
Allied bombers from their main task. Some-
times—as with the rail interdiction programme
of the tactical air forces—operations conceived
with the main task in view served a dual pur-
pose, and no diversion was involved.

246. Moreover, this vital condition of aiv
superiority, for which we had fought without
respite since the Battle of Britain, enabled us
constantly to improve the system of air
defence whose application to new threats I
have endeavoured to describe. Because we had
air superiority we found ourselves free to adapt
the system to novel circumstances and keep it
in action day and night, with scarcely a rap
from the German bombers not an hour’s flying
away.

247. The problems of air defence which have
been described will not remain static. They
may recur in new forms in the future. The
scientific advances which the Germans used so
spectacularly, if unsuccessfully, gave us a fore-
taste of hazards against which it is our busi-
ness to provide. As science goes forward, and
fresh discoveries lead to changes in the
apparatus and methods of air defence, fertility
in research and skill in engineering will provide
better tools and weapons; but these are only
raw materials of progress, What we need to
do, above all, is to give rein to the qualities
of mind and imagination which can take the
growing mass of technical knowledge and
mould what it brings forth to fit the shape of
things to come.
