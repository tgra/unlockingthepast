This set of\n\nmaps also covers the operations described in the other Air\n\ndespatches of the\n\nand Army\nBurma campaign from 16th November, 1943 to 12th September, 1945.\n\nThe following despatch was submitted to the\nSecretary of State for Air on 23rd November,\n1944, by AIR CHIEF MARSHAL SIR\nR. E. C. PEIRSE, K.C.B., DS.O., AFL.,\nAllied Air Commander-in-Chief, South East\n\nsia.\n\nPART ONE\nINTRODUCTORY\n\n1. As a result of the formation on 16th\nNovember, 1943, of South East Asia Command,\nI assumed operational control of all Air Forces\nin the South East Asia theatre, with authority\nto employ them in conformity with the policy\nof the Supreme Allied Commander, Admiral\nThe Lord Louis Mountbatten, G.C.V.O., C.B.,\nDS.O., AD.C. Thus I had at my disposal\nwhat had constituted R.A.F. India Command,\n.and those American units in this theatre which\ncomprised the 10th USAAF. It was my\ntask to ensure that these forces operated as a\ncoherent body and that the best use was made\nof the potentialities of each.\n\n2. In addition it was my continued responsi-\nbility to develop India as a base for future\nair operations, as a supply centre, and as a\ntraining area for R.A-F, and LAF. personnel.\nSuch activities absorb a considerable propor-\ntion of the energies of the Command, and con-\nstitute a task of which the importance and\nTesults are not immediately apparent. I have\ntherefore devoted Part Four of this Despatch\nto the progress that has been made in this\ndirection.\n\n3. Responsibility for operations on the\nNorth West Frontier and for the Indian Air\nForce was relinquished to the formation which\n\nreplaced the Inspectorate-General of the LA.F.\nand to which was bequeathed the name Air\nHeadquarters, India.\n\n* * * * * *\n\n4. To ensure the integrated operational con-\ntrol of Units in Bengal and Assam, a new\nHeadquarters was set up under Major-General\nG. E. Stratemeyer, US.A.A.F., designated\nEastern Air Command and located initially at\nDelhi. This formation, which had previously\nexisted under the title Headquarters,\nUS.A.A.F., India-Burma Sector, China-Burma-\nIndia Theatre, had administered and controlled\nthe 10th U.S.A.A.F. and provided in addition\nbase facilities for the 14th U.S.A.A.F. The new\nHeadquarters consisted basically of the Opera-\ntions Section of the old organisation with the\naddition of an R.A. element. This Com-\nmand, and all those comprising the 10th\nwhich had formerly come under Bengal Com-\nmand and all those comprising the 10th\nUS.A.AF. in the same area. These forces were\nsubdivided into a Tactical Air Force under Air\nMarshal Sir John Baldwin, and a Strategic\nAir Force under Brigadier General Howard C.\nDavidson, U.S.A.AF. I was authorised to\neffect such re-grouping of operational units that\n1 considered necessary to achieve maximum\noperational efficiency, and as a result R.AF.\nand U.S,A.A.F. transport units were merged\non 15th December into one organisation which\nwas given the title of Troop Carrier Command.\nThis new formation was commanded by\nBrigadier General D. Old, USAAF. Simi-\nlarly R.A. and American photographic\nreconnaissance units were incorporated into\none command which assumed the title of\n",

The Aircraft Factory and Arsenal\nat Bangkok received many hits from the 106\ntons of bombs aimed at it. When considering\nthe relative lightness of the attack, allowance\nmust be made for the distance involved, which\nis equivalent to a return flight from London to\nTunis.\n\n65. While I had not originally planned to\nuse strategic bombers in close support of\nground troops, the Commanders on ali three\nsectors of the front requested their help and\nwere accorded it. I have dealt with these\noperations in more detail in the section de-\nvoted to Army Support, where it will be seen\nthat the greater proportion were in direct\nsupport of IV Corps in front of Imphal.\nWellingtons were initially employed on this\ntask by daylight, with fighter escort, since the\nMitchells (B.25) could more usefully be\nemployed on sweeps along the various\nLines of Communication. Subsequently, when\nWellington crews had to be withdrawn for air\nsupply duties, the Liberators (B.24) were used\nin a similar daylight rdle. This m\u00e9thod of\nemployment of strategic bombers was all the\nmore acceptable to me since monsoon condi-\ntions made night bombing wellnigh impossible.\nThe frequency of these attacks increased, and\nby the end of May No. 231 Group alone had\nbeen able to achieve the creditable total of\n646 short tons of bombs dropped on Army\nSupport targets.\n\n66. The above duties of Strategic Air Force\n\ninvolved the dropping, from January onwards,\nof 6,741 short tons of bombs, of which R.A.F.\nand U.S.A.A.F. dropped almost equal propor-\nfins. The distribution of this effort was as\n\u2018ollows :\n\nPer\n\n. cent.\n\nMilitary installations, dumps, etc. 54.7\nRailroad communications wee 22.6\nAirfields and landing grounds ... 10.2\nBridges wee wee we 5.5\nShipping ... 3.5\nJettisoned 3.5\n\n67. The Strategic Air Force carried out one\nmore duty during the period, the reinforce-\nment with crews and aircraft of the transport\nsquadrons maintaining the life-line to forces\ncut off on the Imphal Plain. On 19th May\nforty Wellington crews were attached to Troop\nCarrier Command to help the over-worked\ncrews there, and five aircraft and crews were\ndetailed to carry 250-lb. bombs to the tactical\nsquadrons operating at high pressure in the\nImphal Plain. Despite bad weather, 544\nbombs were delivered by 31st May. In the\nsame period, No. 490 U.S. (Mitchell) Squadron\ndelivered 380 tons of ammunition to the forces\ndefending Imphal. The offensive power which\nthese loads represented contributed to the\neventual breaking of the Japanese offensive\nand enabled the normal transport aircraft to\nconcentrate on delivering jother supplies of\nwhich the Army was in urgent need.\n\n* = * * * *\n\nIV.\u2014SuprorT OF GROUND Forces\n\n68. Operations on land were renewed and\nmaintained on a large scale during this period,\nso that there were greatly increased oppor-\ntunities for giving support to our land forces.\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\nThe fact that we possessed and held air\nsuperiority enabled full advantage to be taken\nof these opportunities, and throughout the big\nbattles\u2014first in Arakan and then in Manipur\nand around Myitkyina\u2014ground support\nreached dimensions which absorbed a large\npart of the total effort.\n\n69. The successful provision of direct sup-\nport to our armies in this theatre is faced by\ntwo great difficulties. The first of these is the\nnature of the terrain over which the fighting\nwas taking place. Much of it is close, densely\nwooded, or covered with thick undergrowth,\nso that the recognition of targets presents a\nproblem to even the most experienced crews.\nThe second is the nature and characteristics\nof the enemy as a fighter on the ground. Three\nthings distinguish him: his tenacity and\nstamina, which enable him to take great\npunishment from the air and still retain his\nfighting spirit; his skill in camouflaging his\npositions and dumps, which makes it very\ndifficult to locate them from the air or the\nground ; and his beaver-like propensity for dig-\nging himself into the ground by excavations\nthat range from a number of shallow fox-\nholes to hold one or two men to an elaborate\nsystem of bunkers unharmed by all but direct\nhits from heavy bombs. By virtue indeed of\nthe nature of each, the terrain and the enemy\nare strikingly suited to each other.\n\n70. The difficult nature of the terrain and\nthe enemy\u2019s complementary skill in camou-\nflage were overcome, to a great extent, by\nthe intimate knowledge that aircrews came to\nhave of the country over which they were\noperating. Another aid to target recognition\nwas the use of artillery or mortar smoke shells.\nThe enemy, however, on several occasions put\ndown diversionary smoke to mislead our air-\ncraft. One remedy to this ruse is the employ-\nment of coloured smoke which has recently\narrived in the theatre.\n\n71. The enemy\u2019s capacity for absorbing\npunishment from the air without losing his\nwill to continue fighting was countered by the\napplication to his positions of a fire-power\nor a bomb-load of such a magnitude as would\nseem in a European theatre to be out of\nproportion to the objects it was hoped to\nachieve, having regard to the forces available.\n\n72. Such a concentration of bombs over\nany area held -by the enemy also helped in\nfinding an answer to the gift of the enemy\nfor camouflage and to the fact that the terrain\nlends itself to concealment. An area was\noften found to contain more bunkers than\n\neven the most careful and thorough recon-\n\nnaissance had disclosed. If these attacks were\nconfined to pinpoint bombing of those bunkers\nwhose existence was known, then when the\nbombing ceased and ground troops followed\nup, other enemy positions were found un-\ntouched by the bombardment. _ For instance,\nat Kyaukchaw, attacked on 17th January by\nheavy bombers, it was thought even a\nbombing had taken place that there were only\nthree bunkers, whereas there were actually\neight. Only complete saturation of an area\ncan ensure a chance of all bunkers being hit\nor the troops in them being at least held\ndown.\n\n73. The problem presented by the strength\nand depth of many of the enemy\u2019s bunker\npositions was never properly solved. The\n",

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT To tos LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\nbombs carried by light bombers and fighter-\nbombers did little damage unless they made\ndirect hits, and the use of medium and heavy\nbombers for the task was of necessity re-\nStricted. Moreover, when heavy attacks were\ncarried out with the help of the Strategic Air\nForce no really decisive success was achieved,\nand as yet the Army has not been able to\nmake an effective assault in conjunction with\nthese attacks. What advantage medium and\nheavy bombers have in the weight of their\nblow is offset \u2018by -their greater margin of\nbombing error, which makes it necessary to\nallow a safety margin and so forces\u2019 troops\nto start their assault at a greater distance from\ntheir objective than is the case with light\nbombers and fighter-bombers. A good ex-\nample of the difficulty of co-operation between\nheavy bombers and ground forces is given in\nthe operation at Razabil, which is described\nlater. Of such attacks, the Air Commander,\nThird Tactical Air Force, noted in his report\nfor this period: \u201cThe Army have not yet\nbeen able to carry out an effective assault\nin conjunction with these attacks.... How-\never, the accession of Mitchells in a forward\nlocation and under Third Tactical Air Force\nis expected to be a very considerable help in\nenabling us to put an adequate and timely\nweight of attack on . . . strongpoints \u201d.\n\n74, Another way in which such bombing\nassisted ground forces was in disclosing the\nenemy\u2019s positions by clearing thick under-\ngrowth from around them. This tactic was of\ngreat assistance to our artillery and tanks, but\nwas inclined to be a double-edged weapon in\nthe opinion of the infantry, since not only\nwas the enemy exposed to view, but their own\nline of advance was also stripped of cover\nso that they were forced to attack either at\nnight or by a flanking movement.\n\n75. The technique of air attack was deter-\nmined by the nature of the terrain in which\nthe target lay. Where thick jungle made\napproach necessary at a height sufficient to\nlocate the target by reference to its surround-\nings, then dive or shallow-dive-bombing was\nused. When the location of targets, as for\ninstance on the lines of communication, was\nnot so difficult, then low-level attacks could\nbe carried out. Dive-bombers therefore and\nfighter-bombers were used principally against\npin-points and specified areas, the ground\nattack fighters against concentrations of troops\nand supply dumps immediately to the rear.\n\n76. The results of attacks made in ground\nsupport could not always be observed from\nthe air, but an analysis of the reports of Army\nunits that followed up the attacks or watched\nthem as they took place, testifies to their\neffectiveness in terms of men and animals killed\nand positions weakened, if not destroyed.\nAlthough great destruction of life was not\nnecessarily the primary object of these attacks\nand was not always achieved, the Army was\nunanimous in its belief that the air support\ngiven helped it to advance when the initiative\nwas ours and to hold out and later counter-\nattack when the enemy were attacking. Army\nformations repeatedly expressed their thanks\nto the air force units that had helped them,\nand further tribute to the effectiveness of this\nsupport is to be found in many reports. One\nof these may be quoted as being typical of\nmany others: \u201c10th May air strike on\n\n1391\n\nJapanese in Lynch position (near Tengnoupal)\nreported by forward troops to be most success-\n\nBunkers were seen to be blown in and\nbodies flying about\u201d. This was the work of\ntwelve aircraft of No. 42 Squadron.\n\n77, A more intangible result of direct sup-\nport was the effect that it had on the morale\nof our troops. It was the opinion, for instance,\nof the Commander of the garrison at Kohima\nin April, that the audible and visible evidence\nof the arrival of air support on the two critical\ndays, the 15th and 18th April, put new heart\ninto his men towards the end of the siege.\nThe obverse side of the picture is given by\nptisoners of war who bore complete witness to\nthe effectiveness of our bombing and machine\ngunning.\n\n* * * * *\n\n78. In November and December, squadrons\ngave the limited scale of support called for\nby Fourteenth Army, which was then occupied\nin regrouping for forthcoming operations.\n\n79. In the 4 Corps area the enemy advanced\ninto the Chin Hills and occupied the line Fort\nWhite\u2014Falam\u2014Haka. They were held south\nof Tiddim, and both sides spent the rest of the\nyear consolidating their positions. ing this\nphase Nos. 45\u2018and 110 Vengeance Squadrons\ndid good work in direct support and in\ndestroying supply dumps particularly around\nthe area of Milestone 52 on the Tiddim\u2014\nKalemyo road.\n\n80. During the same period in the Arakan,\n15 Corps was also regrouping in preparation\nfor an advance, and many attacks were made\non enemy positions in order to inflict casualties\nand disperse enemy troops. Among the targets\nsuccessfully attacked were the Headquarters\nof the Japanese 55th Division at Rathedaung.\n\n81. In January the rate of effort increased\nto support the several intended thrusts forward.\n4 Corps took the offensive during this month,\nand on the 25th occupied Kyaukchaw in the\nAtwin Yomas, an enemy fortress that blocked\ntheir line of advance from Tamu to Yuwa on\nthe Chindwin. From the air point of view\nthis was the most interesting operation of the\nmonth, since the first ground assault was pre-\nceded by an air attack in which aircraft of\nboth the Strategic and Tactical Air Forces took\npart. Eighteen U.S. Liberators (B.24) and nine\nMitchells (B.25) escorted by R.A.F. fighters,\ndropped thirty-five tons of bombs including\ndepth-charges ; twenty-four Vengeances and\ntwelve Hurricanes dropped eighteen tons. The\nbombing was accurate and the whole area of\njungle and undergrowth was covered. On the\nother hand there were no direct hits on bunker\npositions, and the near misses did little damage\nto personnel or to positions. The attack too!\nplace at 16.30 hours in the afternoon, but the\nArmy did not advance until 08.30 hours the\nnext morning, by which time the effect of the\nbombing had mainly worn off. The unintended\nresult of the operation, therefore, was that the\nArmy\u2019s advance was made more difficult by\nthe lack of cover where blast had laid the\nundergrowth flat.\n\n82. Meanwhile in Arakan, 15 Corps had\nbegun to move forward shortly before\nChristmas towards the line Indin\u2014Kyauktaw.\nAt the beginning of January, Maungdaw was\ntaken and the approach towards the Maung-\ndaw\u2014Buthidaung road was continued till the\n",

The major part of the\navailable direct support effort was now being\nexpended on this front, and our advances at\nButhidaung and Maungdaw were both pre-\nceded by intensive dive-bombing of enemy\nstrongpoints. More than once the two\nVengeance squadrons, Nos. 82 and 8 LAF.,\nmounted nearly fifty sorties between them in a\nday. In the Arakan too this month, the\nStrategic Air Force took part in direct support\nbombing to clear a salient in anticipation of\nthe general advance. The target was a position\nnear Razabil, another enemy fortress, three\nmiles east of Maungdaw. The attack was\ncarried out by sixteen American Liberators\n(B.24) and ten Mitchells (B.25), with an escort\nof R.A.F. Spitfires and Hurricanes, preceded\nby twenty-four R.A.F. and LA.F. Vengeances\nwhich indicated the target. The majority of\nthe bombs fell in the area, one 2,000-Ib. bomb\nobliterating the top of a small hill containing\nenemy positions, but again there was an\nappreciable time lag before the Army moved\nto the assault, and the enemy appeared to have\nsuffered no appreciable or lasting damage from\nthe bombardment. The area of attack was\n1,000 by 600 yards and the bomb load 145,250\npounds. The target area was too large for the\nweight of the bombardment, and it is clear\nthat, to be really effective, future attacks will\nhave to be more concentrated.\n\n83. Early in February, the enemy, anticipat-\ning our intended offensive by four days, him-\nself attacked in the Arakan. His plan was to\nseparate 5 and 7 Indian Divisions, cut off their\noverland communications, and then destroy\nthem in detail. 224 Group, therefore, instead\nof assisting this offensive, found itself involved\nin a very grim defensive battle. The enemy\u2019s\nmove to outfank 7 Indian Division reached\nas far as Taung Bazaar, harried the whole\ntime by the two Vengeance squadrons.\nAlthough there was some difficulty in finding\ntargets in the battle areas, every opportunity\n\n. was taken to attack reported concentrations,\n\nbunkers and lines of communication. Over\n600 Vengeance and 800 Hurricane sorties\nwere directed to this end during the month.\n\n84. At the height of the battle, additional\nweight was lent to the support given the ground\ntroops by the employment of Wellingtons,\ncarrying 4,000-lb. bombs, from Nos. 99 and\n215 Squadrons in a tactical r\u00e9le. Targets in-\ncluded enemy headquarters at Godusara and\nRathedaung, and enemy-held villages were\nreported completely devastated. In addition\none operation with R.A.F. fighter escort was\ncarried out, with excellent results, by nine\nMitchells (B.25) of No. 490 U.S. Squadron\nagainst the entrances to the tunnels on the\nMaungdaw-Buthidaung road.\n\n85. By the 4th March the battle in Arakan\nhad been brought to a successful conclusion.\nThere is little doubt that our overall air\nsupremacy was largely responsible for this,\nsince it enabled transport aircraft to drop food\nand ammunition to 7 Indian Division, which\ncould not otherwise have maintained the fight,\nthe Strategic Air Force to lend its weight\nagainst tactical targets, and the close-support\nsquadrons to break up many attacks, to main-\ntain a constant harassing of the enemy\u2019s line\nof communication, and to pin him down in his\nbunkers while our own troops moved in de-\n\nSUPPLEMENT to rHs LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\nployment or attack. Air Commandez, Third\nTactical Air Force, commenting on operations\nin this area, says \u201cIt is interesting to note that\nin 15 Corps support was allied with artillery\nrather more than infantry H.Q. This was con-\nsidered by the Corps to be more satisfactory\nin that gunners are more used to thinking in\nterms of supporting fire... .\u201d ;\n\n86. In the first few days of March the enemy\nlaunched an offensive across the Chindwin on\nthe 4 Corps front. This was not unexpected.\nDuring February he had shown increased\nactivity on the east bank of the river, and\nattacks had been made by Vengeances and\nfighter-bombers on enemy storage areas along\nthe river as far north as the Uyu river and\nupon small vessels and concentrations of rafts\non the Chindwin. The battle in Arakan had\nprecluded any large reinforcement of the\nImphal Plain, although during the preparations\nfor operation \u201cThursday\u201d it became evident\nthat the enemy\u2019s preparations threatened\nImphal and the Assam railway. It was indeed\na question which only events would resolve,\nwhether the fly-in or the enemy\u2019s offensive\nwould start first. As it happened, although the\nfirst enemy units crossed the Chindwin on the\nnight of the 7/8th March, the fly-in was begun\non the 5/6th, in sufficient time to release im-\nportant air resources for dealing with the new\nsituation. Had the reverse been the case, the\ndemands of defence and counter-attack against\nthe enemy\u2019s thrust and of support for the fly-in\ncould not both have been fully met. The brunt\nof air support was now switched from the 15\nCorps to the 4 Corps front.\n\n87. The Army\u2019s intention was, in the event\nof Long Range Penetration Brigades creating\na favourable situation, to push forces across the\nChindwin. To give air support to these forces\nairfields had been developed in forward areas,\nincluding one as far forward as Tamu. Now,\nhowever, instead of fighting in support of an\noffensive, direct support squadrons again found\nthemselves taking part in a defensive battle,\nand Tamu itself was overrun.\n\n88. Having crossed the Chindwin the enemy\npushed onwards towards Imphal by the Tamu\nand Tiddim roads, and towards Kohima\nthrough the Somra hill tracts and from Homa-\nJin via Ukhrul. Air support to meet the threat\nwas provided to the maximum from the re-\nsources available, the two Vengeance squad-\ntons already on this front being joined by No.\n82 Squadron from the Arakan and, towards the\nend of the month, by No. 7 IA.F. Squadron.\nThere was also at this time a welcome increase\nin the number of Hurricane squadrons\nequipped to carry bombs. No. 42 Squadron\nhad been so equipped since January, No. 34\nsince the end of February ; now, at the end of\nMarch, No. 60 and No. 113 Squadrons, too,\nbegan to carry out bombing operations.\n\n89. In April Kohima was __ seriously\nthreatened as well as Imphal, and support was\nconsequently divided between 4 and 33 Corps,\nalthough till May the greater part of the effort\nwas centred around Imphal. \u2018The four Hurri-\ncane fighter-bomber squadrons flew over 2,200\nsorties, the majority of which were in the\nChurachandpur area,.on the Imphal-Tiddim\nroad, against the road block set up at Kangla-\ntongbi on the Imphal-Kohima road, against\nconcentrations of enemy troops attempting to\n",

The four Vengeance squad-\nrons flew over 2,000 sorties during this month.\nTheir bombing was extremely accurate, and\nin addition to direct support tasks they\nattacked enemy dumps and camps. On the\n8th April No. 82 Squadron carried out its\nJast operations on this front and then rejoined\nNo. 224 Group. Over 750 sorties were flown\nby Hurricanes in offensive sorties against fleet-\ning targets and troop positions.\n\n90. In May, direct support operations centred\naround Kohima, where the town itself and the\nAradura Spur to the south were eventually\ncleared of the enemy after intensive attacks\nby Vengeances and Hurricane fighter-bombers\nagainst bunker positions and slit trenches. To\nthe south of Imphal, where the enemy made\nseveral attacks on the Tiddim road from the\nwest and also on Bishenpur, fighter-bombers\nand ground-attack fighters attacked concentra-\ntions of enemy troops and vehicles. Further\nsouth on the Tiddim road, Moirang was also\nattacked by fighter-bombers and Vengeances.\n\ning this month Vengeances flew over 1,000\nsorties on the 4 and 33 Corps fronts and Hurri-\ncane fighter-bombers 1.693.\n\n91. In this battle the Strategic Air Force\nagain assisted With its heavier striking power.\nIn May the Wellingtons of Nos. 99 and 215\nSquadrons flew 125 sorties against tactical tar-\ngets, American Liberators (B.24) 12, and\nMitchells (B. 25) 106. Apart from one attack\non the Mintha-Tamu road, the whole of this\neffort was made against targets on the Imphal-\nTiddim road, especially in the neighbourhood\nof milestones 120 and 87, two points of great\ntactical importance in preventing enemy rein-\nforcements from coming up the road. Attacks\nagainst enemy strongholds included one against\nthe village of Ningthoukhong, which was accu-\ntately bombed by forty-eight Wellingtons and\nMitchells (B.25) on the 9th May. Once again,\nhowever, the enemy withstood the effects of\nthe bombardment and was able to repulse the\nsubsequent assault by ground troops.\n\n92. The enemy\u2019s efforts to deploy in the\nImphal Piain during the month were decisively\ndefeated by the Hurricanes and Vengeances\nwhich attacked at extremely short intervals\nany concentrations in the foothills reported by\nground troops through the Army Air Support\nControl operating at a high standard of effi-\nciency. By the end of the month, Fourteenth\nArmy were going over to the offensive and it\nwas possible to predict that the threat to\nImphal had been averted. Constant attacks\non the tracks through the jungle which served\nas his Lines of Communication had prevented\nthe enemy bringing his full potential strength\nup to the perimeter of the plain, and the effec-\ntiveness of air attack in thick jungle had im-\npressed on him the futility of advancing over\nopen country without overwhelming forces.\nThe attacker was becoming the attacked ; the\nperiod of attrition and defence was over, and\nthe squadrons supporting 4 and 33 Corps could\nlook forward to the prize for which all air\nforces hope\u2014the annihilation of an enemy in\nretreat.\n\n93. Positive results in the form of men\nkilled, storage areas devastated, and transport\ndestroyed are hard to achieve against an enemy\n\n1393\n\nwith such a high standard of camouflage and\nconcealment who, when on the offensive, moves\nin small groups with little impedimenta. No\narmy can maintain its standard of camouflage\nin retreat, however, and as this despatch is\nbeing written, the air forces in this theatre are\nproving again what has been and is being\ndemonstrated in every other theatre of war,\nthat an enemy experiencing overwhelming pres-\nsure from advancing ground forces provides\nthe best targets for air attack. The experience\ngained by Army Commanders, who have come\nto realise, the limitations and Possibilities of air\nsupport during the period of trial, is now pay-\ning full dividends, the results of which should\nform an impressive achievement during the\nmonsoon operations now beginning.\n\n94. During these six and a half months the\nAmerican squadrons of the Northern Air Sec-\ntor Force had, as their primary task, the main-\ntenance of the air superiority necessary to\nguarantee the safety of the air route to China\nand of the bases of the Air Transport Com-\nmand. They were also, however, responsible\nfor giving air support to General Stilwell\u2019s\nChinese-American Forces in their advance\ndown the Ledo Road, which culminated in the\nassaults on Kamaing, Mogaung, and Myitkyina.\n\n95. By February the ground forces had suc-\ncessfully advanced as far as Maingkwan in\nthe Hukawng Valley, and the Mustangs and\nKittyhawks comprising the force had given\nvaluable support in the form of attacks against\ncamps, concentrations of troops, M.T. and\nstores, both in the valley and along the road\nfrom Kamaing to Mogaung. The work of\nground attack squadrons in sweeps along the\nflanks of the road was reported by prisoners\nof war as particularly effective. Liberators\n(B.24) and Mitchells (B.25) were also used in\nattacks on this sector of the front, dropping\n155 tons of bombs on Kamaing, 93 on\nMogaung and 40 on Myitkyina. This support\ncontinued when the Hukawng Valley had been\nleft behind, and by the end of the period\ncovered by this despatch Mogaung was being\ninvested by ground forces and the main strip\nat Myitkyia, taken on 17th May, was in the.\nhands of the N.A.S.F., forming a potential\nadvanced all-weather base.\n\n*- * * * * *\n\nV.\u2014ATTACKS ON COMMUNICATIONS\n\n96. The comparative lack in Burma of large\nstatic targets suitable for heavy bombers has\nbeen offset by the extreme vulnerability of the\nJapanese lines of communication. No. 27\nSquadron, R.A.F., has been operating on Beau-\nfighters against these communications since\nJanuary, 1943, and No. 177 Squadron, R.AF.,\nsimilarly equipped, from September of the\nsame year. As a result of their persistent and\nubiquitous attacks, both by day and by night,\nthe enemy has been driven to remove the main\nweight of his transport from road to river and\nfrom river to rail. His major movements have\nbeen restricted to the hours of darkness, and\nfor protection during daylight he has been com-\npelled to resort to an ingenious and complex\nsystem of camouflage coupled with the estab-\nlishment of an extensive network of gun posts\nas a supplement to his more orthodox anti-\naircraft defences. The Taungup Pass road,\nthe shipping on the Irrawaddy, the Ye-u and\nMyitkyina railway lines, as examples, have long\n",

This did\nnot diminish the importance of the routes of\nNorthern and Western Burma, but it did bring\ninto strategical prominence their relationship to\nthese routes from the south and east. New\nobjectives such as the railway junction at\nThanbyuzayat, the ferry termini at Moulmein\nand Martaban, the bridge over the Sittang\nriver at Mokpalin and in general the railway\nsystem north. south and east of the all-\nimportant junction at Pegu became of cardinal\nsignificance.\n\n97. The armament of the Beaufighters of\nNos, 27 and 177 Squadrons, consisting of four\n20 mm. cannon and six machine guns, proved\nvery suitable weapons for attacking the river-\ncraft, motor transport, rolling stock and loco-\nmotives on these routes. They first reached\nMoulmein on 27th February; thereafter they\nregularly attacked targets as far south and east\nas the Burma-Siam railway itself, and the\nterminus of the main Siamese railway to\nBangkok at Chiengmai.\n\n98. In January, 1944, a third squadron of\nBeaufighters (No. 211) began to operate under\nmy command using rocket projectiles (R-Ps.).\nThe enemy had by this time instituted a system\nof pens and shelters to protect his locomotives,\nand although a target thus protected was\nimmune from cannon and machine-gun fire,\nit was often vulnerable to R.P. attacks. Another\ndevelopment rendered the advent of rocket\nprojectiles even more timely. The opening of\nthe Burma-Siam railway now allowed the\nJapanese to bring replacement engines into\nBurma by this quick and easy route. Accord-\ningly, the emphasis of attack was moved to\nthe more permanent installations on Burmese\nand Siamese railway systems, since the destruc-\ntion or damaging of locomotives was not now\nso serious to him. In attacks on stations, water-\ntowers, curved portions of the track which\ncould not easily be replaced, and bridges, the\nrocket projectile proved a valuable supplement\nto existing weapons,\n\n99, The delay fuse which was all that was\navailable with which to arm R.P.s was soon\nfound to be unsuitable for attacks on bridges,\nand their destruction was left more and more\nto bomb-carrying aircraft of both the Strategic\nand Tactical Air Forces. I have dealt in more\ndetail with this aspect of strategic bombers\u2019\nwork in the section devoted to their activities.\nIn attacks by tactical aircraft the long range of\nMustangs (P.51) and Lightnings (P.38) was ex-\nPloited to the full. The Shweli suspension\nbridge for example had often been attacked\nby bombers but its position rendered bombing\nfrom any height difficult. Fighter-bomber\nattack was not possible until the long-range\nMustangs (P.51Bs) of No. 1 Air Commando\nUnit arrived. Immediately after their arrival\nthe bridge was destroyed by them in April and\nits emergency replacement a fortnight later.\nOther attacks on communications by Mustangs\n(P.51) and Lightnings (P.38) included many\nagainst the vital Mandalay-Myitkyina railway\nparticularly on the section between Shwebo\nand Wuntho which fed both the divisions\nattacking Imphal and the forces opposing\nSpecial Force.\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\n100. Although not primarily intended for\nattack on rivercraft, the 40 mm. cannon, with\nwhich the Hurricane IIDs of No. 20 Squadron\nwere fitted, did great damage to hundreds of\nassorted craft with which the enemy supplied\nhis forces dispersed among the waterways of\nthe Arakan coast. This squadron began to\noperate in December, 1943, using A.P. shells.\nIn February, H.E. ammunition became avail-\nable and the rate of destruction increased.\nCraft when holed could no Ionger be beached,\nbut disintegrated in the water, with the inevit-\nable instead of occasional loss of their cargo.\nWhen, finally, aircraft with additional internal\ntankage arrived, the effective radius of attack\nwas extended south of Akyab, and the rate of\ndestruction. reached a peak which seriously\nhindered the reinforcement and supply of all\nJapanese forces occupying the coastal region\nfrom Cheduba Island northwards to the front\nline, a distance of roughly 150 miles.\n\n101. The damage and hindrance that the\nenemy suffered from these widespread attacks\nare hard to assess, but one criterion of their\neffectiveness was the energy with which the\nJapanese attempted to defend their communi-\ncations. The statistics show that in 1,276 effec-\ntive sorties by R.A.F. long-range fighter air-\ncraft, 35 were destroyed by enemy action or\ndid not return from operations, and 29 were\nseriously damaged by enemy fire, but no\nstatistical summary can adequately record all\nthe damage and delay that the enemy suffered.\nFor example, it was estimated that in April\nreinforcem\u00e9nts travelling from Bangkok to\nManipur took six weeks to reach their\ndestination.\n\n* * * = * *\n\u2018VI.\u2014GENERAL RECONNAISSANCE\nControl and Planning.\n\n102. The vast areas of ocean for which air-\ncraft in this Command were responsible in\nNovember precluded the density of patrol that\nwas desirable. Moreover, it was difficult to\nmaintain a sufficiently close liaison with those\nformations responsible for the security of sea\ncommunications in neighbouring areas. In\nDecember, however, a new directive from the\nChiefs of Staff enabled a more clear-cut policy\nto be introduced and better defined the system\nof control and responsibility. The boundaries\nof the Naval C.-in-C.\u2019s Command were ex-\ntended to include Aden. This facilitated co-\noperation with coastal aircraft there, which\nwere, in the interests of consistency, to come\nunder my command. I thus became respon-\nsible for all flying boats, G.R. landplane and\ncoastal striking force units allotted for opera-\ntions in the Indian Ocean, the Mozambique\nChannel, the Gulf of Aden, the Gulf of Oman\nand the Bay of Bengal. Day-to-day opera-\ntional and administrative control! remained\nwith the A.O.C. in whose command the air-\ncraft were located. Broad control was nor-\nmally to be exercised through A.O.C, 222\nGroup, who was to work in close liaison with\nthe appropriate Naval authorities and South\nAfrican Air authorities. Thus A.O.C. 222\nGroup had a dual responsibility, combining\nwith the command of his own Group the\norganisation and direction of all G.R. opera-\ntions in the Indian Ocean. To aid him in this\nlatter task a new body was formed\u2014Indian\nOcean G.R. Operations, or \u201c IOGROPS \u201d\u2014\nwith a Deputy A.O.C. and separate staff.\n",

In order to make the best use of the\nrelatively few aircraft available to patrol these\nareas, a new policy was introduced with the\nobject of making G.R. forces as mobile as\npossible and to concentrate in areas where\nsubmarines were known or suspected to be. In\naddition, the generous allotment of air escort\nto convoys in areas where no threat existed\nwas reduced to the minimum, and flying hours\nwere thereby conserved for concentrated action\nwhere necessary.\n\n104. C.-in-C. Eastern Fleet is in complete\nagreement with this policy and co-operates to\nthe fullest extent.\n\n105. The concentrations of aircraft needed\nto implement the policy and carry out inten-\nsive patrols when necessary demand consider-\nable shuttling of aircraft between bases. These\nmovements are used to good effect by routeing\nthe aircraft over shipping lanes so that they\nmay carry out traffic patrols while in transit.\n\n106. One of the first tasks carried out by\n\u201cTOGROPS\u201d was an investigation of the\npractical application of the system used in the\nAtlantic, by which air cover is given to ship-\nping in accordance with the degree of risk\nand the value of the convoy. By the standards\nof this procedure\u2014known as \u201c Stipple \u201d\u2014the\nwastage in flying hours during May was\nassessed as follows:\n\nPer\n\ncent.\n(a) Aden area _.. wee we 17\n(6) East Africa... we ws 59\n(c) 225 Group... we wes 55\n(d) 222Group) www 23\n\n107.

A decrease in enemy submarine activity\nin November \u2018permitted a reduction in air\nescorts and a subsequent saving in aircraft\nours.\n\n110. The lull was utilised to carry out a\nmore intensive training programme as a neces-\nsary initiation for No. 203 Wellington Squad-\nton, newly arrived at Santa Cruz; and as a\nrefresher for the other squadrons already\noperational but in need of training to fit them\nfor their more versatile work in the revised\npolicy of mobility and aggression then being\nintroduced. | Otherwise, traffic patrols and\nshipping escorts were the main features of G.R.\nactivity. .\n\n111.

December opened with considerable\nactivity and movement of G.R. aircraft in\norder to protect large shipping movements in\nthe Bay of Bengal. To relieve the congestion\non the Bengal communications system,\nFourteenth Army were to be reinforced from\neast coast ports, and extensive patrols were\nprovided to cover the entire eastern approaches\nto the Bay of Bengal. This involved a large-\nscale and rapid movement of forces over dis-\ntances varying from 1,000 to 1,400 miles to\nconcentrate suitable aircraft in strategic posi-\ntions.\n\n113. Round-the-clock patrols began at first\nlight on the 6th and finished at midday on the\n9th as the ships reached Chittagong. The re-\ndeployment between Groups, and the conduct\nof the operation were notable for the high\nstate of efficiency and serviceability main-\ntained. During the operation there was only\none sighting of a submarine, thought to be a\nJapanese of the \u201cI\u201d class. Unfortunately the\nCatalina was not positioned for an immediate\nattack and further searches failed to locate the\nenemy again. Two enemy aircraft were sighted\nover the Bay of Bengal but were not allowed to\ncome within range of the surface vessels.\n\n114. On the 23rd December the enemy tor-\npedoed the ss. Peshawar in convoy off the\nThe attack was\nmade in perfect weather at midday and while\na Catalina was escorting. This was the first\nexample of such an attack while escort was\nprovided. Continuous day and night cover\nand a hunt to exhaustion was instituted, but\napart from a report from the same convoy on\nthe 25th, which caused an extension of the\nair cover, no other sightings were made.\n\n115. On the 27th, H.M.I.S. BERAR (escort\nvessel) carried out a submarine attack near\nthe south-west tip of India without any known\nresult. A Catalina of 225 Group witnessed\nthe attacks, and the detailed report and photo-\ngraphs taken by the aircraft's crew were of\ngreat value in assessing the results. Further\nsouth-west, on the same day, a merchant vessel\nwas torpedoed, and to counter the threat to\nthe many convoys in these waters, Catalinas\nwere moved from Ceylon to Kelai, and Addu\nAtoll was reinforced.\n\n116. Since commitments in 222 Group were\nheavy, especially in affording air cover to units\nof the growing Eastern Fleet, Beauforts were\nused to escort coastal convoys, and long-range\naircraft reserved for the forward island bases\nand the Australia-Colombo convoys.\n\n117. During this month No. 354 Liberator\n(B.24) Squadron took over the G.R. patrols\npreviously flown by Wellington medium-\nbomber squadrons, and extended them to\ncover the N.E. Bay of Bengal, and the Arakan\ncoastal areas. No sightings of enemy surface\nor underwater forces were made during these\npatrols, but this did not detract from their\nvalue as negative reconnaissance. Several\nsmall craft off the Arakan coast were attacked\nand sunk with bombs and gunfire.\n\n118. The early part of January was con-\nspicuous for the dearth of enemy activity in\nsouthern and eastern waters, in spite of the\n",

One U-boat was known\nto be in the Maldives area, and on the 16th\nanother made an attack off Pondicherry, sink-\ning one vessel. A Catalina assisted in the\nrescue work, but the offensive anti-submarine\nsearch which was immediately instituted\nproved fruitless. What was probably the\nsame submarine was sighted and attacked by\na Catalina of No. 240 Squadron returning from\na convoy escort on the 22nd. Probable\ndamage was done in spite of the difficult con-\nditions of light and angle of attack, and a\nhunt to exhaustion was immediately initiated\nusing Catalinas of both 225 and 222 Groups.\nThe enemy was not destroyed, although depth-\ncharges were dropped on a possible sighting,\nand no further attacks were made on convoys\nin the area.\n\n119. 225 Group aircraft continued to search\nfor the submarine until after dawn on the\n25th, but the 222 Group detachment returned\nto Ceylon to provide cover for units of Eastern\nFleet. Beauforts carried out anti-submarine\nsweeps in front of Trincomalee harbour, while\nthe Catalinas escorted the arriving ships to\nport.\n\n120. In spite of defensive air patrols, one\nindependently routed merchant vessel was\nsunk in the Maldives area, but aircraft again\nlocated survivors and guided a cruiser to the\nspot.\n\n121. Considering the great amount of ship-\nping activity, the month witnessed compara-\ntively few attacks. It is probable, however,\nthat enemy submarines were being employed\non reconnaissance, particularly of the growing\nconcentration of naval forces. There is no\ndoubt that the provision of patrols and escorts\nof the greatest density possible with the forces\navailable was responsible for denying to these\nenemy reconnaissance submarines much useful\ninformation.\n\n122. In February the number of enemy sub-\nmarines estimated to be in the Indian Ocean\nrose to ten, and patrol activity was intensified\nto meet the threat. It became necessary to\naugment air cover for the threatened areas\naround Ceylon with Catalinas and Wellingtons\nfrom 225 Group. Sinkings were heavy during\nthe month, but one submarine was destroyed\nby escort vessels with the co-operation of the\ncovering aircraft, and another, after it had\nsunk H.M.T. KHEDIVE ISMAIL, by H.M.\ndestroyers who were guarding the troopship in\nsuch a strength that no air escort was deemed\nnecessary.\n\n123. The sinkings necessitated many rescue\noperations by aircraft, and the survivors of\nthree ships were located and covered while\nsurface craft were guided to them. The out-\nstanding rescue was that of survivors of a ship\ntorpedoed fourteen days earlier 800 miles from\nthe mainland.\n\n124. The other major operation of the\nmonth, which absorbed a considerable number\nof aircraft hours, was the cover given to a\nslow-moving floating dock from Bombay to\nTrincomalee\u2014cover which would probably not\nhave been afforded had the \u201cStipple\u201d pro-\ncedure been in force.\n\n125. Towards the end of February there\n\narose a potential threat to the east coast of -\n\nIndia from the move of a considerable portion\n\nSUPPLEMENT To tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\nof the Japanese Fleet to Singapore. Plans\nwere laid for the assembly and despatch of\nair striking forces including all heavy bomber\nsquadrons should the occasion arise. Bases\nin Southern India and Ceylon were prepared\nand stocked for the possible advent of large\nforces from Bengal, and No. 200 (Liberator\nG.R.) Squadron from West Africa and No. 47\n(Torpedo) Beaufighter Squadron from the\nMediterranean arrived as reinforcements. No.\n27 (Coastal Fighter) Beaufighter Squadron was\ndetached from Bengal to work with No. 47\nSquadron at Madras. The threat did not\nmaterialise but the organisation built up has\nbeen retained in skeleton form.\n\n126. March witnessed a peak of activity\nwhich began on the first of the month with a\nhunt to exhaustion following the sinking of a\nmerchant vessel twenty-five miles south-west\nof Galle. In the forty-fourth hour of the\nsearch a Catalina sighted and attacked a sur-\nfaced submarine by moonlight. The enemy\nU-boat was not seen after the attack, and\nalthough it was probably damaged the search\nwas continued for two more days.\n\n127. Further enemy attacks resulted in two\nsinkings in the Arabian Sea, four in more\nsoutherly waters, and one of a troopship in\nthe northern Bay of Bengal, an area hitherto\nalmost completely immune from submarine\nattacks. There were regrettable delays in re-\nporting the sinking, and thus the assembling\nof forces to search for the submarine, but the\nlimited number of aircraft available to 173\nWing which controlled the area, eked out by\nBeaufighters from 224 Group, carried out a\nmodified search until the arrival of reinforce-\nments. The flying effort and quick turn round\nof the few aircraft available, however, was\nparticularly creditable, one Liberator of No.\n354 Squadron being airborne again forty-seven\nminutes after landing.\n\n128. No. 230 (Sunderland) Squadron arrived\nin the Command during March, but it did not\nbegin to operate fully until later, since lack\nof spares kept its serviceability low.\n\n129. In April the number of submarines\noperating in the Indian Ocean fell to an esti-\nmated two. One was believed to be in the\nMaldives area and the other to be operating\non the trade routes between Freemantle and\nColombo, out of range of aircraft operating\nfrom the Maldives. Beaufort aircraft were\nthus employed on coastal convoy escort, and\nlong-range aircraft were held at Ceylon in\nreadiness for a threat further afield. No ships\nwere sunk in the waters around India during\nthe month, and the gradual change-over from\nthe defensive to the offensive was symbolised\nin this month by the successful escort pro-\nvided to Eastern Fleet in their strike with\ncarrier-borne aircraft against Sabang in North-\nWest Sumatra.\n\n130. In May, Eastern Fleet was again\ncovered during its journey to and from Soura-\nbaya. During the month, it became possible\nto discontinue the Arakan coast patrols. No\nsightings of any importance had been made\nin the six months that the patrols had been\ncarried out, and the continued absence of a\nthreat in this area now allowed of a diversion\nof these aircraft to more positive work.\n\n131. The loss of Liberators (B.24) engaged\non photographic reconnaissance of the\nAndamans, Nicobars and North Sumatra led\n",

Twenty-six sorties were flown\nfrom Ceylon to the Andaman Islands, Car\nNicobar, Simalur, and Northern Sumatra. Con-\nclusive evidence was obtained on these flights\nthat the enemy employ in this theatre beam-\nswept radar of the type found on Attu and\nGuadalcanal. At the end of April the air-\ncraft were transferred from Ceylon to Bengal\nin order to operate along the Burma coastline\nand in the Bangkok area, but the results of\ntheir investigations have not been sufficiently\nconclusive to be included in this despatch.\n\n132. Searches carried out by coastal aircraft\nduring the period assisted in the location and\nrescue of a total of 535 survivors from tor-\npedoed vessels in the waters around India.\n\n133. The results of coastal activity are\nseldom tangible, and an account of the work\nof forces engaged on this work must of neces-\nsity draw attention to those occasions when the\nenemy\u2019s positive attacks overcame the efforts of\nnegative reconnaissance. Stich attacks in the\narea patrolled by India and Ceylon-based air-\ncraft did not and could not meet with sufficient\nreaction to provide a continual deterrent to the\nenemy\u2019s intrusions, nor was the rate of destruc-\ntion of submarines high enough to prove a\nserious obstacle to him, since the maximum\nforces available in India and Ceylon during\nthe period consisted of ten long-range and\nthree medium-range squadrons.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nVII.\u2014PHOTOGRAPHIC RECONNAISSANCE\n\n134. In November it was the intention that\nNo. 681 and 684 P.R. Squadrons should\neventually come under the control of Strategic\nAir Force. To this end No. 171 Wing, which\nhad originally been formed as a Tactical Re-\nconnaissance Wing, was moved from Southern\nIndia to take over administrative and opera-\ntional control. The 9th P.R. Squadron,\nUS.A.AF., was still under the control of\n10th U.S. Army Air Force.\n\n135. No really long-range reconnaissance\nhad been carried out by this time, since No.\n684 Squadron had only recently received\nMosquitoes, and there had not been time to\nexplore the potentialities of this aircraft under\ntropical conditions. The radius of P.R. cover\non the Ist December, excluding the Andaman\nIslands, was only 680 miles. On 15th\nDecember the first cover of Bangkok was\nobtained and provided much valuable informa-\ntion regarding Japanese dispositions and their\nuse of lay-back airfields. Although Bangkok\nis now a routine target, the sortie was at\nthat time an outstanding achievement, since the\nrange of the Mosquito in this climate was still\nundetermined.\n\n136. At this time the main r\u00e9le of the two\nsquadrons was to provide airfield cover for\naircraft counts, to photograph communications\nand areas indicated by the Army, and to cover\npotential target areas for attacks in Burma.\nTwice weekly sorties were flown to Port Blair\nin the Andamans to secure information on the\nenemy\u2019s anti-shipping activities. In January\none of the few Mitchells (B.25) belonging to\nNo. 684 Squadron photographed Mergui on\nthe Tenasserim Coast for the first time, involv-\ning a journey of 1,600 miles. Survey photo-\ngraphy was also begun during the month to\n\n(11548)\n\n1397\n\nmeet a long-felt need for accurate and up-to-\ndate maps of Burma. By the end of May, not\nonly immediate battle areas had been sur-\nveyed, but also approximately 57 per cent. of\nthe whole of the country. The remainder of\nthe effort was absorbed in assessing the extent\nto which communication facilities were being\nused and the damage inflicted upon them. The\nrecord number of eighty airfields were covered.\nin one day, as was the greater part of the\nBurma railway system, allowing of an accurate\naircraft count and a reliable estimate of the\nengines and rolling-stock in the country. An-\nother valuable result of the large-scale airfield\ncover was the issue of target mosaics to long-\nrange fighter squadrons, which proved of great\n\nassistance, especially when airfields were\nattacked.\n137. Meanwhile,\u2019 the American PR.\n\nsquadron equipped with Lightnings (F.5) was\nstill working independently. This often re-\nsulted in duplication of effort, and closer co-\nordination was clearly desirable. Thus on the\nIst February, Photographic Reconnaissance\nForce was formed, incorporating No. 171 Wing\nHeadquarters. This month and March were\nnotable for many sorties to obtain airfield in-\nformation and to assess the damage to com-\nmunications by aircraft of Third Tactical Air\nForce and No. 1 Air Commando Force.\nSurvey work was also carried out, together\nwith regular flights to the Andamans and the\nvast area bounded by a line joining Kentung,\nSittang, Mergui and Koh Si Chang Island\n(South-East of Bangkok).\n\n138. Small country-craft were now being\nincreasingly used by the enemy, and the water-\nways of the Arakan and Central Burma were\nalso frequently photographed to assess the\ndensity of traffic and staging points. On\n27th March the longest flight yet, of 1,860\nmiles, was achieved by a Mosquito of No. 684\nSquadron when a large stretch of the Bangkok-\nSingapore railway was covered.\n\n139. In April a substantial increase in the\nnumber of Army requests entailed numerous\nsorties over the battle and reinforcement areas,\nA Mosquito improved upon the record flight\nof the previous month by photographing many\nstretches of railway in the Malay Peninsula,\nflying 2,172 miles to do so.\n\n140. The advent of the monsoon affected\nphotographic reconnaissance work perhaps\nmore than any. In May, instead of concentrat-\ning on the programmes laid down, it became\na question of finding areas where the weather\nwas best and photographing the highest\npriority targets in them.\n\n141. The outstanding achievement of the\nmonth was the photography of islands in the\nGreat Nicobar group. The flight was intended\nto discover if it were possible to reach these\nislands, but on arrival there was sufficient fuel\nTemaining to take photographs before return-\ning. Short-range squadrons during May\nobtained routine cover wherever possible and\nwere also instructed to bring back as full a\nweather report as possible, which proved valu-\nable in planning the next day\u2019s sorties. Only\nthree of the twenty-three sorties flown on\nsurvey photography were wholly successful. An\nidea of the achievement in the field of survey\nphotography before the bad weather is shown\nby the following figures, which represent the\n\nB\n",

A high standard of\nphotography and technical work was\nmaintained.\n\n* * * * *\n\nPART THREE\n\nSurvEY OF RESULTS AND Lessons LEARNED\n143. Although territorial gains in the cam-\npaign until the end of May were small, the\nground won back from the enemy in Northern\nBurma marked the first step towards the re-\nopening of overland communications with\nChina. The advance of the Chinese-American\nforces, and the disruption of enemy communi-\ncations by Special Force which aided it,\nwould have been impossible without the air\nsuperiority which had been gained, allowing\nthe free use of transport support aircraft and\nof fighters and bombers in close support. The\nsame is true of both the less positive achieve-\nments of the campaign, the breaking of two\nlarge-scale enemy offensives\u2014one aimed at\nChittagong and the other at Imphal. Of the\nattack on Imphal, C.-in-C. 11 Army Group\nstated: \u201cThere is absolutely no doubt that\nhad we not had air supply we should have\nlost the Imphal Plain, and the position on\nthe eastern frontier of India would have been\nvery grave\u201d. He might with equal truth have\nsaid \u201cHad we not had air superiority \u201d.\n\n144. The campaign established that the em-\nployment of air transport in this theatre is\ncapable of indefinite expansion, and yields\ndividends that could not be gained by any\nother agency. Moreover, there is scope for a\nwider range of transport aircraft than obtains\nin Europe, where thick jungle and high moun-\ntain barriers do not impede swift communica-\ntion. Light aircraft which can land in a space\ntoo small for Dakotas are able to carry out\na multitude of tasks for commanders, and, by\neliminating the feeling of isolation brought on\nwhen fighting so far from established bases,\nhave a beneficial effect on the morale of the\ntorces engaged.\n\n145. Close support of ground troops in such\nterrain has proved the value of accurate bomb\nand gun attacks in a locality where pin-points\nare few and targets difficult to identify, re-\nquiring a thorough knowledge of the sector.\nSuch knowledge is clearly of special signi-\nficance in this theatre. Air liaison officers when\nbriefing crews can give targets that would\noften be refused in other theatres as too diffi-\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\ncult for identification. The same is true of\ndropping zones for. supply-dropping aircraft.\nCrews and staff officers from the European\ntheatre of operations state that the dropping\npoints given here would be considered im-\npossible there. Thus, complete familiarity with\nthe area over which they have to operate has\nbeen found essential for crews engaged in\nground or transport support work.\n\n146. I have discussed the complexities of\nclose support in Burma in the section dealing\nwith that type of operation. Certain con-\nclusions follow that are worthy of note. First,\nunless used in overwhelming strength, the heavy\nbomber is no more the answer against an\nentrenched enemy than has been found in other\ntheatres. Secondly, if air bombardment on a\nheavy scale is used, the infantry must follow\nthe attack immediately in order that the limited\neffect on the enemy is not lost before the attack\ngoes in. Thirdly, specialised trials are neces-\nsary to determine the best types of bombs\nfor use against jungle targets. These are\nnow being carried out in this Command.\nFinally, the fighter-bomber and the dive-\nbomber, with their extreme accuracy, proved\nexcellent aircraft in close support in difficult\nterrain. The Hurricane, for example, could\nbe employed against targets in valleys hemmed\nin by cloud, conditions that demanded high\nmanoeuvrability if the target was to be\nreached at all. Comparable aircraft of higher\nperformance and with the ability to carry a\ngreater weight of bombs should prove an even\nmore decisive weapon.\n\n147. In combating the Japanese Air Force,\nthe lack of long-range fighters was acutely\nfelt until Mustangs (P.51) and Lightnings (P.38)\nof the U.S.A.A.F. became available. Once our\nair superiority was established in the forward\nareas the enemy utilised bases too far away\nfor normal-range aircraft to reach them. I\nhave recounted later how it was that pres-\nsurised long-range tanks were not yet ready\nfor the Spitfires, which could not therefore be\nused in the r\u00e9le of long-range counter air\noffensive. In this theatre, where distances are\nso great and the enemy so widely dispersed,\nlong-range fighters are essential both for escort\nand offensive operations.\n\n148. Finally, it has been proved in this\ntheatre as in others that air power is co-equal\nwith land power, and that Army and Air Com-\nmanders should work from. a Joint Head-\nquarters if they are effectively to implement\nthe principles of command required by a com-\nbined Army/Air Plan. It is according to this\nbroad principle, which has been agreed with\nthe General Officer Commanding-in-Chief 11\nArmy Group and approved by the Supreme\nAllied Commander, that future air operations\nin South-East Asia will be conducted.\n\n* * * * *\n\nPART FOUR\n\nEXPANSION AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nI.\u2014ORGANISATION, REINFORCEMENTS .\nAND BASES\n149. The remoteness of this theatre of war\nfrom centres of control at home, together with\nthe obligation of developing so economically\nbackward a country as India as a supply base,\nhas inevitably led to the assumption by my\nHeadquarters Staff of functions which rightly\n",

Estimated at its\nlowest, Air Command, South-East Asia, exer-\ncises the powers at least of Deputies to such\nbodies.\n\n150. The formation of South-East Asia\nCommand resulted in extensive developments\nin organisation, and a whole hierarchy of\nHeadquarters has been called into being.\nHeadquarters, Supreme Allied Commander,\nSouth-East Asia, moved from Delhi to Kandy\nin March, 1944. It was not possible to move\nmy Headquarters to Kandy at this time, as\nthe expansion and development of my Com-\nmand necessitated maintaining the closest\ncontact with G.H.Q. India, and so it was\nnecessary to form an Advanced Headquarters,\nA.C.S.E.A., consisting of a Planning and\nLiaison Staff, to accompany H.Q. S.A.C.S.E.A.\nin its move to Kandy. Air Headquarters,\nIndia, was set up as an autonomous unit to\ncontrol operations on the North-West Frontier\nand assume responsibility for the LAF.,\ndirectly responsible under its own A.O.C. to\nC.-in-C. India. Eastern Air Command was\nestablished to co-ordinate air operations on the\nBurmese frontier. Its Headquarters moved on\n15th April to Calcutta in order to maintain\ncloser touch with its subordinate units\u2014the\nStrategic Air Force, Third Tactical Air Force,\nTroop Carrier Command and Photographic\nReconnaissance Force. Thus administrative\ncontrol of American units also gravitated to\nCalcutta, since this remained the responsibility\nof Major-General G. E. Stratemeyer in his\nother capacity, that of Commanding-General\nof the U.S.A.A-F, in the India-Burma Sector of\nthe China-Burma-India Theatre.\n\n151. In December, 1943, three new R.AF.\nGroups were formed\u2014Nos. 229 (Transport)\nGroup, 230 (Maintenance) and 231 (Bomber).\nWithin the period covered by this despatch\neleven R.A.F. and IAF. squadrons were\nadded to my command either by formation or\non transfer from another theatre. In addition,\na second flight has been added to Nos. 681 and\n684 P.R. Squadrons, whilst at the height of\nthe defence of Imphal, No. 216 Transport\nSquadron was operating under my command\non detachment from the Mediterrancan. A\nfurther eight squadrons were held in back areas\nfor re-equipment, and seven others changed\ntheir battle r\u00e9le. The conversion programme\nhas been mainly bound up with the further\ninfusion of Mosquitoes and Spitfires into the\nCommand, while Thunderbolts are also\narriving, and plans to re-equip the Hurricane\nsquadrons with them have been formulated.\nThe flow of aircraft in support of this\nmodernization has been steady, though the\nR.A.F, in South-East Asia remains, as far as\naircraft types are concerned, at least a year\nbehind other theatres. Parallel to this ex-\npansion and re-equipment has been the\nrationalisation of the areas for which Groups\nin India are responsible to correspond with the\nboundaries of Army Commands.\n\n152. The large programme of airfield\ndevelopment has been continued, with the\nultimate purpose of providing accommodation\nfor the approved number of squadrons included\nin my long-term target. Save for certain new\nsites in the forward areas and in Ceylon, all\n\n1399\n\ndevelopment has been of existing airfields.\nFive airfields west of Calcutta have been\ndeveloped for the U.S.A.A.F. as bases for\nV.H.B. aircraft. The need for pressing for-\nward our offensive and air transport operations\nhas been responsible for the expansion of a\nnumber of airfields in the Fourteenth Army\narea east of the Brabmaputra. In Ceylon,\nwork has begun on the development of two\nnew airfields at Kankesanturai and Negombo\nfor heavy aircraft, while, for special operations,\nrunway extension and strengthening of taxi-\ntracks has been undertaken at China Bay.\nWork is being started on a plan for reinforce-\nment route development. In this field of\ndevelopment effective use has been made of\nbitumenised hessian\u2014* bithess \u201d\u2014for both run-\nways and apron hardstandings. The service-\nability of this experimental material under\nmonsoon conditions is being closely observed.\n153. The procedure of implementing works\nprojects was altered slightly in January, 1944,\nthough the difficulties and delays remained as\nbefore. In the Fourteenth Army area, priorities\nawarded to the R.A-F. services have been liable\nto alteration by Army commanders without\nany reference being made to the Air Com-\nmander concerned, and without any apprecia-\ntion of the effect of such alterations on the\nfuture of the air offensive. Labour and\nmaterial has been diverted and moved without\ngiving any notification to the R.A.F. authori-\nties concerned ; frequently the first intimation\nthat they receive of such action is the complete\ncessation of work upon some R.A-F. project.\n154. The expansion of establishments con-\nnected with the formation of new Headquarters\nunits and the preparation of cadres for the\nreception of future reinforcements has aggra-\nvated the manpower shortage. The overall\nCommand deficiency of effective\nagainst current establishments has throughout\nthe period been approximately 12 per cent. ;\nbut although this deficiency may not appear\nunduly in excess of the global R.A.F. shortage,\nnevertheless there has been very severe lack\nof personnel in individual trades. Since re-\ninforcements in the period reached this Com-\nmand in only negligible quantity, various\nalternative sources of supply to meet the\ndeficiencies have been tried. An extensive\nscheme has been inaugurated for remustering\nBritish other ranks from Jower trade groups\ninto the more severely deficient higher trade\ngroups, but this, besides merely transferring\nthe shortage from one trade to another, has\nalso meant a loss to effective strength of the\nairmen undergoing conversion training. The\nrecruitment of Indians both as officers and men\nto fill the vacancies has also offered some\nsolution, but this has continued only at a\ndiminished rate and it has been very difficult:\nto find suitable officer candidates. Further,\nsome months must elapse even after the period\nof formal training before such reinforcements\ncan be counted on as fully effective. The\nquestion of substitution by women has also\nbeen given special attention. The W.A.A.F.\nmission from the Air Ministry led by Air Chief\nCommandant Dame Trefusis J. Forbes arrived\nin February. As a result of her investigations\ndiscussions have been begun with the Govern-\nment of India. Meanwhile W.A.C. (1) recruit-\ning for the Air Forces in India has been at a\nstandstill.

In ancillary services, examples of co-\noperation were most notable in the sphere of\nmaintenance, signals and flying control. Major\nGeneral G. E. Stratemeyer has said in his re-\nport on operations during this period\u2014\u201c The\nvarious obstacles which might be expected to\narise as a result of combining U.S.A.A.F. and\nR.AF. units have been overcome as a result of\nintegration of staffs at Headquarters, Eastern\nAir Command, Strategic Air Force, Third\nTactical Air Force, Troop Carrier Command\nand Photographic Reconnaissance Force. Such\na revolutionary change in staff organisation\nmight well have produced many difficulties and\nmisunderstandings, but such has not been the\ncase, and we have undoubtedly derived mutual\nbenefit, not only on the staff side, but in the\ntactical operating of air forces\u201d. With these\nand other evidences of the working of inte-\ngrated forces I have dealt in detail in the\nappropriate sections of the narrative.\n\nTue TASKS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED.\n\n7. The tasks which lay before the combined\nAir Forces were: \u2014\n\n(a) To conduct a strategic air offensive in\nconformity with the general plan to destroy\nenemy air forces and installations, selected\nrail, road and river communications, and\ndepois and maintenance facilities.\n\n(b) To ensure the air defence of the U'S.\nAir \u2018fransport Command airfields in North-\nEast India and to provide for the defence\nagainst air attack of Calcutta and adjacent\nindustrial areas.\n\n(c) To provide support for the operations\nof Fourteenth Army.\n\n(d) To provide support for the Chinese-\nAmerican forces under command of General\nJ. W. Stilwell which were operating from\nbases in the Ledo area.\n\n(e) To support the operations of Long\nRange Penetration forces, an:\n\n(f} To conduct photographic\nnaissance and survey.\n\n8. The prosecution of the first of these tasks\nwas not only the best method of maintaining a\nfavourable air situation, which was my prin-\ncipal charge, but would also force the enemy\non the defensive and thus provide the best pro-\ntection for the air route to China, for the\nCaleutta area and for sea communications in\nthe northern Bay of Bengal.\n\n9. Offensive fighter operations were to be\nundertaken to the greatest possible extent and\nit was proposed to use long range fighters in\nparticular in the offensive against enemy air-\nfields and air installations. Moreover, in order\n\nTecon-\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\nto overcome the wide dispersal of my avail-\nable fighter strength, it was necessary to main-\ntain at the highest pitch of efficiency the early\nwarning system.\n\n10.1 planned to employ the strategic\nbomber force against targets in the following\norder of priority : enemy occupied airfields and\ninstallations, shipping, railways, oil installations\nin Burma and suitable objectives in Bangkok.\nThe course which the battle took, however,\nmade a readjustment of these priorities neces-\nsary and a considerable proportion of the total\nbomber effort was directed to tactical targets\nin support of the Army and later, to carry\nsupplies to the garrison at Imphal. Another\ntask which assumed increasing importance\nduring the period was the evacuation of\ncasualties. Much had to be done to build up\na su organisation which could deal with\nthe transhipment of sick and wounded from\nbattle areas and casualty clearing stations to\nbetter equipped hospitals in the rear.\n\nTe Forces AVAILABLE.\n\n11. To accomplish these tasks there was a\ntotal of forty-eight R.A-F. and seventeen\nU.S.A.A.F. squadrons deployed for operations.\nBy. May these totals had increased to sixty-four\nand twenty-eight respectively.\n\n12. The disposition of tactical units in\nBengal and Assam was designed to provide\ndefence and support over the three main areas\nof land operations ; in the Arakan, along the\nline from Tiddim to Homalin, and the Ledo\nSector in Northern Burma; they were under\nthe control of 224 Group, 221 Group and the\nU.S.A.A.F. Northem Air Sector Force respec-\ntively. Strategic units continued to be stationed\nfurther to the west since the marshy areas of\nthe Sunderbunds and the poor lines of com-\nmunication in that area made the construction\nof airfields east of the Brahmaputra up to\nheavy bomber standards a matter of extreme\ndifficulty which neither the labour, transport\nnor supply position would allow me to under-\ntake except as a relatively long term plan.\n\nTHE SITUATION IN NOVEMBER.\n\n13. Facing the enemy from India there was\na more modern, more powerful, and numeri-\ncally stronger air force than had hitherto been\navailable in this theatre. Moreover, during\nthe monsoon much had been achieved to give\nthe units comprising this force greater striking\npower. Communications, although overstrained\nwere now better geared to carry war supplies\nthan at any time since the outbreak of hostili-\nties. Advanced landing grounds which had\nbeen constructed afforded short-range aircraft\na greater radius of action, both offensive and\ndefensive, during the dry weather that was to\ncome and the warning system was now able to\ngive ample notice of the approach of hostile\naircraft.\n\n14. The enemy for his part disposed of a\nforce of approximately 250 aircraft concen-\ntrated in the airfield groups at Heho, Anisakan,\nRangoon and Chiengmai with the remainder at\nlay-back bases in Siam and the Netherlands\nEast Indies. His ground forces faced ours\nalong a front of 700 miles. In Arakan he held\nthe line from Maungdaw to Buthidaung and\nwas opposed by XV Corps, thence north-west\nacross the inhospitable Chin Hills to Kalemyo\nand northwards up the Kabaw Valley where\n",

Personnel are now demanded against\nceiling establishment figures as fixed by the\nAsian Establishments Committee after con-\nsultation with my Headquarters.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nTI.\u2014MaAINTENANCE AND REPAIR\n\n155. I referred in my last despatch to the\nuphill task confronting the maintenance\norganisation in this Command. Without actual\nknowledge of the conditions, however, many\nof the inherent difficulties cannot be fully\nappreciated and deserve further emphasis.\n\n156. The low standard of industrialisation in\nIndia throws a heavy burden on the shoulders\nof Service maintenance personnel, who receive\nnone of the assistance from contractors\u2019 work-\ning parties that is available at home establish-\nments. Even when it is possible to sub-con-\ntract work to civilian firms, the quality of the\nproducts leaves much to be desired. Secondly,\nthe vast distances involved call for a wide dis-\npersal of existing stocks and make A.O.G.\nprocedure extremely slow. Thirdly, there is\na case for stating that it is not sufficiently\nrealised that more manpower is needed per unit\nof output than in other theatres of war where\nspares are more readily available, the sickness\nrate lower, and base repair not rendered so\ndifficult by the distances between depots and\nthe operational areas, with the inevitable de-\nterioration of damaged aircraft in transit. It\nis in the light of these and similar difficulties\nthat the work of maintenance and repair should\nbe considered,\n\n157. Expansion during the period was\ndirected mainly to preparations for dealing\neventually with the load of 156 squadrons en-\nvisaged under the Long Term Target for the\nCommand. Additional civilian capacity has\nbeen mobilised; one unit\u2014No. 2 Command\nMaintenance Unit Trichinopoly\u2014is in process\nof being doubled in size, and three new\nC.M.U.s have been formed. No. 322 M.U. at\nCawnpore is now in operation, constituting the\nlargest service base repair depot in India. When\nit reaches full capacity it will be able to deal\nwith major repairs to about 55 large aircraft\nand with the overhaul of nearly 500 engines per\nmonth.\n\n158. A comprehensive organisation has been\n\nbuilt for holding reserve aircraft at Aircraft\nStorage Units and Reserve Aircraft Pools so\ndisposed as to cover the whole of India in\nthree zones. The A.S.U.s hold a two-months\u2019\nreserve, while the R.A.P.s hold a fortnight\u2019s\nreserve of aircraft ready for immediate issue.\nThis organisation has contributed in no small\nmeasure to the high rate of serviceability in\nsquadrons, since it is generally possible to re-\nplace aircraft within twenty-four hours.\n159, Lack of storage accommodation for hold-\ning main stocks has been due to poor progress\nin the erection of new buildings planned long\nsince, and is a most serious problem at the\npresent time, when approximately 30,000 cases\nof R.A.F. stores have had to be stored in the\nopen.\n\n160. Often in this Command an aircraft\nwhich has crashed or force-landed away from\nan airfield has to be written off because of\n\nSUPPLEMENT to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\nthe fundamental and ineradicable shortcomings\nof the transport system. Even if a damaged\naircraft can be taken to the nearest railway,\nthe journey thence to a repair depot generally\ncauses so much further damage that a machine\nthat was capable of repair is fit only for write-\noff when it reaches its destination. One remedy,\nwhich is having encouraging results, was the\nformation of an Airborne Salvage Section in\nNovember 1943 to fly to the scene of a crash\nin a specially fitted transport aircraft which\ncan carry spares, tools and engines. On reach-\ning the site, patch repairs are effected and the\ndamaged aircraft nursed to the nearest depot.\nThe Airborne Salvage Section was given one of\nthe first Dakotas it salvaged, and in that air-\ncraft mainplanes of large aircraft and com-\nplete Spitfires have been carried. Up to date,\nthe Section has salvaged eighteen aircraft ; the\npossibility of forming further similar sections\nis under consideration.\n\n161. An example of the shortage of man-\npower to meet emergencies arose in April when\ntransport operations necessitated the maximum\noutput of Dakotas both from major inspections\nand repair. By diverting all available re-\nsources, the time taken on the floor was pro-\ngressively reduced until it became half of what\nit had been at the end of 1943. This rapid\nturnover was only achieved, however, by con-\ncentrating maintenance personnel on Dakotas\nat every stage of their travel, with a conse-\nquent reduction of work on other types. The\noutput of Dakotas from repair rose from two\nin December to ten in April and eleven in May.\nThe later figures would have been higher still\nbut for the complete lack of certain spares in\nthis Command which had to be demanded from\nAmerica.\n\n162. Attempts to produce locally jettison\ntanks exemplify the difficulties and delays ex-\nperienced in indigenous production. The tanks\nwere requested in October/November 1943 to\nimplement the long-range fighter policy. The\nmost suitable firm for their manufacture was\nchosen, but found that it could not work to\nthe required limits laid down in the standard\nVickers\u2019 drawings, and more generous toler-\nances had to be permitted. In spite of this,\none difficulty after another arose, and metal\ntanks are still not available for issue. I have\nalready indicated the urgency with which they\nwere needed in the Third Tactical Air Force.\nAs an alternative, a plywood tank was\ndeveloped and successfully flight tested in\nDecember 1943. There were, however, the\ninevitable delays in getting it into production,\nand they were not actually available for opera-\ntional use until May.\n\n163. Simple types of equipment more suited\nto the manufacturing resources of the country\nhave been produced to the fullest extent, and\nBritish production thereby relieved of a con-\nsiderable burden. The monthly output of\nsupply-dropping parachutes increased from\n35,000 to 144,000, and it is anticipated that\nthis figure will be increased to 250,000 by the\nend of the year.\n\n164. Very close liaison has been maintained\nwith the U.S. Air Service Command. There\nis a free and complete exchange of technical\ninformation and liaison officers are established\nat both Headquarters. At the time when the\nDakota position was acute, the Air Service\nCommand released to the R.A.F. one-third of\n",

Despite the increased operational effort,\nthe serviceability of squadrons has been well\nmaintained. To some extent the higher wastage\nof aircraft has had to be met from reserve\nstocks, whilst the number of airframes and\nengines under or awaiting repair has increased.\nIt is not certain that this back-log will be\nfully eliminated during the monsoon, because\nof shortage of personnel in the various trades\nand the inherent shortcomings of an organisa-\ntion of rapid growth working with inadequate\nlocal resources.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nTII.\u2014-SIGNALs, COMMUNICATIONS AND RADAR\n\n166. One of the major problems of the Com-\nmand has always been the provision of efficient\ncommunication facilities over long distances.\nTrunk telephone and telegraph systems give\npoor and unreliable service, nor can any ap-\npreciable improvement be expected until the\nIndian Posts and Telegraphs Department is re-\ninforced by Military signals units. Meanwhile\nthe construction of long-distance overhead\ncarrier systems is proceeding, although the\nmaintenance problems that will arise when they\nare complete cannot be solved without addi-\ntions to personnel. The six Air Formation\nSignals units within the Command have worked\nwell in view of their deficiency of seven Officers\nand 270 British Other Ranks on the 1943\ntarget. Indeed, shortage of personnel has been\nthe greatest single limiting factor in the ex-\npansion of signals facilities. The situation was\nfurther aggravated by the need to supply to\nSpecial Force 185 Wireless Operators and\nMechanics and eight Officers. These personnel\nare still with the Division.\n\n167. The formation of Eastern Air Command\nresulted in a high degree of co-operation and\nexchange of technical information between\nAmerican and British forces, particularly in the\nsphere of radar. Two G.C.I. stations were\nsited to cover American bases in the Brahma-\nputra Valley and another was sited at Shin-\nbuiyang in May to provide early warning for\nthe Chinese-American forces advancing down\nthe Hukawng Valley. Further British and\nAmerican Light Warning sets were also de-\nployed in the area. Another G.C.I. set has\nbeen modified in order that it may be carried\nby air and made available to U.S. forces. New\nAmerican Light Warning sets have been tested\njointly by RAF. and U.S.A.A.F. officers.\nMoreover, with the prospect of Loran stations\nfor the use of A.T.C. aircraft proceeding to and\nfrom China being installed, the operational use\nof this device by the R.A.F. in the Command\nhas come nearer to realisation. Information\non Radio Counter Measures has been provided\nto XXth Bomber Command and to other\nAmerican units. Finally, all American units\nin this theatre have adopted the R.A-F. call-\nsign procedure.\n\n168. All signals planning for future opera-\ntions has been undertaken with mobility as the\nkeynote. Specialist signals vehicles have been\nproduced within the Command and are\ndesigned to meet needs peculiar to this theatre.\nMoreover, static establishments in operational\nunits in the Third Tactical Air Force have been\nreplaced by mobile units with the result that\n\n(11548)\n\n1401\n\nGroup and Wing Headquarters will in future\nbe self-contained and fully mobile as regards\nsignals requirements. The formation of No. 5\nBase Signals Unit provided the cadre for\noperational training under field conditions.\nPersonnel thrown up by the substitution of\nWireless Observer Units by Indian Mobile\nWireless Observer Companies were among the\nfirst to use these training facilities. It has thus\nbeen possible to establish No. 4 Group Control\nCentre and 104 Mobile Air Reporting Unit\nwhich will replace the existing organisation in\nthe Tactical Air Force of Group Operations\nRooms, Filter Rooms, etc. The installation of\nRadar units in barges has been used to good\neffect already. In November, the most\nadvanced units were those along the Cox\u2019s\nBazaar\u2014Ramu Road and the terrain in front\nof these was unsuitable for more extended\nsiting. As soon as the Army had advanced to\nMaungdaw, an Air Ministry Experimental\nStation (A.M.E.S.) was anchored off St. Martin\u2019s\nIsland. This station, together with a G.C.I.\nand Mobile Radar Unit (M.R.U.) sited at\nMaungdaw, provided most useful cover and\nassisted in successful interceptions off the\nArakan coast. G.C.I. sets have also been in-\nStalled in a jeep, amphibious jeep and an\namphibious DUKW.\n\n169. There has been an overall increase of\n30 per cent. in navigational aids since Novem-\nber. The installation of static HF. D/F* sta-\ntions is practically completed and the delivery\nof V.H.F. D/F{ equipment permitted a start\nto be made on its erection at all airfields along\nthe main transport and reinforcement routes\nwithin India. An up-to-date map is issued\nquarterly giving details of all aids to naviga-\ntion, and the combining of R.AF. and\nU.S.A.AF. facilities has been of great value.\n\n170. Details of the airborne investigations of\nenemy Radar have been given in Part Two of\nthis Despatch.\n\n171. Signals traffic saw a large increase with\nthe creation of Advanced Headquarters, Air\nCommand, South East Asia, in Ceylon, and of\nEastern Air Command, Strategic Air Force,\nNo. 230 and 231 Groups in Bengal.

Within these\nlimitations, however, much has been done, and\nits value is evidenced by the fact that at the\nonly two airfields in 221 Group which could\nbe provided with proper fiying control, there\nwere in February no avoidable accidents\namong the four squadrons accommodated\nthere.\n\n173. In November there were only thirty\ntrained British Flying Control Officers in the\nCommand. This small body was reinforced by\nforty resting aircrew and thirty I.A.F. officers.\nThere were forty main airfields along the re-\ninforcement routes and in Ceylon, with no air-\nfield controllers, no trained airmen and very\nlittle equipment, among which these personnel\nwere distributed.\n\n174. In anticipation of the arrival of trained\ncontrollers from England, plans were made to\ninstitute a full Flying Control organisation in\nthe operational areas and along the reinforce-\nment routes by February. Unfortunately the\nflow from U.K. was stopped in January and\nthe plan could not be implemented. \" The\nurgent needs of operational airfields had to be\nmet by stripping other areas below the safety\nmargin and diluting their establishment with\ntoo high a proportion of I.A-F. officers. At the\nend of May deficiencies on current establish-\nments amounted to 150 officers and 100 airfield\ncontrollers.\n\n175. One of the most encouraging features\nof the development is the progress made to-\nwards complete integration with the U.S.A.A.F.\nLiaison has been pursued since September\n1943, and in March of this year a joint con-\nference proposed the setting up of one system\nof Air Traffic Control throughout the Com-\nmand. A committee was set up to examine the\ntechnical problems involved and make recom-\nmendations. These included a Joint Flying\nControl Board which will meet at intervals and,\nit is hoped, maintain the unanimity achieved\nby the initial committee. Application was\nmade to U.S.A.A.F. H.Q. to send to the Com-\nmand officers trained in the joint system now\nworking in U.K.\n\n176. I therefore anticipate that a unified\nsystem of Flying Controi will soon be operat-\ning throughout the Command, and that every\ncrew will receive standard briefing and stan-\ndard aids on all flights.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\u2018V.\u2014 ARMAMENT\n\n177. The slow receipt and dissemination of\nup-to-date information on armament matters,\nas indeed in all technical branches, has hin-\ndered the work of making the best use of\nweapons and developing the striking power of\nthe Command. New publications take two\nmonths to arrive and an even longer period to\nreprint and distribute. One remedy has\nan extensive use of the microgram service to\nhasten the process of keeping technical per-\nsonnel informed on all current developments.\n\n178. Operational failures have been reduced\nin spite of the fact that fighter squadrons do\nnot possess Armament Officers. It has been\nfound that the stoppage rates on squadrons\n\nSUPPLEMENT \u2018to THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\nmore than twenty miles from their Wing Arma-\nment Officer are from 1.5 to 2.5 times those on\nsquadrons less than twenty miles from the\nwing. In spite of the fact that there are\nestablished posts for only ten squadron Arma-\nment Officers in the Command, which are\nnaturally allotted to the bomber squadrons,\nand that there are many establishment vacan-\ncies which have not been filled because of the\nserious shortage of armament officers, .303 gun\nfailures have fallen from 0.11 to 0.08 and\n20 mm. from 2.07 to 1.48 per thousand rounds.\nBomb failures have similarly fallen from 0.47\nto 0.25 per hundred bombs. The measures\nwhich contributed to this improvement were a\ndecentralisation of the training and mainten-\nance branches, a better system of check on\nfailures, and careful distribution of available\nmanpower. To aid in this distribution a certain\ndilution of I.A.F. personnel has been accepted.\nThese have proved suitable and efficient trades-\nmen at certain tasks and have enabled the\nfollowing dilution to be effected :\nper cent.\n(i) LA.F, Squadrons -. 100\nGi) M<U.s vee ae 50\n(ii) Other non-operational\n\n(iv) Operational R.A.F. Squad-\nrons... wee wee\n(provided British Other\nRanks are substituted\nwhen available.)\n\n179, A number of new weapons have arrived\nin the Command and come into use, operation-\nally, during the period, Hurricane UD aircraft\narmed with 40 mm. cannon first operated in\nNo. 20 Squadron in December, 1943. The\ninitial A.P. ammunition was supplemented in\nFebruary by H.E. which has proved very effec-\ntive against rivercraft. R.P. has been used by\nNo. 211 Squadron since January. It was at\nfirst employed against bridge targets, but the\ndelay fuse was found to be unsatisfactory for\nthis type of attack and no proper facilities\nwere available for modifying it. In view of\nthis, R.P. attacks have been directed against\nrolling stock, transport convoys, oil instaila-\ntions, factories and rivercraft with good effect.\n500 lb. M.C. bombs came into use early in the\nnew year, and in addition to the supply to\nBengal, stocks have been built up at selected\nstations in Southern India and Ceylon should\naction become necessary against a Japanese\nNaval Task Force. 2,000 lb. A.P. bombs have\nbeen distributed for the same purpose.\n\n180. A 4,000 Ib. bomb was dropped on\nBurma for the first time in November, 1943,\nagainst railway targets at Sagaing ; its employ-\nment since then has been extended both by\nday and night. Among American weapons\nwhich have been introduced since November\nare parachute fragmentation bombs, 300 Ib.\nspike bombs for use against railway lines, the\nnoses being of indigenous manufacture, and\nthe rocket-gun employed in the same manner\nas the R.A-F. rocket-projectile.\n\n181. Close liaison between British and\nAmerican Armament Staffs resulted in much\nimter-change of information and resources.\nAmerican aircraft used R.A.F. flares and the\nR.A.F. used American mines, incendiaries and\ndrift lights.\n\n* * * * *\n",

The re-orientation of the training\norganisation early in the period allocated\nresponsibility on a geographical basis, and No.\n227 Group was no longer regarded primarily\nas the training group. From January onwards,\neach group supervised and administered train-\ning within its own area.\n\n183. Much of the available resources have\nbeen absorbed by the need to convert crews\nto the latest types of aircraft, since reinforce-\nments arriving in the Command have not been\nfamiliarised with these types, and many exist-\ning squadrons are re-equipping. The change-\nover from Vengeances to Mosquitoes, from\nWellingtons to Liberators and from Hurricanes\nto Thunderbolts are the outstanding examples.\nAs a result, it is hoped that there will be five\ntrained Liberator and nine Thunderbolt\nsquadrons by November, and two Mosquito\nsquadrons by October. Wastage replacement\ncrews are trained concurrently and provide a\nvaluable reserve without calling upon outside\nassistance.\n\n184. Refresher flying training was provided\nat Poona for 614 aircrew either newly arrived\nin the Command or returning to operations\nafter a period of rest. Air Gunner Instructor\ncourses, LA.F, ab initio W/Op. A.G. courses\nand R.A-F. Pilot Refresher courses have been\ncarried out continuously at Bairagarh in\nBhopal where two LA.F. squadrons (Nos. 3\nand 9) also completed armament and gunnery\ntraining. The Air Fighting Training Unit\ngave advanced courses on tactics and gunnery\ncontrol, through which 71 pilots and 83 gun-\nnery leaders passed, and which were attended\nby many U.S.A.AF. personnel. No. 22 Arma-\nment Practice Camp carried out six bomber\nand fighter refresher courses, one of which was\nattended by No. 459 Squadron U.S.A.AF.\nwhose results improved markedly during the\ncourse, No. 231 Group Navigation School\npassed 420 aircrew through its courses.\n\n185. LA.F. G.D. recruiting did not come up\nto expectations. The following table of out-\nput during the period indicates the scale of\nLAF. production and wastage :\n\nFrom LT.W. 224\nFrom E.E.T.S. : . 101\nFrom S.F.T.S. we wee 80\nFrom O.T.U. . 113\n\n186. Ground training was mainly of LAF.\npersonnel, of whom 8,049 were admitted to\nRecruit Training Centres. A fraction over\n9,000 I.0.R.s were under training of all kinds\nat the end of the period. One important\ntask, the training of flight mechanics, was\ntaken over from the Director of Civil Aviation,\nand as a result the civilian schools were closed\nor taken over as Schools of Technical Training.\n\n* = * * *\n\nVII.\u2014INTERNAL AIR ROUTES\n\n187. The formation early in December of\nNo. 229 Group of Transport Command enabled\nme to introduce a stricter supervision of in-\nternal transport flying, passenger and freight\nservices, and of the movement of aircraft in\nIndia and Ceylon. The need for this had\nlong been apparent but the means had been\nlacking. One of the more positive results of\nthe decentralisation of control I was able to\nmake was a reduction in the accident rate for\n\n1403\n\nthe aircraft which came under No. 229 Group\u2019s\ncontrol from 46 per 10,000 in December, 1943,\nto 13 in May, 1944.\n\n188. The number of aircraft available for\ninternal services continued to be small in com-\nparison with requirements and the distances in-\nvolved. Since it was necessary to earmark\nnearly all Dakotas for the replacement of\nwastages in squadrons operating at pressure on\nthe Eastern frontier, the formation of another\ntransport squadron (the sixth) had to be con-\ntinually postponed, and the conversion of No.\n353 Squadron from Hudsons to Dakotas de-\nlayed. This squadron, based on Palam at\nDelhi, together with the B.O.A.C. and the few\naircraft belonging to Indian civil air lines, was\nall I could make available for the Air Routes.\nNo. 229 Group\u2019s task was thus no easy one.\nIn the six months from December to May,\nHudson aircraft of No. 353 Squadron flew\n7,570 hours on transport work. The age of the\nHudsons makes this a creditable figure. It\nwas only achieved by a high standard of main-\ntenance and by using as engine spares such\nparts from obsolete Mohawks as were avail-\nable. Six Dakotas were also made available\nto the squadron in April and May as a de-\ntached flight based on Dum Dum. They flew\n860 hours in these two months on services\nbetween Calcutta, Colombo and Bombay.\nThis flight was given concurrently two Dakotas\nto maintain a service to China which had\nformerly been carried out by No. 31 Squadron.\nThus this one squadron was operating services\nextending from Ceylon to Kunming and\nCalcutta to Bombay.\n\n189. Ferrying and the movement of rein-\nforcing aircraft accounted for an average of\nover 1,300 aircraft deliveries a month within\nthe Command. These flights were used to the\nfullest extent to supplement the internal air\nservices. By this means, over 1,060 passengers\nand 500,000 pounds of freight were flown from\nKarachi alone.\n\n190. I am glad to say that trunk routes to\nthe United Kingdom have been vastly in-\ncreased. The weekly R.A.F. Liberator service\nfrom Karachi has been doubled and a weekly\nservice by R.A.F. Dakota from Colombo has\nbeen started. In May a B.O.A.C. Sunderland\nbegan to ply twice weekly from Calcutta. For\ncommunications with the Mediterranean there\nhas been since March a B.O.AC. Ensign\nservice three times a week between Cairo and\nCalcutta. The establishment of No. 229 Group\nin my Command, followed by a personal visit\nof the A.O.C.-in-C. Transport Command and\nmany representatives of his staff has been\namongst the happiest auguries for the future\nthat I have to record in this Despatch.\n\n* * * * *\n\nVIIL\u2014R.A.F. REGIMENT\n\n191. The strength of the R.A.F. Regiment\nthroughout has been insufficient to justify the\nacceptance of full responsibility for the local\ndefence of Royal Air Force Stations and to\nmeet the threat of infiltration by enemy ground\nraiding parties to airfields and Radar stations.\nA remedy was sought in November, 1943,\nwhereby the Army agreed to withdraw all\nstatic garrisons from R.A.F. stations in areas\nremote from enemy action, and to provide\nthem at stations where attack was possible.\nThe R.A.F. was to have made a contribution\n",

Regiment\npersonnel had been organised into units with\nindependent establishments. It was possible to\nform only five field squadrons, the remaining\npersonnel being organised into A.A. flights\narmed with light machine-guns, since there\nwere not enough officers nor the requisite\nequipment to allow larger units to be formed.\nThese units functioned with considerable\nefficiency and, in adition, station personnel\ninstructors drawn from the Regiment trained\nin defence a large percentage of all personnel\nin threatened areas.\n\n193. By January, 1944, Army garrisons west\nof the Brahmaputra had been withdrawn, but\nno static garrisons had been provided for the\nmore vulnerable stations in either the 4 or 15\nCorps\u2019 areas. The local defence of these\nstations depended entirely upon the few R.A-F.\nRegiment Units and the station personnel.\nDespite repeated representations, the reduction\nof the Regiment to nearly half its initial\nstrength was insisted upon by Air Ministry,\nand in February action to remuster personnel\nto other trades was initiated. The results were\nseen when in April the Air Commander, Third\nTactical Air Force, was obliged to withdraw a\nnumber of operational squadrons from the\nImphal Valley. I had no alternative but to\ndirect that further reduction of the Regiment,\nalready down to 3,434 all ranks, should be\nsuspended. My Command Defence Officer was\nsent to England in May to explain the circum-\nstances and to request, not only that the\nsuspension of the Regiment reduction should\nbe confirmed, but that a force adequate for\nthe task of defending airfields and ancillary\nstations in the battle areas should be provided.\n\n194. I append a comment by the Air Com-\nmander, Third Tactical Air Force, upon the\nRegiment units under his control: \u2014\n\n\u201cUnits of the R.AF. Regiment have\nproved themselves of the greatest value in\nthis campaign, of which the insecurity of air-\nfields and warning establishments in forward\nareas has been a feature. When Radar\nStations were established at St. Martin\u2019s\nIsland and later in the Maungdaw area, the\nunusual situation existed of Radar Stations\nbeing actually well in advance of the front\nline and within range of the enemy\u2019s guns\nand night patrols. It says much for the\nR.A.F. Regiment personnel that the Radar\ncrews enjoyed undisturbed conditions in\nwhich to carry on their work under such\ntrying conditions. It has proved to be quite\nunsound to rely on the Army maintaining\ntroops for local defence in times of crisis\nwhen the land situation deteriorates. This is\nthe time when they are really needed by us,\nbut this is the time when they are invariably\nwithdrawn to take part in the land battle\u201d.\n\n* * * = *\n\nTX.\u2014Am Sea RESCUE\n\n195. The Air Sea Rescue organisation in this\nCommand has been based on that of the United\nKingdom, with the necessary adaptations for\nlocal conditions and the scale of equipment that\nis available. The responsibility for operations\nhas been delegated to the A.Os.C. of Groups,\nto whom in tum the Group Controllers of\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\nNaval Air Operations Rooms, keeping constant\nwatch, are responsible for initiating such\noperations.\n\n196. Officers responsible to their respective\nA.Os.C. for the efficient arrangement of Air\nSea Rescue azd for keeping squadrons in-\nformed of any new developments in methods\nof search and ancillary equipment have been\nestablished in Commands and Groups as\nfollows :\u2014\n\nEastern Air Command\u2014One Squadron\n\nLeader.\n\nThird T.A.F.\u2014One Flight Lieutenant.\nNo. 225 Group\u2014One Squadron Leader ;\n\nOne Flight Lieutenant.\n\nNo. 222 Group\u2014One Squadron Leader.\n\n197. Twelve Warwicks have now after some\ndelay arrived in India and are undergoing\nmajor overhaul at Karachi, Allahabad and Jes-\nsore. Seven Sea Otters are being off-loaded\nat Karachi and crews have been detailed to\ntake a conversion course as soon as the air-\ncraft become serviceable. When they are\nready for operational flying, these aircraft will\njoin No. 292 Squadron, the Headquarters of\nwhich will be at Jessore. .\n\n198. Meaawhile searches have been carried\nout by the four Walruses already in the Com-\nmand, and by operational aircraft, which, when-\never possible, carry the Lindholme Dinghy\nGear. Experiments are being made to fit this\ngear to Liberators.\n\n199. Little progress has been made in the\nformation of A.S.R. marine craft and Units.\nThis is chiefly due to the slow rate at which\nlaunches have been delivered. By July, 1943,\nthere were nine in the Command. Between\nthis date and January 1944 no more arrived,\nand as a consequence no additional units could\nbe formed. With the improvement, however,\nin the shipping position, four launches have\nrecently arrived from the United Kingdom and\nfour from the U.S.A. There has also been\nnotification of another seventeen being shipped\nto this Command.\n\n200. Air Sea Rescue Units have been formed\nor are now in the process of forming at the\nfollowing places: Chittagong, Maiakhal\nIsland, Calcutta, Dhamra River, Vizagapatam,\nMadras, Cochin, Bombay, Karachi, China Bay,\nColombo, Galle, Kayts (Jaffna), Jiwani and\nJask (iraq). The craft, however, allocated\nto most of these units have not yet arrived in\nthe Command, or are still being fitted out and\nso are not yet operational.\n\n201. The maintenance of these craft has been\na difficult problem owing to the limited supply\nof spares and special tools, to the great dis-\ntances between operational areas and the over-\nhaul workshops, and to the lack of transport\nthat prevails. The problem has been met by\nusing naval facilities where possible for ship-\nping and engine overhauls and by locating\nTescue craft by types, so that they are within\nas easy reach as possible of the workshops cap-\nable of doing the overhaul of their respective\ntypes of engines.\n\n202. Thirty-seven aircraft in all were\nsearched for. The number of aircrew personnel\nin these aircraft was 168, of which 102 were\nsaved. An American amphibious Catalina,\nbased on Calcutta, was responsible for two\nocean landings and the saving of twenty-one\n",

Photographic reconnaissance and sur-\nvey commitments in India have produced a\nhigh quality of photographs, and the speed of\nreproduction has been good considering the\nmany technical difficulties involved. The con-\nstruction of mobile photographic processing\nvehicles is progressing, and a plan to construct\ntwo self-sufficient photographic units each com-\nprising eleven vehicles will be begun in the\nnear future.\n\n208. Experiments in night photographic re-\nconnaissance by Ceylon-based Liberators of\n160 Squadron are proving satisfactory.\nCameras and storage for 28 flashes have been\ninstalled in aircraft, together with the means\nof releasing the flashes at variable intervals\nto obtain line-overlaps. Other trials have\nproved the practicability of obtaining stereo\npairs at night using two F.24 cameras installed\nin tandem. Plans to use carrier-borne aircraft\nfor long-r: reconnaissance have been im-\nplemented to the extent of installing and test-\ning equipment in Hellcat aircraft. Experiments\nnow wait upon the provision of American and\nBritish cameras.\n\n209. R.A.F. and U.S.A.A-F. processing and\ninterpretation in Eastern Air Command have\n\u2018been integrated at Photographic Reconnais-\n\n1405\n\nsance Force Headquarters at Bally Seaplane\nBase, Calcutta, where British and American\nstaffs work together and have achieved a high\ndegree of co-ordination.\n\n* * * * *\n\nXII.\u2014MEpIcAL: WELFARE\n\n210. The health of the Command as a whole\nshows only a slight improvement compared with\nthe analogous period for the preceding year.\nThe sickness rate for malaria and dysentery,\nalthough lower than that for 1943, has since\nFebruary maintained the seasonal rise; that for\nvenereal disease alone has steadily declined.\nThe rate of invaliding in the Command has\nrisen gradually. In 1943 the incidence was\n1.44 per thousand, whilst in 1944 the rate has\nincreased steadily from 2.00 in January to 2.50\nper thousand in May ; these figures are doubt-\nless connected with the increasing average\nlength of the sojourn spent by personnel in\nthe Command. Malaria has continued to be\nthe most important single cause of lost service\ndays through sickness, and measures have been\nactively taken in hand further to combat it. A\nDeputy P.M.O. (Malariology) has been\nappointed to re-organise the plan for malaria\ncontrol and to give the necessary technical\ndirections. Action has been initiated to raise,\nby propaganda and instruction, the standard\nof personal anti-malaria discipline, and plans\nhave been prepared for forming anti-malaria\nunits. A further step has been the experi-\nmental spraying from aircraft of areas where\nmalaria-carrying mosquitoes are known to\nbreed, and a flight of No. 134 Squadron has\nbeen detailed for this purpose.\n\n211. It is hoped to increase the liaison with\nthe Army and .the U.S.A.AF., which has\nhitherto not been as close as desirable.\nArrangements are being made io increase\nhospital accommodation to meet the potential\nneeds of the eighty-five squadrons accepted as\nthe short-term target. Work is now proceeding\non the conversion of the buildings of La\nMarttiniere School, Calcutta, to serve as the\n500-bedded General Hospital, the first R.A.F.\nHospital in the Command, for whose opening\nsanction was given in April. When open, the\nexistence of this hospital should not only\nobviate to a very large extent the present\nnecessity for sending R.A.F. casualties in the\nforward areas to army hospitals, with all the\nconsequent administrative difficulties, but\nshould also put the four R.A.F. Mobile Field\nHospitals in a much stronger position with re-\ngard to the supply of stores and equipment.\nThey have been frequently overcrowded, and\non occasion it has been found that essential\nequipment for which they had vainly been\nasking was nevertheless being made available\nto neighbouring Army hospitals.\n\n212. At the beginning of the year a repre-\nsentative of the R.A.F. Physiological Labora-\ntory, Farnborough, toured the Command and\ninvestigated flying conditions, including such\nmatters as oxygen needs, flying clothes, flying\nrations and length of operational tour. A\nTeport on his visit has since been received\nand action is being taken where necessary.\n\n\u2018WELFARE\n\n213.

Without the services of N.A.A-F.L, the\nprovision of entertainment parties from\n\u2018England proved impossible for a long period.\nThe Government of India have finally been\nprevailed upon to allow E.N.S.A. parties to\nperform in this country, and G.H.Q., India,\nhas partly defrayed the cost from excess\ncanteen profits.\n\n_ 216. Other advances which may be men-\ntioned include the improved scales of accom-\nmodation and furnishings which have been\nsanctioned for Hill Depots, and the development\nof airmen\u2019s clubs. The number of beds avail-\nable for personnel on leave has practically\ndoubled during the past year, and Hill Depots\nhave been made as informal as possible with\nno parades at all and a minimum of restric-\ntions. In spite of this, approximately 70 per\ncent. of airmen still prefer to spend their leave\n\n- panies under training.\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\nin towns. I cannot see any alteration in this\nproportion until travelling facilities on Indian\nrailways vastly improve, and proceeding to\ndistant leave centres becomes less of an ordeal.\nThe unhealthy nature of most large Indian\ntowns makes this improvement even more\ndesirable.\n\n217. Assistance has been given by my Wel-\nfare Staff to 915 airmen in need of advice or\nundergoing avoidable hardship, in addition to\nthe many cases handled by the welfare officers\nin subordinate formations. The provision of\namenities has continued with grants from the\nAmenities, Comforts and Entertainments for\nthe Forces Fund, while the Royal Air Force\nWelfare Grant has been received from Ist April\nonwards. To deal with the growing scope of\nwelfare duties, six selected airmen have been\ncommissioned in the A. & S.D. (Welfare)\nBranch and five welfare officers with the rank\nof Squadron Leader have arrived from the\nUnited Kingdom.\n\nXII.\u2014INDIAN OBSERVER CORPS\n\n218. In November, 1943, the Indian Observer\nCorps consisted of three control units, six\nmobile companies in Bengal, static units in four\nmain areas, Calcutta, Chittagong, Vizagapatam\nand Madras, and fourteen other mobile com-\nThese together with\nCare & Maintenance companies and training\ncentres made up a total strength of 10,851 per-\nsonnel. In December it was decided to break\ndown the static organisation and certain Care\nand Maintenance formations, and form from\nthem seven additional mobile companies. By\nMay, 1944, the number of control units had\nincreased to four, and that of operational\nmobile companies to seventeen with ten others\nunder training or in process of formation.\n\n219. During the battle in Arakan, four com-\npanies were involved, and re-deployment of a\nnumber of posts was necessary. Such posts as\nwere forced to retire succeeded in destroying\ntheir equipment before retreating. Similarly,\nwhen the enemy advanced towards Imphal,\nnearly 50 posts had to be evacuated or re-\ndeployed. The posts east and south of Imphal\nnaturally lost much equipment, but a high. per-\ncentage was saved and all abandoned equip-\nment was denied to the enemy. Casualties, too,\nwere light in view of the little or no warning\nprovided, consisting of some six missing and\nsix others wounded.\n\n220. Experience gained during the period led\nat the end of April to the substitution of\nMobile Control Units for the Base and Forward\nControl Units, with resultant closer supervision\nand greater flexibility. Ultimately there will be\nseven of these to control the seventeen com-\npanies, and each of the latter will control\nfifteen observer posts. :\n\nR. E. C.

Further north still\nhe was confronted by two Chinese Divisions\nbased on Ledo, and beyond this we held posi-\ntions as far as the River Salween with a small\nforce based at Fort Hertz. The enemy\u2019s bases\nand lines of communication stretched for 900\nmiles from Bangkok to Myitkyina, over the\nwhole length of which it was possible to attack\n\n15. The security of sea communications\nmeant that General Reconnaissance aircraft had\nto cover an area ranging from South Africa to\nSumatra, The patrol of this vast expanse of\nsea contributed a problem that could only be\nmet by the careful husbanding and disposition\nof the small forces available.\n\n* * * * * *\n\n16. The account of a campaign covering such\na wide area and diversity of activities does not\nadmit of chronological treatment. I have there-\nfore dealt separately with each strand of the\npattern of operations, commencing with the\nprimary task, the maintenance of air superiority,\nand placing air transport operations next in\nview of the importance they were to assume.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nPART TWO\nOPERATIONS\nI\u2014THE MAINTENANCE OF AIR SUPERIORITY\n\n17. The advent of Spitfires in Bengal early\nin November had already begun an era of\nsuccessful interceptions in which the enemy\ndiscovered for the first time in this theatre\nthe efficacy of modern fighter aircraft backed\nby a well developed system of warning and\ncontrol.\n\n18. The first squadrons (Nos. 615 and .697\nA.AF.) were based on Chittagong in order\nto protect and cover that vital port and to\ncover the Arakan front which was to be the\nscene of the first major battles of the cam-\npaign. Within the month the Spitfires destroyed\nfour enemy photographic reconnaissance air-\ncraft of the Dinah type whose excellent per-\nformance had hitherto allowed them to range\nwith impunity over our forward bases at a\nheight and speed which Hurricanes could not\nequal. The enemy reacted by sending out\nfighter sweeps to test the new arrivals and\nwhittle down our Spitfire strength in order that\nhe could once again range over the Arakan\nsuffering only the minor casualties that Hurri-\ncanes could inflict. In both these objects he\nwas unsuccessful, and by the end of December\nhad lost twenty-two aircraft, probably Jost seven\nand had suffered damage to twenty-six against\nour loss of thirteen. The greatest success scored\nin these raids was by No. 136 Squadron who,\non the last day of the year, scored 12 destroyed,\n3 probably destroyed, and 8 damaged against a\nmixed force of bombers and fighters which\nwere attempting to attack light Naval forces\noff the Arakan coast. As a result of this vic-\ntory the Secretary of State for Air signalled\nhis congratulations and commented that the\nnewly arrived Spitfires had come into good\nhands,\n\n19. The one occasion the enemy could claim\nas a success at this time was a bold strike\naimed at Calcutta with the double object of\ndamaging port installations and demoralising\nthe city. Hie divined that over a front of 700\n\n(11543)\n\n1383\n\nmiles, defence in depth could not be so uni-\nformly effective and that in the rear areas\nwhich included Calcutta, he would probably\nbe met with Hurricanes. On 5th December he\nsent a mixed force of approximately sixty\nbombers and fighters in two waves which suc-\nceeded in bombing Calcutta for the loss of 2\ndestroyed, 1 probably destroyed, and 4 dam-\naged, while the three and a half Hurricane\nsquadrons (the half being night fighters) suffered\nfive destroyed and six damaged. That the enemy\nput-his maximum effort into the attack is\nevidenced by the fact that the second wave\nincluded Naval aircraft.\n\n20. During January the Spitfire squadrons:\ngained valuable experience in air fighting and\ntactics that was to stand them in good stead:\nin the greater battles to come. The enemy\ncontinued to send fighter sweeps over the\nArakan, but Spitfires were able to inflict\ncasualties upon them in the ratio of eight to\none. By this time two squadrons of Spitfire\nVdIIs (Nos. 81 and 152) had arrived from\nMiddle East, and I now had at my disposal\nin the forward areas of Bengal four squadrons\nof Spitfires and nine of Hurricanes for fighter\noperations; the stage was thus set for the\nopening of the battle in Arakan on the 4th\nFebruary. Anticipating our own ground offen-\nsive by four days the enemy launched an attack\nwith the object of annihilating the 5th and 7th\nIndian Divisions and pressing on to capture\nChittagong. This ambitious plan was attended\nby the most impressive measure of air support\nafforded by him in this theatre, sweeps by for-\nmations of fifty plus aircraft being reported\ndaily. The objects of the J.A.F. appear to have\nbeen firstly to intercept our aircraft engaged\non close support, secondly to increase the\nmorale of his own troops and thirdly to give\nsome measure of ground support by attacks\non our positions and forward bases. As the\nbattle developed, one other task assumed over~\ntiding priority for the enemy air forces. The\n\nth Indian Division, cut off from its supply\nbases, was being supplied wholly by air. It\nwas of vital importance to the enemy that our\nsupply-dropping aircraft should not succeed in\nthis task, but the air superiority which we had\nestablished, the provision of standing patrols.\n\u2014particularly in the Kaladan Valley where,\nowing to the intervening hills, no radar cover\nbelow 10,000 feet was available\u2014and resort to-\nsupply dropping by night enabled transport.\naircraft to maintain the beleaguered forces for\nthe loss of only one Dakota (C.47) to enemy\nfighters.\n\n21. The tactics which were employed to gair\nthis dominance over the Arakan battle front\ncentred around the three forward squadrons\nequipped with Spitfire Vs and a few Spitfire\nVIlIs. Hurricanes were used for airfield cover\nwhen Spitfires were re-fuelling and re-arming,\nand for standing patrols over possible target.\nareas during hostile raids in case of a missed\ninterception. The enemy countered by intro-\nducing the Tojo. whose performance exceeded\nthat of the Oscar, adopting the defensive circle:\nand splitting into small groups when the circle:\nwas broken. This brought them a relative\nmeasure of success inasmuch as their losses:\ndecreased whilst those of the Spitfires gradually\nincreased.\n\n22. The advantages of the Spitfire VIII ix\nthis battle were not immediately apparent, for\n\nA2\n",

No.\n436 Squadron, who re-equipped with these\naircraft in February, could not effectively em-\nploy their high overtaking speed against an\nenemy who exploited the manoeuvrability of\nhis aircraft to the full. At first attacks were\ndelivered at too high a speed with a resultant\nfalling off in marksmanship.\n\n23. When the battle switched to the Chind-\nwin front in the second week in March and it\nbecame clear that the main Japanese ground\neffort was to be aimed at Imphal and the rail-\nway to the north, 243 Wing and eight squad-\nrons were moved into the area from 224 Group.\nSpitfires did not immediately repeat their suc-\ncesses of the Arakan campaign for the follow-\ning reasons. Firstly, although the three Ground\nControl Interception Stations were excellent\nand brought off fine interceptions against\nDinahs (No. 81 Squadron scored their first\nsuccesses in this theatre by destroying two in\nfour days at. the beginning of March), the\nrugged nature of the terrain produced techni-\ncal difficulties in the way of echoes which left\nmany blank spots in the radar coverage.\nSecondly, the substitution of Indian Mobile\nWireless Observer Companies for R.A.F. Wire-\nless Units resulted in a lower standard of re-\nporting. Thirdly, squadrons which had already\nlost a number of experienced pilots in action\nwere now losing many more as operational\ntours were completed. Moreover, the sudden\ninflux of personnel, both Army and R.AF.\ncould not be met with a similar growth of trans-\nport, accommodation and communications.\nFinally, as the Japanese advanced, more and\nmore of our early warning system was over-\nrun, and the Army Corps Commander decided\nthat he could not employ troops on local pro-\ntection of airfields and the warning net. Squad-\ndon personnel became exhausted through dis-\nturbed rest, and guard duties by night com-\nbined with operations by day. Certain\nsquadrons were therefore withdrawn from the\nImphal Valley whilst others were flown out\nevery night.\n\n24. Once again the problem of protecting\ntransport aircraft operating so near to Japanese\nbases asserted itself. Deteriorating weather\nand absence of warning made it increasingly\ndifficult to ensure interception, but that our\n\u2018superiority was never lost is shown by the fact\nthat between the opening of the battle and the\nend of May, thirty-one enemy aircraft were\ndestroyed, twenty probably destroyed and sixty-\nsix damaged in air combat over the Manipur\narea, for the loss of seventeen. Of this num-\nber, three were destroyed by No. 176 (Beau-\nfighter) Squadron operating at night from\nadvanced airfields near Imphal.\n\n25. Meanwhile the accretion to the Com-\nmand of long-range American fighter aircraft\nenabled tactics to be developed which were\nito have most damaging results for the Japanese\nAir Force. Already Mustangs (P.51) had\n\u2018proved their worth, notably in a combined\nvictory with Kittyhawks (P.40) against an\n\u2018enemy formation in the Digboi area on -27th\nMarch, claiming 26 destroyed and 4 probably\n\u2018destroyed, for the loss of two. The Amny re-\n\u2018ported finding twenty-two crashed enemy air-\n\u2018craft in the area after the interception. At\n\u2018the same time, No. 459 (U.S.) Squadron,\nequipped with Lightnings (P.38) began to\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\noperate under 224 Group. Thus, it was pos-\nsible to employ Lightnings (P.38) and Mus-\ntangs (P.51) to supplement the work of the\nSpitfires which were still in short supply, and\nhad to be husbanded for purely defensive work.\nThe serious contraction of the warning system\naround Imphal could now be partly offset by\nsending the American long range fighters to\nintercept the enemy on his return to the Central\nIrrawaddy strips.\n\n26. The first success of the policy of intru-\nsion fell to No. 1 Air Commando Force, which\nsurprised a large concentration of aircraft on\nthe Shwebo group of airfields on 8th March,\nand destroyed 46 of them. Three days later,\nthe Lightnings (P.38) squadron scored 15\nagainst the enemy at Heho. The primitive\nnature of the Japanese warning system in the\narea augured well for the successful continu-\nance of the operations. Pilots became increas-\ningly familiar with the details of those airfields\nwhich were within range, and photographs and\nmodels aided quick identification of dispersal\nareas and anti-aircraft posts. In early strikes\nof this nature the enemy were not airborne\nand awaiting attack, and it was possible to\nmake more than one run over the target, the\nfirst run being utilised to locate aircraft in their\ndispersal pens.\n\n27. In May, an improvement in the enemy\u2019s\nwarning system became evident, since often\nfighters were airborne and awaiting the attack.\nHowever, losses remained low, since No. 459\nSquadron discovered that if they maintained\nan indicated airspeed of 300 m.p.h. and refused\nto enter into combat with the slower and more\nmanoeuvrable Oscars and Tojos, they were\nstill able to deliver their attacks at aircraft\non the ground, perhaps fire one burst at any\nfighter which attempted to intercept and make\ntheir withdrawal without loss. The prospect\nof combat during the intrusion therefore proved\nno deterrent. In this manner No. 459 Squad-\nron destroyed 121 enemy aircraft on the\nground or in the air in March, April and May.\nThe enemy was forced in consequence to dis-\ncontinue the use of the Shwebo group of air-\nfields and even Heho and Meiktila became\npractically untenable. By the end of May,\nthe J.A.F. had been forced into the humiliat-\ning position of providing such support as their\narmy, 600 miles away in the northern moun-\ntains, could receive from the comparative\nsafety of airfields around Rangoon.\n\n28. To sum up, the extent of Allied\nsuperiority in the air throughout the period\ncan be seen by a comparison of the effort and\nlosses of the opposing forces. The enemy scale\nof effort amounted to 2,700 sorties sighted or\nplotted, or less than three per cent. of the\nAllied effort. To achieve this, the J.AF. lost\n402 aircraft destroyed in the air or on the\nground, or some 14 per cent. of their effort,\nwhile the comparable total for British and\nAmerican forces amounted to 230 or less than\none-third per cent. of the effort. The air\nsuperiority maintained over the period needs\nno further emphasis.\n\n* * * * * +\n\nTI.\u2014AiR TRANSPORT OPERATIONS\n29.

Indeed,\nit is not too much to say that their services\nwere instrumental in preserving the existence\nof the Fourteenth Army as a striking force on\nthe Burma frontier. Operations on the Eastern\nfront made calls upon them at an ever in-\ncreasing rate, so that despite reinforcement,\ntransport squadrons worked at a high rate of\neffort from the moment they became opera-\ntional. In consequence, crews underwent a\nperiod of considerable strain, for not only\ndoes supply dropping in this theatre involve\nintricate low flying over the dropping zone\nfor as much as an hour in a hot aircraft in-\nterior, but the crews were normally responsible\nfor the arduous work of unloading 6,000 to\n7,000 Ibs. of freight.\n\nDevelopment of Troop Carrier Command.\n\n30. In November, the only R.A-F. transport\nsquadron operating was No. 31, an experienced\nand pioneer unit, but the Ist and 2nd Troop\nCarrier Squadrons U.S.A.A.F. had begun to\nwork over the northern sector of the front\nand there were other squadrons both British\nand American, either in training or on their\nway. Unified operational control of these\nforces was effected by the institution in\nDecember of Troop Carrier Command, Eastern\nAir Command, under Brigadier General W. D.\nOld, U.S.A.A.F., administrative control re-\nmaining in the usual British or American\nchannels.. Headquarters was _ established\nat Comilla on 2nd January, 1944, in close\nproximity to the Headquarters of Fourteenth\nArmy and of the Third Tactical Air Force, as\nwell as to main Army supply bases. Sub-\nsequent operations illustrated the dependence\nof air transport operations upon the tactical\nair situation, and in order to combine final\nresponsibility for the former with the exercise\nof our air superiority\u2014as well as to integrate\nair transport with army policy\u2014Troop Carrier\nCommand was placed under the control of\nthe Air Commander, Third Tactical Air Force,\nfrom Ist May. Subsequently Troop Carrier\nCommand was dissolved as from 4th June,\nby when its component squadrons numbered\n8\u20144 R.A. and 4 U.S.A.A.F. Moreover, in\nFebruary the Air Transport Command had\nloaned to'me twenty-two Commandos (C.46)\nto meet the emergency in the Arakan, and\nwhen it became necessary to return these in\nApril, five US.A.A-F. Troop Carrier squad-\nrons and the larger part of 216 Squadron\nR.A.F, were detached to work with my Com-\nmand from M.A.A.F. Upon their return to\nthe Mediterranean theatre in June, aircraft and\ncrews from the Strategic Air Force were\nattached to the Third Tactical Air Force to fill\nthe gap until the first of the U.S.A.A.F. Com-\nbat Cargo Groups became operational.\nDuring its short but eventful life of little over\nsix months, Troop Carrier Command had thus\nincreased more than four-fold in size, and even\nmore in significance.\n\n31. The routine supply dropping missions of\nNo. 31 Squadron over the Chin Hills and\nArakan were being continued at the time of\nthe formation of South East Asia Command.\nThe first additional need was that of 81 (West\nAfrican) Division which already in December\nreceived supplies landed for it at Chiringa\nby U.S.A.AF. It then moved eastwards over\nthe mountains to the Kaladan Valley at\n\n1385\n\nDaletme and began its advance southwards,\nbeing dependent throughout for its mainten-\nance upon air supply. From 7th January,\n1944, onwards, this became a commitment of\nNo. 62 Squadron R.AF. At the same time\nU.S.A.A.F. aircraft came to the help of No.\n31 Squadron in building up a large reserve\nof supplies at Tiddim, while further north,\nNos. 1 and 2 Troop Carrier Squadrons\nU.S.A.AF. in addition to maintaining the air\nwarning centres screening the Assam Valley,\nbegan to supply on a much larger scale the\ntwo Chinese Divisions advancing south-east\nfrom Ledo down the Hukawng Valley. They\nalso gave help to the Kachin levies waging\nguerrilla warfare in the Fort Hertz district, as\nwell as to the Gurkha garrison of Fort Hertz\nitself.\n\nThe Arakan Battle\u2014February, 1944.\n\n32. When the Japanese offensive in the\nArakan opened on 4th February, the needs of\nthe 14th Army for air supply greatly expanded\nwith only a few days\u2019 warning. The land\ncommunications of 7th Indian Division were\nsoon cut and those of 5th Indian Division in\ndanger, and it was only by supply dropping\nthat the encircled forces could be expected\nto stand their ground and turn a potential\ncatastrophe into a decisive victory. Japanese\npreparations for an offensive had been ob-\nserved, however, and the possibility of en-\ncirclement envisaged, so that when supply by\nair was called for on 8th February, there was\nno delay.\n\n33. On the first day some of our transport\naircraft encountered an enemy fighter sweep\nand one was shot down. Such was our air\nsuperiority that throughout the Arakan opera-\ntions this was the only loss sustained by trans-\nport aircraft from enemy fighters, although\nmany aircraft were damaged by fire from the\nground. Later, as a measure of protection,\nmuch of the supply dropping was done by\n\n\u2018night with but little falling off in efficiency.\n\nThe operation while it lasted was of such\nunexpected magnitude that I was compelled\nto request the loan of a number of Commandos\n(C.46) from the India-China Wing of the U.S.\nAir Transport Command. These aircraft were\npromptly and unstintingly supplied. The\ncritical period from the 8th February to 6th\nMarch inclusive involved the delivery of 2,010\n\n\u2018short tons of supplies of all kinds, including\n\nrations, animals, ammunition and P.O.L.'\nWith such large scale help, ground forces were\nable to break out of their encirclement and\ninflict a decisive defeat on the enemy\u2014-signifi-\ncant in that it pointed the way towards the\nneutralisation of the long familiar Japanese\noffensive tactics. By the end of the month, air\nsupply to the Arakan, though it still continued,\nwas no longer of an emergency nature.\n\nOperation \u201c Thursday\u201d.\n\n34. The major offensive action planned and\ncarried out by 14th Army before the onset\nof the monsoon, was a penetration of enemy-\noccupied territory by columns of Special Force\nunder Major General O. C. Wingate. _ Its\npurpose was to disrupt enemy communications\nand thereby aid the recapture of northern\nBurma and create a favourable situation for\nthe 14th Army to exploit.

The First\nAir Commando Unit under Colonel Cochran,\nUS.A.A.F., had been specially created and\nsent to this theatre to fill these needs, and\nacted as a task force in support of General\nWingate. I have dealt with the activities of\nthis force separately.\n\n35. The long range penetration brigade\nwhich was making its way across the Chindwin\noverland towards Katha received its first air-\nborne suppiies on 10th February, and its main-\ntenance thereafter became a continuous com-\nmitment. The remaining two brigades were\nlanded on two strips improvised in the jungle\nduring the nights of Sth/6th and 10th/11th\nMarch, and a fourth and fifth brigade were\nflown into another landing ground during the\nnights of 24th/25th March and 5th/6th April.\nThe successful accomplishment of the air side\nof this operation was shared directly by the\nFirst Air Commando Unit and by the British\nand American Transport squadrons which\nsparticipated, although the whole operation was\nonly made possible by the high degree of\nair superiority gained by the tactical air forces\nin the preceding months.\n\n36. The initial fly-in was the work of gliders\nwhich carried an American airfield engineer\ncompany whose task it was to receive Dakotas\n{C.47) on the following night, and also a suffi-\ncient number of combat troops with equipment\nto defend the locality meanwhile. Although\nthis preparatory operation was a complete\nsuccess, it was twice in danger of being com-\npromised. The first occasion was when at the\nlast moment it was discovered by photographic\nreconnaissance that one of the jungle clearings\nearmarked for use and called \u201c Piccadilly \u201d had\nbeen deliberately obstructed by the enemy.\nThe commanders on the spot decided to con-\ntinue with the operation and divert the aircraft\nintended for \u201c Piccadilly \u201d to the other landing\nzone\u2014\u2018 Broadway \u201d. Secondly, the towing of\ngliders in pairs proved impracticable under the\ndifficult flying conditions encountered; tow\nropes snapped and a number of gliders failed\nto reach their destination. Moreover there\nexisted in the clearing a number of undulations\nnot visible on air photographs, so that even\non making the best of landings the earlier\ngliders frequently crashed, and each wrecked\nglider became a source of danger for its\nsuccessors. Worse confusion and damage was\navoided by the airfield control improvised by\nLt.-Col. Allison of the U.S.A.AF. who was\nable to stop the arrival of additional gliders.\nDespite these difficulties, by the next night the\nAmerican airborne engineer unit and British\ntroops had levelled \u201c Broadway\u201d sufficiently\nfor Dakotas (C.47) to land. The Air Com-\nmander 3rd T.A.F. commented particularly on\nthe quality of the airfield control and the\nexcellent flying discipline that were features\nof the operation, which enabled the strip to\nbe used almost to saturation by a constant\nstream of transport aircraft in the short hours\nof darkness available. His report remarks as\nfollows : \u201c Nobody has seen a transport opera-\ntion until he has . . . watched Dakotas coming\nin and taking off in opposite directions on a\n\nsingle strip all night long at the rate of one -\n\nlanding or one take-off every three minutes \u201d,\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\n37. By D plus 6 day there had been flown\nin 9,052 personnel, 175 ponies, 1,183 mules and\n509,083 pounds of stores.\n\n38. The element of surprise which had\naccompanied the entry of these forces and\nwhich had been aided by diversionary bomb-\ning around Bhamo and Indaw was maintained\nthroughout. Even when the enemy divined\nour intentions, our air superiority was instru-\nmental in rendering his attacks ineffectual. It\nwas not until 11th March and 13th March\nthat the enemy attacked the two landing\ngrounds which had been first extemporised\u2014\nby which time one had already been evacuated\nand a detachment of Spitfires of No. 81 Squad-\nron had been installed on the other. Other\nlanding strips were contrived as the occasion\narose, though for the most part the thirty\ncolumns of the division were supplied by drop-\nping. Much of the effectiveness of this air\nsupply depended upon the standard of training\nof the Dakota crews, The dropping zones\nwere continually being changed as the columns\nmoved from place to place. Delivery normally\ntook place by night and there was often no\nather guide than navigational skill supple-\nmented by pre-arranged light signals which be-\ncame visible only when the aircraft arrived in\nthe vicinity of the dropping zone. Danger from\nground fire whilst dropping was a frequent and\naccepted risk. This was no less true of occa-\nsions on which Dakotas were able to utilise a\nlanding ground, for enemy detachments were\noften in the neighbourhood. The strip opened\nin the later stages of the operation at Hopin\nwas evacuated because of small arms fire\nthrough which our aircraft had unavoidably\nto pass before landing.\n\n39. Before the advent of the rains made the\nuse of fairweather landing grounds impossible,\none Brigade (No. 16) was flown back to its\nbase in India. The others subsequently joined\nthe Chinese-American forces advancing upon\nMyitkyina under General J. W. Stilwell, and\nparticipated in the operations around Myit-\nkyina, to whose success their columns, sup-\nplied entirely by air, had contributed.\n\nFirst Air Commando Unit.\n\n40. This unit came to my command with\nthe specific duty of assisting the fly-in of\nSpecial Force, the initial maintenance of its\ncolumns and the evacuation of casualties.\nThese functions were extended to include direct\nsupport of the ground forces and sustained\nattacks on installations and communications\nto hinder the eventual mobilisation of the\nenemy against these forces. The Bomber-\nFighter component was engaged from the 3rd\nFebruary onwards in attacks on railways and \u00a9\nairfields and, as soon as the fiy-in had been\naccomplished, in direct support when called\nfor by the columns. In these tasks the\nMustangs (P.51) flew 1,482 sorties and the\nMitchells (B.25) 422. Their claims against\nenemy aircraft destroyed on the ground and\nin the air amounted to ninety. The glider\ncomponent of the force carried out fourteen\nseparate operations involving the release of\n99 gliders which took into Burma a variety of\nequipment ranging from bulldozers to river-\ncraft. .\n\n41. An important part was played in the\noperation by the hundred light communication\naircraft which the Air Commando possessed.\n",

                                "value": "SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\nThese aircraft (L.ls and L.5s) could land\nmore or less at will even in bad country to\nconvey messages and supplies of small bulk,\nto carry commanders from one unit to another,\nevacuate casualties and perform a host of\nmiscellaneous services without the risks\nattendant upon wireless silence or employing\nheavy aircraft. I consider their widespread\nuse in future comparable operations essential.\n\n42. The record of the small force of selected\npersonnel with first-class equipment, which\nconstituted the Air Commando, was naturally\ngood, but that record cannot be advanced in\nsupport of extending the principle of Air Com-\nmando Units. Such a principle gives rise to\nthe. danger of tying down fighter and bomber\naircraft permanently and exclusively to one\nparticular Army formation with the consequent\ntisks of duplication and lack of flexibility.\n\n43. Such anits have a place as spearheads\nfor airborne and air transit operations, but\nas soon as normal supply can begin, fighter\ncover and air support, as requisite, should be\nprovided by the tactical air forces as a whole\nunder the direction of the appropriate air force\nCommander.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nThe Siege of Imphal.\n\n44. Concurrent with the heavy claims on\nTroop Carrier Command from Special Force\nand General Stilwell\u2019s forces arose an emer-\ngency that surpassed in importance all other\ntransport operations, and on whose successful\nsolution by air supply depended the fate of\nImphal and the continuance of support to\nChina.\n\n45. On the 7/8th March the enemy crossed\nthe Chindwin in force with the three-fold object\nof occupying Indian soil, capturing our main\nbase at Imphal, and cutting the Bengal-Assam\nrailway which fed the airfields from which\nsupplies were flown to China.\n\n46. Before the end of March, the enemy had\ncut the Tiddim-Imphal and Imphal-Kohima\nroads, occupied Tiddim and part of Kohima\nand swept round to the Bishenpur area west\nof Imphal. From the air point of view, the\nover-running of our warning system and the\nloss of advanced landing grounds on the peri-\nmeter of the Imphal plain were a serious\ninconvenience. The encirclement of the IV\nCorps divisions at Imphal, however, had\nimmediate and heavy repercussions upon the\ntransport situation, since I was forthwith con-\nfronted with unprecedented demands for the\nlarge scale delivery of reinforcements and\nsupplies, not merely to the beleaguered forces\nin the Imphal Plain, but also to the garrisons\nholding out at Kohima and elsewhere. These\ndemands were met, though not without con-\nsiderable strain upon an already hard-worked\nforce.\n\n47. It was clear that the needs of our ground\nforces could not long be satisfied by the\nexisting number of transport aircraft under my\ncommand. Thus, when the threat of a\nJapanese offensive westwards from the\nChindwin had become apparent, although\nbefore it actually materialised, I made strong\nrepresentations for further reinforcements of\ntransport aircraft. As a result I received on\nloan from M.A.A.F. the services of the 64th\nTroop Carrier Group, U.S.A.A.F., consisting\n\n1387\n\nof five squadrons and a detachment of No. 216\nSquadron, R.A.F. These six squadrons were\nall operating on the Burma Front by the second\nweek in April. In addition, I was permitted\nto retain for a further period the Commandos\n(C.46) temporarily withdrawn from the India-\nChina Wing of the Air Transport Command\nfor supply dropping in Arakan.\n\n48. The needs of our forces in the Manipur\narea were many and pressing. No. 50 Para-\nchute Brigade was flown from the Punjab to\nreinforce the garrison at Imphal, and a little\nlater No. 5 Indian Division was moved by air\ncomplete from the Arakan in 758 sorties.\nBetween 10th/15th April, an infantry brigade\nwas flown from Amarda Road, south-west of\nCalcutta to Jorhat in Assam. 99 Commando\n(C.46) and 189 Dakota (C.47) sorties lifted\n3,056 all ranks, 937,000 pounds of stores and\nthe following equipment: 50 motor-cycles,\n40 jeeps, 31 jeep trailers, 16 25-pounders and\neight 3.7 howitzers. An Army Air Support\nControl unit was taken by air from Poona to\nJorhat for service with 33 Corps. The move-\nment by air of the servicing echelons of tactical\nsquadrons became a matter of routine. In\nregard to the maintenance of our troops, the\nmost varied articles were delivered to the forces\nmomentarily engulfed within the flood of\nJapanese infiltration. At Kohima, for instance,\nowing to the enemy seizure of the wells, it was\nnecessary to drop drinking water as well as\nroutine supplies and medical necessities.\nThree hundred and seventy tons of bitumenised\nhessian were delivered by air at Tulihal to\nmake the airfield there all-weather. On the\nreturn journeys all transport aircraft brought\nout with them casualties or troops not needed\nfor active combat.\n\n49. The 79 aircraft borrowed from the\nMiddle East were due to be returned at the\nbeginning of May. If this arrangement had\nbeen adhered to the consequences might well\nhave been disastrous. General Stilwell\u2019s forces\nwould have been forced to withdraw to their\nLedo base, the Imphal Plain would have\nbecome untenable, the air route to China\nthreatened, the morale of the Fourteenth Army\ntroops encircled in the Imphal Plain would\nhave been considerably affected and the all-\nweather airfields and warning system in the\nSurma and Brahmaputra Valleys would have\nbeen lost. Moreover, the major victory the\nenemy might have won would have had serious\ntepercussions in India.\n\n50. I was compelled to represent that these\nvital aircraft must stay until the reinforcements\nenvisaged by the Chiefs of Staff arrived and\nbecame operational. Agreement was obtained,\nand I instructed the Air Commander, Eastern\nAir Command, to employ aircraft of the\nStrategic Air Force in a transport r\u00e9le should\nthere be any gap between the departure of the\nM.A.A.F, squadrons and the new reinforce-\nments becoming fully operational.\n\n51. On 15th April my commitment for air\nsupply to the besieged garrison at Imphal was\nestablished at the figure of over 400 short tons\nper day\u2014which even then entailed the occu-\npants going on short rations. The fulfilment\nof this contract depended upon a modicum of\nfair weather and upon the speedy loading of\naircraft at Army supply bases. Neither of\nthese conditions was entirely fulfilled, and it\nwas only by reorganisation of the ground\n",

Throughout the whole period the supply\nof the Chinese-American forces operating from\nLedo under General Stilwell had been pro-\nceeding. These troops were advancing down\nthe Hukawng and Mogaung Valleys and\nthereby gradually bringing the opening of an\noverland route to China nearer realisation.\nEach advance took them further from their\nbases, and consequently their calls for air\nsupply were increasing, necessitating up to\n100 sorties per day. Landing grounds were\nconstructed wherever possible along the path\nof the advance, and light aircraft were\nemployed with good effect. The Dakota\n(C.47), however, remained as the greatest single\nfactor in maintaining the advance. In April\nthe entire 50th Chinese Division, numbering\nalmost eight thousand men, was flown from\nSookerating to Maingkwan, while by then all\nthe combat troops in North Burma, both\nAmerican and Chinese, had become dependent\nupon air supply. In May, a fast moving\ncolumn of American troops, known as Galahad\nForce and supported entirely by air, made a\nconsiderable detour and caught the enemy\nunawares, seizing the main airfield at\nMyitkyina on 17th May. All units of Troop\nCarrier Command in the north had been\nstanding by to carry in those forces which\nGeneral Stilwell believed adequate to defeat\nthe expected enemy counter attack. Brigadier-\nGeneral Old was waiting at Shinbuiyang to\nconduct the initial glider operation in which\ntroops and engineering equipment were to be\nconveyed, and himself towed the first glider\ninto Myitkyina. Transport aircraft followed\nthe gliders almost at once. In the course of\nthirty-six hours of intensive operations by both\nday and night, during which ground fire was\ncontinually encountered, and one enemy air\nattack was successful in shooting down a\nDakota (C.47) and destroying others on the\nground, there were landed a complete Chinese\nRegiment, six light anti-tank batteries, twelve\nBofor guns and crews, one airborne engineer\ncompany and a Chinese mortar company.\nMany loads of ammunition, food and stores\nwere also conveyed. Before the end of the\nmonth further troops, in numbers equivalent to\na division, had been taken by air to Myitkyina,\nand the first stage of the reconquest of Burma\nand the reopening of the Burma Road was\ncompleted.\n\nEvacuation of Casualties.\n\n53. It would be incomplete to close this \u00a9\n\naccount of the operations of transport aircraft\nunder my command without some mention of\na further aspect of their work. During the first\nfive months of 1944 the aircraft of Troop Car-\nrier Command flew no less than twenty-three\nthousand sick and wounded back to safety. It\nmay safely be said that but for the provision of\nair transport the greater proportion of these\nwould have had little hope of survival. The\nalternative was many days\u2019 journey by sam-\n\nSUPPLEMENT To THz LONDON GAZETTE, 19 MARCH, 1951\n\npan, mule and ambulance, and perhaps rail,\nto the nearest base hospital. Moreover, a pro-\nportion of the casualties evacuated were from\nthe columns of Special Force fighting in enemy\noccupied territory. The 2,126 casualties evacu-\nated from the division by the end of May\nwould have been a total loss had they not been\nflown out by air.\n\n54. Although evacuation of casualties by air\nwas no new phenomenon in this theatre of war,\nnevertheless it first assumed considerable pro-\nportions during the Arakan battle in February\nand reached its peak during the struggle for\nImphal in April. Transport aircraft, when\nthey landed to deliver supplies frequently re-\nceived casualties for the return journey. When,\nhowever, supplies were dropped, the interven-\ntion of light aircraft was necessary for the\njourney from a small advanced landing ground\nto a strip further back where a Dakota might\nland. But since neither heavy nor light aircraft\ncould be spared throughout this period speci-\nfically for the evacuation of casualties, the\nremoval of sick and wounded remained an\n\u201cad hoc\u201d matter arranged on a basis of ex-\npediency and improvisation. R.A.F. medical\npersonnel at airfields were insufficient to deal\nwith the load of casualties which, due to opera-\ntional exigencies, might be entrusted to them\nwith little or no warning by a flight of trans-\nport Dakotas. And so, although the care of\nall wounded at airfields was officially an R.A.F.\nresponsibility, nevertheless help in this matter\nwas gladly accepted from the Army.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\n55. Thus air transport played a decisive part\nin the three great battles of the period. By\nthe end of May the reconquest of portions of\nnorthern Burma was in sight, and the garrison\nof Imphal was still an offensive force. The\nevents related above make a reiteration of the\nimportance of transport aircraft unnecessary.\nIn connection with the operations, however,\ncertain lessons were learned which I would\nemphasize. First, it is essential that Army\nCommanders should not be allowed to regard\nair transport as an auxiliary arm upon which\nthey can call without reference to the appro-\npriate Air Force Commander. Secondly, the\nArmy must be impressed with the necessity for\nthe quick turn-round of aircraft; during in-\ntensive operations loads must be ready for the\naircraft as they land. Too often crews wasted\nvaluable hours waiting at an Army Supply\nBase because their freight had not been\nassembled ready for loading. Thirdly, when the\nArmy are the main customers of air transport\nforces, the fullest day-to-day liaison and dis-\ncussion of problems must be combined with\nclear statements as far in advance as possible\nof what they require in the way of air trans-\nport, and for what purpose, in order that\npriorities may be allotted.\n\n56. It is to be noted that the inadequacy |\nof the Army ground organisation for supply by\nair operations became recognised by the Army\nas and when these operations became large-\nscale undertakings. Steps were taken to im-\nprove the ground organisation in the light of\nthe experience gained during the operations.\nThe first step was to provide Indian Air Sup-\nply companies at supply loading airfields. A\nfurther important development was to create\nArmy staff organisations both to control the\n\n",

These developments did not,\nhowever, reach completion during the period\ncovered by this despatch.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nTI.\u2014Strratecic Air Force\n\n57. Operations by heavy and medium bom-\nbers sought to accomplish the following tasks:\n\n@ Denial and destruction of the enemy's\nlines of communication.\n\nGi) Destruction of airfields and other mili-\ntary installations.\n\nGii) Destruction of industrial and stores\nareas.\n\n58. In addition to these, the Strategic Air\nForce was often called upon to furnish direct\nsupport to ground forces and to provide air-\ncraft and crews for transport operations.\n\n59. For the transhipment of sea-borne sup-\nplies to Burma, there were available to the\nenemy the ports of Rangoon, Moulmein, Tavoy\nand Mergui; the three latter are all connected\nby rail or road to Rangoon. In addition to\nthese, the enemy could use the port of Bangkok\nand two lesser ports in the Gulf of Siam, Koh\nSichang and Sattahib, both with adequate com-\nmunications to Bangkok. From here the vital\nBurma-Siam railway, which was completed\nabout the beginning of the period under re-\nview, could transport supplies to Moulmein,\nthence across the Salween by ferry to\nMartaban, rail again to the Sittang River where\nthe bridge was down, once again a ferry, and\nso to all points of use by rail. Among the\nmeasures designed to deny these facilities to\nthe enemy was the laying of a total of 89 mines\nin the harbours of Rangoon, Moulmein, Tavoy\nand Mergui, and, further afield, at Bangkok\nand the Gulf of Siam ports. Though the num-\nber of mines laid was not large, the results\nexceeded expectations. Moreover, it must be\nremembered that the effort involved was con-\nsiderable, sometimes necessitating flights of\n2,300 miles. The enemy\u2019s lack of efficient\nminesweeping equipment caused much delay\nin the clearance of harbours, and intelligence\nreports show that considerable dislocation and\ndamage was caused to shipping.\n\n60. Attacks against rail communications\naccounted for almost 25 per cent. of all opera-\ntions. Destruction of the larger installations\nwas allotted to the heavy bombers, with parti-\ncular emphasis on Rangoon, Bangkok and\nMandalay. Wellingtons operating by night\nwere directed mainly against railway centres.\nThe Mitchells\u2019 (B.25) performance and charac-\nteristics made them particularly suitable for\nrailway sweeps and the destruction of bridges.\nIn this connection, the spiked bombs that came\ninto use in March proved invaluable and were\nused to tear up stretches of the permanent way\nat intervals over many miles of track. Bridges\nof strategic importance were attacked con-\ntinuously and attacks were repeated each time\nthe enemy completed repair work. An ex-\ncellent example of this was the Sittang Bridge\nat Mokpalin. Destroyed during the evacua-\ntion from Burma, the bridge was repaired after\nlong and arduous work by the enemy. The\nprogress of the work was carefully followed\nby reconnaissance, and as soon as it was com-\npleted the bridge was wrecked once more in\n\n1389\n\na single operation. It has not been repaired\nsince this attack.\n\n61. The overall strategy of rendering each\npart of the railway system ineffective was ex-\nemplified in the spirited low-level attack on the\nBurma-Siam railway by American Liberators\n(B.24), the series of attacks on marshalling\nyards at Bangkok and Moulmein, and the\nmining of the ferry crossings at Martaban and\nMokpalin. At shorter range, the railway from\nRangoon to Myitkyina was subject to con-\ntinuous attacks, with the result that throughout\nits length there was always one bridge or more\nout of action. Amongst these bridges which\nwere put out of action were the Mu River,\nMyittha, Meza, Kyungon, Zawchaung, Budalin,\nSongon, Natmauk, Tantabin, Swa, Tangon,\nYe-u, Sinthe, Pyu, Bawgyo, Pyawbwe,\nMyingatha, Natkyigon, Daga and Myothit.\nWhenever intelligence indicated that enemy\ntroops or supplies were moving in quantity.\nsweeps were undertaken along the stretches of\ntrack approaching the battle fronts.\n\n62. Attacks on road facilities and communi-\ncations began in earnest in April 1944, when\nthe threat to the Imphal Plain assumed serious\nproportions. One enemy division moving north\nfrom the Tiddim area had, as its main line\nof supply, the motor road leading from Ye-u.\nTwo other divisions attacking from the east\nacross the Chindwin were largely dependent\nupon the road from Wuntho. Mitchells (B.25)\nand Wellingtons began on the 18th April an\nalmost daily assault upon these vital arteries\nand the supplies moving along them. While\nthe former carried out low-level daylight\nsweeps, the latter took up the r\u00e9le of intruders\nby night, replacing Beaufighters which Third\nTactical Air Force considered could not be\nusefully or economically employed on moon-\nless nights. The sum of these attacks, other\naspects of which I have described elsewhere in\nthis Despatch, contributed greatly to the con-\nstant shortage and slow transit of men and\nsupplies which dogged the enemy throughout\nhis offensive.\n\n63. The effort by strategic bombers to\nneutralise the Japanese Air Force was directed\nprimarily to the destruction of airfield instal-\nlations and supplies. At the beginning of\nFebruary a large-scale operation by night was\nundertaken against the Heho group of air-\nfields in conjunction with Beaufighters, who\nwere to follow up the attack at dawn. From\nthe Strategic Air Force point of view, the\noperation was highly successful, photographs\nrevealing many bomb patterns in vulnerable\nareas. The Beaufighter attacks were ham-\npered, however, by early morning mist.\n\n64. Of industrial targets, oil installations\nwere one of the primary objectives. A con-\ncentrated bombing programme was carried out\nagainst facilities at Yenangyaung in which\nAmerican daylight bombers demonstrated their\naccuracy to such an extent that twice Beau-\nfighters operating in the area the following\nnight reported large fires still burning. In\nlate 1943 this plant was producing 600 barrels\nof crude oil daily, from which were extracted\n5,000 gallons of petrol. By May, 1944, the\ndaily processed yield had been reduced to\n1,680 gallons. Installations at Chauk, Lanywa,\nand Thilawa were dealt with in a like fashion.\nAttacks against other industrial areas were\nreserved for the few large towns where targets\n",
