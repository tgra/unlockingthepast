            "description": "129. Japanese naval forces were not long in appearing in strength before Miri. By the 16th December, some ten warships had been sighted in company with a tanker off Miri and Lutong, and these ships became the object of our attacks. On the 17th December, 6 Glenn Martins and 5 Buffaloes of the Netherlands East Indies Air Force delivered an attack from Sinkawang, but scored neither hits nor near misses. The same day, Dutch bombers from Samiuwkoa located and attacked this force, a Dutch navy Dornier scoring a direct hit on a destroyer. Encounters between Dutch Buffaloes and the Navy Zero fighters revealed the clear superiority of the Japanese aircraft. Reports of a Japanese landing at Lutong and Baram Point were received, and on the 18th December renewed attacks on enemy shipping in this area were made, without success, by a mixed force. Eight Glenn Martins from Sinkawang had to return without delivering their attack owing to the bad weather, The following day 6 Netherlands East Indies Glen Martins claimed a  hit on a cruiser and some near misses. The roth December, however, was also marked by Japanese air attacks, Kuching aerodrome and town being bombed by about 15 heavy bombers and one seaplane. Civilians suffered approximately 100 casualties, while the main material damage was the destruction of the Borneo Company Benzine Stores, The air war was also carried to Dutch Territory by a heavy attack on Pontianak, much of the city  being destroyed."

This raid was most successfully carried out by 12th (A) Division. In order to gain maximum experience of moving large M.T. columns over long distances at night, both the rst S.A. and the 24th Gold Coast Brigades were used, although the forces in El Wak were known to consist of only one battalion and 16 guns and some Banda. A large proportion of the enemy battalion escaped into the bush, but all the guns, a quantity of stores, and a number of prisoners were captured at a very small loss to our troops, and considerable loss in killed and wounded to the enemy."

It was intended to make contact with the main body within seven days. We were to retain the necessary landing craft until 15th January but we now thought it unlikely that we should be within supporting distance until at least roth January. By 18th December it was clear that even this date could not be met and General Clark signalled to me   reluctantly   recommending the cancellation of the operation on the grounds that the arbitrary date  set for the surrender of landing craft made it impossible to mount the attack under the conditions necessary for success. I signalled this decision to General Eisenhower on the 2Ist but informed him that I was still studying the problem in the hope of being able to prepare a modification of the original plan for a later date."

            "description": "150. Meanwhile, by the 18th December, 53 Brigade had occupied Seinnyinbya, seven miles south of Buthidaung. Leaving a detachment heavily engaged in this area, the Brigade effected a double river crossing and occupied the large village of Kwazon on the 21st December; while another detachment advanced, against opposition, down the east bank of the river. On the 19th December, 1 Brigade of 82 (West African) Division to the north made a great stride forward and occupied Kindaung, forcing the crossing of the Saingdin Chaung. 4 Brigade, released from its protective r le at Taung Bazaar, was at this time rounding up scattered enemy parties north of Buthidaung, preparatory to rejoining the Division in its advance on Htizwe. After securing Kindaung, 82 (West African) Division encountered stubborn resistance. A number of attacks failed to dislodge the enemy rearguards from their strong hill positions, despite concentrated air support, On the 22nd December, however, the enemy was outflanked by a strong force which moved down the river in boats and seized the high ground north of Zedidaung against stiff opposition. From this area, we were able to overlook the enemy's line of retreat and his resistance collapsed. The Kalapanzin Plain, north of the Saingdin Chaung, had been cleared of the enemy."
