Westward Passage of Force X from Malta,
28th /2gth September (D.4/5).

145. After fuelling, FARNDALE and*HEY-
THROP sailed from the Grand Harbour at
1500, followed at 1615, by KENYA, EDIN-
BURGH and ORIBI. The remainder of Force
X sailed at 1830.

146. At 1745, the Rear-Admiral Command-
ing, 18th Cruiser Squadron was detached in
EDINBURGH with ORIBI in company, to
search for two enemy destroyers reported north-
west of Gozo, steering 180°.

Nothing was seen, and at 2035 these ships
joined the Rear-Admiral Commanding, roth
Cruiser Squadron in KENYA. It is probable
that these two destroyers were FARNDALE and
HEYTHROP.

147. Force X proceeded on a course to make
the Tunisian coast, and thence to Cape Bon,
keeping close to the coast.

The night was uneventful. '

148. FARNDALE and HEYTHROP joined
the Vice-Admiral, 2nd-in-Command at
0835/29, and by 1030 the remainder of Force X
had rejoined.

Passage of NELSON to Gibraltar, 29th/30th
September (D.5/6). .

149. At 0700/29 I informed the Vice-
Admiral Commanding, North Atlantic Station
of NELSON’s position, coyrse and speed, and
requested additional A/S vessels and escort.
This message was purposely delayed until this
time, in order to give no indication that
NELSON was proceeding independently.

* 150. A Catalina flying-boat joined at 0730
and a Hudson as fighter escort at 1000. Later
in the day a second Catalina joined, and this
air escort was maintdined until dusk.

151. PIORUN obtained a doubtful A/S con-
tact at irro and dropped one depth charge.
A French merchant vessel was sighted at

1415, and observed to alter course away to
the south.

152. During the day NELSON ranged bower
and sheet cables aft and flooded certain after
compartments in order to reduce the draught
forward to the 39 feet required for eniering
harbour,

Clocks were put back one hour to Z—1
at 1800; times in paragraphs 153 to 156 are
Zone — I.

153. DUNCAN obtained a doubtful contact
at 1809 and dropped one depth charge.

1154. The first additional A/S vessel, ROCK-
INGHAM, joined at 1845; she was followed by
SAMPHIRE at 2020, JONQUIL at 2040,
FLEUR DE LYS ten minutes later, and
ARBUTUS at 2240. NELSON’s screen now
consisted of 4 destroyers and 4 corvettes.

155. SAMPHIRE and ARBUTUS obtained
an A/S contact and dropped depth charges at
0030/30 without result; the contact was prob-
ably pon-sub. Air escort of one Hudson and
one Catalina joined at daylight.

156. At 1100/30 NELSON entered Gibraltar
harbour, Tugs were used ahead and astern
as the ship was sluggish under helm especially
at low speed. ‘

SUPPLEMENT to to—E LONDON GAZETTE, 11 AUGUST, 1948

Passage of Forces A and X to the Westward,
2gth September (D.5).

157. After Force X had joined Force A at
1030/29 (vide paragraph 148), course was
shaped to the westward, keeping 40 mules clear
of the African coast.

158. At 1645, LIVELY, in position D,
Screening Diagram No. 9g, sighted an object,
resemblingea ship’s lifeboat with mast stepped
well forward, bearing 281°, distant about I,000
yards. LIVELY identified this as a submarine
periscope and conning tower, - momentarily
breaking surface, and estimated the course of
the submarine as 220°, LIVELY, already
under wheel to alter course to 281° in accord-
ance with the zig-zag, increased speed to 24

knots and altered course to 260°. Two torpedo {

tracks, course o10°, were sighted soon after-
wards which confirmed the course of the sub-

marine. The tracks indicated that the submarine ‘

was moving at speed, so course was altered to
250° and a counter-attacking 14-charge pattern
set to shallow depth was fired at 1650. LEGION
on the starboard beam of LIVELY and on a
parallel course fired a 5-charge shallow pattern
about a minute and a half earlier. Action to
avoid the torpedoes was taken by the fleet.
LEGION then stationed LIVELY on her star-
board beam and both ships hunted the sub-
marine.

LIVELY obtained a definite A/S contact on
a submarine at 1700, and attacked with a 14-
charge pattern set medium five minutes later.
After opening to 1,000 yards, LIVELY turned
towards the point at which charges had been
fired, and regained contact at 1715, the plot
raed the submarine’s speed was about
1 knot,

Contact was lost at 4oo yards, and not re-
gained. The hunt was abandoned at 1745 in
order to rejoin the screen at 1900 as ordered
by the Rear-Admiral Commanding, 18th Cruiser
Squadron.

159. PRINCE OF WALES, KENYA,
SHEFFIELD, LAFOREY, LIGHTNING,
ORIBI, FORESIGHT, FORESTER and
FURY parted company from the remainder of
the force‘at 1930 and proceeded ahead in order
to arrive at Gibraltar p.m. 30th September.

The Rear-Admiral Commanding, 18th
Cruiser Squadron took charge’ of the remainder
of the ships of Force X and proceeded towards
Gibraltar at_17 knots.

Return of Units under Vice-Admiral Command-
ing, 2nd-in-Command, Home Fleet
to Gibraltar, 30th September (D.6).

160. During the night 29th/30th September,
between 0325 and 0408, R.D.F. gave echoes
suggesting a U-Boat, and several explosions,
assumed to have been torpedoes exploding at
the end of run, were heard.

161. No further incidents occurred, and the
force arrived at Gibraltar at 1800.

Return of Units under Rear-Admiral Com-

manding, x8th Cruiser Squadron to
