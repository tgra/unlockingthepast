5.25 mch guns and Px turret jammed in

on the starboard side at 1220. Three minutes
later the ship was hit by two torpedoes, one at
the stem and the other in the after part of the
ship, starboard side. At 12244 the ship was
hit by a torpedo abreast B turret on the star-
board side. Amongst other results ‘‘ A’ pro-
peller shaft became jammed, the list was
gradually reduced, and the ship settled appre-
ciably.

6 At 1241 fire was opened with remaining
5-25 inch guns, namely S.1., S.2 and P.1, and
pom-poms, at a high level bombing formation
of eight aircraft. Three minutes later the ship
was straddled and a hit sustained on the cata-

Captain to disembark wounded and those not
required to fight the ship. Finally, the order
to abandon ship was passed.

being taken.

9. I wish to record that H.M.S. EXPRESS
was magnificently handled, remaining along-
side until the last possible moment.

ro. The officers and ratings whom I saw dis-
played great courage and steadiness.

To:—Commander-in-Chief, Far Eastern Fleet.

Sir,

I had the privilege to be the first aircraft to
reach the crews of the PRINCE OF WALES
and the REPULSE after they had been sunk.
I say the privilege, for during the next hour
while I flew around low over them, I witnessed
a show of that indomitable spirit for which the
Royal Navy. is so famous. I have seen a show
of spirit in this war over Dunkirk, during the
“ Battle of Britain,’’ and in the London night
raids, but never before have I seen anything
comparable with what I saw yesterday. I
passed over thousands who had been through
an ordeal] the greatness of which they alone can
understand, for it 1s impossible to pass on one’s
feelings in disaster to others.

Even to an eye so inexperienced as mine it
was obvious that the three destroyers were going
to take hours to pick up those hundreds of men
clinging to bits of wreckage, and swimming
around in the filthy oily water Above all this,
the threat of another bombmg and machine-
gun attack was imminent. Every one of those
men must have realised that. Yet as I flew
around, every man waved and put his thumb
up as I flew over him.

After an hour, lack of petrol forced me to
leave, but during that hour I had seen many
men in dire danger waving, cheering and
joking as if they were holiday-makers at
Brighton waving at a low flying aircraft. It
shook me for here was something above human
nature. I take off my hat to them, for in them
I saw the spirit which wins wars.

I apologise for taking up your valuable time,
but I thought you should know of the incredible
conduct of your men.

I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient Servant,
(Signed) T. A. Vicors,
Fit. /Lt., O.C. 453 Squadron.

APPENDIX II. .

Operational Signals made, by
Commander-n-Chief, Eastern Fleet,
on oth December, 1941.
TO: Force Z FROM: C.-in-C., E.F.

‘Besides a minor landing at Kota Bharu which
was not followed, landings have been made
between Pattani and Smggora and a major
landing 90 miles north of Singgora.

2. Little is known of enemy naval forces in
the vicinity. It is believed that KONGO is the
only capital ship likely to be met. Three Atago
type, one Kako type, and two Zintu type
cruisers have been reported. A number of
destroyers possibly of fleet type are likely to
be met. ’

3. My object is to surprise and sink trans-
ports and enemy warships before air attack
can develop. Objective chosen will depend on
air reconnaissance. Intend to arrive objective
after sunrise to-morrow roth If an opportunity
to bring KONGO to action occurs this 1s to take
precedence over all other action.
