force now consisted of QUEEN ELIZABETH, BARHAM, JERVIS, JANUS, KELVIN, NAPIER and HASTY. At 0858 this force was attacked by 15 JU.88 and H.E.1z1s who appeared from   the Girection of the sun.

BARHAM was  hit on   Y   turret and two of her bulges rere flooded by near misses. A fire was started in B. and this necessitated the force steering down wind to the south until the fire was extinguished two hours later. .Two aircraft were shot down and one was seen to be damaged by gunfire. At 1230, om receipt of instructions from the Commander-in-Chief, Vice Admiral st Battle Squadron shaped course for Alexandria, arriv- 's there at rg00.

. In a message timed 0824 of a7th May (0/67808 of 27th May), General Wavell informed the Prime Minister that he feared we must recognise that Crete was no longer tenable and that troops must be withdrawn as far as possible. The Chiefs of Staff (No. 118) replied that Crete was to be evacuated forthwith. Our troops in the Heraklion sector were still holding out, though it appeared only a matter of time before the enemy launched a major attack against them.

78. The Navy could claim to have prevented any seaborne invasion of Crete and to have kept the Atmy supplied with essential reinforcements of men and stores. The Royal Air Force, owing to circumstances beyond their control had so far been unable to give any direct help to the Navy. The fleet had inflicted considerable losses on the German troop-cafrying con-. voys and had destroyed a number of enemy aircraft. Twenty enemy aircraft had been shot down for certain, with 11 probables. At least 15 aircraft appeared to aye been damaged. But the losses and damage sustained by the fleet had been severe. rs and men had been subjected to prolonged strain from the. constant bombing. _ Little rest could be given, as a formidable task lay before.the Fleet the evacuation of some 22,000 men from Crete to

Egypt.

THE BATTLE OF CRETE. Past I[V TuHeE EvacuaTIon oF BRITISH AND IMPERIAL TROOPS FROM THE ISLAND.

Be pleased to lay before Their Lordships the attached reports of the Evacuation of Crete,

3113

carried out between 26th May and Ist June, - I9Q4I.

2. The evacuation followed without intermission on the Battle of Crete when the fleet had sustained such severe losses and threw a final and almost intolerable strain on the light forces, most of whom had been operating at sea almost continuously since the beginning of Operation   Lustre  * on 4th March, 1941:

3. Only one of the evacuations, that from Heraklion (paragraphs 6 and Mt. could be made from a port with -any facilities at -all. All the remainder had to be taken from the small open beach at Sphakia (paragraphs 18 to 24, 31, 33, 34, 45 and 46) to which access from the land was difficult and slow. This; together with the disorganisation resulting from the events previously described, led to a con- . stant fluctuation in the forecast of numbers to be embarked and made both the organisation and  performance of the evacuation most difficult.

4. In view of the confusion and uncertairity of the situation in Crete and the extemporary nature of the arrangements for the embarkation, Major General J. F. Evetts, C.B., C.B.E., M.C., was sent from the General Headquarters, Middle East, to act as Military Liaison Officer on my staff. His judgment .and co-operation were invaluable.

At the same time an  organisation was set up in the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean's offices for the  co-ordination of fighter protection at sea. Group Captain C. B. R. Pelly, Royal Air Force, was sent from the Headquarters, Royal Air Force, Middle East, to undertake this organisation - which; under his able management, pulled rapidly into shape and undoubtedly saved us many casualties.t

5. The first day of the evacuation was~nct encouraging. In the evacuation of Heraklion, Rear Admiral H. B. Rawlings, O.B.E., the Rear Admiral Commanding, Seventh Cruiser Squadron, was faced with many . difficult decisions, {t was unfortunate that H.M.S. AJAX was not retained with Force B- and much overcrowding thereby avoided, but the  slight nature of her damage was not apparent to the Rear Admiral Commanding, Seventh Cruiser Squadron. Subsequent examination in harbour of damage sustained by H.M.S. AJAX revealed that the reports given to the Commanding Officer at the time were exaggerated and the  ship could have well eacried on with Force | B.

6. The actual embarkation from Heraklion was most expeditiously carried out and reflected credit on all concemed both ashore and afloat.

t Footnote : Air Ministry comment : The general air situation remained much the same with one important difference. The bulk of the troops were  evacuated from bays in southern Crete during the hours of darkness and it was possible to provide some limited fighter cover to ships which, by first light, had proceeded some way. towards the Egyptian mainland. Even thei, the ranges from our airfields and the sine number of aircraft available allowed no i hand to deal-with changes | in the routeing or timing of naval operations which weie necessitated by enomy action.
