and assistance; his great experience of India and the Indian Army has been invaluable.

42. The work of my Chief of General Staff, Lieutenant-General E. L. Morris, C.B., O.B.E., M.C., has been of a very high order. He got through an immense amount of work without fuss or friction; and.his sympathetic but firm personality promoted smooth and efficient working in the complex Indian military machine, which had not been geared to a major war on its immediate borders and required considerable working up.

43. 1 was ably assisted both by the Civilian Staff, C. Macl. G. . Ogilvie, Esq., C.S.L., C.B.E., L.C.S., as Secretary, and his successor, C M. Trivedi, Esq., C.S.1., C.LE., O.B.E., 1.C.S, who took his place when the original Defence Department was divided into Defence and War Departments, and E. T. Coates, Esq., CSL, C.LE., 1.C.S., my Financial Adviser, and by the Principal Staff Officers (LieutenantGeneral W. H. G. Baker, C.B., D.S.O., O.B.E., Adjutant-General, Lieutenant-General W. G. H. Vickers, C.B., O.B.E., QuarterMaster General, and Lieutenant-General Sir C. A. Bird, K.C.LE., C.B., D.S.0., Master General of the Ordnance). I wish to record, the services of these officers and also of my Engineer-in-Chief, Major-General R. L, Bond, C.B.E., D.S.O., M.C., who directed the very large e of airfield construction and other work; and of my Director of Medical Services, Major-General A. C. Campbell Monro, C.B., I.M.S., who effected a great improvement in the medical services in difficult conditions.

44. Command of the Eastem Army, which

-was responsible for the defence of the threatened

frontier of India, was exercised first by Lieut.- General Sir C. N. F. Broad, K.C.B., D.S.O., and after August 1942 by Lieut.-General N. M. S. drwin, C.B., D.S.O., M.C.; iboth these officers carried out a most difficult task of command and administration with ability and energy,
