The attack went with great dash and speed, capturing Pinacle and Elephant Hill. Beyond this the ridge narrows and is devoid of cover, all approaches being commanded by machineguns from Bald Hill, and other prominent features. The maps had given no indication of the exceeding steepness and narrowness of the tidge beyond Elephant, Further advance in daylight was impossible. At o4r5 hours on 5th May, the attack was resumed and Middle Hill was captured. Between Middle Hill and Little Alagi the ridge again narrows to a razorback about 150 yds. wide, wired, flanked by precipices and under machine-gun fire. I Worcesters reached, and at one place went through, the wire, but became pinned and could not move in daylight. Middle Hill was consolidated and the Worcesters were withdrawn to this area on the night 5/6th May. 2oth Indian Infantry Brigade was now definitely checked.",

As I have already explained the capture of this mountain was essential to the whole conduct of operations in order to clear the left flank of the attack. The fighting on the mountain was severe and the enemy counter-attacked many times; major credit for the success must go to x Irish Guards who finally cleared the crest, at the cost of many casualties, within the time table laid down for the operation. Gebel Bou Aoukaz was in our hands by nightfall and all that night the infantry of 4 British and 4 Indian Divisions were moving forward to their assembly areas. On 6th May, at 0330 hours, they advanced to the attack side by side on a very narrow front. The massed artillery of First Army, backed by the dumps of ammunition which we had been nourishing so long for this event, fired concentrations on known enemy localities. At dawn the air forces went in. It was their greatest effort in the war up to that date, over two thousand sorties of all types. The weight of the attack was too much for the defenders, already weakened physically and morally by the heavy fighting since 22nd April. Most of them did their duty but there were isolated instances of demoralisation. By 1030 hours the first infantry objectives were captured and by 1130 hours the village of Frend) was reported clear. The two armoured divisions, which were close on the heels of the attacking infantry, at once passed into the lead. So deep had been our initial penetration that they found enemy resistance, though gallant and desperate, to be but little organised, they met some groups of enemy tanks, from 15 Panzer Division, and many of the 88 millimetre guns withdrawn from airfield defence, but the impetus of the offensive was so strong that it carried them by nightfall as far as Massicault, half-way to Tunis. 6 Armoured Division leaguered for the night to the south-east and 7 Armoured Division to the north-east of the village. The enemy were endeavouring to form a new defensive position at St. Cyprien.",

The two former divisions, with the 56th, were to make the assault on the right.

The main attack was planned for 2gth April and its Gbject was to establish all three divisions in the area of Hammamet, at the base of the Cape Bon peninsula. On the 2gth, however, I received a signal from General Montgomery saying that, as a result of a failure by 56 Division on that day when coming under artillery fire as it was about to take up positions for the attack, he now felt unhappy about the possibilities of success. As this was not going to interfere with the plans I was already forming for finishing off. enemy resistance in the Tunis plain I.authogized the abandonment of the attack, 1 Fighting French Division was brought forward on 6th May to relieve 51 Division and the Eighth Army front became a holding front except for the western flank where the New Zealanders carried out; local gperations to assist XIX Corps and attract enemy attention.",

            "description": "125. By the 6th May the enemy's withdrawal in Slavonia was rapidly reaching its end. Koptivnica (S.E. of Varazdin) and Bjelovar (E. of Zagreb) fell to the 3rd Jugoslav Army, and with the capture of Kocevje (S. of Ljubljana) by VII Corps the German position was further imperilled in the Novo Mesto area. Generalski Stol was taken and Karlovac threatened. The end of the day saw the enemy pocket northwest of Fiume surrender, and the following day B.A.F. flew its last six sorties.",
