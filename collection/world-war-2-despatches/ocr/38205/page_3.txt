SUPPLEMENT to tat LONDON GAZETTE, 12 FEBRUARY, 1948

East Command and the United States force
from North Africa.

The strategic conception of the operation was
influenced very largely by administrative con-
siderations. Jt was still an essential element of
the doctrine of amphibious warfare that suffi-
cient major ports must be captured within a
vety short time of the initial landings to main-
tain all the forces required for the attainment
of the objectives; beach maintenance could
only be relied on as a very temporary measure.
The experiences of operation TORCH, the
North African landing, though difficult to inter-
pret in view of the special circumstances of that
operation, were held to confirm this view. This
meant that attention was at once directed to the
three major ports of Messina, Catania and
Palermo. Messina was clearly out of the ques-
tion as an immediate objective. It was strongly
defended, difficult of access and well out of
range of air cover that had to be provided from
Tunisia and Malta. An assault on Catania
could be given air cover, though the port itself
was at the extreme end of our range, and suc-
cessful exploitation would give us control of the
main group of enemy airfields in the island,
from which it would be possible to provide
cover over the Straits of Messina, our final
objective On the other hand it was calcu-
lated that the port could only maintain four
divisions in the first month and six divisions
subsequently, and this would be insufficient for
the reduction of the whole island. Palermo
would give us sufficient maintenance facilities
provided the enemy allowed us time enough to
build up to the strength required. The dis-
advantages of an assault in that area were that
it left the enemy in possession of Catania and
Messina through which to reinforce, and the
eastern and south-eastern groups of airfields,
while exploitation towards Messina, our final
objective, would be difficult.

The plan therefore proposed a simultaneous
assault in the west and south-east. On D-day
the Eastern Task Force (British) was to land at
four points, Avola, Pachino, Pozzallo and Gela,
with forces totalling three infantry divisions,
four parachute and two tank battalions. The
tasks of the force were to capture the ports of
Syracuse and Augusta and the airfields at
Pachino, Comiso and Ponte Olivo. At the same
time an American force of one infantry division.
and a tank battalion from the Western Task
Force (United States) was to land at Sciacca and
Marinella in the south-western corner of the
island to capture the airfields, in particular the
large airfield at Castelvetrano, in order to be
able to provide air cover over the landings in
the Palermo area. On D plus 2 the main
American landings would be made in the
Palermo area, from the Gulf of Castellammare to
Cape Zaffarano, east of the port, in a total
strength of two infantry divisions and two tank
battalions. The tasks of this force were to
capture Palermo and cut off the enemy in the
west of the island by linking up with the force at
Castelvetrano. On D plus 3 the Eastern Task
Force was to make another landing, with one
infantry division, plus a brigade group, and an
airborne division, in the Catania area, to capture
the port and the Gerbini group of airfields. A
division was allotted to each

Palermo, when secured, and by D plus 7 ‘it was
hoped that sufficient forces would be ashore to

deal with any forces which could be brought
against them.
Modification of the First Plan.

The month of February and the early days
of March were the most critical periods in
Tunisia, where I assumed command on 19th
February, and it was impossible for me to give
the plans for Sicily any detailed attention. I
did, however, suggest certaim modifications to
General Gairdner when he saw me at the end
of February, for the consideration of his
planning staff. These were directed to eliminate
‘certain unsatisfactory points in the onginal
London plan; to ensure, for instance, that divi-
sions were employed as such and not spht up
unnecessarily, to provide a Force Reserve and
to ensure a more concentrated use of our air-
borne forces to neutralise the beach defences
by cancelling a proposed operation against
communications in Calabria. I also considered
at this time concentrating the efforts of both
Task Forces against the south-eastern corner of
the island This was a proposal to which I was
later to return but on first consideration it was
rejected on the ground that port facilities in this
area would be insufficient to support our whole
force, and it still seemed essential to ensure the
early capture of Palermo. To overrun the
island if defended by a garrison of eight enemy
divisions, which was the current Intelligence
estimate of the probable enemy strength, would
require at least ten divisions and I was informed
that only with the use of both Palermo and
Catania could we be sure of maintaining that
number.

It would be unnecessary to describe in detail
the many conferences at which the strategy of
the attack was thrashed out until they resulted
in the adoption of the final plan. Nor need I
emphasise again the difficulties involved; I my-
self and my two future Army commanders were
engaged actively in the field and even when a
conference would have been physically possible
the hazards of air communications in the un-
certain weather of a North African spring often
meant that we could not meet. The staff at
Bouzarea were short-handed and many of the
heads of branches, still fully employed at my
Eighteenth Army Group Headquarters, were un-
able to take over as yet or divert their attention
from the Tunisian battle. All that was possible
was to work out loading tables, training
schedules and all such matters which must of
necessity be taken in hand long before the date
of the assault, while preserving complete flexi-
bility of mind about the objectives which might
eventually be selected for the assault. Flexi-~
bility was, indeed, the keynote of the whole
planning period and every proposed solution was
examined on its own merits. It is for this
reason that it is difficult to show in detail how
the final plan grew to completion but it will be
useful to consider the main aspects that pre-
sented themselves and sketch the way in which
they contributed to the ultimate solution.

The air situation received my first attention.
From our bases in Malta and Tunisia we could
give air cover over the southern half of Sicily
south of a line running from Trapani to
Catania; both these two places, however, were
near to the limit of effective air action, The
plan provided for an early attack on-all three
groups of airfields, but at the cost of a loss of
concentration. The Eastern Task Force, in par-
ticular, would be dispersed in assaults all along
