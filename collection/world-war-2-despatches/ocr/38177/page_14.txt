was imperative not to rely on this alone. More-
over we could not afford to repeat the ex-
perience of the previous convoy, when out of
a total of 30,000 tons of stores despatched to
Malta only about 5,000 were received: aerial
protection must cover not only the arrival of
ships, but the period of preparation and unload-
ing. General Dobbie ended by saying that
drastic action was needed: more Spitfire air-
craft were required in addition to those already
allotted, and the air force must be regularly
reinforced.

Relief, it now seemed, must be deferred until
June when it was hoped that a strong escort
for convoys from the east could be provided
and thatour Libyan offensive would have begun.
There was no certainty that either of these con-
ditions would be fulfilled, so that the Middle
East Defence Committee repeated their request
that a convoy should also sail from the west.
Meanwhile we were obliged to instruct the
Governor to impose even more stringent ration-
ing and to hope that the island would be able
to continue its gallant resistance.

The steady deterioration of the situation in
the Indian Ocean gravely affected our plans in
the Middle East, and we begged the Chiefs of
Staff to acquaint us more fully with develop-
ments in that theatre. On the 23rd April we
received a long and detailed appreciation of
the situation. In discussing possible Japanese
plans, an attempt to invade Ceylon was not
Tuled out, although it seemed more likely that
the Japanese would try to exploit their success
in Malaya and Burma by advancing into India
from the north-east. For the time being we
were in no position to offer effective resistance
by sea, land, or air to any offensive. Should
the Japanese press boldly westward without
pause for consolidation, the Indian Empire
would ‘be in grave danger. In that event the
security of the Middle East and its essential
supply line would be threatened. The Middle
East and India were therefore interdependent.

So gloomy was the picture thus painted that
I felt it demanded a complete reconsideration
of our plans. In a paper prepared for the
Middle East Defence Committee, I pointed
out our present weakness owing to lack of
reserves; that we should run great danger, if
we were to embark on an offensive in Libya
without reserves, sufficient to enable us to carry
it through to the Agheila marshes; and that
the risk was the greater, seeing there was
always the possibility that our supply lines
through the Indian Ocean might at any time
be cut. I was reluctantly forced to the con-
clusion that, although the fate of Malta might
be sealed, in the-circumstances depicted by the
Chiefs of Staff, we could not afford to take the
offensive in Libya. ‘We should rather concen-
trate on strengthening our defences in the
Middle East and spare all we could to reinforce
India in the hope of checking the Japanese
advance before it should be too late.

My colleagues on the Middle East Defence
Committee were inclined to believe that the
Chiefs of Staff review presented the situation
in its worst aspect, We were all agreed, how-
ever, as to what’ we could do in the Middle
East to save Malta or spare to help India,
and decided to inform the Chiefs of Staff
accordingly. , '

‘We explained that, in view of the serious
threat to India disclosed in their appreciation,
we felt bound to give the Chiefs of Staff full

information about our ability to help India and
to mount an offensive in Libya, so that they
might decide whether we should continue to pre-
pare for the offensive. . Although we could
spare no air forces, I believed I could send
an armoured brigade group, a motor brigade
group and two infantry divisions, all seasoned
troops and well equipped, assuming that we
stood on the defensive in Libya. This was
possible, since it now seemed that no new
danger would arise before August or even later,
and that, even when our forces in Cyrenaica
had been reduced, the enemy were unlikely to
muster sufficient strength for a serious attack
for about three months. In the latter assump-
tion, as events proved, we were wrong; but
the comparative strengths of our own and the
enemy forces in Libya at that time and the
general tactical situation on that front seemed
to warrant this conclusion.

The Prime Minister replied at once, saying
that the situation had improved in the last fort-
night, and that, although the next two months

-would no doubt be critical in the Pacific and

Indian Oceans, there were no special grounds
for assuming that an invasion of India was then
imminent or certain. Having described the
various measures that were being taken to
strengthen our position in the Indian Ocean, he
concluded by saying that the greatest help we
in the Middle East could give would be to
engage and defeat the enemy on our ‘Western
Front.

The date by which we could be ready to
Jaunch the offensive, unfortunately, had now
receded. The rate of increase in our own tank
strength had fallen very little short of the esti-
mates given to Sir Stafford Cripps three weeks.
earlier; but, owing to our inability to interfere
effectively with his shipping, the number of
tanks the enemy was likely to possess by the
middle of May now approached the highest
figure we had mentioned. Moreover a new
Italian armoured division had been brought
over, although it was not yet up to strength.
We therefore informed the Chiefs of Staff that,
provided that this new armoured division did
not materialise, we should now be ready in mid-
June. If the division did appear, we should
have to postpone the offensive until August.
We also explained that success would depend
on our retaining supremacy in the air.

I was then informed by the Prime Minister
that it had been decided that an offensive must
be launched as early as possible, preferably
during May, in order to save Malta. We
thought it necessary, however, to point out that,
in the event of our armoured forces being
destroyed as a result of launching an offensive
prematurely, we should not be able to hold
our prepared positions on the Egyptian frontier
for lack of armour, but should be compelled to.
retire to El Alamein. The peril in which Egypt
would then stand would probably have worse
results than if Malta were to succumb. The
War Cabinet were prepared to accept this risk,
being determined that Malta should not be
allowed to fall without a battle being fought by
my army for its retention. I was instructed to.
