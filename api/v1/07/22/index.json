The policy to be adopted in view of the unsatisfactory attitude of the Iranian Govern- ment to the representations made regarding the expulsion of Axis nationals from Iran had been under consideration by His Majesty's Govern- ment and the Soviet Government during the early weeks of July and on 22nd July Lt. General Quinan was instructed to be prepared to occupy Abadan and Naft-i-Shah and at a Tater date the oilfields in South West Iran. On 24th July intimation was received that His Majesty\u2019s Governm\u00e9nt had approved of the proposals for the application of Anglo-Soviet diplomatic pressure backed iby a show of force on the Iranian Government in order to secure the expulsion of Axis nationals \u00a2rom their country; should diplomatic pressure fail force was to be used."

The dumps of supplies, petrol and oil, ammunition and Ordnance stores were partially despatched. Supplies of bread, approximately 18,000 Ibs. daily, were shipped from 22nd July to 13th August. Apart from that, little was done by the island except to meet small urgent de- mands."

            "description": "By 22nd July the relief of the French was completed and the South Africans and New Zealanders were able to make good progress to the west of the Chianti chain. By the end of the 25th both were facing squarely up to the ** Olga \u2019\u2019 line which ran roughly east and west through San Casciano, ten miles south o. Florence. This advance loosened up the de- fence in the Arno valley and on the same day the right of the South Africans, and 4 British Division, were in contact with the enemy posi- tions orf Monte Scalari and Monte Moggio, the south-eastern bulwarks of the defence of Florence. This was the \u2018\u2018 Lydia\u201d line; \u201c Olga \"\u2019, on Route 2, was held by 4 Parachute Division. Leaving \u2018* Lydia \u2019\u2019 to 4 Division, 13 Corps grouped the South Africans and New Zealanders for the attack on \u201c\u2018 Olga \u2019\u2019. There was stiff fighting on the 26th but the next day the New Zealanders captured San Casciano and the parachutists withdrew to \u2018\u2018 Paula\u2019, the last line cov\u00e9ring Florence. 4 Division had very heavy fighting, lasting three days, for Monte Scalari, which was, finally cleared on the 2gth. On the left of the Corps front 8 Indian Division had reached the Arno east of Empoli."

IV Corps on the left was driving on Leghorn, which it planned to take by an enveloping movement from the east. The French, on Fifth Army\u2019s right, had celebrated r4th July by capturing Poggibonsi, on the direct route from Siena to Florence. The time for their relief was now, however, rapidly ap- proaching; on 22nd July their sector was taken over iby 8 Indian Division and in part by the New Zealanders, coming under command of 13 Corps. It was with very real regret that I saw the departure of the French Corps. They had most worthily upheld and reinforced the Teputation of French arms in the country where Bayard and Gaston de Foix had first brought"

            "description": "An assault on Taranto had been considered earlier but rejected on what then seemed suffi- cient grounds. At the date proposed, Ist November, the weather was likely to be unsuit- \u00ab able for beach maintenance, we should have lost too many landing craft in the three previous assaults (i.e., Sicily, Reggio and Cotrone) and air cover would be impossible since Taranto would be out of range of the majority of our fighters operating from the airfields in. north-eastern Sicily, These reasons were no longer cogent. No degree of success could change the November weather in this stormy part of Italy but it would ensure our being able to mount the assault earlier, and a provisional date of rst October could now be contemplated with some confidence. More landing craft were now available as a result of our light losses in the landings in Sicily and we had considerable hopes that it might be unnecessary to carry out one or other of the assaults at Reggio and Cotrone, per-. haps even both, with a consequent further saving in resources. As for air cover we now had hopes of a rapid advance to seize the air- fields at Cotrone and in any case, if the Italian defences in Apulia were as feebly manned as in Sicily (and the German forces in the area were weak), a lesser scale of air support might be acceptable. The advantages of the opera- tion were considerable, It would give us the Possession of ports through which a large force could be built up and it would place us in a geographically protected area on the same side of the Apennines as Foggia, the capture -of whose numerous airfields for the use of the Strategic Air Force was one of dur first objec- tives in Italy. Oni 22nd July, therefore, Fifth Army was directed to prepare plans for an operation \u2018\u2018 to seiz\u00e9 and secure the Heel of Italy east of the line Taranto-Bari inclusive,\u2019\u2019 with target date 1st October, to be carried out under my command. Planning for the assault on Sardinia had already been cancelled on the 2oth and responsibility for this operation, together with that against Corsica, was handed over to the French. \u2018With this decision the western islands passed out of the strategic pic- ture; in the event the Germans withdrew from both, with a precipitancy which they probably later regretted. : :"
