SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 JANUARY, 1947 QI

present be obviated only by co-ordinated
planning between the air and land forces. If
this principle were lost sight of, there would
be a serious risk of the misuse of heavy

bombers in a tactical role, and bombing on |

a large scale might be expended in profitless
destruction which would add little, if anything,
to the progress of a land battle. From the
operational point of view, the need for unified
planning stands out all the more prominently
when it is realised that the strategical forces
which contributed so much and so directly to
the land battle in France were in themselves
equivalent in fire power to vast ground forces.
It is only through integrated ground and air
planning that the air forces can serve usefully
in a tactical role.

533. Although the tactical operations in which
heavy bombers were used in Normandy were
initiated by the ground force commander, there
may also be times when the air force com-
mander with his better appreciation of the effects
which air effort can achieve, might in future sug-
gest to the Army rich opportunities for a com-
bined air and land operation.

Command and Control.

534. The relationship of Air Forces to the
Army and Naval Forces and to the Supreme
Command from the point of view of Command
and Control is well worth touching upon in view
of the great importance of this question in future
Combined Operations of the scope of ‘‘ Over-
lord’’. It raises interesting though naturally
somewhat controversial problems.

535- In the early days of planning and pre-
paration for Operation “‘ Overlord ’’ there was
a Commander-in-Chief of all Air Forces and a
Commander-in-Chief of all Naval Forces each
having the necessary integrated operational
staffs and Headquarters but separate from those
of the allied operational forces. The Comman-
ders-in-Chief and their staffs were also service
advisers to COSSAC and later to yourself as
Supreme Commander. The organisation was,
however, different in respect of the land forces,
the direction and control of these operations in
the field being undertaken’ by the Army staff of
COSSAC itself.

536. In February, 1944, you appointed the
Commander-in-Chief, 21st Army Group to co-
ordinate the planning and execution for the
assault for both the United States and British
Army ae a and thereby raised the Comman-
der-in-Chief, 2st Army Group to the level of
Commander-in-Chief of the Land Forces. He
naturally used his own staff for both these func-
tions but the Army staff of Supreme Head-
quarters Allied Expeditionary Force still con-
tinued to exercise direction of the land opera-
tions from the point of view of general policy
and to co-ordinate the activities of all three
Services on the high level.

537. The Air Commander-in-Chief and the
staff of Allied Expeditionary Air Force were, in
consequence, required to work on two levels
with two large Army staffs. On the one hand,
they had, as your Air advisers, to contribute
to the directives and numerous operational and
administrative memoranda produced by
Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary
Force and on the other, and this time on the
Commanders-in-Chief operational level to plan,

prepare for and execute the assault in co-
ordination with 21st Army Group. Further, it
was inevitable in these circumstances that the
closest contact had also to be maintained with
the Commanding General of the American land
forces.

538. This arrangement severely taxed the
staffs of Allied Expeditionary Air Force and
inevitably led to overlapping and complications
and at times interference with the planning of
the tactical air forces and their opposite Army
and Navy formations. The two staffs were, in
fact, the same as those with which Allied Ex-
peditionary Air Force itself was, at the same
time, planning on a high level.

539. In the post assault period when ast
Army Group reverted to its normal position the
situation was greatly eased but certain difficul-
ties still remained in that the Army staff at
Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary
Force retained a dual function in certain
respects.

540. In spite of its inherent difficulties the
organisation of Command and Control as
developed through the various phases, un-
doubtedly worked, but I suggest that the crea-
tion of a separate Commander-in-Chief of all
Allied Land Forces on the level with, and
having similar functions to, the Air and Naval
Commanders-in-Chief would have facilitated the
execution of the responsibilities of the Air Com-
mander-in-Chief and the Allied Air Force com-
manders, and no doubt also of the other service
Commanders-in-Chief and staffs.

541. The geographical relationship of the
Commanders-in-Chief and staffs of the Air,
Army and Naval forces and the Supreme Com-
mander and his Headquarters also has a direct
bearing on the question of Command and Con-
trol. ~

542. In the first period of planning the Com-
manders-in-Chief and appropriate portions of
their staffs, were housed mainly in one build-
ing in London and this arrangement naturally
worked excellently. °

543. Shortly after the formation of Supreme
Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force itself,
part of its general staff moved out of London
to Bushy Park. This inevitably led to a splitting
and to some extent further duplication of my
staff, part of which had to move to Bushy Park,
part had to remain at Norfolk, House to plan
with ANCXF and the remainder of SHAEF,
and part had to remain at Stanmore for the
planning and control of preliminary air opera-
tions for ‘‘ Neptune '’—the latter being a func-
tion and responsibility which the Army and
Naval Commanders-in-Chief had not to under-
take prior to the assault. I was forced to keep
my main staff at Stanmore if only because of
communication facilities which were adequate
for the control of air operations at no other
Headquarters or centre.

544. A further dispersal of the Combined
and Joint Planners of the operational staff
resulted from the necessity to work with the
Headgnarters staff of 21st Army Group, whose
location was at St. Pauls School, for the de-
tailed planning of the assault.

545. The situation became even more com-
plicated from the air point of view when, for
the execution of the initial stages of the in-
vasion, 21st Army Group and ANCXF, with a
