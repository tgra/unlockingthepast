aircraft continued passing directly over the LITTORIO. A column of smoke was observed to arise suddenly from directly abaft the funnels of the LITTORIO. The   get away   was made past the cruisers who fired at the aircraft and over San Pietro Island when severe A.A. fire was encountered. Three balloons round the harbour were observed to catch fire, probably as a result of the enemy's own A.A, fire. ILLUSTRIOUS was sighted at orgo and the aircraft landed on ro minutes later.

(vi) Maund / Bull. Task: Torpedo attack on battleships.

Came in over land north of Rondinella point encountering A.A, fire from the end of the point, followed by fire from the cruisers and from the entrance to the canal while gliding down to the torpedo dropping position approximately 4 cables S.S.W. of the mouth of the Canal. When the aircraft reached the water the fire was passing overhead and the pilot was able to flatten out and make an accurate drop at the more southerly LITTORIO (B in Plan 1) at a range of approximately 1,300 yards. The observer saw the torpedo run. After dropping, the pilot made a sharp turn to starboard, doubled back amongst the merchant ships off the commercial basin and then over the northern end of San Pietro Island out to sea encountering severe A.A. pom-pom fire from Lo Scanno point on the northern extremity of the island. The aircraft then returned to the ship without incident.

(vii) Kiggell/ Janvrin.

Task: To drop flares along the eastern shore and S.A.P. bombs on any convenient target.

The aircraft was detached by the Squadron Commander off Cape San Vito and came in at 7,500 feet. Over Cape San Vito and  the promontory H.E. A.A. fire was encountered. Commencing at 2302 a line of eight flares was dropped at half mile intervals set to burn at 4,500 feet. After the flares had been dropped and appeared to be providing satisfactory illumination, the pilot turned to starboard and cruised around for 15-20 minutes looking for a target, and then made a dive bombing attack on the most southerly oil storage depot (See Plan 1) from which a pipe line leads to the new jetty. No results were observed.   Get away  was made at 2325 in a. southerly direction. _ILLUSTRIOUS was sighted at ofr2 and the aircraft landed on at or20.

>. (vill) Lamb/ Grieve. Task: Stand by flare dropper.

Came in astern of Kiggell/Janvrin but as the first flares appeared satisfactory no flares were dropped. The course flown and the A.A. fire experienced was the same as that by

+ Kiggell/ Janvrin and the same oil storage depot

was the target for a dive bombing attack but no results were observed.

(ix) Patch / Goodwin,

Task: Dive bombing attack on the line of cruisers and destroyers moored stem on against the quay side on the south of the Mar Piccolo. _

_ The aircraft came im at 8,500 feet over San Pietro Island at 2306, encountering fire from * both Islands and from Rondinella Point,



crossed the Mar Grande and the canal and to the middle of the western portion of the Mar Piccolo, Difficulty was experienced al first in identifying the target which appeared to be in a shadow but two minutes after crossing the canal the target was identified and a dive bombing attack was made from 1,500 feet obliquely across two cruisers from N.W. to S.E. at 2315. Pom-pom fire from a number of points along the quay side, and from the cruisers in the Mar Piccolo (See Plan 1) was encountered. The pilot then turned east and about five minutes later a large fire was observed from the direction of the seaplane base. Further anti-aircraft fire was met from a point near the village of San Gorgio but this was avoided by diving behind the neighbouring range of hills. The aircraft crossed the coast in a southerly direction some 8 miles east of Taranto harbour. ILLUSTRIOUS was sighted at 0135 and landed on at 0155.

(x) Sarra/ Bowker.

Task: Dive bombing attack on cruisers and destroyers in the Mar Piccolo.

Coming in at a height of 8,o00 feet over the western mainland and diving to 1,500 feet over the Mar Piccolo, the pilot was unable to identify the target. He accordingly continued along the southern shore of the Mar Piccolo and delivered an attack on the seaplane base (See Plan 1) from a height of 500 feet. A direct hit on one hangar and further hits on the slipways were observed and a large explosion occurred in the hangar. Much pompom and machine gun fire was met, it being particularly intense just after the attack. The aircraft made its  get away  to the south and went out to sea about 5 miles east of the harbour and returned to the ship without incident.

(xi) Forde | Mardel-Ferreira.

Task: Dive bombing attack on cruisers and destroyers in the Mar Piccolo (See Plan 1).

This aircraft was separated from the leader and arrived as the first flare was dropped and came in east of Cape San Vito a large fire being observed on the oil storage depot previously attacked by the flare dropping aircraft. No A.A. fire was met until that from a position 1,400 yards N.W. of the oil storage depot. On reaching the Mar Piccolo the pilot turned to port and delivered his attack on the target from N.E, to S.W. releasing at 1,500 feet. The first bomb hit the water short of two cruisers but the remainder should have hit the cruiser although no immediate results were observed.

ntense A.A. fire from the cruisers moored in the Mar Piccolo was met throughout the dive. The pilot was uncertain whether his bombs had released and circled the western basin of the Mar Piccolo and repeated the attack. The  get away  was made to the northwest, the aircraft going out to sea about 5 miles west of the harbour. While going out a fiash and big fite was seen near the  seaplane hangar.
