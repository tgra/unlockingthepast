            "description": "15. In the Basra area no major operations took place. The principal difficulty was that, to start with, there were insufficient troops to con- currently. The airport, dock area and power station at Maqil were occupied, but although the Iraqi troops in Basra agreed to withdraw on 2nd May, they failed to do so. When, even after the time hmit had been extended, they failed to comply, action by bombing and artillery fire was taken against them whereupon they immediately withdrew northwafds, along the West bank of the River Tigris above Qurmat Ali and towards Qurna. The only other action of any importance in the Basra area occurred on 7th May, when our troops occupied Ashar, the business quarter of Basra, after encountering slight opposition from some Traqi police and armed civilians,"

The Admiralty reply received next day was to the effect that it was not possible to main- tain large forces in face of enemy air superiority well in advance of established fighter aero- dromes and that Bodo was the only place south of Narvik where such could be estab- lished. That small parties only would be main- tained at Mo and Mosjoen with the object of cbstructing enemy advance and to prevent land- ings by sea and air. On the 7th May I learned that all Independent Companies operating in Northen Norway would come under Narvik \u2018Command and I was given details of their dis- position under Colonel Gubbins. Anxiety was expressed by the Norwegian Commander-in- Chief as to the potential aerodromes in Bode\u2019, Mosjoen area. :"

H.Q. Frontier Battalion reached the outskirts of Debra Tabor on 7th May and from then until arrival of 4 Company on 16th May, in spite of continual rain, inadequate clothing and cover, and much lameness caused by jigger sores, they maintained systematic nightly bombing attacks on the Debra Tabor garrison, which consisted of two Blackshirt and two Colonial battalions and a regular Banda group. 4 Company continued the work with mortar support until 2oth May, when the battalion was ordered to Dessie, much to the regret of the commander, who, after an exchange of correspondence with Colonel Ange- lini, commanding the Debra Tabor garrison, believed, that in spite of his instructions to hold out to the last man, Angelini would have surrendered with a little more pushing. Major Simonds was withdrawn at the same time. Debra Tabor did not fall until the beginning of July 1943, but it remained isolated throughout the intervening period as a result of the work of Beghemder Force and the Frontier Battalion."
