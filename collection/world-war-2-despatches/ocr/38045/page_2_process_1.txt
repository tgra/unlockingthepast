Polish Ship SLAZAK (R. Tyminski, Kmdr.- Ppov.) and H.M.S. BROCKLESBY (Lieut.- Commander E. N. Pumphrey, D.S.0., D.S.C., R.N.) were within about 4 miles of Group 5 and that H.M.S. CALPE was the only ship in the immediate vicinity of H.M.S. GLENGYLE and Group 4, it. was decided to keep Group 4 in sight.

5. Actually Group 5 had made a chance encounter with some armed trawlers, and although Commander D. B. Wyburd, R.N., in S.G.B.5 (Lieut. G. H. Hummel, R.N.R.) maintained a steady course and speed in order that his L.C.Ps. should remain in company, S.G.B.5 was soon disabled, and the L.C.Ps. disorganised. Commander Wyburd's _persistence in remaining the guide of the slow L.C.Ps. while himself under heavy fire, showed great gallantry and determination. _ Nevertheless, 1 am of opinion that he would have done better to use the speed and smoke-laying capabilities of S.G.Bs.* in order to protect the L.C.Ps. L.C.F.(L) 1* (Lieut. T. M. Foggitt, R.A.N.V.R.) also in company with Group 5, successfully engaged the German vessels, setting one on fire and claiming to have sunk a second. In the course of this engagement her fire control was unfortunately put out of action.

6. During the action O.R.P. SLAZAK with H.M.S. BROCKLESBY in company was approximately four miles to the N.N.E. but did not intervene. The Commanding Officer of O.R.P. SLAZAK has since informed me that he considered the firing came from the shore and therefore thought it best to continue with his patrol.

7. It will be convenient at this stage to complete the story of the Yellow Beach landings, which were frustrated by this encounter.

8. Five L.C.Ps. effected a delayed landing on Yellow I Beach.{ Heavy opposition was encountered and the troops made no progress. Subsequent attempts were made by the L.C.Ps. to withdraw them but it proved impossible to close the beach on account of machine gun fire, and eventually only the Naval Beach Party who swam off to the boats were taken off. During this period, a small German tanker was set on fire and driven ashore by M.L. 346 (Lieut. A. D. Fear, R.N.V.R.) whose conduct throughout the operation was outstanding.

g. One L.C.P. effected an unopposed Janding at Yellow II Beach.t The troops on board, under the command of Major P. Young, M.C., succeeded in approaching the coast defence battery at Berneval and in sniping it for about two hours. Subsequently they were successfully withdrawn. I have little doubt that the failure of the coast defence battery at Berneval to play an effective part in the operation was largely due to the action of Major Young.

10. Subsequently on the extreme western flank, the PRINCE ALBERT's Landing Craft, carrying No. 4 Commando, were successfully landed according to plan. This part of the operation, which was under the joint command of Lieut.-Commander H. H. H. Mulleneux,

R.N., and Lieut.-Colonel the Lord Lovat, M.C., M.P., went through without a hitch from beginning to end. The troops were very fortunaie in that they blew up an ammunition dump at their objective by a chance mortar hit early in their attack. They were subsequently withdrawn at approximately 0835 and returned to England without incident.

1x. Reverting to the main landings, that at Green Beach* took place punctually and according to plan, and only encountered slight initial opposition, Subsequently Group 6, under the command of Commander H. V. P. McClintock, R.N., and carrying the Camerons of Canada, effected a landing at Green Beach according to plan but about 30 minutes late. The reason for the delay lay partly in the anxiety of the Senior Military Officer not to be landed ahead of time, and partly due to navigational difficulties occasioned by smoke during the final approach. This landing met with a certain amount of opposition, but the troops were successfully put ashore. It is interesting to note that at this stage the enemy fire on the approaches to Green Beach was slight, but steadily increased throughout the operation, and -resulted in very heavy casualties being suffered during the eventual withdrawal. This was because the force landed did not succeed - EEcupymE the high ground east of the

12, The landing on Blue Beach* was delayed for 15 minutes, on account of time lost when the boats were forming up. This was due to M.G.B. 315 (Lieut. J. id Lloyd, R.N.V.R.) (whose role was to remain with H.M.S, QUEEN EMMA and escort her back) going ahead and getting mixed up with the Landing Craft from H.M.S. PRINCESS ASTRID, who mistook her for M.G.B. 316 (Act. Temp. Lieut.-Commander T. N, Cartwright, R.N.V.R.) whose role it was to lead in these landing craft. Although the landing subsequently took place according to plan, I fear that the 15 minutes delay must have been partly responsible for the very heavy opposition which the troops immediately encountered after landing, and which epparently pinned them down on the beach area throughout the day.

of L.C.As.f landed additional troops on this beach according to plan. This landing took place at about 0545 and encountered no abnormal opposition. At about 0530 I was informed that a signal had been received stating that no landing had taken place on Blue Beach, and I reported this in my situation report made at 0612. Actually there is some reason to suppose that this report was of German origin but the whole of the events that took place ashore at Blue Beach were obscure, although it was clear from the very outset that the troops were held up. + There is little doubt that this was the chief cause of the failure of the Military plan, and in view of the uncertainty about what really happened, I have since requested the Commanding Officer, H.M.S. QUEEN EMMA to conduct a close enquiry with all the boat officers concerned. The resulting report has been forwarded separately.
