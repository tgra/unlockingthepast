ENCLOSURE I.
HM.S. DEVONSHIRE.
13th May, 1942.
REPORT OF PROCEEDINGS—OPERATION
“* TRONCLAD 7”,
The Approach to the Western Anchorage.
During the greater part of the passage from
Durban with convoy Y (slow convoy) DEVON-
SHIRE experienced favourable currents which
made the problem of arriving at the right time

1595

principally a question of delaying the advance
of the convoy by the correct amount. It was
essential to keep a certain amount in hand since
at any moment a strong South Westerly set
from the direction of Cape Amber might be ex-
perienced. During the night of Sunday, 3rd
May /Monday, 4th May, a set of 0.7 knots in a
direction of 0go° was experienced. It was de-
cided to hold the convoy back sufficiently for
DEVONSHIRE to be within reach of position
AA at 8 knots. During the forenoon of Monday,
4th May, convoy Y was manoeuvred on courses
at right angles to the line of advance in order
to achieve the necessary delay, but in so doing
the screen became considerably disorganised.

2. At 1500 the signal ‘‘ Proceed in execution
of previous orders ’’ was received and the whole
force formed up. DEVONSHIRE was in station
5 miles ahead of the starboard wing of the con-
voy steering 058° at 9 knots by 1545.

3. Group II formed up as an A/S screen two
miles ahead as shown below: —

FREESIA
CROMER POOLE
ROMNEY AURICULA
CROMARTY NIGELLA
ANTHONY DEVONSHIRE LAFOREY
WINCHESTER. CASTLE LIGHTNING

4. The estimated 1800 position was passed to
LAFOREY at 1603 based on the latest fix
obtained at noon. At 1800, which was just
before dark, LAFOREY, LIGHTNING and
ANTHONY were detached. The remainder of
the screen altered course to 118° to conform
with DEVONSHIRE’s intended alteration at
1830. It had been anticipated that DEVON-
SHIRE would pass through position 298° AA
two miles at 1830.

5. At 1840, by which time it was quite dark,
the evening star sights showed that the North
Easterly set had in effect reversed during the
afternoon, and DEVONSHIRE’s position at
1830 was 220° AA seven miles. Course was
therefore altered without signal at 1900 to 096°
in order to regain the correct line of approach
and to counteract this set. This alteration was
not immediately noticed by the screen who got
along way out of position in consequence.
However they did not lose touch and had
tegained their stations by 2000.

6. This last fix also indicated that the force

was early. No immediate adjustment was made
because the possibility of an adverse current had
still to be allowed for.
- 7. Land echoes by R.D.F. were obtained
between 2030 and 2100, but were of no value at
that time. At 2100, just before moonrise, the
high land on Cape San Sebastian was sighted
and a reasonably good fix obtained by visual
bearing and R.D.F. range. More land was
sighted after moonrise, and at 2150 Windsor
Castle was identified at a distance of 40 miles
and a good fix obtained. At this time DEVON-
SHIRE was in position 298° ZB 18 miles.

8. Course was altered to 118° at 2200 and the
speed reduced to 84 knots without signal. The
screen detected this alteration with less difficulty
than before and was soon back in station.

ROYAL ULSTERMAN

g. The set now seemed to work round to the
Eastward again, and speed was reduced to
8 knots at 2230 to allow for it. No reliable
fixes could be obtained between 2230 and 2300
because the land was in shadow, but at 2312
another good fix was obtained putting
DEVONSHIRE in position 330° ZB 6 miles,
having been set about 2} mules to the North-
ward. It was evident that the sweepers and
FREESIA were short of manoeuvring room,
but they had to be left to work it out for them-
selves. x

to. The first dan buoy was sighted at 2306.
At 2318 DEVONSHIRE altered to 138° and
later to 155°.

Iz. At 2338 LIGHTNING’s three vertical
lights were switched on, and thereafter the
havigation was not difficult. At 2342
ANTHONY passed close alongside and reported
that there was no set, also that the outer dan
had drifted to the South West.

Tuesday, 5th May.

12. At 0001 course was altered to 109° past
the first dan buoy to follow the minesweepers
which could becleatly seen ahead; LIGHTNING
was abeam to starboard 6 cables away at 0008
and signalled “Set 150° $ knot.’’ The right
hand edge of Nosi Hara which had been
selected as a leading mark was clearly visible
bearing 114°. DEVONSHIRE had thus passed
ZB 33 minutes early. ~

13. The passage along the swept chahinel was
somewhat confused because it was difficult to
see which sweepers were sweeping, and ‘several
of the dans broke adrift. The first or outer dan
(laid by LAFOREY) had been cut and had
drifted to the South West, so it was left to star-
board. ‘
