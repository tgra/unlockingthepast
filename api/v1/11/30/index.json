            "description": "As a site for a base, Dimapur possessed almost every conceivable disadvantage: heavy rainfall ; unhealthy climate ; and uneven ground (which did not become apparent until the dense jungle had been cleared). Moreover, it lies on a narrow tongue of land between two rivers, both of which are liable to overflow during the monsoon. To these local topographical disadvantages must be added the further one of the liability to interruption of the railway to Assam by the rivers and streams which pour down from the huge catchment area of the Himalayas, the foothills of which the railway skirts. In.1942, the railway was cut by floods from the 24th June till the 30th November.",

            "description": "‘car which had reached General Freyberg’s headquarters broke down at the crucial ‘moment, and Brigadier Pienaar postponed further advance until daylight when he could ‘see what was happening. By midday on the 30th November wireless touch with the New Zealand Division was restored, and General Norrie, who had stayed with the South Africans, arranged with General Freyberg for them to attack Point 175 from the east. The advance proceeded slowly and there was a long pause when the brigade reached the escarpment east of Point 175. Finally a moonlight attack was staged. But the position was strong and well supported by tanks, so that at dawn on ‘the ist December the South Africans were still 3,000 yards short of their objective, and spent the whole day attempting to take the position. , Belhamed fell early on the rst December before a heavy attack launched by enemy tanks and infantry from Sidi Rezegh. The qth Armoured Brigade rushed from its leaguer some miles south of Point 175, but arrived in time only to cover the retirement of the New Zealand Division to Zafraan.",

            "description": "On the 2gth November violent assaults began on both flanks of the corridor. After several heavy, ‘but unsuccessful attacks on Ed Duda, the enemy at length penetrated between Ed Duda and Belhamed, and secured a foothold on the crest of the position. The garrison launched a counter-attack, and by daybreak the whole position was once more in our hands. Meanwhile the enemy succeeded in making a permanent breach on the southern flank. The New Zealand troops holding Point 175 drove off two attacks in the morning, but eventually fell victims to a ruse, mistaking German tanks for the advanced guard of the South African Brigade. Next day the enemy captured the rest of Sidi Rezegh Ridge. During the afternoon of the 30th November the 6th New Zealand Brigade, reduced to barely one-third of its fighting strength and with only two support tanks left, was assailed by fifty tanks from the west and large numbers of infantry from the south, and after a gallant resistance was overwhelmed.",
