had reached the Sunle-Htinzin area, though
their concentration was hindered by swollen
streams. The third brigade (the 21st) of the
Division was protecting the road in the rear.

52. Ukhrul Area, At the end of July, com-
‘mand of the Ukhrul area had passed from
20 Indian Division to 4 Brigade of 2 British
Division.

6 Brigade of this Division was responsible
for a sector of the main Kohima — Imphal road,
and 5 Brigade was operating in the Tamu
sector under 23 Indian Division. 4 Brigade
was operating in the Ukhrul area with patrols
as far as Humine. .

In the middle of August columns were
directed on Homalin to destroy what was left
of the enemy between the Angouching Range
and the Chindwin. At the end of August
these columns were actively engaged in clear-
ing this area despite rising streams. The other
two brigades of 2 British Division were with-
drawn to Kohima.

53. Myothit-Thaungdut Area. On _ the
10th August “Tarcol”, a special force of two
battalions and a detachment of engineers, was
formed from troops of 20 Indian Division to
drive the enemy from the Myothit - Thaungdut
area.

In the third week of August, “ Tarco]l ” was
increased by an additional battalion. Having
successfully crossed the difficult Yu River, this
force was, at the end of the month, advancing
on Tonhe, after destroying weak enemy parties
which they met.

Patrols from an Indian battalion of this
column reached the Chindwin River on the
30th August, the first troops to do so since
the Japanese crossed it at the opening of their
offensive in March.

Summary of Operations in August.

54. Arakan. Activity limited to patrolling.

55. Chin Hills and Chindwin. During the
month, the advance along the Imphal-
Tiddim road had continued. By the end
of the month our troops had crossed the
Assam-Burma frontier and reached a point
21 miles south of the border. Numbers of
tanks, guns and vehjcles had been captured.

The Japanese were constructing defences in
the Tiddim area and appeared likely to make
a stand.

Further east, British and Indian troops ad-
vancing to the south-east had capured the
village of Tamu on the 4th August. 11 (East
African) Division, which then took over from
them, had begun operations east and south
of Tamu and, by the end of the month, were
within four miles of Sittaung. To the south
they had reached Htinzin.

56. At the end of August, the Japanese were
holding positions astride the Tamu - Sittaung
track, the track Tamu - Yuwa, in the hills to
the east of the Tamu-Kalemyo road, and
astride the road at Yazagyo.

57. North of Tamu, “ Tarcol ” had captured
the village of Thanan, 12 miles north-west of
Thaungdut, and were advancing on Tonhe.

58. North Burma. Myitkyina was captured
on the 3rd August after a siege lasting 78 days.
The greater part of the garrison of 6,000 was
annihilated, although some troops escaped
down the Irrawaddy on rafts.

SUPPLEMENT To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 APRIL, 1951

Chinese forces crossed the Irrawaddy east of
Myitkyina and moved down the Myitkyina -—
Bhamo road to Kazu where, at the end of
August, they were consolidating.

+ About 20 miles west of Kazu, detachments
of Kachin Levies were in contact with the
enemy along the east bank of the Irrawaddy.

36 British Division was advancing down the °
railway south-west of Mogaung and had
captured the village of Pinbon.

50 Chinese Division had completed its con-
centration in the Mogaung area.

Events in September.

59. Tasks allotted to 15 Indian Corps—
Early September. On the 4th September,
General Slim in an Operation Instruction
warned the Commander, 15 Indian Corps, that
Fourteenth Army would launch large-scale
offensive operations across the Chindwin into
Central Burma about December and that his
réle would be:—

(@) To secure his present positions in

Arakan, including Maungdaw.

(b) To keep open the sea line of com-

Spicalion through the entrance to the River

{c) To destroy any Japanese force which
might launch an offensive in the Arakan.
(it was possible that the enemy might attack
in as a counter to our offensive
across the Chindwin.)

(@) To exploit any withdrawal or excessive
Henning out of the Japanese forces opposing

These orders amplified the Operation In-
struction which I had issued on the 29th July
regarding our post-monsoon operations. It
became necessary, however, to amend these
orders at the end of September, but I shall
deal with this in a later paragraph.

Operations in September. 3

60. Arakan Front—15 Indian Corps. In
pursuance of the Corps policy of anticipat-
ing the enemy on important tactical features,
and with the object of securing bases for
operations directly the monsoon was over,
moves were made by 25 Indian Division during
September. As events proved, it was not
always possible to anticipate the enemy, and
sharp fighting on a small scale was frequently
necessary to evict him. By the middle of
September units of 25 Indian Division were
firmly established along the main spine of the
Mayu Range. Small but violent enemy counter-
attacks on the nights 14th/15th and 15th/16th
were heavily repulsed, as was another deter-
mined attack at the end of the month. The
situation then was: ;

25 Indian Division:—patrolling to the
east and south-east down the Kalapanzin
River, after having advanced well south of
the Tunnels Area.

26 Indian Division:—one brigade in the
Taung Bazaar and Goppe Bazaar areas
respectively, with one brigade in reserve.

81 (West African) Division : —continuing
its concentration which had begun some three
weeks previously in the Singpa area (five
miles west-north-west of Mowdok).

61. Chindwin Front—33 Corps : (a) 5 Indian
Division (Imphal-Tiddim Road). The ad-
vance down the Tiddim road continued. On
