The Commander of 2nd Corps reported that the Belgian 1st Corps was now reforming in 4th Division area. I also discussed the organisation of the second position on the Senne canal and of a Corps reserve line east of Brussels. 5th and 48th Divisions were ordered to reconnoitre the Senne position on 15th May.

On the British front, the day passed quietly on the whole. 1st Corps was not attacked in strength ; 3rd Division of znd Corps was attacked north-west of Louvain and its forward positions were penetrated, but a counterattack successfully restored the original line. There was considerable enemy bombing of rearward areas during the day, and the movement of refugees became increasingly difficult to control, This was, in part, due to the bombing of Tournai and other towns on the routes and to the French decision to close the frontier to pedestrian and horsed traffic. Despite my requests, made as early as roth May, the Belgian authorities had done nothing to restrict the use of private motor cars or the sale of petrol.",

In October a very valuable reinforcement of 17 officers and 20 Warrant and Non-Commissioned officers was received from Southern Rhodesia. No other reinforcements reached the Protectorate till 15th May, 1940. The Governor's request to be allowed to enlist 50 additional men in the Camel Corps, made on 15th September, 1939, was not approved till the spring of 1940, some six months later. A recommendation submitted by myself to the War Office on 15th January, 1940, to mechanize two Camel Corps Companies was not approved until 19th May, 1940.*",

But although the reinforcement of the garrison had been approved in principle in January, 1940, it was not till gth March that authority was received to move one battalion, and owing to difficulty in providing the necessary shipping it was not till 15th May that the rst Battalion Northern Rhodesia Regiment -of the King's African Rifles, with certain administrative units, arrived at Berbera and be to disembark.

The problem of command was difficult, particularly in regard to artillery support, while the South Africans were advancing from the south side of the hill. Throughout 14th May the South African Brigade advanced towards Triangle, the big feature overlooking the pass from the south-east. Assisted iby the Patriots, who, in this area, did excellent work, the Triangle was captured by o800 hours on 15th May, finally closing the circle. This made further resistance by the enemy merely useless waste of life, and, on 16th May, an armistice was asked for and granted. Subsequent negotiations resulted in the unconditional surrender of the Italian garrison who were granted the honours of war. .",

Directly Akyab Island was occupied, work began on expanding the existing allweather airfield so that it could accommodate three transport and three and a half tactical squadrons, with a target completion date of the 15th May.. At the same time, to meet the immediate and pressing needs of Fourteenth Anny, a fair-weather transport field for two squadrons was constructed and opened on the 17th February. Two tactical strips were also made. Fourteenth Army's rapid progress, however, made further demands on the airfield development of Akyab. A second fair-weather transport strip was called for, and an advance on the completion date for the all-weather airfield, and finally an increase in the operational capacity of the latter was required. Despite many difficulties this programme of work was completed ahead of schedule. The works on Akyab Island were begun by the Chief Engineer, 15 Indian Corps, but early in February, the responsibility was taken over by the commander of an Army Group Royal Engineers, working directly under my Chief Engineer.",

Although flying was certain to be intermittent and hazardous, air supply became often the only practicable means, but it was entirely dependent on allweather airfields. Al] administrative planning had to include provision for the continuance of adequate maintenance under monsoon conditions. The absolute importance of completing the construction of all-weather airfields for supply aircraft before the monsoon was therefore obvious.",

These dates were, however, not nearly early enough to support Fourteenth Army's rapid advance and it became necessary to develop fair-weather airfields and to put them into operation simultaneously with the construction of the all-weather ones. Two squadrons of C.47 aircraft began supply operations from Akyab on the 20th March, with No, 1 R.A.M.O. which had been switched from Imphal, and a further two squadrons by- the end of the month. Half a squadron operated from Kyaukpyu during April for the supply of troops in Arakan only. The all-weather airfields were in fact completed in both places in early May, when each base operated three squadrons of C.47 transport aircraft.",
