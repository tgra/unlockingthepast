He was not as yet well placed to do this since his administrative position was not yet firm; on the other hand there was no immediate risk in advancing ahead of his main strength since the enemy main forces were fully engaged elsewhere. Medenine, the road junction in front of the Mareth line, had been occupied by us on the 18th and by the next day headquarters and one Brigade of 51 Division were at Ben Gardane, with the other two brigades moving forward from Tnpoli. By the 24th Eighth Army had two armoured car regiments in contact with the outposts of the Mareth line and General Leclerc’s force, now known as ‘‘L’’ force, had occupied Ksar Rhilane, a desert outpost thirty miles west of the Matmata mountains; 51 Division continued to move up and all three brigades were forward of Medenine, but not in contact with the enemy, by the 25th. In the meanwhile I had informed General Montgomery on 23rd February that the situation at Kasserine was now improved and ordered him, while keeping up a display of force, not to prejudice the future by undue risks. He rephed on the 27th that he had been careful to keep well balanced and considered his present position adequately strong.",

This Force had suffered seriously from disease, especially malaria, during ts 1944 campaign, When I inspected it in December, 1944, I formed the opinion that, despite its splendid achievements and fine esprit-de-corps, it was no longer battle-worthy and that it could not be used for the Capital airborne operation. Moreover I considered that there was no longer a justifiable réle for a force such as this, which, like all forces of this nature, was particularly expensive in overheads such as Headquarters and Signals. I therefore recommended its disbandment, and later, on the 23rd February, was informed by. India Command that the War Office had approved my recommendation.",

On the Northern Combat Area Command front 36 British Division (less 29 Brigade), advancing on Mongmit from the north, effected a strongly opposed crossing of the Shweli River during the first week of February. The first attempt failed, but the second one, made with increased air support, was successful near the bend of the river north of Myitson. Myitson fell on the 9th February and the advance continued against stiff resistance. On the 17th, the enemy counterattacked in strength, using flame-throwers and rouch artillery. They succeeded in penetrating our forward positions, but were ejected by a Spirited attack by an Indian battalion after bitter hand-to-hand fighting. Our further progress towards Mongmit continued to meet with determined resistance. 29 Brigade, advancing on Mongmit from the west, captured Nabu on the 18th February and, by the end of the month, had reached a point approximately half way between Nabu and Mongmit, Further east, 50 Chinese Division entered Namtu on the 23rd February, capturing eleven locomotives and a quantity of tolling stock. Further east again, 30 Chinese Division captured Hsenwi on the night 18th— 19th February against light opposition. This village lies on the Burma Road about 30 miles north-east of Lashio. The enemy in this sector appeared to be falling back to positions immediately north of Lashio, with a view to defending that town.",
