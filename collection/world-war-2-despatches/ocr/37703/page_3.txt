SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 28: AUGUST, 1946

and West a final line of defence had been
selected by General Sir E. P. Quinan and pre-
pared by troops of Tenth Army.

6. North Persia is a mountainous country,
with few localities where airfields. can be de-
veloped rapidly. Between the open country
about Kasvin-Teheran-Hamadan on the South,
and the River Araxes on the North, the only
areas offering reasonable facilities for airfields
lie in the valley between Ardebil and Tabriz
and about Lenkoran on the Caspian coast.

‘Possession of this area was extremely im-
portant. As long as I could hold it, the Royal
Air Force would be able to provide fighter
cover for troops in action against the enemy
and for bombers attacking his communications;
if I lost it these advantages would be trans-
ferred to the enemy, and the Royal Air Force,
forced on to the defensive, would have to dis-
perse its efforts to provide fighter protection
for the vulnerable oil installations, ports and
communications.

I had reluctantly to come to the conclusion
that the forces I could maintain north of this
important area were not strong enough to fight
a successful battle if the Germans attacked in
strength. ‘I determined, however, to hold it as
long as I could, and it was therefore my in-
tention to send forward to the River Araxes
whatever mobile forces I could maintain, to
delay any German advance for as long as
possible. . ‘

7. By the end of September, 1942, I had had
sufficient opportunity to consider’ the situation
and to discuss it with General Sir E. P. Quinan,
Commander Tenth Army, who had been study-
ing’ the problem ‘for some time and had -been
able to visit North Persia and see something
of the country. By this time the likelihood
of a winter campaign in North Persia was re-
ceding, the earliest date by which it was esti-
mated the Germans could reach the River
Araxes having already been put back to
15th November.

I had at this time only one Indian Motor
Brigade and two Infantry Divisions fit to
undertake operations and could not have main-
tained more than this force in North Persia
without substantial administrative reinforce-
ments, which even if they were available from
the Middle East, could not reach Persia for
some weeks.

At this time the troops in Persia and Iraq
Command were located mainly in the Persian
Highlands about Hamadan and Kermanshah,
where the winter climate is very severe. It
was desirable to move them for the winter to
milder areas and this move could not be long
delayed. It was my intention to bring all the
troops back to the railways for the winter,
in order to reduce the strain on. the transport
available and afford it opportunity for refitting
before the Spring. I intended also to cut down
to ‘the minimum the force in Persia, whose
maintenance requirements had to be moved up
the Persian line of communications in diminu-
tion of the flow of aid to Russia.-

‘My first proposal was to locate two
divisions, which force I could expect to main-
tainin North Persia if operations took place
during the winter, in the area of Kasvin; but
as this was in the Russia zone’ the concurrence
of the Russian Government ‘had’ first to be
obtained.. ‘As the time was not considered ‘ex-
pedient for an approach ‘in this sense to the

Russian Government, I had to modify my plan;
this involved little or no risk, as the sustained
Russian defence at Stalingrad and in the North
Caucasus continued to postpone the date by
which German intervention in North Persia
might. be expected. I therefore reduced the
force in Persia to one division and one motor
brigade, located in the British zone at Qum
and Andimishk respectively; the remainder -of
the troops being brought back to winter train-
ing locations oa the Iraq railway.

8. By November, 1942, the course of the
campaign in Russia and the opening of the
Allied offensive in North Africa’ had rendered
a German threat to North Persia during the
winter almost -impossible; the earliest date for
possible operations was estimated to be
15th April, 1943, five or six divisions being
considered the maximum force the Germans
were likely to deploy on or south of the River
Araxes. ‘

The troops in Persia and Iraq had mean.
while completed their moves to winter locations,
and arrivals from other theatres had increased
the strength available. I had now at my dis-
posal two British divisions and one British
Armoured brigade; three Indian divisions (two
with three Infantry brigades each and one
with two); one Indian Armoured division (with
some light tanks and trucks in place of medium
tanks); and one Polish division reasonably pre-
pared for operations. The remainder. of the
Polish Army was in process of organization,
equipment and training, and for some months
to come could not be-counted on for operations.
The. flow of equipment into the Command was
increasing and some improvement had been
effected in the “transport position, © "+" ¢

To achieve a balanced fighting force for pos-
sible operations in the Spring of 1943, I formed
the British and Indian Infantry divisions into
two Corps (3rd and 21st Indian) each of one
British and one Indian division. Both Corps,
together with 31 Indian Armoured Division
and zo Indian Motor Brigade, were placed
under command of Tenth Army for operations
in North Persia. I intended to retain direct com-
mand of the Polish Corps and to hold the re-
maining Indian Tafantry division (of two Infan-
try brigades) in general reserve, and with this
in view incorporated with it as an integra] part
7th British Armoured Brigade. .

My general plan to meet a German offensive
in the Spring remained substantially as before,
though I now had at my disposal a force more
nearly adequate to its task. |

I was still not in a position to maintain
sufficient forces far enough forward to make
sure of stopping the enemy before he reached
the Northern group of. airfields about Ardebil
and Tabriz; my intention remained, therefore,
to secure these areas for as long as possible and
subsequently to defeat the enemy South and
South West of Mianeh if he should succeed in
advancing so far. ' .

The defence of Northern Iraq against an
attack from Lake Urmia I proposed to entrust
to the Polish Army in the East, assisted by
troops of the Iraqi Army. (My outline plan
was submitted to the War Office on 17th
November, 1942.) : x
