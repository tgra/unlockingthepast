\ ' THE BATTLE OF CRETE
IARRATIVE BY THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, _

AsE IV—TueE .EVACuATION- OF THE BRITISH

‘AND IMPERIAL FORCES FROM THE ISLAND:

After a battle which had lasted eight days, it
was decided that our troops were not any longer
in a position to resist effectively and must be
evacuated. So far, the Mediterranean Fleet had
already lost two cruisers and four destroyers be-
sides having the aircraft carriér, two battleships,
one cruiser and one destroyer virtually out of
action. Amother five cruisers. and four
) destroyers had suffered minor damage, which
did not, however, greatly affect their steaming
powers or fighting efficiency. The fleet was now
given the task of attempting to evacuate some
22,000 men, mostly from an open beach on the
south coast of Crete, 360 miles from the fleet
base at Alexandria.

2. Up to date the fleet had been required to
operate without fighter protection (except for
the brief period on the 26th May, when FOR-
MIDABLE’s fighters weré available). On the
agth May, a message was received from the Air
Officer Commianding-in-Chief, Royal Air Force,

Middle East, stating that the Royal Air Force

would do all possible to provide some fighter
-, cover for ships but ‘owing to the distance from
our bases, the cover would only be meagre and
spasmodic (H.Q.R.A.F., M.E. A.458 of 27th
May, time of origin 1718 of 27th
May). Group <eptain Cc. B. R. Pelly from
R.A.F.H.Q., M.E. was attached temporarily
to the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean’s
staff at Alexandria, in order to co-ordinate

fighter protection with the monte of fleet «

3.. Throughout the evacuation, great diffi-

‘ enity was experienced in finding out the exact

\ numbers to be removed on each night. This

sometimes resulted in the ships not being quite

filled to capacity and sometimes in not enough
ships being sent.

4. The method adopted in allocating ships
was as follows: —

The numbers.to be taken off and the em-
barkation: points would generally be signalled
by ‘‘CREFORCE ”’, the General Officer
Commanding, Troops in Crete. The initial
estimate of numbers, which proved to be
substantially correct, was given by the Naval
Officer-in-Charge, Suda Bay. The Com-
mander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, after con-
sulting Major General J. F. Evetts, C.B.,
C.B.E., M.C. (who was acting as his Military

Liaison Cfficer) would decide on the number _

of ae to be sent.’

a The original plan for bringing off troops was
as follows :—

(2) ‘Troops from the Maleme-Suda Bay
area were to come oft from Sphaki~

3115.

(2). Troops from the Retimo area were
_ to come off from Plaka Bay. 5

(c) Troops from the Heraklion area were
to be. taken off from Heraklion harbour.

. (4) A’small number of troops who. were
cut off to the south of Heraklion were

- expected to make their way to. Tymbaki.

(e) Evacuation was invariably to be
carried out at night, usually between the
hours of midnight and 0300. This allowed
ships to be as far as possible from enemy

. -air bases during daylight hours.

f) Ashore in Crete, the evacuation was
to be covered by troops fighting a rearguard
action from the Suda Bay area to the south
coast. Major General E. C. Weston,
Royal Marines, was Placed in charge of
-the rearguard,

5. It was decided that the. main evacuation
on the night of 28th/2gth May should be from
Heraklion. It will be recalled that on the
23rd May the enemy had delivered an ulti-
matum to the Heraklion garrison to surrender,
but this had been rejected by the British and
Greek Commanders. During the ensuing days
the enemy were re-inforced continuously by
troop-carrying planes. In spite of this the
garrison held out, delivered counter attacks
and inflicted severe losses on the enemy right
up to the time of evacuation,

28th /2oth May, 1941.

6. At o600 on the 28th May, Force B, con- .
sisting of C.S.7 in ORION with AJAX, DIDO,
DECOY, JACKAL, IMPERIAL, HOTSPUR,
KIMBERLEY and HEREWARD, left
Alexandria to evacuate the Heraklion garrison.
Force’B was about go miles from Scarpanto at
1700 and from then until dark was subjected
to a series of air attacks, consisting of high
level bombing, dive bombing and torpedo,
attack, At 1920 IMPERIAL was-near missed
but at the time appeared to be undamaged. At
2100 AJAX had a close miss which started a
small fire, seriously wounded twenty men and
caused slight damage to the ship’s side. In
view of the need for ships to be fully efficient
to carry out the night evdcuation and to cope
with the almost certain air attacks on the
following day, C.S.7, after receiving a report
of the damage from AJAX, decided that she
should return to Alexandria. Shortly. after
zioo, C.S.7 gave orders accordingly.

‘7, After passing through the Kaso Strait and
tuming to the westward, Force B was attacked
‘by a torpedo plane, without result. The force
arrived off Heraklion at 2330. The destroyers
immediately entered hawbour to. embark troops
from the jetties and ferry them to the cruiser
outside. By 0245 the ferrying was complete
and by 0300 KIMBERLEY and IMPERIAL
had embarked the rearguard. At 0320 the force
proceeded at 20 knots, having embarked the
whole of Heraklion garrison, amounting to
some 4,000 trocps. Twenty-five minutes later
IMPERIAL ’s steering gear failed and she nar-
towly missed colliding with both cruisers. This
could scarcely have happened: at a more in-
opportune time since it was essential to be as
far from enemy air, bases as possible by day-
light. C.S.7 was faced with the difficult: deci-
sion whether to wait in. the hope that the
steering gear gould he; repaired or to sink the
IMPERIAL and camry on.
