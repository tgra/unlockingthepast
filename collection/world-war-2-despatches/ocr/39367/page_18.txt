The Po Valley and North-West Italy.

201. The switching of the main air effort
northwards against the’ frontier routes implied
that more freedom of movement than formerly
was permitted the enemy in the Po Valley.
During the period of static ground operations,
however, this was considered of minor import-
ance. Nevertheless, a considerable M.A.T.A.F.
effort was continued against the principal lines
of communication immediately behind the battle
area, especially when bad weather prevented
operations further afield. During the period,
sorties were flown against the Po River zone
and in the Mincio, Oglia and Adda river zones,
branching northwards from the Po River. Par-
ticular attention was paid to the disruption of
lines leading to Milan, Turin, and Genoa in
order to hinder the transportation of looted
industrial and agricultural products bound for
the Reich. Also in March, the night intruder
effort was increased considerably, particularly
in the form of a greater number of attacks on
damaged bridges and diversions to demoralise
the enemy’s repair gangs. Generally, both the
day and night attacking aircraft in the Po
valley were increasingly concerned with de-
stroying rail and road traffic and rolling stock
in marshalling yards rather than the wrecking
of the railway system itself.

Air Effort in April.

202. In April M.A.T.A.F. maintained the in-
terdiction of communications between Italy and
the Reich until the 9th, when its main effort
was switched to the close support of the 15th
Army Group’s offensive. During the first eight
days of the month, the various elements of
M.A.T.A.F. continued to attack the same tar-
gets as during March. In particular, the medium
bombers flew nearly 400 sorties against the
Brenner Line, their main targets being the
bridges. By the gth of April the route was
blocked in eleven places. Desert Air Force
meanwhile continued to attack the lower reaches
of the north-east frontier routes and the lines
across the Venetian plain. On the eve of the
Allied offensive, the north-east frontier zone re-
mained well disrupted, and no through traffic
was possible across the Venetian plain. The
state of interdiction in the Po Valley itself was
also very satisfactory. The XXII T.A.C.
fighter-bombers paid a considerable amount of
attention to the east-west lines north of the Po
and their connecting lines, while the medium
bombers made’ fairly constant attacks on
bridges.

203. M.A.S.A.F.’s April effort against the
enemy’s railway communications in northern
Italy was further increased. During the four
days prior to the opening of the Army’s offen-
sive on the gth April the heavy bombers dropped
2,000 tons of bombs on bridges and marshalling
yards on the Brenner Pass route and also
attacked bridges, marshalling yards and loco-
motive depots on lines to the west of the route
and a marshalling yard.on the Piedicolle route.
Even after the offensive started, M.A.S.A.F.
continued to bomb the Italian railway system,
in addition to providing close support to our
advancing troops.

Enemy Repair Organisation.

204. The enemy’s chief means of combating
the interdiction programme was a large and
very efficient repair organisation.

205. He showed extraordinary energy im
effecting repairs and much resourcefulness in
reducing the vulnerability of targets. Troops
which were held up by the breaks were pressed
into the repair gangs; bridges were sometimes
replaced in 48 hours and craters were filled in
in far less time. -In spite of frantic efforts
at repair work and brilliant organisation, the
enemy was never able to counter our air attacks
sufficiently to make an appreciable difference
to his desperate situation. e whole area was
sterilized and the German Army was becoming
more and more impotent because of the im-
possibility of movement—even by night.

206. During the latter part of 1944 the enemy
resorted to deception to supplement his repairs
and it certainly became a very clever and much
used means to increase the flow of traffic. At
Calcinato, a span of the bridge was constantly
seen to be out during air reconnaissance, but
accumulated evidence proved that traffic was
passing over at night. In fact, when a night
reconnaissance was flown, the missing span was
revealed in place. This particular bridge at
Calcinato became known as the first ‘‘ night
operational ’’ bridge.

207. As our attacks increased in number, so
the number of ‘‘ night operational ’’ bridges
increased also, During April eleven of these
bridges were noted; ten of them were attacked
and put out of service for varying lengths of
time,

208. Another method of deception used by
the enemy was to maintain the unserviceability
of selected bridges when there was no imme-
diate need for their use. Certain damaged
bridges were repaired up to a certain point—
left so that they looked quite impassable—yet
could be made passable in a few hours.

209. Full maintenance of the interdiction de-
pended on the weather. Good weather made
it possible to achieve complete success, but in
periods of bad weather prohibiting flying,
repairs were rapidly carried out by the enemy
and supplies adequate, for some days hurriedly
passed through. In spite of these weather diffi-
culties, the railways (as has been shown) were
blocked almost continuously.

Interdiction of road communications.

210. Road movement was also dealt with in
a systematic way. The whole area of enemy
occupied Italy was divided up into a number
of areas and regularly patrolled by aircraft of
Tactical Air Force both by day and by night.
Tn this way, it was possible to keep an accurate
check on all enemy road movements and to
attack road transport wherever it was found.
However, German road movements were
strictly limited because of the shortage of oil
fuel. Oxen were used to tow lorries, and so
valuable had even small quantities of petrol
become that members of the German 98th Divi-
sion were offered a reward of a thousand
cigarettes if they returned from a patrol with
a tin of captured: petrol.

Interdiction of water communications.

21x. As a result of the attacks on his other
forms of communication the enemy made an
increasing use of waterborne traffic. Shipping
travelling by night carried supplies from Trieste
and the Istrian ports, ‘while ‘barges’ were used
in the waterways of North-East Italy to support
