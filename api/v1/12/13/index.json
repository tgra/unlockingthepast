The 4th Indian Division was directed south of Gazala on Tmimi and Bir Halegh el Eleba. The principal task of the 7th Armoured Division (4th Armoured Brigade and 7th Support Group) was to protect the left flank of the Indian Division, but it was also to send columns and armoured cars to raid the enemy communications near Tmimi and to patrol towards Mechili. The movements of the 4th Armoured Brigade continued to be restricted by supply difficulties until the morn- ing of the 13th December. The 22nd Guards Motor Brigade was placed under command of the Armoured Division and held in reserve near Knightsbridge. The 7oth Division was left in Tobruk to round up scattered parties of the enemy lurking in the deep coastal wadis."

            "description": "The 13th Corps began to attack this line on the 13th December. In the north the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade, which had already captured an important locality on the coast overlooking Gazala, could make no progress. In the centre the 5th Indian Infantry Brigade attempted to capture the Alem Hamza position and was repulsed, but later one battalion occu- pied a position to the south-west without opposi- tion. The 7th Indian Infantry Brigade were forming up to attack further south when they were themselves attacked by tanks. After a sharp encounter the enemy was beaten off with heavy loss, but no new ground was captured. Meanwhile the Support Group, reinforced by an armoured regiment, succeeded in making the enemy fall back on the southern flank, although the armoured regiment lost one-third of its tanks in an action fought to the rear of the enemy positions."

Parry, Captain C. H. L. Woodhouse and Captain F. S. Bell, and also that I had been promoted to Rear Admiral to date 13th December.

One company of 5/7 Rajput Regt. was therefore ordered to cover the withdrawal of the remainder and then themselves embark in the last flights.

            "description": "186. On the 13th December the policy as re- gards the defence of Penang had to be reviewed in the light of the situation on the mainland which has been described earlier in this Sec- tion. There was avery real danger that the tz Indian Division, which at this time was in an exhausted and very disorganized condition, would be overrun and cease to exist as a fight- ing formation. There was also the danger that the threat from Kroh, which was now much greater than we had anticipated, would cut the communications of the 11 Indian Division in the Kuala Kangsar area. If either of these things had happened, the enemy would have had a clear run down the west coast, for there were no other troops with which to oppose him north of Johore, and by doing so he would have cut the communications of 9 Indian Division on the east coast. That was the situation we had to face and we had the choice of trying to fight the enemy both on the mainland and on Penang Island or of concentrating the whole of our resources for the battle on the mainland. The anchorage was no longer of any use."
