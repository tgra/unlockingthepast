A new bridgehead was established by 33 Corps opposite Myinmu, in the teeth of determined opposition on the part of the Japanese, who took it to be part of a major encircling movement against Mandalay in conjunction with the forces in the Singu bridgehead to the north. They accordingly threw in most of their available reserves to combat it. A feint crossing was made far to the south, opposite Seikpyu, while the main thrust was made a little upstream, opposite Myitche, where 4 Corps was able to establish a foothold against comparatively light opposition from the enemy, who still underestimated the threat to his left flank. When this bridgehead had been consolidated, a motorised brigade was concentrated behind its lines."
