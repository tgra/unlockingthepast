            "description": "In the open desert country of Cyrenaica superiority in armour was in my opinion the essential of any offensive. To achieve this we needed at least half as many tanks again as the enemy, taking into account the relative efficiency of the German tanks and our own. Over and above that we needed a reserve equal to at least twenty-five per cent. of the number deployed with units. Judging from past experience, the reserve should have been double that figure; but I was prepared to take that risk. Estimates of relative strengths, based on information then available and on the assumption that no troops or equipment would have to be diverted to the Northern Front or elsewhere, showed that we might hope to attain the desired Position by the 1st May.*",

Fighting continued for two days and on the 1st May, Hurricanes of Nos. 73 and 274 Squadrons maintained fighter patrols to protect our troops and,, artillery against enemy fighter and bomber action. The Hurricanes encountered enemy fighters, in greatly superior numbers but shot down 4 Me.r109's in flames, with the loss of 1 Hurricane. Our troops successfully counterattacked, destroying 11 enemy tanks and inflicting other heavy losses. The enemy however, retained a hold on 5,000 yards of the outer perimeter and our line was adjusted accordingly. A further attack by the enemy on the 2nd May was repulsed, after which the enemy effort there appeared to be temporarily spent.",

            "date": "1st May",
            "description": "A final conference was held on 1st May, also in the War Room at Caserta, at which decisions were taken on the remaining outstanding points. D-day was fixed at 11th May and H-hour at 2300 hours; postponement would only be on account of bad weather and would be for periods of twenty-four hours, the decision to postpone being taken not later than 1600 hours on D-day. The breakout from Anzio, which it had already been agreed should be prepared for D plus 4, would take place when a penetration of the enemy's second line of defence on the main front (i.e. the   Hitler  line) had been achieved. It was hoped that there would be sufficient air resources to meet all the demands of both Armies but, if not, priority would go in the first phase of the attack to Eighth Army and in the second, the breakout from Anzio, to VI Corps. Until the attack was about to open the air forces would continue with their existing plan of attacks on enemy lines of communication. The effects of this were most valuable but, since this was the first time we had tried anything of this nature, there was a certain tendency to overestimate them. I felt it necessary to emphasize that our intelligence staff credited the Germans with at Jeast four weeks supplies at full operational rates and ventured the prophecy that we should have at least twenty-one days actual fighting, quite apart from days spent in movement, before the enemy could be defeated. It was actually twenty-four days from the opening of the offensive to the entry into Rome.",

On the 1st May, heavy air attacks were made on all knowa defences on both banks of the Rangoon River and the Parachute Battalion was dropped successfully at 0630 hours. They captured Elephant Point practically unopposed. It was only now that we received the first indication that the Japanese had virtually abandoned Rangoon.

The situation created by the Japanese occupation of Monywa was serious since it cut off all the Imperial Forces west of the River Mu from the direct approach to Ye-U through Monywa and also prevented the move of any forces up or across the Chindwin. Further, there was no regular formation of Imperial Forces in position to oppose an enemy advance  direct on Ye-U. The Commander x Burcorps at once ordered the 16 Infantry Brigade to move with all speed via Shwebo to cover the approaches to Ye-U from the south. The situation in Monywa, however, improved due to the prompt action of Commander x Burcorps and the courage and tenacity of the troops and by the morning of the 1st May the town was again temporarily in our hands.",

At this meeting, at which Commander 1 Burcorps was present, General Stilwell agreed that a withdrawal could no longer be delayed and the code words to put this into effect were issued at 1845 hours. General Stilwell also agreed that the situation at Monywa demanded the withdrawal of 7 Armoured Brigade from its position in support of 38 Chinese Division east of the River Mu and orders were therefore issued for 7 Armoured Brigade to move forthwith on the axis Ye-U Monywa.
