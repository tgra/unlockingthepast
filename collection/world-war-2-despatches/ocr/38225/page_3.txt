SUPPLEMENT 1o tHe LONDON GAZETTE, 4 MARCH, 1948

However, the night being clear, star sights
and the use of R.D.F.* echoes from islets and
prominent land, together with good visibility,
made it possible to allow for these variations.

23. Meanwhile, LAFOREY and LIGHT-
NING had gone inshore, LAFOREY’s task
being to buoy the channel roughly, and ascer-
tain the conditions for landing craft, LIGHT-
NING’S initial task being to act as a naviga-
tional fixed light to mark Nosi Fati shoal—
the starting point for the approaching ships.

In due course, LAFOREY laid her first

lighted dan, and thereafter buoyed the
approach channel as planned.
Dux.

24. Unfortunately, the first Main Channel
buoy was cither laid by LAFOREY in the in-
correct position or dragged, with the result that
the sweepers went too close to Nosi Fati shoal
and all four of them parted their sweeps.

M/S 14 was unaware at the time that the
sweeps of all had parted, and believed that
the channel was being swept according to plan.

In fact, this was not the case, and the
channel so far as the initial anchor berth of
the leading ships of the Assault Force, was
not swept.

25. At o124 DEVONSHIRE rounded Nosi
Hara and anchored as arranged, the transports
and M.T. ships anchoring to seaward in their
allotted berths.

26. At o154 WINCHESTER CASTLE
anchored silently in her pre-arranged position,
assault landing craft were lowered and by 0214
FREESIA, followed by ROMNEY and CROM-
ARTY, assault landing craft, and LAFOREY,
were proceeding up Courrier Bay for the point
where the assault craft would be unleashed
to attack Red Beach.

27. At 0303 a mine detonated in ROMNEY’s
sweep and others were seen to have been cut
by her. A second mine detonated and parted
ROMNEY’s sweep at 0315.

The setting off point for the assault craft was
reached at 0308 by which time it was estimated
that at least 17 mines had been cut or
detonated.

The skill, coolness, and accuracy with which
these ships and craft were brought safely
through a most difficult channel bristling with
mines, is above all praise, and is a shining
example of devotion to duty.

28. At 0230 the assault craft containing troops
of No. 5 Commando and B Company of 2 East
Lancashire Regiment, which was under com-
mand, set off for Red Beach, in the North
part of Courrier Bay. LAFOREY and
FREESIA stood by as ordered, to give support.

LIGHTNING and ROYAL ULSTERMAN
who had followed up the channel arrived at
0415, and on the return of A.L.C.sf from Red
Beach at 0515, troops from ROYAL ULSTER-
MAN embarked in them and set off at o6r1 for
Blue Beach, at Basse Point.

29. Meanwhile, assault craft containing
t Royal Scots Fusiliers and 2 Royal
Welsh Fusiliers from KEREN} and KARANJA

respectively had left their ships at 0227 and
0319’ for Green and White Beaches in
Ambararata Bay. These beaches were located
successfully without the use of the Lorenz beam
which was ineffective owing to the line of the
ships at anchor coinciding with the approach to
White Beach.

Complete surprise was achieved at Red,
Green and White Beaches, and only at Blue
Beach was opposition experienced. This was
successfully overcome by troops which had
landed at White Beach, crossed the peninsula,
and taken the defenders in the rear.

By 0620 about 2,300 of our troops had been
landed.

30. The situation in the main anchorage was
that mines were likely to be encountered to
the North and East of a line joining
Nosi Famaho to Mangoaka Point and the move
to Ambararata Bay anchorage could not be
made until a clearance sweep had been car-
ried out. This was completed without any
mines being cut by 0750, and-ships were ther
ordered to shift billet. This anchorage had
been laid out when it was considered that
White would be developed as the main beach,
and in consequence the turn round to Blue
Beach was long and it was obviously desirable
to move the anchorage opposite Blue Beach.
Sweepers were instructed to clear a new anchor-
age, but before it could be completed, 24 mines
had been cut, AURICULA mined, and so much
gear destroyed as to prejudice subsequent
sweeping operations in the main harbour. It
was therefore decided to abandon further
sweeping and accept the longer turn round and
bad loading conditions caused by wind and
sea. Difficulty was experienced in finding a
suitable beach for BACHAQUERO* and she
was finally beached on Red centre in the after-
noon after being swept in by CROMARTY.

31. To turn to the picture of the situation
as seen by the G.O.C., and me in the Flagship.
to seaward.

At 0314, having then received ANTHONY’s.
report, I informed the Admiralty that the
operation had begun, this message being cleared
at 0351.

My first intimation of any occurrence inshore
was LAFOREY’s report at 0318 that mines
had-been cut off Red Beach.
u-At about o44o sighting of starshell showed
that HERMIONE wa8& carrying out the pre-
arranged diversion on the East coast.

But communication with ships inshore was
poor, and undependable, and indeed so they
remained for much of D.z.

The first and positive report of progress was
LAFOREY’s message received at 0540 stating
that there was no sign of opposition ashore
and an optimistic suggestion that the Fleet
could now enter Courrier Bay.

Messages, some of them very much delayed,
showed that the vital No. 7 Battery had been
captured, and that our troops everywhere
seemed to be advancing, taking prisoners and
incurring negligible casualties themselves.

32. I knew that air operations had proceeded
according to plan and by 0720 I felt that the
assault had made a very good start. Troups
