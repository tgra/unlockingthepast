Hospital ship TJITJALENGKA was con
tacted by aircraft and directed to the Fleet:
she embarked a few sick and casualties.

H.M.A.S. NORMAN joined TF 57 replac-
ing H.M.A.S. NEPAL. Captain D. 27 in
H.M.S. KEMPENFELT assumed Senior Offi-
cer Destroyers for experience, vice Captain
D. 4 in
Force. ‘
. _ At 1800 detached H:M. Ships BENDIGO and

CAIRNS with R.F.A.s SAN AMBROSIO, SAN

ADOLPHO and CEDARDALE .to Manus.

H.M.S. PARRETT acted as additional escort

to them until dusk on 21st, May, with orders

to detach and proceed to Leyte at that time.
* At 1930 H.M.A.S. NEPAL was detached to

Leyte to augment the escorts available to CTF

112 for the forthcoming move south of the

Fleet Train.

At 1930. the Fleet ‘took departure for the .

operations area. .

American Task Group 52.1 “covered

Sakishima. ; “as

20th May. . .

The flying-off position for the day was to be
23° 39’ N 126° 40’ E..

First light- was, at 0458 when clouds were
low and about-8/Io0 and the horizon clear. At
0500 the four ‘‘KK’’ destroyers including
H.M.S. QUILLIAM, left the screen: as pre-
viously arranged, and* started to close their
carriers to form astern of them. The Fleet
was proceeding at 16 knots.

At o5z0 A.C.1 assumed tactical command.
The clouds were low and rain had started.
A-C.1. therefore ordered the postponement of
flying off aircraft for 15 minutes.

_ «At 0515 the Fleet ran into dense fog. ' At
0524 H.M.S. QUILLIAM, endeavouring to
form astern of H.M.S. INDOMITABLE,
collided with her. Fortunately no casualties

‘were sustained, but superficial above water’

damage was caused to H.M.S. INDOMIT-
ABLE, and serious damage to the bow of
H.M.S. QUILLIAM. As soon as the damaged
destroyer ‘was clear of the screen, H.M.A.S.
NORMAN was ordered to take her in tow. At
0615 H.M.S. BLACK PRINCE was sent to
stand by both ships and escort them to area
Cootie. The Commander Logistic Support
Group was later ordered by signal to despatch
from area Cootie H.M. Tug WEASEL to tow,
and H.M.S. RULER to. provide air cover.

H.M.A.S. NORMAN experienced ‘consider-

able difficulty in towing H.M.S. QUILLIAM .

stern first, as the wrecked bow hanging in the
water acted as a formidable hard over rudder.
By 1300 H.M.S. BLACK PRINCE had taken
over the tow, but the same difficulty restricted
the towing speed to 3 and later to 54 knots.

As the weather remained unsuitable for fly-

ing, the Fleet was manoeuvred until 0745 so as
to cover the damaged destroyer. :

At 0745, by which time the weather had im-
poved. slightly CAPS and the first strike ‘were
flown off. Although 4 bomber strikes were
planned, weather conditions ‘throughout the
day ‘made only one strike possible and seriously
hampered its effectiveness, . Looe

QUILLIAM' who remained with the.

’ celled his strike.
At 1210 two bogeys were detected 50 miles ©

SUPPLEMENT. To THE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 JUNE, 1948

Strike Able, after only finding the island with
great gifticully bombed. Hirara town in Miyako
through a clear patch of cloud, while‘ Fire-

’ flies rocketted ground installations.

Strikes Baker and Charlie had to be can-
celled for weather, and the outlook for strike
Dog was far from promising. However, in
view of CIF 51’s signal stressing the import-
ance of evening strikes on Sakishima in order*
to reduce the. weight of dusk and moonlight
attacks on Okinawa, it was decided to make
the attempt, and the strike took off, at 1530
for Ishigaki.. The weather .however was so
bad that the strike was unable to get through
ty the island and had to be brought back to the

leet. ; . :
During the forenoon CTG 99.2’s signal was
received, indicating the intention of that group
to strike Miyako with shore based aircraft at
17oo. It was therefore decided to withdraw
CAPS from that island by 1600. The strike
planned for Ishigaki at 1630 was not altered.
These intentions were communicated to CTF 5x
and CTG: 99.2. In the event, however, and
presumably because of weather, CTG 99.2 can-

to the westward tracking 040°. Fighters sent
to intercept found both aircraft were friendly
bombers. No information of their presence nor

‘mission was known to.this Force.

At 1000 a_ Corsair from -H.M.S.
VICTORIOUS, heavily hit by flak, was re-,
ported to have ditched. Fellow Corsairs
searched without success for the pilot! who -
they consider could not have survived. At.
1529 a Corsair ditched om taking off from
M.S. FORMIDABLE. The pilot was re-

- covered unhurt by the KK destroyer.

At 1845 the usual radar pickets were re-
called and by 1900 all CAPS had: landed on; the

.Fleet withdrew to the southward for the night,

and CIF 57 assumed tactical command at
1930. At 2100 IF 57 passed close to.H.M.S.
BLACK PRINCE who reported that H.M.S.
QUILLIAM was satisfactorily in tow.
Enemy’ aircraft destroyed or damaged, nil.
x junk and 3 barges were damaged.
Bombs dropped on targets, 6} tons plus 24:

Own losses:—in combat 1 Corsair;
operationally 1 Hellcat; 1 Seafire.
ast’ May. .

A.C.1 assumed tactical command at o5r10.
¥Flying-off had been planned for 0540 from a
position. 85 miles 110° from Miyako. -The
weather at dawn was similar to the previous
day except that the Fleet was clear of fog
patches. Flying-off was therefore postponed.
Four Hellcats were flown off at 0600 to investi-
gate the weather within a 30 mile radius. They
reported clear weather to east and west, and -
improving weather tothe northward. Acting on
this information the first strike was flown off
at 0655. . : .

Five bomber ‘strikés were sent in, three to
Miyako and two to Ishigaki. . .

Strikes for Miyako were flown off at 0655,
1210 and 1610. Nobara and Hirara runways
were well plastered with bombs, 2 fires started
in’ thé warehouse. area of Hirara town, and.a
radio weather station was hit,. A tented camp
was straffed, 2. _
