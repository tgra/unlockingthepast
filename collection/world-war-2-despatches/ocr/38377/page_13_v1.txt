General. - x08. Outstanding points in this operation were:  ;

(a) Effective work of Fulmars. The Fulmars of ARK ROYAL contributed in no small measure to the safe arrival of the convoy at its destination. On 23rd July formations of enemy aircraft were intercepted on three occasions. On the first occasion, two were shot down for certain and another two probably destroyed, whilst the suryivors which reached the fleet were in no state to carry out an accurate attack. On the second occasion, as the Fulmars were about to intercept, the bombers released their bombs on the destroyer screen and immediately withdrew. Finally an attempted T/B attack was completely broken up and driven off, leaving two aircraft shot down with another damaged and possibly lost.

On 25th July the only enemy formations to  approach the fleet were once again thoroughly routed. A force of torpedo bombers withdrew before the fighters could reach it and the only high level bombing attack was intercepted about 15 miles from the fleet, when four enemy planes were destroyed for certain with one probably destroyed and two more damaged. All bombs were jettisoned,

One Italian officer survivor stated he had been shot down by a Hurricane. It is evident that the enemy hold our Fleet Air Arm figfiters in higher esteem than do our own Fulmar pilots.

(b) Towing of FIREDRAKE by ERIDGE.  Excellent seamanship and determination were displayed by ERIDGE whilst taking FIREDRAKE in tow in spite of difficulties caused  by the latter's steering gear being out of action. The tow was maintained for 37 hours, during the whole of which period the ships were in close proximity to enemy air and surface ship bases and subjected to continuous air observation. The resolution and fine spirit displayed by both ships  companies was most creditable.

(c) Prompt action and: wmtiative displayed by NESTOR_on two occasions. The successful avoiding action taken by the heavy ships at 2315/22 was only rendered possible by the prompt action taken, and quick and accurate report made, by NESTOR.

The initiatrve and resolution shown in bringing SYDNEY STAR safely into port after she had been torpedoed on the night of the 23rd/2qth and stopped 4 miles from the enemy's base was a noteworthy achievement,
