AIR OPERATIONS IN GREECE, 1940-1941

The following report was submitted to the Air
Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Middle East,
on August 15th, 1941, by Air Vice-Marshal
J. H. D'Albiac, D.S.O., commanding the
Royal Air Force in Greece.

REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT BY
THE Royal AIR FORCE IN GREECE: NOVEMBER,
1940, TO APRIL, I94I.

*Appendix “ A ’’—Memorandum on Air Policy

in Greece. ;
*Appendix ‘‘ B’’—Lessons of the Campaign.
Sir,
I have the honour to forward the follow-
ing report on the operations carried out by
the Royal Air Force under my command in
Greece from November, 1940, to April, 1941.

Introduction:

2. In framing this report, my object is to
describe the various problems with which we
were confronted from time to time and how we
attempted to solve them; our reasons for adopt-
ing certain definite lines of policy; the difficul-
ties with which we were faced; our successes
and failures; and finally to draw attention to
some of the lessons we learnt in a campaign
which, although perhaps not entirely successful
in its highest conception, contributed materially
to the prosecution of the war as a whole and
formed a chapter in history of which the Royal
Air Force may well be proud. I do not propose
to compile a day to day record of all the activi-
ties of the Command. Apart from the im-
mensity of such a task, an account of this de-
scription would not serve any useful purpose
and would only tend to obscure those particu-
lar points which I wish to emphasise. Neverthe-
less in order to obtain some form of continuity,
it is necessary to deal with the campaign in
chronological sequence. I propose, therefore,

dividing it into three periods of two months into .
which arrangement the campaign conveniently
divides itself from the strategical point of view.

NovEMBER-DECEMBER, 1940.

Declaration of War:

3. At 3 o’clock in the morning of 28th Octo-
ber, 1940, the Italian Minister in Athens handed
to the Prime Minister of Greece a note from his
Government complaining in strong terms of
alleged Greek assistance to the Allies and de-
manding for the Italians the right to occupy
certain strategic bases in Greece. General
Metaxas regarded this note as an ultimatum
which he promptly refused and a few hours
later, Greece was at war with Italy.

Unlike the Italians, the Greek forces were
little prepared for war. Their repular Army
units were at their peace time stations through-
out the country and general mobilisation had
not been ordered. On being attacked, the
Greek units holding the frontier posts on the
mountainous borders of Albania, although
fighting with the greatest gallantry, were
overwhelmed in some cases by sheer weight of
numbers and compelled to give ground. This
was particularly the case in regions where con-
ditions were suitable for the employment of
Italian mechanised forces. The progress of the
Italian army was, however, slow for although
Italy had concentrated large forces on the Greek
frontier, the firm attitude adopted by the Greek
government came as somewhat of a surprise as
it had been thought that all Italian demands
would be met without resort to arms. It was
confirmed also from the reports of prisoners
taken in the first few days that the opening of
hostilities was quite unexpected by the Italian
soldiers themselves, who had been led to expect
a diplomatic victory and a peaceful advance
into Greek territory.
