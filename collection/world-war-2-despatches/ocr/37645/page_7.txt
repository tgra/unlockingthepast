SUPPLEMENT to tuz LONDON

Asosa to Kurmuk, were constant threats to the
Nile L. of C. and the railway at Sennar.

Period before Italian Evacuation of Kassala.
From early January there were strong indica-
tions from all sources of intelligence that the
enemy might be intending to evacuate Kassala.
At first it was not possible to say definitely
whether the moves which the enemy was mak-
ing ‘were a re-grouping of his forces to resist an
expected attack by us, or were the preliminaries
to complete evacuation. Our forces were far
from concentrated and there was considerable
risk that if a premature attack was launched
against the Kassala-Sabdarat-Tessenei triangle,
it might suffer a reverse from lack of sufficient
strength and delay the eventual advance
unduly. So strong were the indications that
the enemy really did intend to withdraw, prob-
ably to the line Aicota-Keru, that by rath
January, a conference was called of both
Divisional Commanders in Khartoum to decide
on the earliest possible date an advance could
be made and what strength would be available.

On the evening of 12th January, an order
was sent to 4th and 5th Indian Divisions order-
ing r1th Indian Infantry Brigade Group to con-
centrate forthwith in the Aroma area and warn-
ing them that the brigade might be required to
seize the Jebel Mokram and Jebel ‘Kawatab,
large jebels on the north-east side of Kassala’and
approximately three miles from it, not earlier
than the night 16/17th January. 5th Indian
Division was warned that it might be required
to seize the Jebel Ibrahim Tau not earlier than
the same night. 5th Indian Division was given
permission to move forward agth Indian Infan-
try Brigade, 68 Medium Regiment, less a
battery, and 28 Field Regiment. (These had
been held back in Gedaref area for reasons of
secrecy and deception.) Gazelle was ordered
to be prepared to operate east of Sabdarat.
Reliable information revealed that the enemy
now intended to evacuate the Walkait (Tsegede)
garrison. There were only mule-tracks from
this area to Gondar and the L. of C. was to
Tessenei. From this it was reasonable to sup-
pose that these forces would retire on Barentu
covered for the first part of their move by Umm
Hagar garrison. This was confirmed next day
by the Manager of the Italian Cotton Scheme
south of Tessenei who gave himself up at the
Butana Bridge and stated that the enemy
intended to retire to the hills “‘ on account of
the superiority of our tanks.’’ The date of the
attack on Kassala was fixed for 19th January.

Advance Headquarters.

On 18th January, a small Advanced Head-
quarters was established at the Butana Bridge.
Advanced Headquarters, 203 Group, R.A.F.,
were established at the same place and time.

Orders for Pursuit.

It now became clear that the enemy had
escaped from Kassala. At 1940 hours, orders
were issued for the pursuit to commence and
4th Indian Division were directed first on Sab-
darat, second on Wachai, and third to exploit
towards Keru up to the limit of administration.
gth Indian Division was directed first on
Tessenei, second on Aicota, and third to
be prepared to exploit either towards Barentu
or Biscia. The ‘‘I’”’ tanks were to follow 4th
Indian Division as soon as they detrained at

Aroma, although it was doubtful whether the
country further east would be suitable for their
employment.

Administrative Note.

A few words on the administrative difficulties
are not out of place here. 4th Indian Division
was extended from Sabdarat as far back as
Derudeb, 165 miles to the north, with 5th
Infantry Brigade moving from the Gedaref
area, 150 miles to the south-west. The Central
India Horse and some transport for 5th Infan-
try Brigade were still on the Nile Valley route,
250 miles to the north-west in a straight line
across the desert, and more than double that
by rail. The situation of 5th Indian Division
was, if anything, even more difficult as its rear
H.Q. was still in Gedaref and it also had to
maintain the force operating up the Setit River
based on Showak. Signal communications were
becoming stretched and later, particularly in
the case of 4th Indian Division, reached break-
ing point.

The pursuit started on the morthern road
Sabdarat-Wachai-Keren with Gazelle Force
leading 11th Indian Infantry Brigade and 4th
Indian Division; 5th Infantry Brigade a long
way behind and not reaching Kassala until 20th
January. Gazelle had its first brush with the
enemy near Wachai, where a rearguard of
approximately one battalion was unable to
impose any great delay on our advance. It was
here that our troops had their first serious air
attack, but luckily few casualties were inflicted
and the troops were unshaken.

Simultaneously, 5th Indian Division led by
roth Infantry Brigade succeeded in crossing the
Gash near Tessenei and pursued the enemy
toward Aicota which was reported unoccupied
on the morning of 21st January.

Kassala itself was found to be very little
damaged. Railway water tanks were destroyed
and some rails had been removed. Signal
cable lines were left intact. On his entry into
Tessenei Commander 5th Indian Division was
given a letter from the late Italian Civil
Governor pointing out that he had left the town
practically undamaged and expressing the hope
that throughout the campaign both sides would
respect civilian property. The repair of the
railway line was put in hand immediately and ~
the first train arrived at Kassala, which became
trailhead, on 25th January.

Action at Keru.

On 21st January the first serious resistance
was encountered by 4th Indian Division on the
northern route at Keru, where the road passes
through a long steep ridge of hills. The road
runs through a very narrow gorge and was
a bad road for M.T. even before the enemy
demolitions had made it more difficult.

4th Indian Division attacked from the east,
and at the same time a Mechanized Column
consisting of No. 2 M:M.G. Group with 2 High-
land Light Infantry under command (Com-
mander El Miralai Orr Bey, D.S.O.), moved
from Aicota via Biscia towards Daura Toat,
thus getting behind the enemy forces at Keru.
The reconnaissance of the Keru position
revealed that the gorge was narrow with hills
rising about 1,500 ft. on either side. The
position was well prepared and held by five
enemy battalions. It was an ideal rearguard
position and it appeared that the enemy
