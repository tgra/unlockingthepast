SUPPLEMENT to tHE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 AUGUST, 1948

T.S.D.S. destroyers ahead, were passed within
Io feet. The possibility exists, therefore, that
‘one or more of the above casualties may have
been caused by mines and not by torpedo.

15. These E-Boat attacks did not go un-
punished, at least one and possibly two E-
Boats being destroyed. V.H.F.* conversations
in Italian intercepted in H.M.S. ASHANTI
confirmed this.

16. At about orgo, H.M.S. PATHFINDER
went ' alongside H.M.S. MANCHESTER and
after discussion with the Captain embarked
{ about 150 of the ship’s company and then pro-
\ ceeded to join Rear-Admiral Commanding,
‘roth Cruiser Squadron as he had been ordered

to do,

17. Subsequently, the Commanding Officer,
H'M.S. MANCHESTER decided to abandon
and sink his ship. The last of the ship’s com-
pany left the ship at about 0245 and at about
0550 the ship was seen to sink

18. At 0245, H.M. Ships CHARYBDIS,
ESKIMO and SOMALI joined Rear-Admiral
Commanding, roth Cruiser Squadron.

1g.’S.S. WAIRANGI was hit in the ‘éngine
room and §.S. ALMERIA LYKES before
No. x hold. Both ships were abandoned and
their crews picked up some hours later by
H.M. Ships ESKIMO and SOMALI. Neither
ship was seen to sink though both are reported
as left in a sinking condition. Commanding
Officer, H.M.S. ESKIMO reports that he did
not complete the sinking of the ships because
he thought there might be an opportunity later
for salving them, S.S. SANTA ELIZA was
sunk later in a bombing attack.

20. At dawn D.4, Rear-Admiral Command-
ing, oth Cruiser Squadron in H.MS.
ASHANTI had in company with him H.M.
Ships KENYA, CHARYBDIS, INTREPID,
ICARUS, FURY, ESKIMO, SOMALI and the
M.T. ships MELBOURNE STAR, CLAN
FERGUSON and ROCHESTER CASTLE.
H M.S. LEDBURY with S.S. OHIO was 5
miles astern, H.M.S. PATHFINDER and
H.M.S. _BRAMHAM with S.S. PORT
CHALMERS were 10 miles to the north-west,
while H.M.S. PENN’ was observed beyond
$.S. PORT CHALMERS standing by an M.T.
ship—probably S.S. WAIMARAMA—which
was on fire and shortly afterwards blew up.
Later S.S. DORSET was sighted to the north-
ward and ordered to join the convoy.

2x. It was learned later that S.S. BRISBANE
STAR spent the night and part of the day in
the Gulf of Hammamet. Whilst in territorial
waters his ship was boarded by the French
authorities who, after protest, behaved well and
took a seriously wounded man ashore to Susa.
$.S. BRISBANE STAR eventually reached
Malta at 1430 the following day, r4th August.

22. At o712, Rear-Admiral ‘Commanding,
Ioth Cruiser Squadron ordered H.M. Ships
ESKIMO and SOMALI to return and stand by
H.M.S. MANCHESTER. On their way to do
so they picked up survivors of S.S. ALMERIA
LYKES and WAIRANGI and at 1040 off
Kelibia they recovered about 150 of the
MANCHESTER’s ship’s company from Carley

floats. They were then only half a mile from
the coast and were able to see several hundreds
of, apparently, H.M.S. MANCHESTER’s
ship’s company being marched away. Having
recovered all survivors, H.M. Ships ESKIMO
and SOMALI proceeded for Gibraltar.

23. At 0810, the first of a series of air attacks
was experienced by Force X, JU.88s deliver-
ing a dive bombing attack, mostly directed
at S.S.°CLAN FERGUSON, second ship of
H.M.S. CHARYBDIS’s column. S.S. CLAN
FERGUSON received a direct hit and blew up.
Her next astern passed through the flames
apparently unscathed. .§. CHARYBDIS
reports seeing two aircraft diving on S.S. CLAN
FERGUSON and only one coming out of the
dive, the other presumably Peing destroyed by
the explosion.

24. Further attacks by Stuka dive bombers
accompanied by Italian aircraft laying para-
chute mines ahead and on the flanks of the
convoy occurred at 0925. The Stukas made a
set at S.S. OHIO who sustained several near
misses. One Stuka which was shot down by
the combined efforts of H.M.S. ASHANTI and
S.S. OHIO dived into $.S. OHIO’s side.

25. The Malta Beaufighters and Spitfires were
now in sight of Force X and seen to be making
contact with the enemy at times. Rear-Admiral
Commanding, roth Cruiser Squadron reports
that, observing they had no fighter direction
aid from Force X, he considered the fighters
performed a magnificent job of work through-
out the day. .

26. At og41, H.M.S. KENYA was near
missed by further dive bombers, and at 1017
and 1050 similar combined dive bombing and
minelaying attacks occurred. In these S.S.
DORSET, who was rejoining, and S.S. OHIO,
were both near missed and stopped. H.M.
Ships PENN; LEDBURY and BRAMHAM
stood by 5.S. OHIO and DORSET. The latter
was eventually sunk at 20r4 after being set
on fire by more air attacks.

27. At 1120, Italian torpedo bombers carried
out an attack combined with the dropping of
parachute mines or circling torpedoes. - Tor-
pedoes were dropped at long range and except
for one which’ became entangled in S.S. PORT
CHALMERS’ paravane (subsequently cleared
safely) none appeared to endanger the force.

28. Beaufighters and long-range Spitfires
were observed to shoot down at least 4 enemy
aircraft in the distance but unfortunately one
Spitfire was engaged by merchant ships during
a dive bombing attack and crashed, the pilot
being killed.

29. By 1230, Force X was within range of
Malta’s Short -range Spitfires and thereafter was
unmolested.

30. At 1430, the Malta Escort Force under
the Senior Officer, Minesweepers, in H.M.S.
SPEEDY, reinforced the escort and at 1600,
Force X, less H.M. Ships PENN, BRAMHAM,
and LEDBURY, who continued to stand by
S.S. OHIO and DORSET, retired to the west-
ward. S.S. PORT CHALMERS, MEL-
BOURNE STAR and ROCHESTER CASTLE
were turned over to the local escort and
eventually entered harbour at Malta safely at

_ 1825.
