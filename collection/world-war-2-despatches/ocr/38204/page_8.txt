1000 SUPPLEMENT to rHE LONDON GAZETTE, 11 FEBRUARY, 1948

squalls frequent, X.r0 secured alongside the
shore with her grapnel, considering the risk of
detection negligible with shore and craft
covered with snow. The opportunity was taken
to get some rest and try to make good some of
the defects.

84. At rI00Z on 23rd September after the
light in the projector compass had been re-
placed and with the periscope lashed in the
“up ”’ position, X.ro proceeded out of Smal-
fiord and dived towards the southern end of the
minefield. Surfacing at 1800Z, she crossed the
declared area at full speed on the engines to-
wards the recovery position, where it was hoped
a submarine would be encountered.

85. Recovery position F.B. was reached
about 2300Z on 23rd September and a search
was carried out. X.10 patrolled in the viciniiy
of the recovery position all day 24th September,
spending some time on the surface in the hope
of being sighted; and that night she carried
out a further search. At 0430Z on 25th Septem-
ber, when no contact had been made, X.Io set
course for Sandoy Fiord, on the northern coast
of Soroy Island. This was reached at 12002
and by 1525Z X%.Io was secured alongside the
beach in Ytre Reppafiord, on the northwest of
Sandoy Fiord. This bay was completely
deserted and here the crew got some much
needed rest. .

86. X.10 remained in Ytre Reppafiord until

the morning of - 27th September, when~

Lieutenant Hudspeth decided to move to
O Fiord, which it was expected a submarine
would close that night. O Fiord was reached
at 1550Z on 27th September and a search was
carried out across the entrance after dark.

87. At or0o0 on 28th September contact was
made with STUBBORN, and at o150 X.z0
was in tow. It was by this time too late for her
crew to be taken on board STUBBORN and the
weather was none too good for the transfer, and
it was not until 2200Z on the following day that
the crew were taken off and the passage crew
from X.7 took over X.10. By this time the
crew of X.r0 had been on board their craft for
almost exactly ten days. They had been sub-
jected to much hardship and. disappointment,
but were none the worse for their experience.

88. Apart from the sighting of the three
vessels mentioned, two of which (since they
were burning navigation lights) may have been
fishing vessels or small coasting craft, no patrol
activity was encountered either on the inward
passage up the fiords or, after the attack, on
the way out; nor, apparently, was there any
A/S activity or counter-measures in Alten Fiord
directly subsequent to the attack.

8g. X.r0 also reports that all shore navigation
lights were burning normally and showing
morta’ characteristics, and that the weather on
the 22nd September was ideal for X-craft
attack, with the sky dull and overcast and a
fresh breeze raising white horses to assist an
unseen approach.

- go. From these facts there appears to be no
reason to doubt that other X-craft, free from
defects, should ‘have experienced no difficulty
in making the passage to the entrance to
Kaafiord. 5

gi. X.10 also reports that before diving in
the vicinity of Tommerholm Island at 0215Z
on the 22nd September, and again on surfacing
that evening at 1800Z,.dights were observed in

the entrance to Kaafiord which appeared to be
of the nature of low powered flood lights, pos-
sibly for illuminating the net across the entrance
to the fiord,

g2. The Commanding Officer expresses the
highest opinion of all his crew throughout the
whole time they were on board. They worked
long and arduously in the face of ever-growing
disappointment, and at no time did their zeal
or enthusiasm fail. I consider that the Com-
manding Officer himself showed determination
and high qualities of leadership in a gallant
attempt to reach his objective. He was frus-
trated by defects for which he was in no way
responsible and which he made every endeavour
to overcome. He showed good judgment in
coming to his decision to abandon the attack,
thereby enabling the craft to be recovered and
bringing back valuable information. .

Movements of Submarines after Slipping
X-craft.
20th September

93. After slipping X-craft to proceed to the
attack, THRASHER, TRUCULENT, STUB-
BORN and SCEPTRE withdrew within their
patrol sectors and assumed patrol. SYRTIS
remained on patrol within her sector, and SEA-
NYMPH was patrolling in the vicinity of
70° 25° N. 17° 16’ E.
21st September

94. I had decided to order SEANYMPH to
patrol off Andoy in order to intercept any main
units endeavouring to escape to the southward,
and in my signal at 1205—which could be read
by all submarines taking part—I ordered SEA-
NYMPH to patrol in the vicinity of position 69°
11’ N, 15° 27’ E., proceeding so as to arrive after
dark on 22nd September, her object being to
attack main units proceeding from Alten to
Narvik. I also informed all submarines taking
part that X 8 had had to be sunk.

SEANYMPH proceeded towards her patrol
area at 1856Z, 22nd September.
2and September

95. As no reports had been received, other
than SEANYMPH’s, to indicate that any
X-craft apart from X.8 were out of the running,
it was assumed that the remaining five had pro-
ceeded according to plan. It was therefore
confidently hoped that some would be attacking
in the early hours of the 22nd September and
that the “‘ bang ’’ would occur about 08302.

96. Senior British Naval Officer, North
Russia, bad been asked to fly a P.R. over the
area p.m. on 2and September if possible.
LUTZOW at least was not likely to have be-
come a casualty: with the loss of X.8 she was
not liable to attack: and it was possible that
this reconnaissance might show signs of a move
of main units southwards, having been
“* flushed ’’ by the attack. In anticipation of
such a movement I ordered SCEPTRE to leave
her patrol sector and proceed to patrol in posi-
tion 69° 44’ N. 17° 43’ E. to arrive as soon as
possible after daylight on 23rd September.

97. I also decided. that should sufficient in-
formation of a major movement be received in
time I would send one of the “‘ T”’ class sub-
marines into Soroy Sound, accepting the risk
of crossing the declared mined area. I there-
fore’érdered THRASHER to close to the south-.
east of her area, and to charge her batteries
full out after dark. For the same reason I
ordered TRUCULENT to proceed fram Sector
